<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000339"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again this morning, Mr. Bayley, as we continue to make good
progress in our consideration of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011971000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments link in to new clause 20. We were not sure whether the new
clause would be successfully accepted into the Bill. Therefore, we
tabled the amendments as back-up. Our preferred means is to amend the
Bill through the new clause, which we will consider towards the end of
our proceedings. However, it is appropriate to talk about the
amendments at this stage. With that in mind, I hope that the Minister
will be able to respond positively to the proposed ideas. I recognise
that amendments 35, 33 and 34 are slightly awkward in their phrasing,
but that is because we tried to find a way to build our proposal into
the Bill in the event that the new clause is not agreed
to.</div><a name="10011971000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the last couple of weeks, we have seen great pressure on gas supplies.
We have come through it, but this is the third time that we have faced
the issue in five 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>years. It is now four and a bit years since I began this job. One of the
first statements I heard from the then Minister for Energy, the right
hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), was that we were awash
with gas, and in a few hours he was explaining why we had almost run
out. That was back in the early winter of 2006. We had a further
problem last winter, when we were down to, perhaps, three days&#146;
gas storage, and we have seen some pressure on it in the last couple of
weeks. Clearly, we do not want to overestimate that. We do not want to
pretend that there was a crisis when there was not, but we are right to
be aware of the pressures and challenges that exist. It is also
reasonable to point out that part of the reason there was not a crisis
on this occasion is demand destruction. Demand for gas has been
significantly down due to the recession&#151;down by 5 per cent.
across the board, and by 15 per cent. among industrial and commercial
users. Therefore, had this been a normal economic cycle without the
recession, the pressure on gas would have been significantly
greater.</div>
<a name="10011971000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
look at the implications of that for the future. We have been helped in
these last couple of weeks by the ability to bring back on stream every
element of coal-fired generation in the country. That will not be the
case in a few years. We will reach a situation where a third of our
coal plant will be closed down by 2016 at the latest, as a result of
the large combustion plant directive, and most of the rest of 
the coal will be out of commission as a result of the industrial
emissions directive, if it goes through, as planned, by 2023. We face a
situation where we simply no longer have the ability to call on coal as
back-up. We expect new gas generation capacity in the generating mix. I
would be interested to hear from the Minister how she views that. The
Government&#146;s low-carbon transition plan talks about the role of
gas in the mix falling from 40 per cent. or more today, down to just
29 per cent. in 2020. There are very few people outside her
Department who believe that those figures are realistic. At the same
time Ministers talk about the huge amount&#151; 20
GW&#151;of planned potential new generating capacity, of which 60 per
cent. is actually gas. If that were to happen, it is inconceivable that
we could meet the Government&#146;s target, so it would be useful to
know where the Government really think we are going to end up in this
process.</div>
<a name="10011971000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to note that, during this period of pressure, a considerable
amount of electricity, much of it gas-generated, was exported to
France. The interconnector with France has often been working at
capacity, with up to 2 GW sent to France at a time when our own
industrial users of gas have been asked to close down their factories
for a period because of the pressure on gas supplies. There have been a
number of interruptions. It is against that background that we need to
do more to secure the gas storage facilities in the country. We clearly
have many more diverse sources of supply than has been the case
historically.</div><a name="10011971000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
LNG facilities have come on stream at South Hook and elsewhere, and
that is an important contribution, which we do not in any way
underestimate. However, the evidence is that an LNG facility does not
mean that the gas can always be used, because the nature of such
facilities is that the gas will often set off around the world without
a destination in mind and then go to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>the highest bidders. In the early days of the new LNG facilities, much
the gas was going to America. That has reduced due to the extent to
which shale gas has been found there, and much of the gas was going to
Japan because of the problems that they were having with their nuclear
fleet. Only after those changes did we end up with more gas coming into
the LNG facilities in the UK. Although such facilities make an
important contribution, they cannot alone guarantee our security of gas
supply.</div>
<a name="10011971000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
also been new pipelines; for example, the Langeled pipeline to Norway
is an extraordinarily important element. However, in the recent cold
spell, we saw that it could not work at capacity because of structural
and technical problems, so we were not getting as much gas through it
as we needed to replenish our stocks. As a consequence, we ended up
with four balancing alerts in one week. Large business users were asked
if they would mind closing down, and there was a contractual basis for
that to be done so it was a voluntary arrangement. Nevertheless, big
British companies were asked to stop producing and manufacturing to
conserve gas because of the pressure on
supplies.</div>
<a name="10011971000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000340"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Joan
Ruddock):</b> The hon. Gentleman may want to reconsider what
he has just said, which was that businesses had to stop manufacturing.
If he checks, he will find that most companies with interruptible
contracts have back-up supplies and alternative fuel. For most, that is
the only way that they would sensibly have taken on an interruptible
contract. One would not expect manufacturing to
cease.</div>
<a name="10011971000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000341"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I certainly accept that some of the companies
concerned will have had alternative sources of supply, but that,
inevitably, will be another form of hydrocarbon and is not good for our
carbon emissions. I realise that that is a different point but there
are consequences of such balancing
alerts.</div><a name="10011971000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we look further ahead, we see clear warnings. Last week, Alistair
Buchanan, the very constructive and sensible head of Ofgem, warned the
<i class="I">Financial Times</i> that Britain&#146;s gas markets faced a
&#147;cliff edge&#148; in 2015-16, which could cause supplies to
run short in the latter part of the decade. He focused on the security
of gas supplies from places such as Turkmenistan. The amount that could
come through to Europe and to Britain could be as little as one tenth
or one fifth of what we assume is there.</div>
<a name="10011971000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000342"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Again, I should put it on the record that we do
not accept that analysis. In fact, the number of countries from which
we now have the option of getting supply has dramatically increased. We
do not expect reliance on Turkmenistan.</div>
<a name="10011971000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000343"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I was not suggesting that there would be
&#147;reliance on Turkmenistan&#148;, but there has been a
significant assumption concerning the billions of cubic meters of gas
that will be forthcoming from there. Alistair Buchanan&#146;s point,
which we have to take seriously, is that due to structural problems,
delays in pipelines and other issues, we may not get anything like the
amount of gas being forecast to come from Turkmenistan. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>An important aspect of the work that Ofgem is doing through Project
Discovery is about looking at the potential sources of supply,
identifying where the pinch points might be, and seeing how realistic
the sources are and to what extent we can truly rely on
them.</div><a name="10011971000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
week the Energy Intensive Users Group and the Engineering Employers
Federation wrote to the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> to express
concern</div><a name="10011971000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
the complacent nature of some of the comments about the UK&#146;s
energy
supply&#148;,</div><a name="10011971000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
about gas and gas storage in particular. We have a challenge; I do not
put it more strongly that that. We have seen three challenges in the
past few years and we have to do much more to ensure the security of
gas supply coming into the country, which means that we have to look
more at the availability of gas storage.</div>
<a name="10011971000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
critically short of gas storage for different reasons. In France, they
have about 120 days of gas storage, but they are overwhelmingly
dependent on gas imports. In Germany they have 100 days of gas storage.
In the United Kingdom we have perhaps 16 days of gas storage at best. I
realise that historically the North sea has been our gas storage
facility, but as the gas from the North sea has started to be depleted
and as we have become net importers of gas with all the problems that
involves, we have not seen the sort of increase in gas storage that we
need.</div><a name="10011971000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000344"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): Does the hon.
Gentleman not accept that the climate of this country, other than in
the past month, is usually such that we do not quite need the same
storage facilities as other countries in mainland Europe? Would not the
knock-on effect be that we would waste money in storage and he would
complain to the Government about doing that as
well?</div><a name="10011971000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000345"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> That is an extremely valid point. The point I
would make is that we know what we are losing in terms of generation
capacity in the next few years. We know that we lose a third of our
coal, and we cannot replace that with coal with CCS in that time scale
because the technology is not there, even though it is clearly being
developed. We know that we are starting to lose our nuclear fleet and
that all, bar Sizewell B, are due to close by the early 2020s. Some may
get life extension, but that would be a bonus rather than something
that we can count on. We can see a huge amount of plant coming out of
use, and that will have to be made up by something else in the short
term. New nuclear in time may fill it up, but in the short term it will
not be able to do it. Therefore if new gas plant is to be built and we
move from having perhaps 40 per cent. of our generating mix powered by
gas to potentially 60 per cent., which some of the Ofgem scenarios
anticipate, then 80 per cent. of our gas will be imported. So it is
nothing to do with our climate, it is to do with the mix of generating
plant that we
have.</div><a name="10011971000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other aspect, and this goes to the heart of the amendment, is that we
are not saying that this should be Government spending. We do not
advocate Government-funded strategic storage. We are saying that the
companies that will be using gas either to burn it for generation or to
supply it to domestic households must find a way of having certain
amounts of gas storage which would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>specified by the Secretary of State. This is a buffer. It is a security
of supply issue that we think is important in a challenging and
changing
world.</div><a name="10011971000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000346"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood</b> (Bournemouth, East) (Con): My hon. Friend
is making a powerful argument. Those people who would appreciate extra
storage capability in the UK would be those 100 companies that were
told on 7 January that they would have their supplies cut, even if only
for a short period, because of the type of contract they had. They
would very much like this extra storage as would much of Britain
now.</div><a name="10011971000037"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000347"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important additional point
which is the nature of some of the contracts. What we have seen in many
other countries is long-term contracts, significantly backed by
Government. If there is a major event of a contract between the German
Government and the Qatari Government, Chancellor Merkel is there in
Qatar to sign it. Here those tend to be signed off by the British high
commissioner or the ambassador without necessarily having the same
degree of top-level Government support for long-term contracts. That is
an important element that has to be addressed there
too.</div><a name="10011971000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000348"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I note the point
about climate. Does my hon. Friend agree with me about the suggestion
that for the next  30 years Britain will be cooler, not warmer?
My real point is about the ability to buy gas on longer-term
contractual arrangements. Is not that where the importance of storage
comes in as well in terms of purchasing price on the open
market?</div><a name="10011971000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000349"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend on his
latter point, but after the Met Office promised a barbecue summer and a
mild winter I will not get involved in a discussion about where the
climate is going. If the Met Office can get the forecast quite so
wrong, my ability to project it for 20 years is perhaps without any
basis in fact. I agree with my hon. Friend about long-term contracts.
One of the advantages of gas storage which they have in Germany is that
they are able to replenish their gas supplies in the summer when prices
are cheaper and can maintain supply in the winter. When we are running
short of gas in the winter, we end up importing it and paying the spot
price which is massively higher. It has been calculated that it costs
consumers about &#163;1 billion more than it needs to because of the
inability to buy sufficient quantities at the lower summer price to
sell during the
winter.</div><a name="10011971000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
<a name="10011971000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000350"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman factored in the cost of
building gas storage? It is phenomenally expensive, and it is therefore
no good just comparing the price of the gas that one might buy in the
summer with the situation today. For the record, we have the best of
relations with the Qatari Government, and if our Prime Minister has not
been there to sign a contract that does not mean that we do not feel
secure in the contracts we have with them. Finally, the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>has posed frightening scenarios of how we might run out of everything
because everything is closing down, but what calculation has he made of
the contribution of
renewables?</div><a name="10011971000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000351"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I totally understand the importance of a good
relationship with the Qatari Government, and I understand what is
happening
there.</div><a name="10011971000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
pricing, of course there is a price and I will come to that, but the
crucial issue is that there is a price for gas security but an even
greater price for insecurity. In the past few years, we have come close
to running out of gas and having to say on a more substantial scale
that people will have to switch off their businesses. At that point it
is not a question of back-up, but of simply saying that there is no gas
left. That did not happen this winter, but it nearly happened last
winter and three or four years ago. In those circumstances, had we gone
that bit further, we would have been in a situation in which companies
around the world looking to invest in Britain would have said,
&#147;Look, this country pretends to be a first-world nation but
can&#146;t even maintain the gas supplies to its businesses.&#148;
Insecurity has a massive national economic cost, and that is why
additional investment is required, along with greater focus and
drive.</div><a name="10011971000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister, when she responds, will highlight some of
the plans in the National Grid&#146;s statements to bring some of
that forward. Of the most imminent plans, two were supposed to be
confirmed for definite towards the end of last year but have not been
so far. A whole range of the plans have not even put in for planning
consent at this stage, and one of them has been turned down by the
Secretary of State but is still on the list as a potential plant. There
is, therefore, enormous doubt and questionability in the
system.</div><a name="10011971000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the Minister&#146;s final point about renewables, of course we would
factor in renewables, but what we have learned from the past week or so
is that there will be a greater need for back-up for renewables. During
the particularly cold spell a couple of weeks ago, the contribution of
renewables to our electricity generation was low, at one fifth of 1 per
cent., because the United Kingdom was in an area of sustained high
pressure and the wind was blowing almost nowhere. Therefore, as we
increase the extent of renewables in the mix&#151;we share the
Minister&#146;s commitment to that&#151;there has to be either
battery power, pumped storage and hydrogen facilities to move the
wind-generated power from where it is generated to where it is needed,
or enormous back-up capability, which will still almost certainly be
hydrocarbons and gas. The growth of renewables may create a greater
requirement for gas&#151;for a plant to be used not 24 hours a day
but at times when demand is greatest, such as on those cold January
days when the wind is not blowing and we have to keep the lights
on.</div><a name="10011971000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000352"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): Has the hon. Gentleman factored
into his argument the difference between how the market works on the
European mainland and in the UK? When the Business and Enterprise
Committee, on which my friend the hon. Member for Northampton, South
also served, looked at that issue, we were concerned that because the
European market was not as liberalised as the UK one it was not
reacting to market signals, in that when gas was expensive in the UK,
gas was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>coming in from elsewhere in Europe. How will the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment deal with that problem, given that he has mentioned the
greater storage in continental
Europe?</div><a name="10011971000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000353"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Gentleman brings us to an extremely
important and relevant point. In January last year, when we were
approaching our coldest winter for 18 years&#151;as it was
then&#151;and were about to face a dispute between Russia and Ukraine
and massive pressures on gas supplies elsewhere in Europe, particularly
in central Europe, we were exporting 25 million cubic metres of gas a
day though one of the interconnectors and importing 26 million cubic
metres through the adjacent one. It may be hard to imagine that amount;
it is the equivalent of 250 Albert halls&#146; worth of gas being
pumped out of the United Kingdom every day, at a time when we were
facing particular pressure. Because of the pricing structure in the
market, gas was being pumped into the United Kingdom from Norway or
through LNG facilities and then being pumped straight out again. The
gas was not coming to serve UK consumers, but was simply being
transited through.</div>
<a name="10011971000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue we
have to address is when to trigger a stop on exports, as happens in
France and other countries. When gas supplies fall below a certain
point, they ask whether a stop should be triggered. Last year, we were
down to three days&#146; gas supply in storage, yet that measure was
still not triggered in the United Kingdom. That issue is not addressed
in the amendment, but the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that it
should be focused on. The market was working perfectly, the molecules
were following the money, but our gas security was put at risk. We do
not believe that Governments can be neutral in such
situations.</div>
<a name="10011971000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment and the new clause is for Government to take a more
active role in how to secure more gas storage in Britain. They cannot
be neutral about it. Some welcome and important changes were made in
the last Energy Act, in 2008. We think that Government have to go a
stage beyond that and say to people, &#147;If you are a gas user, in
terms of generation capacity, or a supplier of gas to domestic
consumers, you need to be able to satisfy Ministers that you have
access to sufficient storage during the winter. That could be that you
run your own storage facility, own it, put the gas in it and know it is
there for you. It could be that you contract somebody else to do that
work on your behalf but, again, you have a contractual arrangement. Or
it could be that there is a long-term contractual arrangement with a
supplier who is robust and where there is no doubt about the security
of those issues.&#148; We think that sort of change is necessary to
ensure we have the security of supply and the storage that we need to
build.</div>
<a name="10011971000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been some changes but Lord Hunt, the Minister who speaks in the Lords,
has said that, if all that is planned to be built in the next couple of
years comes through, it will lead to just five hours&#146; more gas
storage in the country. As we increasingly depend on imports, which
have to come from a wider range of countries around the world, our view
is that that is not adequate; more is required. We would like to use
the Bill as an opportunity to give the Government the powers to make
that happen.</div>
<a name="10011971000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000354"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> It is a pleasure to work under your tutelage
again, Mr. Bayley. I wish to echo some of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>points that have been made. One of the differences between the system in
the UK and that in France and Germany is the absence of legislation.
There is no legislation to ensure that we have the right levels of
capacity. As my hon. Friend pointed out, our storage was the North sea.
Since 2004, we have been a net importer of gas. An interesting fact
concerning the last cold spell is that coal overtook gas as the major
contributor of natural resources towards our power requirement.
Although we are working to clean up coal&#151;and this part of the
Bill will get us there&#151;we are a long way from ensuring that coal
can take its correct place as part of the required energy mix. Until
then, we rely on gas. I do not think the Minister should shy away from
the importance of gas storage.</div>
<a name="10011971000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
about the cost of storage are relevant and how that is paid for is also
important. That is where a timetable would make sense: for us to plan
ahead to make sure that we have increasing storage capability,
eventually to match that of our French and German counterparts. We are
seeing changes in the gas scene and, with the development of the
Nabucco and Langeled pipelines, important new assets are coming on to
the market. The problem is that we are not able to buy gas when it is
cheap and then use it, rather than buy it when it is expensive. That is
the importance of energy security; to ensure that we are not again in
the situation of having to tell companies, &#147;Your gas supply will
be turned off and you are going to have to use your back-up
systems.&#148; That is not good for the economy.</div>
<a name="10011971000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">To reduce the
risk, we cannot have an over-dependency on one area or resource, and we
need to be able to identify and react to potential shifts in global
energy requirements. That means recognising where the gas comes from
and what would happen if those taps were tweaked or turned off. We have
had illustrations of that in Russia and the consequent repercussions
right across Europe. It is all very well saying that we can get our gas
from Qatar, Norway or Russia, but if there is a sudden change in the
dynamics and a dearth of gas across Europe, all countries will be
looking after themselves and we are last in the queue&#151;we are at
the end of the stream. Ensuring that we can weather a storm in which
there is a shortage of gas is therefore
critical.</div><a name="10011971000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo my hon. Friend&#146;s opening remarks and ask the Minister
seriously to consider the amendments. We must change the amount of time
we have to provide gas to our customers, particularly as all the gas
stations will remain online until 2030 and all the other stations,
whether they be nuclear or coal, will have expired by then. Gas is very
much part of our energy mix. In fact, it is currently the senior part
and will remain so for many years to come. That is why the amendments
are
important.</div><a name="10011971000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000355"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This is something of a reprise of a debate that we
had on the Floor of the House last week during the Conservative
Opposition&#146;s Supply day. I am not going to go over all that
ground again, although it is important that we debate the issue in
Committee. I believe that new clause 20 has significantly more merit
than the amendments. The new clause proposes that there should be a
minimum requirement for an amount of gas to be secured for use both by
suppliers of gas to domestic and business customers and by gas-fired
generators. However, it begs the question: how does one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>define &#147;secured&#148;? We can secure gas both by supply in this
country and by contract for supply from outside. Although the new
clause is entitled &#147;Provision of gas storage facilities&#148;,
I am not sure that it does exactly what it says on the
can.</div><a name="10011971000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we table Opposition amendments the first time around, we usually do it
to see what the technical objections and substantive arguments are.
There is an argument for a new clause&#151;I would be happy to work
with others before Report on this&#151;that imposes an obligation on
the Secretary of State to require suppliers to either have or plan for
enough storage in the UK. The substantive argument that we could face
significant problems down the track is valid, because of the declining
natural supply of gas from the North sea. It will last a long time and
will not go away, and we are still going to use it and it is important,
but we have to take account of the fact that it is in
decline.</div><a name="10011971000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make a substantive point about the way in which the amendments
would work. We will have the clause 16 stand part debate shortly. It is
not a significant clause, because the obligations that it puts on Ofgem
are more window-dressing than substance. Moreover, the amendments are
not significant either. They seek to add the words &#147;gas
storage&#148;, but clause 16 already proposes that Ofgem should have
a new duty and states:</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;Those
interests of existing and future consumers are their interests taken as
a whole, including&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a)
their interests in the reduction of gas-supply emissions of targeted
greenhouse gases;
and&#151;&#148;</div><a name="10011971000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">this
is the important one&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#147;(b)
their interests in the security of the supply of gas to
them.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
encompasses what the hon. Member for Wealden is arguing for without the
need for an amendment. We will hear what the Minister has to say, but I
anticipate that that will be her
response.</div><a name="10011971000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10011971000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point follows from last Wednesday&#146;s debate. I was quite
assertive, or aggressive, to the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg
Clark) because I believe that the argument he made to the press on the
issue&#151;a perfectly proper issue to raise in the press&#151;was
phrased to suggest an imminent risk of people losing their supplier.
The Conservative press release was headed:</div>
<a name="10011971000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only
eight days worth of gas left in storage&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011971000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In it, the hon. Member
for Tunbridge Wells
said:</div><a name="10011971000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
will the Government understand we need more storage capacity and the
ability to get gas to consumers so nobody has to face the possibility
of going without gas during cold snaps like this
one?&#148;</div><a name="10011971000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention must have been to cause concern or alarm and it certainly had
that effect, as I reported to the House last week. It was a bit
mischievous, to put it gently, to pray in aid the estimable Alistair
Buchanan&#151;we will no doubt discuss him later, in the context of
other Ofgem responsibilities&#151;because, as reported in the
<i class="I">Financial Times</i>, his concern about the &#147;cliff
edge&#148;, and those were his words, was about 2015-16, not about
now. Nothing I have read from Ofgem this month about the cold spell and
our supplies in December and January has suggested that there is a
threat to our security&#151;nothing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div><a name="10011971000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000356"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way, although I think that he is making a bit of a meal of the issue
and digressing a bit from the Bill. Temperatures dropped hugely to
minus 22°. It was an unprecedented cold snap, which necessitated
an increase in gas requirements of more than 28 per cent. The first
step, the first port of call that gas companies have to take is to
limit the supply to those with interruptible contracts, which suggests
that we are heading towards running out of gas. Gas companies would not
do that if they did not think that they had to start taking
precautions. The precautions they took were enough to guarantee
domestic supply for those who obviously need it to weather the worst of
the weather. I urge the hon. Gentleman to proceed with caution, because
I think he is being a bit mischievous. The remarks were made simply to
underline the fact that we need more storage in this country, which I
think has now been accepted by the
Government.</div>

Hughes:</b> The arguments from objective
commentators&#151;not from politicians&#151;were about the issues
for the UK in 2015-16 and beyond. I do not think that the hon.
Gentleman would find any objective commentator&#151;National Grid,
Ofgem or others&#151;who in the last month said that we were at risk
of not having sufficient gas supply for the UK
need.</div>
<a name="10011971000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000358"></a>Mr.

precaution.</div><a name="10011971000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000359"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> But the burden of the Conservative song over
recent weeks has been to suggest that we are running out of gas. That
was the implication. Of course, using up some of the gas storage means
that there is less storage, but as the hon. Member for Wealden has
fairly put it today, we have significant connections through the
recently established interconnectors with Norway and the Netherlands.
Norway is the most significant contributor. The interconnectors have
worked almost without interruption since they were set up. There was
one technical hitch in the supply from Norway&#151;that is
correct&#151;but we have liquefied petroleum gas supplies coming into
Milford Haven and the Isle of Grain, which we did not have 10 years
ago. We also have our indigenous supplies from the North sea. The hon.
Member for Wealden is right to say that when demand is
greater&#151;we had record demand&#151;we turn to alternative
suppliers such as the coal industry.</div>
<a name="10011971000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000360"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind all members of the Committee
that we are debating whether the law should be changed to make further
provision for the storage of gas, rather than debating comments made by
Members in the last week or so? I hope we will focus on the content of
the amendment.</div>
<a name="10011971000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000361"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am happy to do so. I was arguably distracted by
the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East.
</div><a name="10011971000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000362"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Gentleman referred to the quote I
attributed to Alistair Buchanan in the <i class="I">Financial Times.</i> I
specifically referred to 2015-16. If we can see a pressure point now,
five years out, does it not make sense for us to react to it now and
put the gas storage in place so that if there is a pressure point
within that time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>scale we have taken steps well in advance to prepare for it? I did not
use the quote to suggest that it related to the problems of the last
week or so, but simply to say that it enhances the case for taking
sensible preparatory steps at this
point.</div><a name="10011971000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000363"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree with that
proposition. I have never dissented from the fact that we need proper
long-term planning for our energy security. It is hugely important. As
it happens, the UK is relatively well placed, as is Europe. The hon.
Gentleman will have read that the International Energy Agency
think-tank made an announcement this month, repeating its assessment
that the &#147;gas glut&#148; was likely to grow up to 2015. It
then
said:</div><a name="10011971000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Europe
is geographically well placed to secure gas supplies from a variety of
external
sources.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality is that because of our indigenous supplies, our connections
already in place, our contracts in place, our new use of liquid
petroleum gas and our plans for the future, we are well placed. But,
yes, we need to plan to make sure that we have security.</div>
<a name="10011971000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope we
will realise that no alarm bell was sounded by Ofgem or by National
Grid over the last few weeks. The companies that had their supplies
interrupted because they had an interruptible contract, which meant
that they knew the risk, had, as the Minister of State suggested,
alternative supplies available. They planned against the knowledge that
they might have a reduction in contract. No domestic supplies were
curtailed and therefore we got through a very difficult period
relatively comfortably.</div>
<a name="10011971000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may have
more difficult winter periods in the next few days if today&#146;s
forecast was accurate. Weather forecasts are less believed nowadays.
The hon. Member for Wealden is on the right track with a variant of new
clause 20 as the way forward. I do not think that we need to tinker
with clause 16 in the way that is suggested because that point is
covered if it needs to be covered. No doubt we will hear the
Minister&#146;s response to all these things any second
now.</div><a name="10011971000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000364"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I want to make a few brief points. I have a lot of
sympathy with what the hon. Member for Wealden is trying to do with new
clause 20, although I am not sure that it will achieve what he sets out
to do. He talks about a minimum requirement for the amount of gas to be
secured. He does not say that it has to be by storage. I am sure that
many will argue that the long-term contracts in place for LPG and
others are securing the supply. He mentioned the contract that Germany
had entered into with Qatar as part of its energy security.</div>
<a name="10011971000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
lot of problems. I mentioned in an intervention my concerns about the
way the interconnector works and the difference between the liberal
market in the UK and the less liberal market on the continent. That is
an important point. Continental energy systems work very differently
from ours. If we are to have new gas storage and security of supply for
consumers in the UK we will have to go an awful lot further and look at
re-jigging the UK market completely so that we could prevent the export
of gas from the UK, a point to which the hon. Gentleman
alluded.</div>
<a name="10011971000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole
point of the interconnector is that it is supposed to react to market
signals. It should be bringing gas from the continent to the UK to
enhance our security when the price is high and there is demand for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>gas. That is simply not happening to a significant degree at the moment
because of the way the market works on the continent. If we are to do
as the proposal suggests, it seems to me that we have to work with our
European partners to change the market on the continent to a more
liberal one, or make the UK market less liberal, to ensure that we do
not have that problem, which is exacerbated by most of our energy
companies now being offshoots of the large European energy companies.
Some would argue that they have a feeling for their home market more
than indigenous companies might.</div>
<a name="10011971000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">To build new
storage capacity would place an enormous cost on the energy companies,
which would inevitably be passed on to the consumer. They have been
piling cost upon cost on to the consumer and will reach a limit at
which the consumer will rebel. That has to be borne in mind. I have
sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s cause, but I am not convinced
that the proposal will achieve what he is setting out to
do.</div>
<a name="10011971000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000365"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> As always, Mr. Bayley, it is a
pleasure to serve under your direction. I will try to deal with a
couple of the issues raised before I make my main pitch regarding the
amendments and the new clause.</div>
<a name="10011971000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Angus and for North Southwark and Bermondsey both made
measured speeches in response to the amendments, illustrating some of
the complexity in trying to determine whether we have sufficient and
safe supplies of gas. The Conservative party has tried to raise alarm
over those issues, quite wrongly in our view. The facts do not bear out
the arguments that the Conservatives have been making.</div>
<a name="10011971000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bournemouth, East said that interruptible contracts were not
good for the economy. It is obviously the view of companies who
voluntarily take interruptible contracts&#151;nobody is forcing them
to do so&#151;that it is good economics. If a company gets as much as
10 per cent. off energy bills for a decade, one interruption probably
makes very good financial sense. That is the situation in which they
find themselves. There were, of course, no forced cut-offs but only
contractual arrangements, freely entered into and undertaken according
to the clear financial preferences of the companies involved. There was
never a threat to domestic consumers and no one external to Government
ever suggested that was the case during that period. I stress that
alarm was raised completely wrongly in our view.</div>
<a name="10011971000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also raised the question of Russian gas and, of course, the
UK takes virtually no&#151;or very little&#151;Russian
gas.</div><a name="10011971000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000366"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> The Minister is right that we take very
little&#151;about 3 per cent. of Russian gas ends up here&#151;but
I am trying to illustrate that Europe is very much one village and
relies heavily on Russian gas. If the taps are turned off, it will
affect the price of gas and its distribution, and that will have
repercussions. I do not know how severe they might be, but there would
certainly be repercussions on the gas supply to the UK. If the Minister
denies that, I do not think she is taking the matter as seriously as
she should.</div>
<a name="10011971000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point the Minister raised was about interruptible contracts. They are a
reflection of the system that developed in the UK, with the North sea
oil 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>supply acting as our huge reserve. Times have now moved on and we do not
have the storage capacity of France or Germany. Rather than look back
and keep contemplating what happened in the last cold snap, we are
saying that we should use the Bill as a vehicle to improve our storage
capability by 2015, when the situation may get worse. Let us be
prepared for that longer cold snap because, had the last one been two
or three more days, the businesses that grabbed contracts because they
were cheaper would have suffered because they would not have been able
to keep their alternative power supplies
going.</div><a name="10011971000307"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="10011971000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000367"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The only business that I saw on record clearly
said that it had two weeks&#146; supply of alternative fuel and did
not in any sense feel at risk. When I come to my major points, I think
that the hon. Gentleman will see that he is looking to one single
solution and that the market is much more complex. There are many
solutions to the gas supply problem, which I hope to describe in a
moment.</div><a name="10011971000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservatives have also made much of their statement that there were
only eight days&#146; gas left. There has been a failure to
understand what gas storage means. Saying that there are only eight
days&#146; gas left implies that no other gas was coming into the
country. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> But that is the
implication, that there is eight days&#146; gas left.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> No, if the lay person on the
street was told eight days&#146; gas was left they would believe that
all gas supplies would run out in eight days. That is a common-sense
interpretation. Those who, sophisticatedly of course, know much better
should not put out simplistic statements that clearly lead the lay
person to believe that they would have only eight days&#146; gas
left.</div><a name="10011971000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000368"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> If the Minister goes back and looks at the press
release at the time, she will see that it was made absolutely clear
that that was not the case. Therefore the statement that we put out,
which was a beacon of clarity, did not say that. Others may have
interpreted it, or it may suit the Minister to interpret it, in that
way, but that is not what we said at the
time.</div><a name="10011971000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000369"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the Minister continues may I give
some guidance to the Committee? I think that we have probably heard
enough about whether the press statement of a week or two ago was
alarmist. It is, of course, relevant to debate whether there are
sufficient gas reserves. That is what the amendment is about, and I
hope that the Committee will focus on that from now
on.</div><a name="10011971000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000370"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley, for that
guidance. I think that you, I and the hon. Gentleman all know that in
politics it is the headline that matters and not the content of the
press
release.</div><a name="10011971000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000371"></a><b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="10011971000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000372"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Let me just describe the facts and I will then
happily give way. During the difficult period&#151;the cold
snap&#151;overall storage was about two-thirds full and, had the cold
weather gone on, that would have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>enabled a contribution at the level that was being made from gas storage
to continue for over seven weeks. The gas storage facility does not
have to replace all the gas being used because gas is still flowing
from everywhere. The storage makes a contribution, which at that level
would have been able to continue for seven weeks. The reality, for the
record, is that that is what we have in the most extreme circumstances
that we have faced in a long
time.</div><a name="10011971000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000373"></a>Anne
Main:</b> Putting it simplistically for the man in the
street&#151;as the hon. Lady said&#151;surely we should be asking,
&#147;Do we have less gas storage than other countries? If we do, do
we have sufficient or should we have more?&#148; To ensure that we
have more, the change should be made to the
Bill.</div><a name="10011971000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000374"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am sorry to tell the hon. Lady that she is
entirely wrong. That is not the question. When I come to my main
contribution, I hope that she will understand the points I make
then.</div><a name="10011971000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000375"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Government have intimated on a number of
occasions that we need more gas storage. Is the Minister now arguing
otherwise? She sounds complacent about the issue, but perhaps she will
tell me that we shall move on to talk about the need for more gas
storage. If so, I am happy with her remarks in that
respect.</div><a name="10011971000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000376"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I will come
on to talk about more gas storage, but it is so important to understand
that the point raised by the hon. Member for St. Albans is clearly
about how adequate our supply of gas is, which is not the same as
saying, &#147;How adequate is our storage of gas?&#148; Those are
not the same thing, and I seek to make that
point.</div><a name="10011971000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say again how extreme the situation was. The previous record demand
was in 2003 and was for  449 million cubic metres
per day. On 7 January this year it was 454 million cubic
metres per day and on 8 January it was 468 million cubic
metres per day. We were dealing with unprecedented demand over those
few days. What we have to ask ourselves, and what the person in the
street wants to know, is, given unprecedented demand in unprecedented
cold weather, did our gas supply stand up to the test? It
did.</div>
<a name="10011971000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 33
to 35 and new clause 20 all relate to the debate that we have just had
on gas storage. I must acknowledge that the hon. Member for Wealden has
clearly said that the preference is for accepting new clause 20 rather
than the amendments, but, for the record, I shall speak to the
amendments. They expand clause 16 to make it explicit that when Ofgem
is carrying out its principal objective of protecting consumer
interests, those interests include the need for gas storage. The
clarifications to Ofgem&#146;s principal objective that clause 16
will implement will, without amendment, put beyond doubt that the
interests of consumers include ensuring secure gas supplies. That is
the point that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
made.</div>
<a name="10011971000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the hon. Member for Wealden that gas storage is an important element of
security of gas supply, but it is just one element. What is really
important to consumers and businesses is that Britain has secure gas
supplies, and that can be achieved in a number of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>ways, not just through gas storage. Clause 16 will comprehensively cover
those interests, whereas the amendments focus on just one element. Gas
storage is specifically encompassed by the
phrase</div><a name="10011971000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;commercial
activities connected with, the...supply of
gas&#148;</div><a name="10011971000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
new subsection (1B) in clause 16(3). Amendments 33 to 35 are,
therefore, superfluous.</div>
<a name="10011971000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
new clause 20 is to allow the Secretary of State to set a minimum
requirement for an amount of gas to be secured for use by the suppliers
of domestic and business customers and gas-fired power generators. It
would also allow the Secretary of State to specify which customers
and/or generators would benefit from that secure supply. I do not
believe that the power is
necessary.</div><a name="10011971000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK&#146;s market arrangements have been tested rigorously during the
recent cold weather. The market delivered secure supplies even though
demand for gas reached record highs at the same time as four major
losses of supply from Norwegian fields due to technical
difficulties.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000377"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Does the Minister accept that the thinking driving
the amendments and the new clause is not problems of the past week or
so but the challenges of the future? If 80 per cent. of our gas is
going to be imported by 2020, that fundamentally changes the need for
gas storage in this country. The proposals are about driving forward
that necessary change, so it is wrong to tie them to the recent
challenges.</div>
<a name="10011971000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000378"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes his point but the
unprecedented weather and demand is extremely relevant. Did the market
prove effective in those circumstances? It did. He said that 80 per
cent. of our gas is predicted to be imported by 2020. The Government
are taking steps towards, and industry is responding well to, more
indigenous gas production. We cannot take that figure as absolute,
because more gas fields are being exploited and there is more reserve
than perhaps people anticipated. It may become more and more worth
while to get gas out of the sea.</div>
<a name="10011971000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have seen
the market in action. National Grid issued four gas balancing
alerts&#151;</div><a name="10011971000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000379"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Minister just said that we have seen the
market in action, yet she has not given us any indication of how much
more money we have to pay to maintain the supplies. She said that gas
storage is very expensive, but there was no understanding in that
statement of the difference between the cost of gas storage and the
amount that we might save if we were able to buy in the longer term.
Before making that statement, the Minister clearly had an understanding
of that difference. What  is
it?</div><a name="10011971000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000380"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman would not expect me to have
those figures at my fingertips. I make the point again that to build
gas storage is enormously expensive. We are therefore both right to say
that, if the argument changes and gas storage becomes the best way
forward and the other things that I will address are considered to be
less effective, the comparison has to be made. I remind him that the
unprecedented demand that we have recently seen is a once-in-a-decade
demand. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>There is therefore a major issue as to how much money should be invested
in gas storage to deal with an unusual situation where, as I will go on
to maintain, the market responded. It has been argued that people may
have paid more money, but that is not
certain.</div><a name="10011971000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
comparison needs to be made. I do not have the figures at my
fingertips, but our officials have looked into the issue and our
argument is that gas storage alone is not the answer to everything. It
will be part of the answer, but we will resist the new clause because
we do not think that it is the way
forward.</div><a name="10011971000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000381"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I have lots of memories of

it may be unusual in this decade, I remember house supplies being cut
off on the Conservative party&#146;s watch after it decided to close
down the
pits?</div><a name="10011971000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000382"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> We are all very grateful to my hon. Friend for
that intervention. I am sure that Mr. Bayley does not wish
me to wax lyrical about the days of the three-day week, but many of us
will remember them and we do not wish to learn lessons from some
members of the
Committee.</div><a name="10011971000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000383"></a>Mr.

the winter of discontent, but let us not go there.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div><a name="10011971000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000384"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am not going to have a winter of
discontent. We are not debating the degree to which gas was the cause
of the three-day week, but whether this country needs to legislate for
more gas storage. The Minister was explaining her
case.</div><a name="10011971000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000385"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> May I press the Minister on the price issue? She
made a fair argument about the relationship between the cost of the
storage and the price of gas. In order to make that statement, the
Minister must have an idea of the relative prices. I understand that
she does not have them at her fingertips, but would she be kind
enough&#151;she intimated that officials have done work on
this&#151;to write to us with those figures? They are an important
factor in her
argument.</div><a name="10011971000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000386"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am more than happy to do whatever I can to help
the hon. Gentleman. However, I ask him from a common-sense point of
view to realise that the proposal is for an obligation to build gas
storage, no matter what the price, for the whole year round, even in
years in which none of the events under discussion might ever occur.
Given that such events only rarely occur, that huge investment would be
dead money for most of the
year.</div><a name="10011971000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000387"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="10011971000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000388"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I will give way, but we might need to make a
little
progress.</div><a name="10011971000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000389"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> It was on a point of clarification. The new
clause does not say &#147;build gas storage&#148;, although some of
us would like eventually to wander down that route. It encourages the
Secretary of State to ensure that there is a minimum requirement. That
could still be achieved by gas companies owning a rig or a natural 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>refinery, or by venturing into other agreements with organisations to
ensure a guarantee of supply and avoiding the need to have gas storage
here in the UK. That is why it was written in this
way.</div><a name="10011971000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000390"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to invite
his Front-Bench spokesman to provide greater clarity on this
point.</div>
<a name="10011971000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000391"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> It is in the new
clause.</div><a name="10011971000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000392"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Yes, but I heard the speech as well. My
understanding, and I stand to be corrected and I would welcome an
intervention, is that we are talking about gas storage
facilities&#151;</div><a name="10011971000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000393"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> It was drafted specifically in this
way</div><a name="10011971000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000394"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Let me seek clarification from the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s Front-Bench spokesman. If we are talking about
market mechanisms we are talking about something quite different. We
have market mechanisms and it is very difficult to understand how one
would place an obligation on a company to enter into a market
mechanism.</div><a name="10011971000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000395"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I hope I can provide that clarification. The new
clause talks about an amount of gas to be secured. I said in my opening
comments that that could be a company owning and running its own
storage facility. It could involve its contracting the storage out to
another organisation, or it could be done through long-term contractual
arrangements where those were seen to be sufficiently robust. There are
energy companies in this country that are looking to buy their own gas
fields internationally, so they know they will always have that
available and could use the existing pipeline structure to provide
that. That should be taken into account in handling. It is not purely
storage in the United Kingdom; it is allowing the Secretary of State to
say, &#147;We want access to be provided by a number of
means&#148;, but to be satisfied that they are in
place.</div><a name="10011971000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000396"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
clarification. I think he weakens his case and makes the difficulties
for companies even greater. It would be extraordinarily difficult for
the Secretary of State to make such a requirement of companies, which
would then appear to be interfering entirely in commercial contractual
arrangements. That would be incredibly difficult. We have to deal with
the fact that it can be physical storage and look at that issue.
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reflect further on what he actually
means by suggesting that the Secretary of State could impose on
companies the need to enter into particular types of contract. Who
would police that? Who would decide whether their long-term contract
was sufficiently long term or secure, and so on? This is very difficult
territory.</div><a name="10011971000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me return to my overall argument about the nature of the existing
market and why we have confidence in that. I was about to say that
National Grid issued four gas balancing alerts earlier this month
signalling 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>that it needed the market to bring forward more gas in response to the
record demand. The market did exactly that. This serves to demonstrate
the robustness of the regulatory framework we already have in place,
within which the market delivers secure gas supplies. This includes
sharp financial incentives to ensure gas shippers provide sufficient
gas to meet customer demand; clear market information; and price
flexibility.</div><a name="10011971000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current gas market arrangements have attracted unprecedented investment
in the UK gas import capacity over the last decade, leading to a
fivefold expansion. This is my first significant point, to which the
Opposition have not given sufficient weight. I know the hon. Member for
Wealden mentioned it, but we now have oversized import capacity that is
equivalent to 125 per cent. of the UK&#146;s current gas
demand&#151;about 100 billion cubic metres. That new capacity
includes the Langeled pipeline, the Tampen Link offshore pipeline
linking the UK and Norway, the Balgzand Bacton pipeline between the UK
and the Netherlands that has been built and upgraded, the
interconnector between the UK and Belgium that has also been upgraded,
the major new LNG facility at Milford Haven and the expansion of the
Isle of Grain LNG import
terminal.</div><a name="10011971000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not needed as much gas storage capacity as other EU member states.
In addition to our significant import capacity, we have had and
continue to have supply-level flexibility on our doorstep. The North
sea fields still meet some 50 per cent. of our gas demand on an average
winter&#146;s day, and even during this period of high demand they
have produced about a third of the country&#146;s
supply.</div><a name="10011971000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do, however, recognise that as the indigenous gas supplies decline we
need to have robust arrangements in place to ensure continued energy
security. Part of our response is our commitment to diverse energy
supplies, by increasing our level of renewables, encouraging new
nuclear build and supporting the development of cleaner fossil fuels,
alongside our commitment to improving energy efficiency. Nevertheless,
gas will continue to be an integral part of our energy mix, and we are
taking steps to address the risks associated with falling UK
output.</div><a name="10011971000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have taken action to maximise the remaining indigenous resources by
providing new tax allowances to support the development of particularly
challenging oil and gas fields, and by setting up a new taskforce to
explore the development options for gas infrastructure west of
Shetland. We have also encouraged more gas storage projects to come
forward. We reformed the planning regime, which is widely believed to
have been one of the most significant obstacles to new storage projects
being completed, or completed on time. In Budget 2009 we confirmed that
bought-in cushion gas was eligible for tax relief, and that should
benefit some storage projects. New projects are coming forward, such as
the Aldbrough facility in East Yorkshire, which started commercial
operation last summer. We also recently approved a project in the Irish
sea, which would add new capacity equal to approximately 30 per cent.
of current UK storage capacity. In total, there are 22 gas storage
projects at various stages of development in the UK, which, if they all
came forward, would provide sufficient storage capacity to meet some 20
per cent. of current demand by 2020.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div><a name="10011971000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
cold weather has tested our capabilities to the limit, and those
capabilities have
responded.</div><a name="10011971000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000397"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> What does the 20 per cent. mean in terms of days
added to our existing 14 or 15 days&#146; storage? What are the
projection and the time
frame?</div><a name="10011971000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000398"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am being offered advice, which I am trying to
understand. I will check, and give the hon. Gentleman a precise answer.
I think we both understand what 20 per cent. means&#151;it is one
fifth&#151;but I want to be sure about how we express it. There is
constant mention of number of days and, as I have tried to make clear,
if we simply took a number of days, it would mean that that was
equivalent to all the gas supply we could conceivably need. We do not
draw on storage to replace all gas supply but to contribute to it, so
the number of days can be expressed but the figure is not entirely
meaningful. The hon. Gentleman should therefore beware of asking for
information that does not add greater
clarity.</div><a name="10011971000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000399"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> It is relevant to the ability to purchase gas at
the best possible price.</div>
<a name="10011971000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000400"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> On that point I have no dispute with the hon.
Gentleman&#151;I agree with him. We expect a fourfold increase in our
gas storage capacity.</div>
<a name="10011971000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000401"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Is the point the hon. Gentleman is making, which
might give a wrong impression, similar to saying there is five
days&#146; supply of fresh milk in the shops? That might make people
think we were going to run out of fresh milk in five
days.</div>
<a name="10011971000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000402"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hon. Friend is correct. There is a difference
between the understanding that we have in the Committee, and what the
person in the street might think if it was suggested that milk or gas
could run out.
</div><a name="10011971000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011971000403"></a><b class="B">Bill
Wiggin</b> (Leominster) (Con): Oh no, a milk crisis as

<a name="10011971000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000404"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Yes, we are getting into very difficult
headlines.</div>
<a name="10011971000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to make it clear to the Committee that the actions we have taken to
increase import capacity have delivered and the actions we have taken
to increase gas storage capacity are already having an impact. The
introduction of the kind of requirement envisaged by the new clause
would be very likely to have a detrimental impact on the flexibility of
the British market and to increase costs to consumers. That would
particularly be so if the new clause required a certain level of gas to
be secured, irrespective of costs or market conditions. That is why I
made the point to the hon. Member for Northampton, South that the
proposal prompts the question, would the obligation exist regardless of
the cost and the impact on the market and consumers?</div>
<a name="10011971000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guaranteed
stores of gas would weaken the incentive for gas shippers to respond to
market signals. There would be less drive to reduce gas consumption
when demand was high and power generation switches from gas to other
fuels, such as coal. That facility is an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>important strength of the British gas market, which other European gas
markets do not have, and it leads to lower gas prices
overall.</div>
<a name="10011971000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the powers
set out in the new clause were used to impose an obligation on gas
shippers, they would effectively require them to contract to hold a
certain amount of gas, which would have cost implications for consumers
of gas and electricity. For example, gas prices would have been higher
recently if market participants had not been able to take advantage of
competitively priced LNG, which has dropped in price recently due to
falls in world demand for gas. Those facts go to the heart of the
points made from the Opposition Front Bench and by the hon. Member for
Northampton, South. What are the implications? What are the effects on
prices? Which best advantages the customer? Frankly, the situation
cannot be predetermined. We have a sufficiently robust market that is
properly regulated, and which comes forward and meets our needs, as we
have recently seen.</div>
<a name="10011971000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The licensed
gas shippers already have a strong financial incentive to balance their
portfolios. There is a range of balancing tools on the supply side to
which they have access: imported flows by pipeline, LNG by tanker, and
storage. The shipper can purchase gas from the most economically
attractive source, enabling consumers to benefit from the lowest
prices.</div><a name="10011971000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the new clause is only an enabling power. Even so, it
could create regulatory uncertainty in the market, which could reduce
investment in new infrastructure and increase costs to consumers,
either through taxes or higher gas prices. The Government take security
of both gas and electricity supplies very seriously. We keep the issue
under constant review, working closely with National Grid and Ofgem,
through its Project Discovery, and are committed to taking appropriate
action to maintain our current high levels of energy security. For
those reasons, I believe that the new clause is unnecessary and, worse,
that it could have an adverse impact on the security of our gas
supplies and the cost of gas to
consumers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000405"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> You heard it here first: the prediction of the
Amber Valley milk crisis, due to hit by the weekend, when the children
of Amber Valley will be forced to switch to alcopops instead of their
daily &#147;pinta&#148;, if they have not already done
so.</div>
<a name="10011971000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
very interesting and important debate on gas storage. I am very
grateful that the Committee has had the opportunity to discuss the
matter in some depth. The fundamental point is that we are trying to
look ahead at the challenges that the country might face in the next
decade, and to move beyond a debate about what has happened in the last
fortnight. The Minister talked about some of the other sources of
supply that might come into the mix. Realistically, however, on the
time scale we are talking about, they are of very little benefit. New
nuclear cannot come into play before 2017-18 at the earliest. On the
massive roll-out of renewables, the offshore wind change that the
Government has planned will be toward the end of that decade rather
than in the early and middle part. We know that our coal plant is
significantly coming out of commission in the middle of this decade and
therefore the likelihood is that, if we are to keep the lights on and
generate the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>necessary power, gas will have to play a more important part. If we move
to a world, as Ofgem predicts in part of its Project Discovery work, in
which by 2020 80 per cent. of our gas will be imported, then we have to
take steps now to ensure that we have the storage facilities for that
eventuality.</div>
<a name="10011971000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
used some fairly obscure arguments to try to make her case. She said,
on security, that the amount of money needed could make storage a bad
investment because it will not be needed most of the time. In all
issues of national security one pays money in the hope that one will
never actually need it, but one knows that it is there in extremis. The
same argument could be made about Trident, I imagine. Indeed, the hon.
Lady probably made that argument about Trident in a different
life.</div>
<a name="10011971000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000406"></a>Bill
Wiggin:</b> But they stopped making
it.</div>
<a name="10011971000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000407"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> They have indeed stopped making that argument. But
there is a very strong case for saying that some investment is
necessary to protect us against moments of extreme need and extreme
danger.</div>
<a name="10011971000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000408"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Surely the hon. Gentleman needs to acknowledge
two things. First, there are many other ways&#151;and I cannot
imagine that my arguments sounded so obscure&#151;of bringing gas
into the country when we are under pressure. We have demonstrated how
many investments we have made; in fact, we have 125 per cent. capacity
in terms of imports. Secondly, we are, as I indicated, already seeing
more gas storage planned and coming on stream. It is a question of,
&#147;What more does the hon. Gentleman
want?&#148;</div><a name="10011971000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000409"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> If we look further ahead, we see that it is quite
possible to have an environment where more gas facilities will have
been built internationally than there are the molecules available to
power them, and therefore gas will be rationed by price. The energy
facilities will be working at full capacity only if we are prepared to
pay top dollar&#151;if we are prepared to pay more than the other
countries in the world who might be bidding for that gas at the same
time. A year or so ago that was not the case. The Americans and the
Japanese were prepared to pay more for that gas and therefore those
facilities were lying idle for significant periods. That is not the
case now, but it was the case. Therefore, price will become a rationing
factor. If one wants to smooth out those price fluctuations, having gas
storage is an important way of doing it, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton, South emphasised.</div>
<a name="10011971000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
also made the point that if there is more gas storage, then there is
less incentive to switch from gas to other fuels. I think that is a
rather perverse approach. One wants to ensure that if people want to
use gas, the gas is available. Therefore, having a greater Government
approach to delivering that will be important. Critically, we have not
tried to impose a single solution. We have not said that everybody who
wants to use gas in generation must have their own storage. We think
that is much too prescriptive. We want to allow the market to deliver
the right solution. A significant energy company in this country is
actively looking to buy its own gas field internationally and then use
the existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>pipeline infrastructure to make sure that it has all the gas that it
needs at any time. It would be peculiar to say that it must also have a
gas storage facility in the United Kingdom when it has invested to that
degree to try to ensure securities of
supply.</div><a name="10011971000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we seek to do through the amendment is give the Secretary of State the
ability to assess, company by company, the arrangements that they have
in place. We also want to make sure that, as we approach a period in
which gas is going to be more important to the United Kingdom, either
as a basic fuel or as a back-up fuel as renewables come on stream to a
greater extent, we can be comfortable that the gas storage
exists.</div><a name="10011971000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister talks about 22 projects at various stages of development, but
many of those have not even submitted planning applications. Those that
have do not have the funding; they have not agreed on the partners to
take them forward. Those that we assumed would be in their final stages
according to National Grid&#146;s 10-year statement&#151;we
expected to have that in place by the end of last year&#151;have
still not done it. There is a significant amount of uncertainty, and we
are trying to provide greater
security.</div><a name="10011971000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000410"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am finding this difficult to follow. Why would
the hon. Gentleman not believe that the commercial interests of the
companies and the development that they clearly want would not go
ahead? It is entirely in their interests to be able to supply their own
markets and customers with the energy that they need. What will the
Secretary of State have to do to the companies to make them behave in a
way that differs from their own commercial
interests?</div><a name="10011971000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000411"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> If we look at what happened early last year when
the Russia-Ukraine dispute was building up, we see that German gas
storage, even though it was pumping out an enormous amount of gas to
its neighbours who simply did not have the storage, was substantially
full at the end of that period and was almost at the same levels at
which it started. Ours, in the meantime, has been massively depleted,
because we had a different and much more liberal regime that allowed it
to be exported at will according to where the demand was. The market
worked, but our national security was
compromised.</div><a name="10011971000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are saying is that, as we inevitably become more dependent on gas
imports, we need to do more to protect the consumer against such
external shocks. We cannot predict where they will come from, but there
is a high likelihood that there will be future shocks. We are not
talking about the Government owning and running the gas storage
themselves, but they have a leadership role to ensure that it is put in
place.</div><a name="10011971000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000412"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The difference between us is that we believe that
what is necessary will come on stream; the companies have made it
evident that that is the case. The hon. Gentleman refers to the
difficulties in mainland Europe, but the UK did not fall into
difficulties. We were able to continue with our suppliers and were not
in the position that he
suggests.</div><a name="10011971000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000413"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Let us have a further reassessment: we were down
to just three or four days&#146; worth of gas storage left in this
country, because so much gas had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>been shipped out at a time of national pressure approaching what was the
coldest winter for 18 years. There were real difficulties that needed
to be
assessed.</div><a name="10011971000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would be a precautionary measure. We are entering more
difficult periods, because we will be less able to depend on our own
sources of supply. Supplies will come from a range of different
countries and we recognise that there will be agreements in place on
those contracts. Nevertheless, we are moving toward a greater period of
uncertainty. What the Government need to address most is the role they
truly expect gas to play. Their low-carbon transition plan states that
the role of gas is declining from 40 per cent. of generation capacity
to less than 30 per cent. As part of its Project Discovery, however,
Ofgem stated that it could possibly be double that amount. In other
words, 60 per cent. rather than 30 per cent. of our electricity
generation could come from gas. That makes a critical difference to the
amount of gas that we will be importing and to the need for storage in
this
country.</div><a name="10011971000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have indicated that we do not plan to press the amendment to a vote and
that we will withdraw it. I am keen, however, to work with the Liberal
Democrats to see whether we can return with an amendment on Report. The
fundamental issue, which is of greatest importance, is that this is not
just about what is happening now. We are moving into a more difficult
period, when we are going to be more import-dependent. Government need
greater powers to secure the necessary storage and other long-term
contracts, in order to ensure that consumers do not run out or face
significant price spikes, which happens in times of shortage. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011971000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

clause 16, page 13, line 14, leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000416"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Mr. Bayley, I hope we can move with
greater speed through this part of the Bill. The amendments seek
greater clarity about what is intended. Our view is that there should
be a clear distinction between the role of the Secretary of State and
the Government, which is to set policy, and the role of the regulator,
which is to regulate within that policy framework. I seek clarification
from the Minister on where that boundary lies. We are seeing some
changes, which we understand. We discussed them during the course of
the Energy Act 2008, when the Government resolutely refused to go down
this route, in spite of much encouragement and temptation. We need to
be clear where the balance of decision making applies. Clause 16(3)(1A)
says:</div><a name="10011971000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
interests of existing and future consumers are their interests taken as
a whole, including&#151;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div><a name="10011971000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) their
interests in the reduction of gas-supply emissions of targeted
greenhouse gases; and</div>
<a name="10011971000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) their
interests in the security of the supply of gas to
them.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue that arises from that is clearly that the interest of consumers
is the primary duty of Ofgem. It is not clear who decides the relative
importance to be put on security of supply or low carbon. The phrasing
of the Bill says that Ofgem can decide on that relative balance. By
deleting the word &#147;authority&#148; in a number of these areas,
the amendments would make it clear that the Secretary of State has that
primacy. Policy making is at the heart at the role of Government and we
are keen to see that with greater clarity.</div>
<a name="10011971000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is no
reflection on Ofgem; the work that Ofgem has been doing on Project
Discovery has been of immense importance to the nation in understanding
the challenges and options that are open to us. It would be helpful to
have greater clarity from the Minister as to where the primacy of power
will
lie.</div><a name="10011971000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000417"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Clauses 16 and 17 clarify Ofgem&#146;s
principal objective by setting out that the interests of current and
future consumers include their interests in reducing greenhouse gases
and in security of gas and electricity supply. Those interests need to
be considered by the regulator when it is undertaking its functions in
regulating gas and electricity markets. It is worth noting that clauses
16 and 17 do not give Ofgem any new powers. The effect of amendment 12
would be that, in cases where Ofgem is carrying out its functions in
regulating the gas market, it would be for the Secretary of State to
decide how it could carry out its functions and what would further the
principal objective. In other words, Ofgem would no longer have
discretion to consider how best to regulate gas markets in order to
further its principal objective. Amendment 14 would have the same
effect with respect to Ofgem&#146;s functions as regulator of the
electricity markets. Amendments 13 and 15 are consequential on
amendments 12 and 14.</div>
<a name="10011971000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would have the impact of undermining the current system of
independent regulation of the gas and electricity markets. Ofgem would
need to refer every decision it made to the Secretary of State to test
whether the Secretary of State thought the decision was the best way to
further its principal objective. Undermining regulatory independence in
that way would reduce regulatory certainty and risk investment at a
time when it is
needed.</div><a name="10011971000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for the references in clauses 16 and 17 to</div>
<a name="10011971000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Secretary
of State or the
Authority&#148;</div><a name="10011971000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
that they amend the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989. Those
Acts give both Ofgem and the Secretary of State powers to act in
regulating the gas and electricity markets. We intend each to carry out
its functions in the way that is best calculated to meet the principal
objective of protecting the interests of current and future consumers,
including their interests in reducing greenhouse gases and ensuring
security of gas and electricity
supply.</div><a name="10011971000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would have a detrimental effect on the operation of the
regulatory framework. I hope that that I have indicated to the hon.
Member for Wealden that it is very clear that the Secretary of State,
as always, sets the policy and the regulator&#146;s principal duties
are in statute. Within that, the regulator must have independence, and
the proposed new subsections bring clarity to the principal
duty.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div><a name="10011985000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000418"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> May I take the Minister back to clause 16(3),
which introduces the issues of reduction of emissions and security of
supply? It does not give them relative weight and does not suggest that
the Secretary of State will give further guidance on the relative
weight. Therefore, it will be for Ofgem to
decide.</div>
<a name="10011971000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000419"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> That has to be the case, but, obviously, policy
constantly develops on security of supply and emission reductions to
tackle climate change, so there will always be a dialogue and a policy
framework within which Ofgem will act. However, when it comes to
deciding on a particular course of action, as the independent
regulator, it will have to weigh up the balance between the two issues.
It is impossible to say that more weight should be given to one or the
other because the circumstances in which Ofgem has to perform that
balancing act cannot be predicted. To fix the balance between the two
in stone would be to shackle the regulator. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman that that may seem somewhat unsatisfactory, but I do not
think that we can expect to go further. It is important that we have
introduced the clarification of the principal role of Ofgem, not least
because current consumers may not benefit directly, or may even suffer
some degree of disbenefit, if it became necessary to take a course of
action that could impose an additional burden on them to serve the
interests of future
consumers.</div><a name="10011971000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a complex matter. Ofgem will have to make difficult decisions and
there will be conflicts in doing that. Through the Bill, we seek to
indicate to Ofgem that both issues will have to be weighed in the
balance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000420"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> There are different pressures in trying to achieve
different objectives. For example, there is the Climate Change Act 2008
and the legally binding requirement to reduce our carbon emissions by
80 per cent. by 2050. The Government could decide that climate change
needed more emphasis than energy security, because that was the world
in which we lived and they felt comfortable about security of supply.
The proposed new subsection appears to give Ofgem the ability to reach
a different conclusion, and Ofgem would decide the pricing structure.
Therefore, we could have conflict because the independent regulator
decided the balance but the Government, in policy terms, reached a
different conclusion. Will the Minister explain how that will work in
practice?</div><a name="10011971000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000421"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The issue is difficult, and I may not be able to
entirely satisfy the hon. Gentleman. When it comes to policy
decisions&#151;setting overall strategy for climate change, for
example&#151;the Government will obviously set the policy framework,
and it will be for them to decide all the issues in an overarching way.
Ofgem will, however, need to strike a balance when there are competing
courses of action. We have set Ofgem the clearly difficult task of
weighing up the issues and determining what is in the consumer&#146;s
interests. We are aiming for more clarity because we know from past
experience that at times Ofgem has perhaps not entirely fulfilled the
role it has been
set.</div><a name="10011971000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000422"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Does not that make it difficult for the businesses
concerned? They seek to abide by the rules and provide a pricing
structure that meets what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>they believe to be Government policies and priorities, and if they put
extra effort into gas security because they are following this debate,
they could be told that their pricing structures are unfair to
consumers because Ofgem has reached a different conclusion and reckons
that low-carbon issues will be more important than the security of
supply. I am concerned about what happens in businesses that are trying
to make the right investment decisions but might see a conflict
developing between the Government&#146;s priorities for low carbon
and security and those set out by Ofgem, which are independent and
would appear to have equal
validity.</div><a name="10011971000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000423"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I cannot dispute the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intellectual argument. In practice, of course, there is a continuous
dialogue between the Government and Ofgem, Ofgem and companies, and
companies and the Government. We are entering a new world in every
respect, and I foresee that it will be that constant dialogue between
all the parties that will enable us to get the best result from the
legislation. The Bill attempts to draw out the fact that there are
conflicting pressures, and to say to the regulator that it must take
account of them and make the best possible decisions in the interests
of the consumer. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman further comfort on
that
issue.</div><a name="10011971000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000424"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I have one final word. We do not plan to press the
amendments to a vote, but will the Minister further consider, before
Report, whether greater clarification will be necessary so that in the
event of a disagreement of relative importance between Ofgem and the
Secretary of State, the views of the latter will carry
primacy?</div><a name="10011971000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000425"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am delighted to give the hon. Gentleman that
undertaking. I assure him that I will look extremely carefully at all
my responses in Committee, to see if I may do better on
Report.</div><a name="10011971000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000426"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> There are two interesting and important
interrelated issues here. May I ask you, Mr. Bayley, to bear
it in mind that the debate has been specifically about the
constitutional interrelationship between the Secretary of State and
Ofgem? There is the wider issue of the balance of duties, which is in
the clause, and I would therefore be grateful if you allowed that to be
discussed in a stand part debate so that I could limit my remarks now
to the constitutional
issue.</div><a name="10011971000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000427"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We can discuss such matters in a stand part
debate.</div><a name="10011971000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000428"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am grateful for that, Mr. Bayley. I
am sympathetic to the amendments, as is the consumer organisation
Which?, which would like the amendments to be more strongly worded. In
its briefing, it argues that responsibility for enacting policy in the
energy market should rest with the elected representative, the
Secretary of State, thus ensuring democratic accountability. It is not
currently clear that this is the case. It adds  that the
amendments would help avoid any confusion when considering the
principal objective to promote consumer interest.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div><a name="10011971000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will come back to the debate about the balance of interests. I
understand the Minister&#146;s point that in the existing Gas and
Electricity Acts there is the dual responsibility. That is the way
those two Acts are phrased. But when we come to the judgments about
balancing consumer interests and competitiveness&#151;low
prices&#151;and other issues like emission and climate change, the
Secretary of State should be accountable because there would be the
ability to influence those decisions as part of the political
process.</div>
<a name="10011971000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofgem has its
supporters and its critics, but it is a quango. It is at one step
removed from accountability. It has moved pretty slowly, if not very
slowly, on many of the issues in which consumers have had most
interest. I do not think it is to be regarded overall as a friend of
the consumer. It has been regarded generally as a friend of the
industry. Therefore it would be better and more responsive if Ministers
were accountable for these things rather than the regulatory
authority.</div>
<a name="10011971000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I heard what
the Minister said to the hon. Member for Wealden about reflecting on
the debate. It is wise that we all step back and do that. But my
instinct would be to say to the hon. Gentleman that we are right to
pursue this on Report and to ask the Minister to think about the
constitutional accountability. I think this is where the public would
expect us to be able to hold Ministers to account and not to hear them
say that it is a matter for the regulator and they will tell us next
year what it
thinks.</div><a name="10011971000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000429"></a>Charles

amendment.</div><a name="10011971000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000430"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The same issue arises in this clause as in the
next one. I will therefore make the arguments only once. As would be
expected, I have looked at the original clauses in the Gas and
Electricity Acts, as amended subsequently. So that those who follow our
proceedings can understand what is happening, we need to see the effect
of the proposed change. The current proposal is to take the Gas Act and
quite significantly restructure the obligations. Section 4AA (1)
states:</div><a name="10011971000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principal objective of the Secretary of State and the Gas and
Electricity Markets Authority... in carrying out their respective
functions under this Part is to protect the interests of consumers in
relation to gas conveyed through pipes, wherever appropriate by
promoting effective competition between persons engaged in, or in
commercial activities connected with, the shipping, transportation or
supply of gas so
conveyed.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
effective competition is the method. Subsection (2) states:</div>
<a name="10011971000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State and the Authority shall carry out those functions in
the manner which he or it considers is best calculated to further the
principal objective, having regard
to-</div><a name="10011971000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">the need
to secure... all reasonable
demands...&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011971000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
that is security of
supply&#151;</div><a name="10011971000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
(b) the need to secure that licence holders are able to finance the
activities.&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011971000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
that is to make sure that they are viable economic undertakings. It
then continues about other duties. Subsection (3) states:</div>
<a name="10011971000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(3)
In performing that duty, the Secretary of State or the Authority shall
have regard to the interests of-</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div><a name="10011971000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) individuals who are
disabled or chronically
sick;</div><a name="10011971000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
individuals of pensionable
age;</div><a name="10011971000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
individuals with low incomes;
and</div><a name="10011971000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d)
individuals residing in rural
areas;</div><a name="10011971000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">but
that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the
interests of other descriptions of
consumer.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
therefore points to categories of people who will be in the mind of the
Secretary of State or the regulator. The central provision of the
current Act is not significantly altered by the rest of the
clause.</div><a name="10011971000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10011971000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) shortens the principal objective to protecting the interests of
consumers and does not get into a qualification or definition. Proposed
new subsection (1A) then introduces a new proposal, which I welcome as
far as it goes, although my comments are intended to explore how far it
goes. It states:</div>
<a name="10011971000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
interests of existing and future consumers are their interests taken as
a whole, including...in the reduction of gas-supply emissions of
targeted greenhouse
gases&#148;,</div><a name="10011971000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is clearly an important consideration, given the climate
council&#146;s
debate,</div><a name="10011971000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
their interests in the security of the supply of gas to
them&#148;,</div>
<a name="10011971000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">which we have just
debated. We then come to a third provision, which is set out in
proposed new subsection (1B):</div>
<a name="10011971000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State and the Authority shall carry out their respective
functions under this Part in the manner which the Secretary of State or
the Authority (as the case may be) considers is best calculated to
further the principal
objective&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011971000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
protection of consumers&#146;
interests&#151;</div><a name="10011971000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wherever
appropriate by promoting effective competition between persons engaged
in, or in commercial activities connected with, the shipping,
transportation or supply of gas conveyed through
pipes.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Act is changed by the Bill, therefore, we will have a principal
objective of protecting the interests of consumers, and I buy that,
because it seems to be the right starting point. The clause then looks
at how we define that objective, and we find that the definition
includes issues relating to greenhouse gas emissions and security of
supply. Proposed new subsection (1B) then talks about the principal
objective being met</div>
<a name="10011971000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wherever
appropriate by promoting effective competition&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011971000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
lawyers&#146; minefield, and if the issue were ever contested with
Ofgem or the Minister, the question would be what comes first and what
the hierarchy is. The protection of consumers is at the top, which is
fine, but where does effective competition stand in relation
to greenhouse gas emissions and security of supply?</div>
<a name="10011971000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
straightforward point to the Minister is that, having looked at this
carefully&#151;I have not paid for or taken counsel&#146;s opinion
to get an answer&#151;I am not clear how Ofgem, the Secretary of
State or their successors would balance these considerations. I would
like us to put on record how the process would work, because
this is an important issue. I am grateful that emissions and
security of supply are included, because those are the right
considerations, but I am not sure whether they
have equal billing with competition or whether they are secondary to it
when it comes to the crunch.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div><a name="10011971000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have put the case clearly. It is right for us to look at the
responsibilities of the Minister and Ofgem, and we need to know how the
different considerations will be weighed up in this clause and in the
following, comparable clause, which deals with
electricity.</div>
<a name="10011971000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000431"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Clause 16 clarifies&#151;that is our
intention&#151;the principal objective of the Gas and Electricity
Markets Authority, or Ofgem, in relation to the regulation of the gas
markets. The principal objective of Ofgem and the Secretary of State
when exercising statutory functions relating to the regulation of the
gas and electricity markets is to protect the interests of existing and
future consumers. That objective relates only to the carrying out of
the functions that Ofgem already has under legislation. That is an
important point, and we are not giving Ofgem any new powers. In the
context of the clause, those functions include the licensing of the gas
network and market activities and ensuring the compliance of licence
holders.</div><a name="10011971000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principal objective will not be changed by the clause, but its meaning
will be clarified in two ways. First, the clause will put it beyond
doubt that the interests of consumers include the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring energy security. That was
implicit in the current legislation, given that consumers clearly have
an interest in those issues. It was also explicit, but only to the
extent that Ofgem already has secondary duties to have regard to
aspects of the issues in carrying out its functions. What the present
clause does is to make that assessment part of the principal objective,
and therefore an integral part of identifying where consumer interests
lie, rather than a subsidiary
consideration.</div><a name="10011971000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
doubt whether, for the record, I can be more explicit than I have in
making those remarks, but I shall reflect, as we have all agreed I
should. If, on Report, or in any other way, such as by writing to hon.
Members, I can say more, I shall do so. However, I believe that what I
have said should make our meaning clear: it is to make the assessment
part of the principal objective, and therefore an integral part of
identifying where consumer interests lie, rather than a subsidiary
consideration.</div><a name="10011971000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
Ofgem is currently required to protect the interests of consumers by
promoting effective competition wherever that is appropriate, as the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said. Although effective
competition is fundamental to consumer protection, it may not always be
sufficient in the energy markets and there are times when more
immediate action, such as the enforcement of existing, or the urgent
introduction of new consumer protection measures is required to
safeguard consumers&#146; interests adequately. I think that the hon.
Gentleman and I are both aware of circumstances in the recent past when
Ofgem was effectively forced by public opinion and Government pressure
to act, and to do things more quickly, because reliance on competition
did not produce the required results. With issues such as prepayment
meters we saw a need for it to take more robust and immediate
action.</div><a name="10011971000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes it clear that Ofgem, before reaching a decision, must
consider whether the interests of consumers would be better protected
by other means alongside, or instead of, the promotion of competition.
It does not give Ofgem any additional powers, but it clarifies the
framework within which the regulator is expected to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>carry out its functions. Given the importance of transparency and
predictability in the energy market framework, we consider it right and
proper to ensure that the basis for Ofgem&#146;s decisions is clearly
supported by primary
legislation.</div><a name="10011971000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000432"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I beg to move amendment 25, in clause 18,
page 16, line 21, at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) the establishment
of a competition for the construction of undersea high voltage direct
current cables for the purposes of connecting offshore electricity
generation to the onshore
grid.&#146;.</div><a name="10011971000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that you may forgive me for one moment, Mr. Bayley, if
before I speak to the amendment I refer to an issue that we discussed a
little earlier. The Minister said in relation to gas storage issues
that companies had not had to stop manufacturing. I have since had
information from the Chemical Industries Association that of its
12 members whose power supplies were interrupted five had to
shut down for the period in question; so there was an important
implication for the interests of UK plc, and I hope it is appropriate
to mention that.</div>
<a name="10011971000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000433"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> We will have to check the record, but I was
making the point that they should not have had to shut down, because if
they have an interruptible contract, they should have alternative
generation in place. If they chose to shut down manufacture, they did
not make a sensible decision when taking an interruptible
contract.</div><a name="10011971000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000434"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With that exchange over, we should move on to
the
amendment.</div><a name="10011971000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000435"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> We shall return to the matter in due
course.</div><a name="10011971000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with access to markets, and I believe that we all agree
that new generation capacity is of little value if it cannot connect to
the national grid. We are all aware of a wide range of issues
concerning connection. It is difficult to explain why some wind
facilities that have received planning permission are being given grid
connection dates a decade in the future, and even further ahead. A
whole range of issues on connectivity need to be addressed as part of
energy policy. Amendment 25 refers to the connection of offshore
facilities.</div><a name="10011971000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
briefing provided for this part of the Bill states of the terms for
connection of new generation electricity to the
grid:</div><a name="10011971000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposed change will clarify that Ofgem, in assessing the regime for
grid connections, should consider the interests of consumers not only
in efficient investment, but also in curbing emissions and in a secure
energy supply. The Government believes that ensuring a regulatory
framework that supports early, efficient deployment of low-carbon and
other generation within a timeframe consistent with project development
plans would meet the consumer interest.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div><a name="10011971000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no doubt that
we all agree that the phenomenal potential of offshore wind is a key
part of that. We followed with great interest the announcements during
the past week or so on the round 3 licences in which there has been an
exceptional amount of interest in trying to take forward that
investment.</div><a name="10011971000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Angus often reminds us that a great deal of that
renewable electricity generation will be off the coast of Scotland.
Currently, 15 per cent. of all Scotland&#146;s electricity is
exported to the rest of the United Kingdom. I am not sure that
&#147;export&#148; is the right word, but it is almost certainly
the word that the hon. Gentleman would like to be used. The electricity
comes from Scotland to
England.</div><a name="10011971000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000436"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> We export electricity not just to England, but to
Ireland.</div><a name="10011971000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000437"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I feared that the hon. Gentleman would take us
into a different debate, so I am glad to be
corrected.</div><a name="10011971000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
potential for renewable electricity generation in Scotland is estimated
to be 60 GW, which is 10 times the total demand in Scotland, so there
is an enormous need to get that to market elsewhere. We are persuaded
that if the offshore potential for wind is to be actively developed, it
is important to have high-voltage DC cables along the coast, as set out
by the National Grid in some of its proposals to link up many of those
facilities, and to bring that power to areas where it is in greatest
demand and of greatest use. National Grid estimates that such bootlaces
would cost around &#163;6.5 billion to build, and either it could be
required to build them, or the  process could be put out to
tender if there was interest in doing
so.</div><a name="10011971000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be very challenging indeed to meet the objectives and targets for
offshore wind. At the moment, there is a shortage of ships, cranes,
skills and money. Apart from that it is probably going rather well, but
a great deal more needs to happen if we are to see the investment
coming to fruition. The reason for the amendment is that the Government
need to do more in taking a strategic lead, and requiring high voltage
to be put in place will enable that to
happen.</div><a name="10011971000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
issue relating to the supply chain is that if the market potential
continues for the next 20, 30 or 40 years, not just to 2020,
the companies that produce the cables will look to the United Kingdom
as a place to invest. The extent to which high-voltage DC cables will
be required will take up much of the world&#146;s global output of
every year over the next decade. There is a need for greater
manufacturing capacity, and we all agree that we want that investment
to come to Britain. To make those multi-million pound investment
decisions, businesses need to understand that the Government have a
clear strategy and will require the cablings to be put in
place.</div>
<a name="10011971000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="10011971000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is all made more complicated by the absence of a road map on how the
renewables targets are to be delivered. I understand that the
Government are  working on a road map, but it seems rather slow
in coming. We think that our proposal is a better way to do it, rather
than requiring point-to-point connections. Our understanding is that
that could make many projects 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>unaffordable, as was indicated by some of the academics who gave
evidence to the Select Committee.</div>
<a name="10011971000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has the chance to be bold and say that we have a strategic opportunity.
By this small amendment, we can require the cabling to be put in place
and start to make more likely the delivery of the massive roll-out of
off-shore
wind.</div><a name="10011971000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000438"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This is a welcome short debate about how we get
our infrastructure in place. I have a couple of questions for the hon.
Member for Wealden and, like him, would also be interested in the
Minister&#146;s reply.</div>
<a name="10011971000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question arises from the amendment&#146;s proposal of a competition.
I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has thought that the logical thing
would be to have a competition for producing the place and type of
infrastructure we need, given that there is an equally valid argument
that Government, having talked to industry, need to decide the
appropriate infrastructure, location and format.</div>
<a name="10011971000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question is connected to that. The hon. Gentleman has heard me say
before that I am enthusiastic supporter of a European supergrid. We
have various bits of a potential supergrid already in place around
Europe. There are bits interconnected, and we have heard about some of
them today, but the concept of a European supergrid is much bolder and
bigger. I am not clear whether the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues
believe that the best way to obtain the necessary energy security for
Europe that could give us energy independence as a continent, is to
work with our European colleagues and have a common European energy
policy, which produces an agreed European supergrid, just as we need an
agreed European train network. Government decide in essence where lines
are going to go because they have to be interconnected. I have never
heard the Conservatives say that they are signed up to that, and that
it should be led by the European Union.</div>
<a name="10011971000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever our
arguments and differences about the European Union, energy policy, like
environmental policy, is self-evidently better dealt with at a
European-wide level where possible. The supergrid is clearly better
sorted at a European level. We have several other countries immediately
next to us: Ireland on the one side; the Netherlands, Belgium and
France on the other. Scotland and the north-east have Scandinavian
countries, in particular Denmark, Norway and Sweden, which are
relatively proximate for potential supply. We know that there is
currently a rather ridiculous and unco-ordinated set of activities
building pipelines from Asia to Europe, influenced by all sorts of
financial and political considerations. Competitive attempts are made
to bring security of supply; some will avoid Russia and come further
south; some will come through the Black sea or from the Caspian sea.
There is a whole set of proposals.</div>
<a name="10011971000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
countries in the European Union are extremely nationalistic about
energy policy. The French and Germans have been particularly
nationalistic about these things in the past. If we are to harness,
particularly but not only, renewables to give us access to and security
of supply of oil and gas from elsewhere&#151;whatever our energy
efficiency and reduction in consumption&#151;we need a planned short,
medium and long-term project up and running as soon as
possible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div><a name="10011971000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Member for Wealden and his colleagues have often heard me argue
that the best way of maximising the benefit of renewables, both for use
in and export from this country and for use in other countries across
the European Union, is to allow for the hydroelectric schemes of
Norway, the solar schemes of Europe&#146;s Mediterranean countries
and those on the south of the Mediterranean in north Africa&#151;they
are also interested in the issue&#151;and for the tidal opportunities
that I anticipate we will hear more about this spring when the Crown
Estate announces the result of its work in the Pentland firth and so
on. All that seems to logically point towards an integrated European
supergrid. We, the UK, need to be signed up to that, as do Energy
Ministers at the Council of
Ministers.</div><a name="10011971000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not suggesting that our Secretary of State is not committed to that,
but I doubt whether the Conservatives are, because I have never heard
them say so. I would like to hear from the hon. Gentleman whether he,
as his party&#146;s spokesman, is willing to say, &#147;We, the
Conservative Party, pledge our undying commitment to a European energy
policy with a European supergrid driven and promoted by the EU.&#148;
That would be a refreshing, positive and reassuring outcome. We may
not, however, get such a statement today, tomorrow or any day between
now and the general election. It would be an opportunity
missed.</div><a name="10011971000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have always been a bit concerned that the Conservative party has not
caught up with the importance of working, planning and deciding
together, so I am intrigued to know what lies behind this modest but
potentially hugely important amendment. It would be important only if
it became what Europe needs, which is a commitment to a European energy
supergrid driven, organised and co-ordinated in the European
Union.</div><a name="10011971000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000439"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman has
said. We have also been very supportive of the supergrid idea to link
us with Scandinavia and other European countries. I have some concerns
about amendment 25. First, given what has happened in the carbon
capture and storage competition, the word &#147;competition&#148;
fills me with dread in relation to energy policy. Another point is that
high-voltage cables may be the way forward for the round 3 wind farms,
but other wind farms, particularly in the Scottish sector, are nearer
inshore where the more sensible thing to do may be to take the cables
onshore and link to the grid through the existing infrastructure. That
leads to the argument of transmission charges, but I will resist that
today, because we have been through it many times. The argument,
however, must be dealt with at some point. The high-voltage cable is a
good idea, but, as the hon. Gentleman has said, we need to investigate
the possibility of a European supergrid, which will allow us to import
as well as export energy through our offshore
renewables.</div><a name="10011971000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000440"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I think that there is a degree of confusion, and
I hope that I will be able to clarify things. The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey asked about developing a supergrid and
co-operation in Europe. The Government always seek co-operation within,
and are an active member of, the European Union. The development of a
supergrid could sit well with many of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>our wider energy policy&#146;s objectives, particularly our offshore
wind policy. In December, my colleague Lord Hunt signed a political
declaration with eight other European Energy Ministers from Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden and
Ireland to co-operate on the development of offshore wind
infrastructure in the North and Irish seas. The intention is to
prepare, at working level, a strategic plan for early this year to be
enshrined in a memorandum of understanding to be signed in 2010. The
hon. Gentleman will therefore see that we are willing to pursue those
European connections. We see the sense of his argument. The European
supergrid, which has been consented to by all the relevant members,
must be one very positive potential future solution to securing all our
energy needs in Europe.</div>
<a name="10011971000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000441"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am aware of the agreement and I welcome it. Does
the Minister think that the signatories, including this country, will
seek to promote widening the agreement to the other 19 countries of the
EU? The new Climate Action Commissioner is the Danish Minister and the
new Energy Commissioner is the German nominee to the Commission. Will
the Minister reassure us that the Government plan to engage early with
those two key people in Brussels, so that there will be not just eight
countries working together, but Britain leading  27 countries
working together with the two key people in the
Commission?</div><a name="10011971000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000442"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we expect to
be positively engaged with new Commissioners. That is in all our
interests. We know them well already and that is a very good start. I
would not want to pre-empt what the working party hopes to bring
forward, but it is called a strategic plan and I think that augurs well
for the future. There are many Ministers in other countries, with whom
we have very close connections, who share our aspirations for
developing diversity of supply, serving our consumers well, and
providing security of
supply.</div><a name="10011971000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the record, I should make it clear that we have decided that National
Grid, as national electricity transmission system operator, NETSO, will
be responsible for co-ordinating development of both onshore and
offshore grid connections. That should ensure that the grid can be
developed in a strategic and co-ordinated way, while being responsive
to generators&#146; needs. Ofgem recently consulted on changing
National Grid&#146;s licence to, among other things, publish and keep
updated an offshore development information statement that will present
potential scenarios and National Grid&#146;s best view of the
development of the transition network offshore and the Crown status
already agreed to assist National Grid in that work. I hope that is
helpful to members of the Committee.</div>
<a name="10011971000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18
gives the Secretary of State the power to limit or eliminate the
circumstances in which, or the extent to which, a licence holder may
obtain an excessive benefit from electricity generation in a particular
period. The intention is to prevent undue exploitation of market power
where transmission constraints exist. The amendment seeks to add the
establishment of a competition for constructing undersea high-voltage
cables for connecting offshore generation to the onshore grid to the
list of modifications that may be made by virtue of the Secretary of
State&#146;s powers in clause 18.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div><a name="10011971000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to see what the amendment would achieve. The constructor or
owner of the cable connecting offshore generation projects to the
onshore grid has no role to play in the electricity balancing system
and is therefore not in a position to significantly influence the
conduct of a generator as regards constraint costs. There is no
incentive for offshore generators, obviously, not to generate and
transmit to the grid all of the electricity that they produce due to
the level of payments that they receive through the renewables
obligation certificates. Generators are also unable to increase
generation at a given time due to the intermittency of the wind. In
addition, the power in clause 18 (1) to amend generation licence
conditions does not extend to the amendment of conditions of a
transmission licence and would therefore not affect the holder of such
a licence. Those companies participating in a competition for an
offshore transmission licence are therefore highly unlikely to be in a
position to engage in the undue exploitation of market power by
generators, which is what clause 18 is designed to tackle. It would
therefore not be appropriate to extend the scope of the clause in the
way envisaged by the
amendment.</div><a name="10011971000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="10011971000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the Secretary of State has already used powers granted by the
Energy Act 2004 to establish an innovative regulatory regime to connect
offshore wind projects to the onshore grid in the most effective way.
That regime allows for the construction and ownership of cables
connecting offshore generation projects to the onshore grid to be
undertaken by means of a competitive exercise. What the hon. Member for
Wealden seeks to do through the amendment is not what clause 18 would
do and the amendment is therefore inappropriate. The hon. Gentleman
appears to seek to introduce competition into the process, probably in
order to speed it up and get ahead. However, that is already being done
in a different way using existing powers.</div>
<a name="10011971000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofgem has
already commenced tendering for nine offshore generation project
connections and expects to grant the first offshore transmission
licences for those connections from summer this year. I therefore
welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for the competitive
approach&#151;I understand that in the past his party had not put
forward such a measure in connection with these connections. I am glad
that he now believes that to be the right way forward, and I assure him
that it is already under way, albeit in a slightly different form. I
hope that he is satisfied that a process involving competition is under
way, and that he will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011971000243"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000443"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> This has been a useful and relatively brief debate
on the issues involved in taking forward the investment in offshore
generation. There has been a discussion about whether it should be a
competition, and the Minister is absolutely right&#151;when we
initially made the proposal some months ago, there was a suggestion
that National Grid should be mandated to put in place that connection.
In response to representations by Ministers and others, we think that
perhaps there is scope for doing it in a different way, and that a
competition would be more appropriate.</div>
<a name="10011971000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for North Southwark and Bermondsey and for Angus clearly have
doubts about competition. It could be that the competition would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>come out with only one bidder willing to do the work, but at least it
would have been done in a more open way. Similarly, if a competition
for a new bus route solicited a bid only from Mr.
Bayley&#146;s bus services, and nobody else was interested in running
that service, it would go forward in that way. However, that does not
negate the purpose of having a competition in the first
place.</div>
<a name="10011971000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey tried to put the debate into
a European context. I shall endeavour to answer that without straying
into a debate that would be more appropriate elsewhere, but I am keen
to respond to his point. This matter can certainly tie into the concept
of a supergrid. I think that I would be considered an early adopter of
the concept of a supergrid, and we should pay great credit to Eddie
O&#146;Connor, who was one of the people who had the genius to
develop the idea, and the imagination to try and drive it forward. The
fact that it is now being taken so seriously owes a significant amount
to the drive from him and his company.</div>
<a name="10011971000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea was
also taken forward by Tony Blair as Prime Minister, who raised it
directly with the German Chancellor to see whether we could try and
move the discussions forward. In a way, the Minister&#146;s response
has shown the way that such things can be developed. There has been an
agreement between a range of Energy Ministers from those nations that
will be affected and who desire to work together, co-operate and try to
deliver on this idea. It does not necessarily need to be something that
covers every aspect of the European Union. I am not sure that Bulgaria,
Romania and Greece have a particularly strong view about the
development of a supergrid in the North sea. There is clearly a need
for co-operation, but many of those things should be done through
treaties and agreements between the individual nation states that have
the most to gain and that will benefit most, rather than by requiring
all 27 EU nations to reach agreement. In that way Norway could be part
of an agreement, which clearly cannot be done within the European
Union.</div><a name="10011971000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned the potential
development of a southern grid linking into the solar power in the
Sahara, and the discussion and development of that does not need to
involve every northern European state, as that could impede progress
rather than move it forward. He also mentioned some of the pipeline
infrastructure, which tends to depend on treaty arrangements rather
than on agreement by the whole of the European Union. Although the
European Union may generally be supportive of the Nord Stream
development, Russia has negotiated treaties with the nations through
whose territorial waters the pipeline would pass to get their agreement
to the concept. That is the right
approach.</div><a name="10011971000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to be careful about the limit of European competence. I will be
careful, Mr. Bayley, not to stray beyond the issues that we
are looking at in the Bill. I would be nervous if there were to be a
European energy policy that determined whether we could build nuclear
power stations, that determined that CCS done only on a European
competition model could go ahead and that we could not run our own
national schemes, and that would have a Europe-wide approach to energy
efficiency. There are individual national issues on which we should
absolutely rightly be able to make decisions, but we completely
understand that if we are trying to deal with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>climate change and emissions, co-operation with our European partners
plays an important part. I am therefore completely in favour of
co-operation and of working together, but many of the issues ultimately
come down to energy policies that should rightly be decided at national
state
level.</div><a name="10011971000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is nothing in the amendment that would make it more difficult to
develop a European supergrid, which would be a natural way of taking
things forward. The thinking behind the amendment is to find a way of
driving forward the investment that we are keen to see in the offshore
renewables sector, not just in wind, but in the crucial development of
marine renewables technology a decade or so from
now.</div><a name="10011971000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has made some pertinent remarks about why it is difficult to
tie in the amendment to this part of the Bill. We understand her
concerns, and I will therefore seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
Importantly, however, National Grid has been one of the organisations
that have been most keen to develop the concept, because it sees it as
particularly important for the level of investment required. The
Government have up to now opposed the concept of high-voltage DC
cabling. Lord Hunt, when he appeared before the Energy and Climate
Change Committee, said as much, and I hope that we are beginning to see
a softening of the Government&#146;s approach. The Minister said that
National Grid was in the position of co-ordinating the approach, and I
hope that there will, therefore, be a generally open approach to how
best to take things forward and encourage those sorts of investments.
It may be that that sort of competition could be set up without the
need for legislation, but that might be an issue for another Government
to assess and see how best to take forward. We have had a useful debate
about how we can best encourage development in the offshore renewables
sector, a development which I think we all care to see very much
indeed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011971000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011971000446"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> New clauses 18 and 19 have been tabled by the
Liberal Democrats, and new clause 4 by the Conservatives. I will take
the items in the group in turn. I anticipate that my contribution will
be interrupted by
lunch.</div><a name="10011971000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
36 is on a matter that was pursued by the hon. Member for Amber Valley
in her questioning of Mr. Alistair Buchanan when he gave
evidence to the Select Committee in December. She had been well
briefed, as always, by Which?, and I saw a fairly robust set of
questions, putting to Mr. Buchanan and his colleague
Mr. Wright, who appeared to give evidence, the point that
Ofgem was not perceived as a great friend of consumers. In particular
the hon. Lady pointed out a particular anomaly that is of concern at
the moment.</div>
<a name="10011971000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would deal with that anomaly and would require the minimum notice
period by which the licence holders must inform their customers of any
change to their energy tariffs to be an automatic condition of the
licence. I think that I shall be told by the Minister that it was
already possible to include it as a condition; I want to ensure that it
will always be included as a
condition.</div><a name="10011971000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue arises because at the moment&#151;and there is an early-day
motion about it&#151;energy companies have 65 days after a price rise
to inform customers of it. Customers then have only 20 days in which to
switch, after they have been informed. The research done by Which?
shows that 98 per cent. of people want their supplier to notify them
ahead of the price rise.</div>
<a name="10011971000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
obvious to me that a customer buying a product at price x, which is
about to go up, who has a legal right to change at any time to another
supplier, should know that the price is going up before it happens,
rather than later. It certainly seems to me that 65 working
days is a ridiculously long period in which to make it acceptable to
tell customers that the price has gone up. It is something like three
months.</div>
<a name="10011971000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the current licence condition dates back to 2006. Previously
suppliers were required to give retrospective notification within 10
days. I do not think that there is any strong argument that
retrospective notification is sufficient, and it seems to me that in
this day and age people should be notified either at the time, or,
preferably, in advance.</div>
<a name="10011971000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">On page 115
of my copy of the uncorrected transcript of evidence of the Energy and
Climate Change Committee sitting on 2 December 2009, when
Mr. Buchanan, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>Mr. Marlee and Mr. Wright gave evidence, the hon.
Member for Amber Valley&#151;I should probably have alerted her to
the fact that I would be quoting her; but it will all be favourable

were a bit damning earlier about how opaque the bills still are but I
thought that was your responsibility. Have you not imposed a new

This report is still very
damning.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a reply about those issues, but I shall hold off on that, as it
relates to the new clause.</div>
<a name="10011971000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
went
on:</div><a name="10011971000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
have been fairly damning reports from both Which? and The Plain English
Campaign. What about this phrase in the Which? Report that &#145;the
regulator's efforts to address confusing tariffs are weak and
impossible to enforce, leaving consumers struggling to find and keep a
good deal&#146;. Would you care to
comment?&#148;</div><a name="10011971000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I shall come back to the response. There was a series of exchanges and
then the hon. Lady said to Mr.

the issue of the advance or retrospective notification of price
changes. Mr. Buchanan
said:</div><a name="10011971000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
second issue here, and because we were going to make an announcement I
have been given permission by my sustainability senior partner to
mention it today, is that I think Which? is touching on a very strong
nerve when they talk about why companies have 65 days. We have just
created a consumer panel of 100 people; we are going to ask them to
have a look at this. Although the general probe...that Andrew has
been talking about will get a full review in 2012, if we think this
needs particular action sooner than that, then we will pursue
that.&#148;</div><a name="10011971000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady&#146;s question was
then:</div><a name="10011971000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Why
do you have to wait for a panel? Why can you not just tell them it is
not acceptable? I do not know of anywhere else where somebody would
take 65 days to tell me the price of something that I was buying was
going up. You name another supplier of anything that I buy that would
take 65 days to tell
me?&#148;</div><a name="10011971000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
