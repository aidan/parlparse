<H4><center>New clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>SPECIES ACTION PLANS AND HABITAT ACTION PLANS</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to ensure the preparation, maintenance and revision of lists of species and habitats, in respect of which special measures shall be taken to monitor their population status in view of their vulnerability or international importance, and to determine—
<P>
(a) which species listed are priority species and require the development of Species Action Plans; and
<P>
(b) which habitats listed require the development of Habitat Action Plans.
<P>
(2) It shall be the duty of every Minister, government department, local authority and public body, so far as it is consistent with their primary functions, to further the objectives of Species Action Plans and Habitat Action Plans.'.—[Ms McCafferty.]<P>

<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are considering new clause 20–Local sites—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) It shall be the duty of every local authority to adopt and maintain a scheme for maintaining a series of sites in their area (in this section referred to as ``local sites''), to ensure the conservation, restoration and enhancement of species, habitat, geological and geomorphological features of substantive nature conservation value.

(3) Such guidance shall—
<P>
(a) specify standards for the identification of sites, notification of owners, occupiers and others and the provision of adequate information and advice as to the management of local sites;
<P>
(b) provide for the involvement of voluntary organisations, landowners and others in the adoption and maintenance of the scheme.
<P>
(4) It shall be the duty of the Nature Conservancy Council for England and the Countryside Council for Wales periodically to report on the operation and effectiveness of each scheme.
<P>
(5) In the formulation and exercise of their functions relating to land under any enactment every Minister, government department, local authority and public body shall further the conservation, restoration and enhancement of local sites.'.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. It is always good to see another man of Kent arriving to discuss important issues, and I suspect that you will see us through our last few knockings. Our discussions will not detain us beyond one o'clock tomorrow afternoon which I think is the end of the time that we are formally allowed.
<P>
I was speaking in support of the new clause. As I said, although all hon. Members welcome moves to protect SSSIs, many of us believe that the Government should go much further to protect species outside the SSSI network. The specific point of the new clause is to provide greater underpinning of the biodiversity action planning process. I pray in aid of my argument the words used by the Government throughout our proceedings. They say that they support the intentions behind the new clause, and have made their support for such aims clear in answers given to hon. Members from all parties.
<P>
For example, during consideration of amendment No. 489, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), the Under-Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The best route for dealing with the issue is to use the current biodiversity action planning process, which prescribes the action needed for each species on a case-by-case basis.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 18 May 2000; c. 720.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That approach is precisely right. During our discussion on amendment No. 466, the Minister for the Environment told the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>priority species currently identified under the biodiversity action plan are those that are most at risk of population decline<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say that the best route for dealing with that issue was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>through the current biodiversity action planning process.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 18 May 2000; c. 733.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the Government recognise the importance of biodiversity action plans. Those of us who support the new clause are seeking to allow the Government to live up to their own rhetoric. The United Kingdom's ratification of the convention on biological diversity, the publication of the UK biodiversity action plan and the subsequent development of individual species and habitat action plans have set in train some recovery process for many of our most threatened species. However, the current approach to developing and delivering these biodiversity action plans requires many people to work on a voluntary and participatory basis. Such an arrangement can be appropriate, but it needs further strengthening. It is not appropriate for the entire biodiversity action planning process to be dependent on good will.
<P>
We have seen many examples of circumstances in which even that widespread good will does not add up to enough action on the ground. The most notorious one involves the Countryside Council for Wales, which has been operating with a Government budget that it regards as inadequate and has had to drop significant sections of its work load. It has, therefore, not unreasonably prioritised programmes that it has a statutory duty to perform. Consequently, biodiversity action plan work in Wales has not been a priority, so the benefits that could be gained from the process are not available. There are similar examples in England. In Yorkshire, progress on biodiversity action plans has been slow because no public body has taken the lead. I am aware that the Environment Agency is the subject of criticism. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) has not been slow in chiding the agency. Many environmental groups believe that the agency in Yorkshire has been reluctant to become involved in the BAP process because it is not regarded as a priority.
<P>
One prevalent misunderstanding should be cleared up. The amendment does not make biodiversity action plans legally binding. I know that officialdom objects to the amendment because it wants BAPs to remain voluntary. The new clause underpins the process of drawing up such plans, but not the plans themselves, which would continue to be voluntary. The clause would secure the Government's financial and policy commitment to the process in the long term and therefore provide volunteers with the security that they require.
<P>
I turn to new clause 20. Although local sites may appear less important than sites where the most threatened species may be found, they are vital in allowing people convenient access to wildlife near large centres of population. I believe that the two new clauses are vital to allow a rounded approach to wildlife protection and I speak warmly in support of them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): I take this opportunity to welcome you, Mr. Gale, to the Chair.
<P>
In speaking to new clause 18, I wear my hat as chair of the all-party wildlife protection group. The underpinning of biodiversity action plans has been an important part of that group's discussions for at least the last year. It has not suddenly been thought of and tacked on at the last minute. Support for BAPs in the House can be judged by the fact that the early day motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Ms McCafferty) received 91 signatures in only 10 days.
<P>
I warmly support new clause 20. I shall give a local example of how the proposed powers might have prevented damage severe to an important site in my constituency. Helpstone quarry is important for its habitat and geology. Its limestone grassland contains many nationally important flora and fauna. When it was last surveyed in 1993, the great crested newt and six nationally scarce varieties of water beetle were found there. In 1997, the site's owners planned a series of 4x4 rallies, involving thousands of vehicles each year. However, as those rallies were to be held on only nine days each year, planning permission was not required. The site was developed for those activities, which included the laying of tarmac tracks and digging up of various areas.
<P>
Peterborough City council, in consultation with the local wildlife trust could, and did, refuse planning permission for buildings and drainage. That and pressure from local residents resulted in the landowner removing that activity from the area. However, the site was re-surveyed shortly afterwards by the same surveyors who carried out the 1993 survey and it was found that no less than 75 per cent. of the habitat had been lost or destroyed. Three quarters of the area was ruined. Peterborough City council would welcome the additional powers that the clause would give it. I have great pleasure in supporting the new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I, too, welcome you, Mr. Gale, to the Chair of what might be —who knows?—one of the final sittings of the Committee. We have had a succession of Chairs, all of whom have served us extremely well. [Interruption.] I am sure that you would agree, Mr. Gale, that observing the proper courtesies of Committees cannot be described as creeping.
<P>
I support the new clause. That is not surprising as I have put my name to it. We had a short discourse on ``The Wind in the Willows'' this morning when we discussed which members of the Committee might be identified with which characters. I do not propose to re-open the debate other than to suspect that there might be stoats and weasels from the wild wood lurking around, against whom we should guard.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) said, the new clause is significant. It has been given a substantial pre-billing. On several occasions during our discussions, the Minister noted the central importance of biodiversity action planning as a process, citing it as an answer to the issues that were raised. It is fair to say that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee share that view. We consider such planning to be a crucial aspect of the Bill and we want to ensure that the process has the statutory underpinning that it requires.
<P>
Ministers have the problem that a small majority of the members of the Committee support the new clause, as was the case regarding an earlier new clause concerning areas of outstanding natural beauty. That is not to say that they will not persuade us that there is a better way of achieving its aim. Nevertheless, the support of members of the Committee demonstrates the importance attached to the issue.
<P>
It is worth repeating the point made by the hon. Member for Ashford. No one suggests that there should be a prescriptive view of what local biodiversity action plans should contain or how they should be advanced. The value of the exercise currently is its voluntary nature and the way in which partners are brought together in a process that establishes species protection.
<P>
Whether the starting point of the process has statutory support is a matter of great concern. The United Kingdom would fail in the commitments into which it has entered under the convention on biological diversity if there were no statutory underpinning of the process. That significant point must also be made in practical terms. The partners to agreements—those wishing to see a process of protection entered into and continued—must be confident that they will continue to receive support from successive Administrations, not just the Government of the day. However, I find it hard to believe that a future Government would turn their back on the need for biodiversity.
<P>
There is a real danger that priorities of the public bodies associated with the process might change at a local level. People might have different views of the correct way in which to use the limited resources available. Only if the underpinning that the new clause would offer were provided could there be confidence that the Government and all levels of public authorities were committed to the process.
<P>
My fear is that, unless we have that confidence, we will continue to lose species and habitats that fall outside the geographically identified protected areas. The essential measures will not be taken in time and in full to protect them. Not only will that be a great shame, but it will fly in the face of non-voluntary and voluntary work throughout the country. Local conservation bodies are very much engaged in the process of local biodiversity action planning. If their work is not worthy of support at a national level—in the plainest and most evident terms, if it is not recognised in the Bill—we will be doing them a disservice. I pay tribute to local conservation bodies, which were excited by the prospect of the convention's ratification, for taking the lead.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For all those reasons, the new clause is important and the Government would do well to support it. There would be no downside. The new clause could have only a positive effect. If the duty is laid down, it will be clear that we mean business when it comes to the convention on biological diversity. We are committed to the same objectives, although we might advocate different ways in which to achieve them at local level. However, at least the process is continuing and we are all committed to it.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale. I have more faith than the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that this will be our final sitting. I cannot let it pass without reminding my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment, the Under-Secretary and all other Committee members of the support that my—admittedly unsuccessful—Wildlife Bill in November 1998 and early-day motion 11 in the 1998-99 session received from all parties. That is the first time I have mentioned my early-day motion in the Committee, although my right hon. Friend and I have discussed it and corresponded on the issues. The 349 hon. Members who supported it signed up to two major considerations—the importance of statutory underpinning for the biodiversity action plan and the importance of local wildlife sites, which are dealt with in new clause 20. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will have encouraging words for all of us on the Government's intentions.
<P>
I received a letter from the Brighton urban wildlife group, which meets regularly in my constituency. It advises Brighton and Hove council on wildlife issues. Although my constituency is largely urban, in the first two decades of the previous century, the people of Brighton were persuaded by their mayor, Herbert Carden, to buy up large tracts of the countryside around Brighton so that it could be protected. Brighton urban wildlife group reminds me in its letter that the wildlife strategy in Brighton and Hove is not part of the council's local plan. Indeed, there are no obligations on councils to produce biodiversity action plans, let alone to implement them. I look forward to hearing the Under-Secretary's response and I am sure that the issue will command all-party support.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I, too, take this opportunity to welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I support new clauses 18 and 20. New clause 18, in particular, strikes a chord with those of us who were fortunate enough to meet Commissioner Margot Wallström in Brussels as a delegation from the Environment Committee. Britain is clearly not fulfilling its responsibility under the European Union biodiversity directive. The new clause would go some way towards rectifying Government reluctance in that quarter.
<P>
I vigorously support new clause 20, which bears a remarkable resemblance to one that I was thinking of drafting. I am concerned not just about the protection of local wildlife sites, but about the staggering fact, which I discovered by doing some research with the assistance of the Wildlife Trusts and the Library of the House of Commons, that there is no statutory definition of wildlife sites. New clause 20 is important in that respect.
<P>
In a constituency such as the Vale of York, where there are only five or six sites of special scientific interest and many special sites have already been lost to agriculture—partly because agriculture is the North Yorkshire's most important industry and is deeply in crisis—the best places for wildlife are local sites. They need better protection and a system needs to be developed to common standards by local authorities. It would be particularly appropriate for that to be backed by central Government through new clause 20, so that local authorities would know the location of sites and so that there would be a presumption against development that might damage them.
<P>
The Government have recognised that an issue needs to be addressed by referring to the importance of such sites in their consultation paper on sites of special scientific interest, which led to the Bill, and also by setting up the local sites review group. I understand that that has now reported. It would be chivalrous and noble of the Government to adopt the new clause.
<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee that the Government will rigorously and vigorously pursue the issue, so that there will be action properly to protect wildlife sites? The conservation of local sites is crucial, because if the decline in wildlife is to be reversed and the national biodiversity action plan targets are to be achieved, we need a framework in law. That framework would ensure that a local system of conservation were implemented and would help to alleviate the present starkly apparent regional differences. It would also establish the need to have due regard to adequate resourcing of the system, and to the provision of information and advice to landowners and the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): I share in the general welcome to you, Mr. Gale, and the general support for the new clauses.
<P>
I thank the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust for its advice. It is based in my constituency at Elvaston castle, one of several country houses that survive in south Derbyshire. I want to draw attention to two aspects of its research and also to mention that it is a voluntary organisation, as all wildlife trusts are, driven very much by the endeavours of a small number of people who are tremendously committed to the flora and fauna of their area. We owe all the trusts a considerable debt. The two new clauses would assist them in the tasks by which they contribute to their rural communities. I want to give members of the Committee the opportunity to share the pleasure of contemplating the good work that the trusts do.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would want to join me in congratulating the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust for its fine work in conjunction with the Ramblers Association in setting up the first local access forum in England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating that organisation, but I get the signal that not too many such interventions are required at this particular moment.
<P>
In her earlier contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley mentioned the future of the water vole in south Derbyshire and described the position as bleak. There is a major problem for that species, even in the attractive and important rivers that cross and re-cross my constituency. Another, less obvious, matter for concern is the loss of unimproved or semi-improved grassland, which currently preserves a wide range of wild flowers and creatures that live in the grassland and feed off other creatures there. That habitat is rapidly disappearing. A survey conducted in the national forest that occupies the southern third of my constituency showed that 94 per cent. of unimproved and semi-improved grassland had been lost in that area since 1983. That is a staggering figure, which indicates a variety of effects, including changes in agricultural production and, especially in an area such as south Derbyshire, opencast mining and other development pressures. It is an attractive area, where many people wish to live. Many people find opportunities to make money from land development. This Bill is the only one in this Parliament—and probably in the next as well—that addresses countryside and wildlife issues. Therefore, it is important that it should deal as comprehensively as possible with the concerns of those who seek to protect the flora and fauna of our countryside. We have the opportunity to do that now.
<P>
In conclusion, establishing biodiversity action plans and local sites on a statutory basis and suggesting how those sites might be managed invites questions about the process of enforcement, which is not sketched out in the Bill. That leaves some doubt and ambiguity, which will have to be addressed in future legislation.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> Welcome, Mr. Gale—nicely timed, if I may say so. We must also welcome the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) back to our deliberations with his newly acquired suntan, which is no doubt the result of some rigorous fact-finding mission in a sunny clime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It was gained gardening in my garden in Wiltshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I remember from our earlier discussions that council houses in Wiltshire have drives that are somewhat longer than those in other areas, and I suspect that the gardens in Wiltshire might also be slightly larger.
<P>
I take heart from the all-party consensus on the issue that seems to exist. My right hon. Friend the Minister and I have listened carefully to the points that have been raised. My hon. Friends the Members for Calder Valley and for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), who opened the debate, put forward some very persuasive arguments. Under the United Kingdom action plan for biodiversity, individual plans have been drawn up for 391 species and 45 habitats. My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley will be pleased to know that the vole is included in those 391 species. The Government are proud of that achievement and are determined to keep up the momentum.
<P>
The Government are sympathetic to the proposals, but the danger is that a proposal to provide a statutory basis for species and habitat action plans would place the onus on the public sector, and might put at risk the highly successful delivery partnerships of the statutory, business and voluntary sectors. We would not wish to jeopardise a commitment to which so many have already contributed.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to new clause 20. Last October, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment asked officials to set up a local sites group to review the identification, protection and management of local sites and consider how it might best fit the Government's approach to site protection. The report illustrated a large degree of consensus on many issues, especially on the need for a clear framework for the identification of the support and funding for sites. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there was a breakdown of that consensus on the group's legislative recommendations, which are embodied in the new clause. Those recommendations caused particular concern to landowning and, to some extent, local authority interests. That is not to say that progress cannot be made, but the potential difficulties were not acknowledged.
<P>
That said, the Government are prepared seriously to consider placing biodiversity action plans on a statutory footing. I give no commitment, but on that basis I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley withdrew the new clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's serious thoughts on the matter. Candidly, the danger with biodiversity action plans is of too much plan and not enough action—and eventually not enough biodiversity. In years to come, those who promoted the Bill will be judged by whether wildlife protection outside the SSSIs has markedly improved. As the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) said, the House does not have many chances to get it right. If we pass up this chance, we shall not have another for many years, by which time serious damage will have been done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust tells me that it has a satisfactory agreement with the Cotswold district council, which can inform the planning process, so that if a planning application is made for such a site, the council can see how best to modify it to protect that site. I am told that not all district councils in Gloucestershire are as co-operative. Those things work differently not only throughout the country but within counties. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government should take this into account in whatever solution they propose, and try to ensure that the system works more evenly across the country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. One of the reasons why the process may need some statutory underpinning is to avoid the sort of local difficulties that I and my hon. Friend have mentioned.
<P>
I am grateful for what the Minister had to say. We shall obviously scrutinise the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Ms Chris McCafferty </B>(Calder Valley): I thank hon. Members from all parties for their support for new clauses 18 and 20, which demonstrates how seriously hon. Members take the issues that they address. I was delighted by the Under-Secretary's remarks, as well as a little taken aback. Now he is looking at me and I am wondering whether I have read more into his remarks than he intended to imply. I hope that that is not the case, because this is the first marginal success that I have had in the House. [Interruption.] I hold up my hand to say that that is not true; I withdraw the remark. What can I say? Totally wicked is the answer. I am delighted and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>CUTTING OR FELLING TREES ETC THAT</center></H4>
OVERHANG BRIDLEWAYS
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) Section 154 of the 1980 Act (cutting or felling trees that overhang or are a danger to roads or footpaths) shall be amended as follows.
<P>
(2) For the words ``or footpath'' in every place where they appear, there is substituted ``, footpath or bridleway''.
<P>
(3) For the words ``or pedestrians'' there is substituted ``, pedestrians or equestrians''.'.—[Mr. Gray]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I am glad to have returned from my modest garden in Wiltshire in time to see you, Mr. Gale, in the Chair, albeit for this short time. [Interruption. ] I shall ignore that remark from the Liberal Democrat Benches. I think that I was being asked whether your chairmanship would be of the high quality that I expected, Mr. Gale. I shall try to draw a veil over that.
<P>
The new clause, which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, is straightforward. I should perhaps declare two non-pecuniary interests in relation to it. I am the chairman of the horse and pony taxation committee, and, as such, I am an unpaid consultant to the British Horse Industry Confederation, the organisation that looks after the national horse industry and tries to communicate its interests to the Government.
<P>
The horse world has been disappointed by the progress of the Bill, as the Government have not accepted two groups of amendments that were targeted specifically at helping horsemen throughout the nation to gain better access to the countryside. By contrast, the new clause is a modest proposal that would none the less significantly improve access to the countryside for horsemen. The thrust of the Bill is to improve access for walkers; the new clause would have a similar effect, in a limited manner, in respect of horsemen.
<P>
The proposal attacks a particular problem that has arisen because of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which took effect when horse riding was at its lowest ever ebb. Agricultural horses had declined almost to extinction and sport riding and hacking out had not become the sport that it is today. The nation's bridleway network is consequently extremely inadequate. It is very short, and many bridleways go nowhere or stop at county, parish or district boundaries. Access to the countryside on bridleways is very poor indeed and bridleway organisations and the British Horse Society are keen to find ways of improving that access.
<P>
One of the difficulties that horseman face everywhere is caused by farmers and landowners who allow trees or bushes to overhang bridleways. There is currently no statutory means of ensuring that such encroachments on the bridleway can be corrected. The Highways Act 1980 refers only to bushes and trees that obstruct the passage of vehicles and pedestrians on roads or footpaths. The new clause seeks to add the words ``or bridleways'' to the phrase ``roads or footpaths'' in the 1980 Act. The Act ensures that roads and footpaths cannot be obstructed by trees, but it does not apply to bridleways and there is no way in which horsemen or bridleway associations can put such problems right on bridleways. Where the Act states that the passage of vehicles or pedestrians cannot be obstructed, the new clause seeks to add the words ``or equestrians'' in the same way, which is a consequential change.
<P>
The new clause would simply enable horsemen to ask the proper authorities to give 28 days' notice under the Bill and require owners to cut back overhanging trees or bushes that are obstructing bridleways. It is a modest and small provision, but it would be welcomed by the horse industry and by horse riders throughout the nation. I therefore hope that the Government will give it a fair wind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire said, new clause 19 would amend section 154 of the Highways Act 1980, which gives local authorities a power to require, by notice, certain persons to lop or cut a hedge, tree or shrub that overhangs or is a danger to a road or footpath.
<P>
The amendment is aimed at two perceived defects in section 154(1), into which it would insert the word ``bridleway''. It might be argued that bridleways are not covered by the provision—the subsection refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a highway or any other road or footpath to which the public has access.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the provisions do apply to bridleways because they relate to hedges, trees or shrubs that overhang a highway. Bridleways, of course, are a type of highway.
<P>
There is also uncertainty regarding bridleways concerning how much the owner of a tree can be required to lop. He can be required to lop up to a height of 6ft or so, to provide clear access for those on foot. However, it is not so apparent that he can be required to lop, say, a further 4 ft, to give those on horseback clear passage along the bridleway. The amendment seeks to do away with that uncertainty by inserting a reference to equestrians.
<P>
Such is the generous spirit and the demob atmosphere in which the Committee meets this afternoon that we are willing to consider whether the 1980 Act should be amended to empower highway authorities to serve notice on owners and occupiers to remove or cut back hedges, trees and shrubs that grow on their land and overhang bridleways and other highways to a height convenient for horse riders. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire will be willing to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I cannot remember who said ``a small thing, but mine own'' but I am grateful to the Government for considering my small thing. I hope that they will return to the matter at a later stage and on those grounds I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss new clause 23—Hedgerows—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) Section 97 of the Environment Act 1995 is amended as follows.
<P>
(2) After subsection (2) there is inserted—
<P>
``(2A) Where a hedgerow is not determined as `important' under the prescribed criteria, local authorities shall have the power to determine the hedgerow as `important' where it is considered to be significant locally.''
<P>
(3) In subsection (8) after ``stretch of hedgerow'' there is inserted ``and also includes all features which are known locally as hedges (for example Cornish hedge banks and Welsh cloddiau) as well as any bank or wall on which the hedge is growing, and any trees which may be growing within it''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Under-Secretary should beware of using phrases such as demob happy because I have another group of new clauses to move. He might be being premature.
<P>
The new clauses address significant issues and represent the last chance for Opposition Members to get the Government to take seriously matter of dry stone walls. We have become the friends of the dry stone wall, but to little effect so far because the Government have refused to accept our suggestions for improving the state of Britain's dry stone walls.
<P>
That subject appears as part of a wider package in new clause 22, which would improve the protection of several landscape features—stone walls, ditches, dykes and ponds—that are central to the character and diversity of the English countryside but which enjoy no statutory protection. That is despite the fact that they continue to disappear at an alarming rate. In Cambridgeshire, for example, dykes have reduced in number by 25 per cent. since 1983. Fifty per cent. of England's 112,000 km of dry stone walls are derelict or not stock proof. A third of England's ponds have disappeared since 1945. The problem is widespread and has continued for many decades. That adds to the urgency of the problem. As we have said on several occasions, the Bill gives the Government a once-in-a-generation opportunity to increase protection for all landscape features by accepting the new clause or by producing their own version of it.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's affection for dry stone walls. I built one only a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is it still standing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Remarkably, it is. Is the hon. Member for Ashford not concerned that the new clause would allow the Minister to prescribe by regulation a rather open-ended provision that could prove extremely onerous to a great number of people if it were misconstrued by future Ministers?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I was seeking to tempt Ministers by allowing them the chance to do what they like to do most, which is to make regulations. If they wish to propose a better solution, I shall welcome it. The protection of natural features is important. The new clause is one way of achieving that, but there may be others. I am sure, however, that the problem is urgent. Some public-spirited citizens are putting up new dry stone walls, but those walls are likely to be relatively small in number compared to those that are falling into disuse or are being damaged.
<P>
The Under-Secretary and the Minister are aware of the problem. Even I have grown weary of quoting their words back at them this afternoon, so I shall spare them that. They have frequently said that those natural features are under threat and deserve protection. I invite them once again to turn their words into action.
<P>
New clause 23 refers to hedgerows. It gives local authorities the power to determine whether a hedgerow is important locally. The provision would amend the existing hedgerow protection regime, which is based on complex criteria and historical records. The number of hedgerows covered by existing regulations is the subject of controversy—the number ranges from 20 per cent. to slightly more than 50 per cent. Even at the higher figure, many hedgerows are not protected. The Department's review of the hedgerow regulations in 1997 showed that they were not particularly effective. The new clause seeks to break the shackles of the present criteria by allowing locally important hedgerows to be protected. It allows local and professional judgment to be applied to their protection.
<P>
The new clauses seek to broaden the protection provided by various provisions in the Bill by applying them to some of the best-loved natural features of the English and Welsh landscape.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I add my expression of pleasure at serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale—albeit briefly, as I know that the Committee would like to complete its consideration of the Bill today.
<P>
New clause 22 deals in part with the preservation of stone walls. You, Mr. Gale, would hardly expect someone from the Cotswolds to speak only briefly about Cotswold stone walls, which are disappearing at an alarming rate. The Minister for the Environment knows the Cotswolds well and he knows that I am right. I draw his attention to a lacuna in the planning laws that could be dealt with either in the new clause or in other legislation. Unless the wall is of a certain specified height—I believe that it is 6 ft, which would have to be a very well-built wall—the planning authority can do nothing to prevent its deliberate removal.
<P>
The problem has been drawn to my attention several times since I have been a Member of Parliament. It causes great anger in the Cotswolds when unthinking developers deliberately demolish dry stone walls. The local authority should have the power to prevent that from happening. I hope that the Under-Secretary and the Minister—who are now discussing something at great length—will be able to reassure me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> New clause 22 is intended to extend statutory protection to important landscape features other than hedgerows. The Government recognise that traditional field boundaries and landscape features are often felt to give a landscape character and a locality distinctiveness, which the public particularly appreciate. Some believe that all field boundaries and landscape features deserve protection in law. That was a key recommendation of the 1998 report by the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs. The Government's response to that report stated that we would consider legislative protection for field boundaries in the light of up-to-date information from the Countryside Survey 2000. The results will be available at the end of the year. Although it is too late to include anything on the matter in the Bill, I assure hon. Members that we shall return to it.
<P>
I have also noted the comment of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) about the height of walls. We shall reflect on that as well.
<P>
In the meantime, incentive schemes such as Countryside Stewardship and Tir Gofal in Wales have a key role in encouraging active management of landscape features in order to secure their long-term well being and retention. The major switch in farm spending from production aid to support for the broader rural economy announced by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 7 December means that over the next seven years around £500 million will be available for the Countryside Stewardship scheme. The extra funding will more than double the number of agreements offered in each of the next seven years. We estimate that that means that there will be an extra 18,000 agreements on top of the present 10,000. Funding for Tir Gofal has also been significantly increased in the current financial year.
<P>
Some safeguards for field boundaries and landscape features are already in place. We need to evaluate the latest data on their condition before we make any final decisions on further Government action.
<P>
The intention of new clause 23 is to protect hedges that are considered significant locally, but do not meet the statutory criteria of importance. It would also extend protection to features known locally as hedges, but which lack the shrubby element—which is what it says here—necessary to be qualify as hedgerows under the Hedgerows Regulations 1997. The Department is well aware of these concerns. They have been raised and, indeed, addressed by the group that considered improving the hedgerows regulations.
<P>
The group suggested a way by which locally significant hedges might be covered by the revised hedgerows regulations rather than by altering primary legislation in the Environment Act 1995. They proposed that a list of such hedges should be included in the regulations as a separate schedule. If a hedge appeared on the list, it would be considered important and therefore qualified for protection.
<P>
The Countryside Agency has carried out research into the feasibility of the idea and has prepared an initial list of locally significant hedges in England. The Countryside Council for Wales has undertaken an initial survey of local authorities and others to collect the same data. It appears that the aim of the new clause can be achieved through revisions to the, hedgerow regulations. I shall examine the proposals closely in the context of the revision of the regulations, which will be completed shortly. We hope to publish revised draft hedgerow regulations for statutory consultation in the summer. Revisions to hedgerow regulations in Wales are a matter for the Welsh Assembly.
<P>
We will also investigate what scope there is for using the regulations to extend protection to Cornish hedge-banks. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) considers them important and has raised the issue previously. It may be possible to include other features known locally as hedges under the forthcoming Regulatory Reform Bill.
<P>
New clause 23 also seeks to extend the legislation so that the—here is that word, again—non-shrubby elements of a hedge are protected. However, the existing legislation does not need to be changed to achieve that. Current guidance on the hedgerows regulations already makes it clear that any tree growing in a hedgerow is covered by the regulations. Equally, protection exists under the regulations for banks and stone walls with a hedgerow growing along the top, as removal of the bank or wall would destroy the hedgerow. I therefore ask that the new clause be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for what the Minister said about hedgerows. If action is possible under the existing regulations, that might be more flexible. I wait with interest to find out what the agencies come up with. I am not sure why the Minister introduced the concept of shrubby or non-shrubby elements, which is not in the new clause. However, I appreciated his remark about Cornish hedge-banks and was intrigued that he did not carry on to deal with more of the west of the country, and mention their Welsh equivalent, called cloddiau. I hope that I pronounced that right, though in the absence of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) I cannot be sure. I have not had to speak Welsh since I was nine.
<P>
I am interested to learn, with respect to new clause 22, that the survey will report in the next few months. The Minister appeared to be, by the standards of ministerial statements in Standing Committees, reasonably positive about the prospect of action subsequently. I am grateful and, while not exactly holding my breath, look forward to finding out what the Minister will come up with. In view of those points, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The Committee has often heard that unreasonable people are found in all sectors of society, not just in English Nature, and in general the Bill will rightly establish sensible arrangements for reasonable people, while providing last-resort measures to deal with those who are unreasonable. However, with respect to the destruction or stopping-up of means of access, no effective last-resort measures have been included. The new clause would provide one.
<P>
The only provision under the Bill for dealing with an owner or occupier who deliberately and systematically destroys or stops up all the means of access to an area of access land is that the access authority may—not must—take action under clause 35 to do the necessary work to open some or all the means of access. However, before the access authority can do that it must follow the procedures set out in clauses 33 and 34, to satisfy itself that it is unable to make an agreement with the landowner. That is not a satisfactory mechanism for dealing with unreasonable owners or occupiers who set out to frustrate the purpose of the Bill by destroying all the means of access in an area. I wonder how many access authorities would be willing to exercise their powers under clause 35. Even those that were willing would take some time to reach the point at which they were in a position to act.
<P>
New clause 24 would make it an offence to destroy, without reasonable excuse, an existing means of access where there was no alternative means of access nearby. That should not give reasonable landowners any difficulty. An offence would have been committed only if the action had been taken without reasonable excuse and if there was no alternative access within 1 km. It would not be an offence occasionally to stop up a means of access for valid land-management reasons, nor to stop up one or more means of access in an area with many, to influence the way in which people gained access. Only systematic and deliberate stopping-up that left users with no reasonable alternative access would be an offence. I hope that the Minister will appreciate the wisdom of the new clause.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley on her contribution. We thought long and hard about her relevant point, but we do not envisage that the problem of landowners blocking a means of access will be widespread. Many areas of land that are subject to the new right will be accessible by existing rights of way. Landowners and managers will need to gain access to the land. Most people who manage the land will understand the benefits of ensuring that it is easy to gain access and that simple actions, such as leaving a gap in a wall or a gate unlocked, will help to manage that access. I expect that the vast majority of walkers prefer to be guided towards a suitable point of entry if one is available. Similarly, I have little doubt that the great majority of landowners prefer walkers to use gates or stiles. It will not be in their interests deliberately to prevent such access. However, as that will not always be the case, chapter III provides access authorities with powers, as my hon. Friend said, to erect and maintain means of access to deal with such problems. If a landowner decides to block or stop-up obvious points of entry, users can climb gates or fences provided that they cause no damage, which we discussed earlier in our proceedings.
<P>
We appreciate that landowners might want to close a means of access for land management reasons—for example, to close a gap in a hedge through which livestock are escaping—but we expect another means of access to be within easy walking distance. If that is not the case, landowners should make an effort to provide an alternative means of access. They might want to consult the access authority for approval to erect a new gate or stile.
<P>
However, to return to my hon. Friend's point, we recognise that in rare cases a means of access will need to be closed for land management reasons when no alternative access is readily available. A landowner or farmer should not face the threat of committing a criminal offence in such circumstances, which is the implication of the new clause. It is also possible that reasonable alternative access will depend on the actions of another landowner. That would also not be a suitable basis for the imposition of a criminal offence.
<P>
So, I agree with my hon. Friend there is a problem, but we believe that it can be approached in three ways. First, it is unlikely to arise because it is in the general interests of landowners to provide a means of access. Secondly, if there is a problem, the access authorities can require a means of access to be made available by using the powers in chapter III. Thirdly, if they fail to act or until they act, users can climb gates or fences provided that they cause no damage. That is not a wholly satisfactory way of resolving the problem but, on balance, it is the best conclusion. The alternative—to criminalise the offence—would impose a disproportionate regulatory burden. I listened carefully to my hon. Friend and I hope that she will be persuaded by my arguments that sufficient provisions are already included in the Bill to meet her requirements. On that basis, I hope that she will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister for explaining how the Bill will operate in relation to persistent offenders. Given his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<H4><center>DEFINITION OF LEGALLY RELEVANT OBJECTION</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. In the 1981 Act, in paragraph 13(2) of Schedule 15, after the definition of ``council offices'' there is inserted—
<P>
`` `duly made' means an objection or a representation which is—
<P>
(a) made within the time and in the manner prescribed in the notice that was published by the authority on making the order in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Schedule; and
<P>
(b) which states the grounds on which it is made, being a matter which is capable of affecting the decision whether or not to confirm the order.''.'.—[Mr. David Heath.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
New clause 26 deals with an important area of definition and clarification, for which the Bill might serve as a useful vehicle. Unusually, in a matter relating to rights of way—usually a matter of bitter contention between different interests, one of which might be said to benefit while another is disadvantaged by a particular proposal—it is to the benefit of all concerned that we should introduce clarity into the provisions and should not extend unnecessarily the stages or process of making decisions about the definitive map if that can be avoided.
<P>
The current difficulty is that the areas that can properly be considered by an inspector in dealing with a definitive map order are closely constrained by previous legislation. There is not the flexibility in reaching decisions that many members of the public feel that there should be. Indeed, the planning inspectorate's booklet ``Definitive map orders'', gives clear advice on the points that a Secretary of State or inspector should take into account in deciding orders under the 1981 Act. Section 5 of the booklet says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only things to consider are whether or not the path exists and, if it does, its route and status. Questions such as the effects of its use on nearby properties are not relevant. Authorities have other powers to deal with problems of this kind.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In making a decision, the inspector only considers the facts of the route based on the evidence presented. He or she does not consider what the council or anyone else would like the situation to be. Section 53 cannot be used to change the definitive map and statement to show only the paths which people would like to have.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement gives clear guidance on the matters that should be taken into account. The difficulty is that whenever an addition to the definitive map is disputed, those matters are not raised as objections. A variety of objections are put forward, most of which are, sadly, spurious. It is suggested that the way is no longer needed or that it is unsuitable for the use in question, or that, by encouraging such use, confirmation of the order will lead to conflict. It is suggested that use of the way would be detrimental to farming or other land use or would give rise to security concerns, or it is suggested that the real need is for additional rights beyond those recognised in the modification order.
<P>
I described those objections as spurious because they are spurious within the sharply defined terms of the legislation, but they are not spurious to the people who raise them. Those people have real concerns, which they feel forced to put before the authority. However, the surveying authority does not have discretion. If an objection is raised, unless the authority can secure its withdrawal, it must forward both the order and the objection to the Secretary of State for a determination—but the Secretary of State does not have the option of deciding that the objection is spurious. The Department has no option but to proceed to determine the order and, where necessary, to hold a local inquiry. The result is that local inquiries are held and people raise objections that cannot properly be considered and cannot form the basis of a decision by the planning inspectorate. That might mean that the entire local inquiry is otiose, or that it may unnecessarily extend the proceedings of an inquiry.
<P>
I know how difficult it is. The Committee knows that I served on a county council for many years, and often sat on the rights of way sub-committee. It was difficult not only for members of the public giving evidence to the committee but for the committee itself to understand that it was a quasi-judicial hearing, and that its decisions would be based on evidence alone. It did not have the discretion to make a political decision about whether a path should exist.
<P>
Clarity is greatly to the benefit of all, because it avoids unnecessary cost, delay and uncertainty. The new clause simply adds a little clarity. It would allow the authority to say that objections were not proper matters to be considered and that they therefore did not have to be forwarded to the Secretary of State for determination. It would not prevent the authority having the discretion to make that decision, and the decision would still have to be reached properly, but there would not be the automaticity that now takes so much time and effort.
<P>
I hope that the new clause is not contentious. The question is simply whether the Minister for the Environment agrees that it would help the process or whether he can find an alternative way of achieving that aim. I suspect that he cannot.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I find it difficult to respond to the new clause, which is highly technical. However, we shall certainly consider the point. Giving the authority the discretion to consider objections or representations but not automatically having to refer them to the Secretary of State seems a sensible objective.
<P>
Although I am sympathetic to the objective of the new clause, which I assume to be to ensure that only relevant objections make an order an opposed order requiring referral to the Secretary of State for confirmation, I am advised that it might jeopardise accurate modification orders.
<P>
I am told that the new clause is a response to the Lasham Parish case—I doubt whether the Committee will know the details of that case—in which it was decided that an objection was duly made if it was made within the time and manner specified by notice of the making of a modification order. The case established that a duly made objection did not need to specify legally relevant objections. In other words, if legally irrelevant objections were made to an order, they would still be duly made. I agree that that is nonsense, and that we should deal with it.
<P>
I am advised also that the new clause could have some undesirable results. An objector who was ignorant of the law but genuinely wished to challenge the status of the way would be prevented from pursuing his objection merely because he had advanced legally irrelevant grounds within due time. Furthermore, I am not sure that it is best for the objector, whose objection had been rejected as legally irrelevant by a surveying authority, to pursue the matter by way of statutory review. I believe that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me—that a legally irrelevant objection is better dealt with by attempting to have that objection withdrawn and reminding the objector of the possibility of costs being awarded against him. I hope, therefore that he will withdraw the amendment. The matter requires addressing and we shall examine it again. The issue involves many legal technicalities and we shall attempt to find an effective and legally water-tight solution.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his approach to the new clause. If someone proposes legally irrelevant grounds for an objection, it would not be helpful to allow the objection to go to the Secretary of State or to a local inquiry for determination. That would only raise false hopes for a successful conclusion. The objector could not obtain satisfaction because the inspector or the Secretary of State would not be able to take the objection into account because it was legally irrelevant. It would be preferable for the objection to be knocked on the head at the earliest opportunity. The hon. Gentleman agreed with me that it is absurd that a local authority has to forward an objection which is legally irrelevant. That is the position under the law at present and it should be addressed.
<P>
I am not sure whether the Minister's advice proves that the new clause fails to deal with the problem. Some of the arguments that he presented were slightly lacking in substance. However, he has promised to examine the issue again and, if necessary, table a Government amendment to resolve the problem at a later stage. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is the last new clause to be considered. It is substantial, however it would achieve a simple objective and is not as complex as it may seem at first.
<P>
The intention of the new clause is to deal with the removal of stiles and other objects that impede the use of the countryside by individuals with mobility problems. It extends the provisions in clause 60, which fails to deal with all cases. The Government have accepted the need to encourage highway authorities to promote the principle of allowing passage for disabled people at places where rights of way cross obstacles. That is within the Bill. That principle was also raised in the consultation paper. When the paper went out to consultation, the proposal—I believe that it was number 18—was supported by 76 per cent. of respondents. Therefore, it is a popular proposal that the Government could have adopted. The cost of full implementation was estimated at £28,000 per annum per authority, or £1.7 million across the country. The principle affects not only people with disabilities, but parents with a pushchair and even people walking dogs.
<P>
The fact that no provision was made for dealing with existing obstructions caused disappointment, particularly among ramblers. Clause 60 applies to new applications for new stiles and gates. It does not give authorities the scope to examine their existing networks and decide whether there is an opportunity for increasing access for disabled people. Of course, they can do so, but questions have to be asked about whether they need additional statutory powers, especially in respect of changes made in co-operation with the landowner, as authorities can provide kits to transform stiles and to make them more easily accessible. There is also the question whether authorities have power to pay for changes, apart from the 25 per cent. that they are obliged to pay towards maintenance costs, and whether or not such a change is ultra vires.
<P>
If the Government are genuine about the need to promote and develop the rights of way network, they should introduce a provision along the lines of the new clause. Such a provision would be to the advantage of landowners as well as visitors, as they often want improvements to their land that they cannot afford to make.
<P>
One of the counter-arguments to the new clause is that obstructions are often in place for livestock control purposes. That is true, and we do not want to prevent land users from properly managing the land. That is why the notification and consultation process is necessary, to ensure that such matters are taken into account in discussion with owners and other organisations such as the local access forums. That process means that a local authority can produce a genuine improvement plan for its rights of way network and provide for disabled people and people who otherwise have difficulties with stiles and gates in the same way as it would cater for able-bodied persons. The new clause is consistent with Government policy and with aims expressed elsewhere in the Bill, to which it would be a worthwhile addition. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am, of course, sympathetic to the motives behind the clause. As I have said on several occasions, we are keen to promote access to the countryside for disabled people. Clause 53, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, requires local highway authorities to take a proactive approach to meeting the needs of disabled people in drawing up their rights of way improvement plans. Clause 60 gives effect to the proposal set out in our consultation paper by ensuring that local highway authorities are required to do more to make it easier for disabled people to use rights of way. It requires authorities to take account of the needs of disabled people in authorising the erection of stiles or gates on footpaths or bridleways.
<P>
I appreciate the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, which is that the provisions are fine, however they concern the future and do not address existing problems. I recognise that stiles and gates can present particular difficulties to disabled people. However, the question, as has repeatedly been the case during our deliberations, is whether the proposed solution is right or disproportionate. We must ask whether the new clause, which contains a power of direction and default powers, and thus an element of compulsion for landowners, is necessarily the best way of dealing with the problem. An alternative option would be to give local highway authorities power to contribute to the cost of replacing a stile with an alternative means of stock control that is more suitable for use by disabled people. Another possible option is a special grant fund that is operated by the Countryside Agency. Either of those alternatives might be a more effective way of approaching the issue than a mandatory system that necessarily involves lengthy procedures and safeguards for the landowner.
<P>
I recognise that the hon. Gentleman has given a good deal of thought to the matter and I should like time to consider more carefully whether a legislative approach is the best way forward and, if so, what form it should take. We might make proposals at a later stage during the Bill's passage, but I am not giving a commitment today. We want the best solution to problems affecting disabled people. We shall consider the matter seriously and, if we think it right, present further proposals. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has approached the subject with his usual courtesy and in the constructive way in which he has approached the entire Bill. I am grateful for that. The matter is important and I do not pretend that the mechanism set out in the new clause is the only way to reach the desired objectives. Indeed, there are clearly arguments against compulsion. However, serious questions arise about local authority aid for the relevant purposes being ultra vires. I hope that that will be cleared up before the Bill is passed. If, as an alternative, a fund could be set up to establish conversion, where appropriate, that would be all to the good. The matter should come within the rights of way improvement plans and if it is a lacuna in the present arrangements it should be filled.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman has assured me that he will consider the matter carefully and try to find ways to achieve what I am sure is an objective that we share, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is a matter of regret that no sooner had we welcomed you to the Committee, Mr. Gale, but we were bidding you goodbye. It may have had something to do with the briskness with which you chaired the proceedings, which we appreciated. All hon. Members of the Committee would agree that we have been fortunate with our Chairmen, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Malins. I remember Mr. Malins particularly for his assistance in telling me exactly the moment at which to move formally, nod or shout Aye. If he had double crossed me and presented me with a ring of Opposition amendments we should have had a different Bill.
<P>
I approached the Committee proceedings with some apprehension, but as things warmed up I began to feel more relaxed. Towards the end I was positively enjoying myself. I imagine that on Thursday I shall bound out of bed ready for my injection of Committee proceedings only to be disappointed. I am grateful to all members of the Committee, not least to the Opposition. I pay tribute to those on the Opposition Front Bench, who dealt with the Bill extremely well. They never filibustered and allocated time tightly and well, concentrating on the key points. If part of their job is to keep the Minister on his toe, I assure them that they succeeded well.
<P>
There were several contenders for the post of most colourful member of the Committee, but the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex wins every time. He gave us humour even in our darkest moments. I learned from him. I had always regarded English Nature as a group of honourable men and women and had not realised until I came to Committee that it was a pettifogging, Pecksniffian, teeny-bopping set of bureaucrats who should be chased from the face of the earth. I also learned about snipe. I confess that I have never eaten snipe but I was promised after a sitting that I would be treated to it. I look forward to that, although I realise that we are here for conservation purposes rather than any other.
<P>
I also say thank you to my Back Benchers. Being on the Back Benches during a Committee on a Government Bill is not always especially enjoyable. They had the skill of being neither silent nor loquacious and have moved a string of amendments that will improve the Bill. I remember hearing someone say when I was first elected to this place that the line between loyalty and obsequiousness was narrow. I can say only that they have trodden it extremely well.
<P>
In thanking you again, Mr. Gale, I note that the Bill is important and, perhaps, historic. I would like to pay tribute to everyone who has contributed.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On behalf of the Opposition, I add my thanks to you, Mr. Gale, for your small but perfectly formed contribution in the Chair and, through you, to the others who have done stints in the Chair. I thank the Clerk, Hansard, the Attendants and the other officials who have served the Committee so well. I also thank the Ministers for their unfailing courtesy and ability to take seriously serious amendments and other attempts to improve the Bill. The Bill is important, as we have maintained consistently, and we have sought to improve it.
<P>
I am not entirely sure what the Opposition equivalent of the thin line between loyalty and obsequiousness. It is presumably—
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Silence is rarely welcome in opposition. I think the equivalent is a sense of timing—knowing when and for how long to speak.
<P>
I share the Minister's warm views of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex. I am not sure that the word ``colourful'' does him justice; the word ``inimitable'' is probably a better description. As the hon. Gentleman has observed, we are seeking to train the next generation of MPs to follow in his footsteps.
<P>
We have made small improvements to the Bill and will seek more and larger improvement at later stages. I am grateful to Ministers and Government Back Benchers for the way in which the Committee has been conducted. The spirit has almost always been good. I join the Minister in thanking you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I also thank you, Mr. Gale, and your colleagues for your contribution in the Chair. We have had biodiversity in the Chair, which has been all to our good. I share the general view. The Committee has been conducted in extremely good humour and has focused itself well on the task of improving the Bill. I am grateful to the Minister and the Under-Secretary for the way in which they have approached the amendments tabled by the Opposition parties. To be honest, I have been pleasantly surprised both by the scope of the amendments tabled by Government and Opposition Members and by the way in which the Government have responded when good points have been made. They have been prepared to listen to arguments. Arguments and the Government's agreement or partial agreement to them never match the effect on Report. The Bill lies largely unamended in several areas but we look forward to considering what I suspect will be compendious amendments.
<P>
The Minister was overtaken by a fit of candour earlier when he said that the Bill was a mess in some respects. It is slightly less of a mess now and I have every confidence that it will be anything but a mess by the time that it has finished its proceedings. It will be much more satisfactory.
<P>
In his reply to a point that I made, the Under-Secretary said that the difficulty might have been in dealing with the timetable for the amendments and with finding parliamentary time. My slight warning is that time will have to be found in the Lords, if it is not found elsewhere, in which to table substantial amendments on significant issues. Members of another place will have much to say on many aspects of the Bill.
<P>
We have stuck to our task and have considered balance, clarity and adequacy. The Bill has been improved in terms of its balance and there is the potential, especially with future amendments, to improve its clarity. Whether it is adequate to the task will depend on what we hear on a later stage and on the resources that the Government are prepared to attach. Having said that, the Bill is good and I wish it well in its future progress.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In responding, I assure the Committee that I will convey right hon. and hon. Members' kind comments to both of my colleagues on the Chairman's Panel who conducted the greater part of the business. On behalf of the Committee, my fellow Chairmen and myself, I thank the Officers of the House—the Clerk and Hansard—who have facilitated the proceedings.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
