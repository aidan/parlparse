<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>

<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/096/1997096.htm">Police (Northern Ireland) Bill</A></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): On a point of order, Mr. Jones.
<P>
I do not wish to delay the Committee or embarrass the Minister, but merely to gain some 
information on my own account. During the debate on clause 25 in our previous sitting, I raised the 
issue of the exception in clause 25(8) relating to subsections (2) (j), (2) (k) and (2) (l). I asked the 
Minister to tell us whether that was a deviation from normal practice in that police associations, the 
Police Federation, superintendents and the Association of Chief Police Officers were to be debarred 
with regard to regulations on pensions and gratuities.
<P>
I cited current examples, and maybe the Minister considers those to be sub judice. However, I 
should like him to make clear whether a process is being worked into the Bill that will prevent police 
associations from interfacing with the Secretary of State about regulations on pensions and gratuities.
<P>
The Minister also alluded to the police negotiating body. Is something being cleverly worked 
into the Bill to force the hand of the federation and others in respect of that body? I do not wish to 
return to that debate, but I want to place it on the record that I have raised the point and that I remain 
dissatisfied.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not yet have the Hansard report of those proceedings, nor was I present for 
that sitting. The hon. Gentleman’s point is not a matter for the Chair, but I am sure that the Minister 
has heard what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> Further to that point of 
order, Mr. Jones. We do not have the relevant Hansard so it is impossible to examine the issue in 
detail. However, I assure the Committee that I believed that I had dealt with it in my response. If 
doubts remain, I shall write to hon. Members clarifying the points raised by the hon. Member for 
Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis).
<H4><center>Clause 29</center></H4>
<H4><center>Liability for wrongful acts of constables</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 16, 
line 7, after ‘(c)’ , insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘subject to the approval of the Police Authority.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 85, in page 16, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(2A) The Chief Constable shall submit to the Police Authority on such dates and in such form 
as the Police Authority may reasonably require details of all payments made under subsection 
(2).’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Similar provisions to those in my amendments are contained in section 14 of the 
Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“(2) There shall be paid by the Police Authority—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any damages or costs awarded against the Inspector General”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
now it is the Chief Constable—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“in any proceedings brought against him by virtue of this section and any costs properly 
incurred by him in any such proceedings so far as not recovered by him in the proceedings; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any sum required in connection with the settlement of any claim made against the Inspector 
General”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
again it is the Chief Constable—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“by virtue of this section, if the settlement is approved by the Police Authority.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Within minutes of arriving in Committee this morning, I received a letter from the Minister 
about clause 29 and that very point. No doubt his response will embellish that letter. He will know 
from his discussions with the Police Authority that it believes that clause 29 is one of the most 
important in the Bill. I am pleased that the minister is in dialogue with, and is listening to, the Police 
Authority, and that he is seeking a way forward.
<P>
The powers in section 88 of the Police Act 1996, which covers England and Wales, are more or 
less identical to those in the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. However, the Bill’s wording is very 
different from the existing legislation for the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, and from that for 
England and Wales. The Police Authority wrote to me saying that the removal of such powers is 
unacceptable. Amendment No. 84 would reinstate those powers, and amendment No. 85 would insert 
a new subsection granting additional powers.
<P>
It is clearly vital that civil actions against the police are carefully and meticulously scruitinsed—
public interest demands nothing less. The public also expect the lessons learned from such actions to 
be taken on board—and to be seen to be taken on board—by the Chief Constable and the Police 
Authority. The public further expect diagnosed faulty procedures, or inadequate or inappropriate 
conduct on the part of one or more members of the police service, to be dealt with.
<P>
There remains the vexed question of the system’s potential for the cover-up of wayward, 
inappropriate or unlawful police conduct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Who would carry out such a cover-up?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I presume that the Chief Constable—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The Chief Constable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Chief Constable or senior officers might have the power to make compensatory 
payments out of court. These situations may not have arisen yet, but we must ensure there are no legal 
loopholes in the future.
<P>
Why else would the Police Authority be so exercised about the matter? Does it feel that in the 
past things have been done—the Minister is smiling; he ought to know more than I do as he is in 
charge of the police service in Northern Ireland. If the Minister were to investigate he would find 
historical instances where the Police Authority was made to feel uncomfortable. There may not have 
been any criminal intent or wrongdoing, but because the Police Authority was not consulted on 
decisions, it bore the opprobrium of the community when details leaked out. That raises the question 
of transparency and letting the Police Authority take up the consultative power enjoyed by its 
equivalents in England and Wales.
<P>
We were talking about cover-ups, which would apply to stories that may hit the media and 
embarrass the police service, the RUC, the Northern Ireland Office, and ultimately, the Minister and 
the Secretary of State. Compensation may be paid to buy people off. We should anticipate that 
possibility and frame legislation that closes loopholes in the law.
<P>
I do not imply that the present Chief Constable, for whom I have the highest admiration, would 
ever get into such a situation, nor do I have evidence that previous Chief Constables get into 
difficulties. Public accountability is at the heart of the Police Authority’s duties and responsibilities, 
and transparency would reassure the public about the handling of these matters.
<P>
Similar problems have doubtless arisen in England and Wales, and probably in the Metropolitan 
police. Concealment of police wrongdoing, on whatever scale, by compensation is not in the public 
interest, especially when payment is made in secret and grievances against the police are not carried 
forward by the complainant. I am sure the Minister agrees with that. Section 14(3) of the Police Act 
(Northern Ireland) (1970) allows the Chief Constable to pay out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“any sum required in connection with the settlement of any claim that has or might have given 
rise to such proceedings.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase “might have given” suggests that payment is made before matters come to court. 
Current legislation gives that considerable power to the Chief Constable, and the Bill as drafted 
means that he would make that decision. He may well make the right decision based upon the 
evidence, but that does not mean that there has not been corruption at lower levels—perhaps at senior 
officer level—in the police service. If the evidence with which he must make the judgment is wrong, 
the Chief Constable would be highly embarrassed.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
All we ask is that the Police Authority is given back the powers that it enjoyed under the 1970 
Act, and is also given the powers of police authorities in England and Wales.
<P>
Amendment No. 85 would protect the Police Authority for Northern Ireland from accusations 
that it colluded with actual or alleged wrongdoing by the police. Rumours are rife in Northern Ireland, 
and rumours and allegations of wrongdoing hit the media and cause difficulties. The Police Authority 
must be able to stand back from bad publicity surrounding allegations. Amendment No. 85 would 
ensure that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Chief Constable shall submit to the Police Authority on such dates and in such forms that the 
Police Authority may reasonably require details of all payments made under subsection (2).”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 are reasonable, and would replace powers and responsibilities that 
seem to have been taken from the Police Authority. The Police Authority is perplexed as to why that 
has happened, and has had no explanation why the powers were removed. I am glad to hear that the 
Minister is talking to the Police Authority. I await to find out his progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. 
Moss) is important, because I am alarmed at the erosion of Police Authority responsibility. The Bill 
means that  the role of the Police Authority will be so neutered as to become almost irrelevant.
<P>
Under the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 the Inspector General deferred to the Police 
Authority when money was needed to take action against a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. 
The Chief Constable is likely to come under increasing pressure. In addition to his operational 
responsibilities, the Department is adding to his agenda responsibility for all the RUC’s resources. He 
must oversee an enormous agenda of work. I doubt whether, if he comes under pressure, he will have 
the time or resources to examine carefully the case being brought against a policeman or group of 
policemen. In the past the Police Authority could consider such matters in detail before deciding 
whether to fund the defence of a policeman. However, it would be easy for a Chief Constable under 
constant pressure to say, “Out of my budget of £600 million, £5,000 will not be terribly important.” 
The clause does not provide the lines of accountability that are required in the interests of society in 
Northern Ireland.
<P>
It is difficult for a minority party to attempt to amend one of the official Opposition’s 
amendments, but any amendment tabled by me would have inserted the phrase.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“subject to the approval of the Police Authority”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at the beginning of the clause. To include it elsewhere in the clause is well and good, but 
inadequate. The Chief Constable should in all things be accountable  ultimatley to the Police 
Authority. That would provide protection for the Chief Constable, the RUC, society and the Secretary 
of State, who will be perceived, on the basis of the Bill, as the puppet master pulling the strings of the 
Chief Constable in many contexts.
<P>
I support the amendment—perhaps with even more conviction than its mover. 
[Interruption.] It is called damning with faint praise; that is right. My remarks have been in the 
spirit of what I have said again and again. I reiterate my views because the Minister has until Report 
to make considerable amends. The Police Authority’s power is being eroded, and that of the Secretary 
of State enhanced. Meanwhile, the power and authority of the Chief Constable is being enhanced, but 
in a way that will allow him to be dominated by the Secretary of State. Protection must be available 
for everyone, in each of the strata that I have identified, from the Secretary of State down to the 
lowliest member of society. There must be protection and accountability. The amendment is justified 
for those reasons.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Ingram.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran </B>(Beverly and Hoderness) rose—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Cran.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It was kind of you to call me, Mr. Jones. I thought that you were going to punish me 
for something that I had done in the past.
<P>
I am also anxious about what the Government plan to do. Conservative Members will listen 
excessively carefully to the Minister’s response. He is aware of the concerns that have been articulated 
by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for Fermanagh 
and South Tyrone.
<P>
I want to get the situation clear in my mind. I am sure that if I am wrong, the Minister will put 
me right. Clause 29(1) provides that the Chief Constable shall be liable for any torts committed by his 
constables, as if he were an employer within an employee-employer relationship. However, he is not 
the employer—not as I understand it.
<P>
In subsection (2), the Chief Constable is further provided with the power to pay damages and 
costs arising from civil actions and to settle civil claims. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East 
Cambridgeshire spent some time dissecting and exploring that provision. He gave his view, and that 
of the Police Authority, about why problems will occur. Subsection (3) provides the Chief Constable 
with the power to make legal representation for his officers, and so on. That is the framework against 
which we are speaking.
<P>
As other hon. Members pointed out, there is a further framework in the current legislation 
relating to policing in Northern Ireland—which is, I think, the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. 
Section 14 of the Act contains provisions similar to those in clause 29, but, crucially, provides that it 
shall be the authority that pays damages and costs, approves the settlement of civil claims and 
arranges legal representation. That is the status quo, and many of us believe that it should be retained.
<P>
Section 88 of the Police Act 1996, which, I understand, is the current legislation in England and 
Wales, contains similar provisions to those in the 1970 Act, and states that civil cases may be settled 
only with the approval of the Police Authority. If I have got that wrong, the Minister will tell me. His 
officials will jump up and down to advise him of that.
<P>
There is consternation in the community; the Police Authority is not happy with the Bill. The 
Minister and others may put that more eloquently than me. I shall quote from a brief that the authority 
has sent me, but first I want to anticipate the Minister’s distress—he has been upset with me in the 
past, and he will probably be upset again—and tell him that if he wants me to produce the document 
in toto, I shall do so. Nothing at all will be hidden. I hope that that will assuage the Minister’s anger.
<P>
The document contains the Police Authority’s views about the Government’s plans. The wording 
is interesting. The document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The authority considers this unacceptable”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Hesford </B>(Wirral, West): As someone who is relatively new to these proceedings, but 
who listens to them with care, may I ask whether the statement which the hon. Gentleman is about to 
read is the considered view of Conservative spokesmen? Or is it some academic exercise, similar to 
the many that I have listened to, in which Conservative Members read from a document that they 
have not considered, just for performance reasons?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> He will go far.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am absolutely delighted to have given way to that intervention, because it comforts 
me to know that Labour Members are listening to the debate.  If anyone else had said that, I would not 
have believed it. Many people would not believe it.
<P>
I shall not dwell on the matter for too long, in case you rule me out of order, Mr. Jones. Labour 
Members are beginning to snap. Our previous sitting lasted until 1.30 am, and they cannot take the 
pressure. I shall have to set up a seminar on the organisation of Committees for Labour Members. We 
are responsible for articulating the concerns of bodies that know a lot about the subject that we are 
considering. I presume to say that the Police Authority knows more than the hon. Gentleman about 
current legislation on the administration of the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I have not finished.
<P>
It would be appalling if a responsible Opposition did not listen carefully to the Police Authority’s 
views on the clause. Before the hon. Gentleman gets excited again, I want to finish the quote that got 
up his nostrils.
<P>
The Police Authority said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The authority considers this unacceptable and is resolutely of the view that the words ‘if the 
settlement is approved by the Police Authority’ should be reinserted in subsection (2)(c).”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
“Resolutely” is not a word that the Police Authority uses lightly. The Police Authority has made 
a strong statement. Therefore a responsible Opposition have to ask the Government to justify their 
change to the status quo.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> I would like an answer to my question. Have Her Majesty’s Opposition considered 
those matters carefully, and is it their view that the points are worthy of further consideration? Do the 
amendments reflect the views of those on the Opposition Front Bench?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I could get rattled. But I shall not, because we are considering a serious matter, and I 
like to be cool, calm and collected—the opposite of Labour Members. The hon. Gentleman simply did 
not listen. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, the hon. Member for 
Fermanagh and South Tyrone and I support the status quo—until the Government justify the change. 
We shall then consider the Government’s response and decide whether we can agree with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful—[Interruption.] He is not listening. He said that he was listening, 
but he is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Jones. Is it in order to wave across the Room and say 
“he”? Who is “he”?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> All right hon. and hon. Members address the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I would address the Chair as “you”.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> This is an intervention by my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Yes.
<P>
Section 88(2)(b) of the Police Act 1996, which was passed under the previous Government, says 
that no moneys shall be paid by a chief officer unless the settlement is approved by the Police 
Authority. That is exactly what we are saying. We put the legislation on the statute book when we 
were in government; we are now saying that those words should be reintroduced into Northern Ireland 
legislation. The hon. Gentleman’s intervention was thus utterly irrevelant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am not sure that the intervention by the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. 
Hesford) asked me anything, but I shall assume that he was asking me whether I agreed with his 
interpretation. To finish the spat, the hon. Gentleman is rather thin-skinned, but he will get over it 
after a few years in this place. This could have been a short; I could have got all I wanted to say off 
my chest in about six minutes, but Labour Members have prevented me from doing so.
<P>
Let us return to the amendment, which is reasonable. If the thin-skinned hon. Gentleman had 
been willing to wait, he would have heard those words, which would have answered his question. The 
amendment is entirely reasonable. The climate in Northern Ireland is different from that in the rest of 
the United Kingdom. However, the climate of opinion is such as to demand transparency in 
arrangements. The details should not be made public, for obvious reasons, but the public expects 
constitutional checks and balances.
<P>
I shall not go in detail into the American constitution, but its checks and balances are important. 
There are also checks and balances in some systems in this country. If the hon. Member for Wirral, 
West had been patient he would have heard me say that the checks and balances have been removed 
by the Government’s decision in this regard. The public will not accept that with equanimity, and 
neither do I.
<P>
That goes to the nub of the question. I can think, of no other comparable situation in which 
checks and balances have been or would be removed. There must be an extraordinary good and 
compelling reason for that to be done, especially in the light of the Police Authority’s strong words to 
the effect that the provision is “unacceptable” and that the authority is “resolutely of the view” that the 
status quo ante must be restored.
<P>
I listened carefully to the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East 
Cambridgeshire, in which he spoke about the potential for cover-up. [Interruption.] If the 
Minister will listen, he will hear that although he asked us who and what, we feel that it is the 
perception that matters. As my various hon. Friends have said already, we are dealing with a divided 
community. In that context, as my hon. Friend said, rumours abound and take over, even though they 
may be based on no fact whatever. My hon. Friend made it clear that he had full confidence in the 
Chief Constable, as do the rest of the Opposition. We have had full confidence in previous Chief 
Constables, but the direction in which the Government are going exposes the Chief Constable to 
allegations. We consider that unfortunate: he ought not to be exposed in such a way. After all, the 
Police Authority is peopled with extremely responsible individuals who are charged with an onerous 
duty. They would not be chosen were they not of the highest probity. Unless there are compelling 
reasons for removing this power—no doubt the Minister will reveal them if there are—dong so is, in a 
way, casting a slur on the Police Authority. I concede that the Minister may have something to tell us, 
but, in the absence of that, removing the power could be construed as lack of confidence in that body. 
We are completely perplexed by what the Minister is doing.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman who spoke, whose constituency I cannot remember—

<P>

<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> Wirral, West.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> appears to be deep in his constituency work, or he may even be reading the Bill—
which would be something of a revelation. The Police Authority is also perplexed by what the 
Government are doing. The Opposition regard the authority as a body of some substance and, if it is 
worried, that adds to our worry. I shall leave it there, because we want to hear from the Minister. We 
shall listen with pens in hand, taking down what he says, and we may wish to respond. Of course the 
Official Report will tell us all in detail, and it is always 100 per cent. accurate, but we shall want to 
respond immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> During our late sitting on Tuesday, I received information about the tragic incident 
at Poyntzpass. I am sure that all members of the Committee will share my horror, revulsion and 
condemnation of the brutal murder of two innocent members of the public and the injuring of two 
others. The evil people who carry out such acts for nakedly malign reasons stand condemned by the 
vast majority of the citizens of Northern Ireland. I feel that it is right for me to express those 
sentiments on behalf of members of the Committee.
<P>
I will give a brief assessment of the way in which the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness 
(Mr. Cran) presented his case. Once again he has tried to stoke the fires of division among the 
Government, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. In reality, there is no such division. A 
good working relationship exists between the three elements of the tripartite structure, and the 
authority is on record as welcoming the broad thrust of the Bill.
<P>
As regards amendment No. 84, I am fully aware that the Police Authority has serious concerns 
about clause 29. It believes that the clause should be identical with the legislation for England and 
Wales. However, as hon. Members know, financing for policing in Northern Ireland is not the same 
as that for England and Wales, and the legislation will have to take account of the differences. I have 
written to all members of the Committee setting out what I propose to say in Committee. I realise that 
they received that letter only this morning. I apologise for its lateness, but there were good technical 
reasons for that. [Interruption.] I apologise if hon. Gentlemen have not received it, but I 
understand that it was put on the Notice Board this morning. If they check their messages every day, 
they will have picked it up.
<P>
It is the authority’s role to monitor what is happening about civil claims, and especially to 
consider how the public interest can best be met. The authority should not become involved in the 
approval of the payment of settlements, but exercise its reporting powers in an appropriate manner.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us be clear about the purpose of the sections in the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 and 
the Police Act 1996, which are equivalent to the clause. My firm legal advice is that the power on the 
statute is intended to provide an independent check on the propriety of the means by which the Chief 
Constable has reached his decision in a given case, and on the propriety of the negotiation process 
leading to the final settlement amount. In other words, the authority must ensure that the Chief 
Constable takes appropriate legal advice on whether to settle any claim against one of his officers out 
of court, follows that advice and then takes proper account of the need to conserve public funds in the 
quantum of any settlement.
<P>
The authority’s approval function should not amount to statutory second-guessing of the Chief 
Constable’s decision to settle a claim—or to fight it, as has happened in the past—in a particular case, 
nor to decide whether a liability exists; nor is it intended to have the effect of deciding that a 
particular case must be heard by a court.
<P>
The authority’s approval function is more akin to that of a court in proceedings by way of 
judicial review, ensuring that proper procedures have been used but not substituting its judgment for 
that of the relevant authority. The Police Authority recognises that, and in its document, “Listening to 
the Community—Working with the RUC”, sets out its interpretation of the legislation, which, I would 
argue, confirms what I have said. Under compensation—the issue that we are discussing—it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Chief Constable is legally liable for the actions of members of the RUC under his 
direction and control.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that there is unanimity about that statement. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Where civil claims arise as a result of police action, the Chief Constable decides whether to 
contest the action or seek an out-of-court settlement. In either case, the Police Authority is financially 
liable for legal costs incurred and any damages payable by way of compensation.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The section—remember, this is from a booklet produced by the Police Authority—continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“If the Chief Constable decides to fight a claim, the Authority provides the necessary financial 
resources to do so and pays any damages awarded by the courts. However, if the Chief Constable 
decides to settle a claim out-of-court, the Authority must satisfy itself that the correct procedures have 
been observed in reaching the decision. Separate Authority approval must then be given for the 
amount of the settlement which must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. This staged 
approval process is designed to provide an independent oversight of the settlement system by the 
Authority.”<P>

<P>
The Police Authority is saying in that document that it has an oversight of the procedures being 
applied; it does not second guess the legal advice on which the Chief Constable works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Can the Minister give us the date of that document? Presumably, it was written on the 
basis of the law as it stands, which is, of course, the 1970 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is the work of the Police Authority from July 1994 to June 1995. Of course, it was 
written to be consistent with the 1970 legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> We want that back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is what we are asking for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness and for North-East Cambridgeshire 
have missed the point. They have not understood what I am saying. I shall read the extract from the 
document again. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“if the Chief Constable decides to settle a claim out-of-court, the Authority must satisfy itself 
that the correct procedures have been observed in reaching the decision.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The procedures must be observed, not the basis on which the claim is being considered. The 
authority must satisfy itself about the procedures. That is its oversight function. 
<P>
It remains my belief that that independent check could quiet properly be exercised through codes 
of practice and financial instructions. Because the authority does not raise any of the revenue spent on 
policing in Northern ireland, propriety does not demand that it has a specific formal power in primary 
legislation to approve civil claims. That is not the same as the situation in England and Wales or in 
Scotland; and neither is it the same as the situation that the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 was 
intended to deal with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have heard that point made again and again. It is not correct. Although we have 
a different system of local government in Northern Ireland and do not have within the local rate 
element the right to levy for police expenditure, within the regional rate that is administered by the 
Department of the Environment there is a notional sum that is intended to pay for policing in 
Northern Ireland. It is a local rate contribution to policing in Northern Ireland. I do not know the 
exact figure. The Minister will obviously have it at his finger tips and can tell us. I suspect that it is 
somewhere in the region of—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to keep his interventions very 
brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not have the figure at my finger tips. But as the hon. Gentleman sat down I 
think he said that it was about £150,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, £150 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We can check that. We said that it was administered by another Government 
Department under a procedure that is substantially different from those that relate to England and 
Wales.
<P>
Under the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 the Minister of Home Affairs had his own 
representation on the Police Authority and was answerable to the Stormont Parliament for the Police 
Authority’s spending. In both those cases the authorities concerned are or, in the case of the Police 
Authority for Northern Ireland, were ultimately answerable to local electors for the stewardship of 
resources. We are now working in an entirely different environment with different procedures.
<P>
I recognise that the Police Authority has strong feelings about the issue. I have said that I am 
always prepared to listen to representations on this matter, as on others. I fully concur with the 
authority’s opinion, which has been set out by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and 
other hon. Members, that there must be independent checks on the conduct of the Chief Constable. 
That is fundamentally correct and no one can dispute it. However, the different financial 
arrangements in Northern Ireland mean that we must craft any provision in primary legislation with 
care and avoid putting in place arrangements that would contradict the clarity that the bill is intended 
to bring to the financial arrangements.
<P>
Over recent days I have been speaking to the chairman of the Police Authority. He told me that 
this is one of the fundamental issues that the Police Authority feels strongly about and I am bound to 
take full account of that. I know the arguments. We have considered them and have drafted the Bill on 
the basis of our knowledge of those arguments. However, I am prepared to consider the matter again. 
The best way in which that can be done is not through primary legislation but through separate 
financial memorandums of understanding between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. 
There is no intrusion into this matter by the Secretary of State. The red herring of the hon. Member 
for Farmanagh and South Tyrone was that somehow this was all a transfer of power to the Secretary 
of State. That is not the purpose of the clause.
<P>
If I am to move towards the intention of the amendments I would want to be satisfied that the 
working group that has been designed to look at the financial instructions and the relationship 
between the various strands of the tripartite structure—in this case between the Chief Constable and 
the Police Authority—are up and running. It is not at present. That is not because the officials for 
whom I am responsible or the Chief Constable are denying the Police Authority the opportunity to sit 
round the table to discuss these matters. It is its decision to be dilatory. If it feels so strongly about the 
matter it must come to the table so that we can start moving forward rapidly to a solution on those 
points.
<P>
Secondly, there must be a change to the relationship that makes the Chief Constable a puppet of 
the Police Authority. I have set out in a number of other debates the importance of operational 
independence of the Chief Constable. He has been impugned by implication again and again in 
Committee, on this occasion by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. His claim that the 
measure transferred power to the Secretary of State was an implied attack on the operational 
independence of the Chief Constable. I am not prepared to countenance or support that. Opposition 
Members may want to see the Chief Constable’s powers diluted and they may want to make him a 
puppet of the Police Authority, but I am not prepared to accept that.
<P>
We must get the working group up and running—responsibility for that now rests with the 
Police Authority. We must set up robust financial arrangements that will stand the test of time and 
which will not be reneged on as they were in the past when there was a memorandum of 
understanding. If we can put those procedures in place we can amend the Bill accordingly on Report. 
At this stage I am not prepared to accept the amendment. If the hon. Gentleman feels so strongly 
about it I challenge him to put it to a vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister seems to be in a “get my retaliation in first” mode this morning. He is 
working himself up into a real lather. It is not a Celtic versus Rangers match. We are just proposing a 
couple of reasonable amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Reasonable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> They are entirely reasonable and fundamental. Putting aside for one moment the fact 
that the Police Authority recognises this as the most important clause to be amended, we are seeking 
parity with England and Wales. That was promised to the Police Authority when these matters were 
being discussed, certainly in the time of the previous Government and subsequently. Part of our 
argument is that the arrangements whereby the Police Authority approves compensation payments are 
set out in the 1996 Act pertaining to England and Wales.
<P>
The Minister has failed to tell us why the Police Authority has to approve such expenditure, as in 
some ways that goes against the interests of the independent control and operational independence of 
a chief constable and should not come into the reckoning at all. He has said that checks and balances 
are needed on moneys paid out by chief constables. Since he has accepted that a principle, I fail to see 
why he is not prepared to accept the amendments, which would have that effect.
<P>
In the 1970 Act, which is what the Police Authority and the Chief Constable are working under 
until the Bill replaces it, it is quite clear that approval by the Police Authority is needed. It does not 
say that the Police Authority must approve only the procedures, but talks about overall approval. 
Section 14(2)(b) refers to the Police Authority paying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“any sum required in connection with the settlement of any claim made against the Inspector 
General by virtue of this section, if the settlement is approved by the Police Authority.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That makes it clear that it is not the procedures but the settlement itself that must be approved by 
the Police Authority.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I refer again to the Police Authority’s own description, definition and 
understanding of the legislation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“However, if the Chief Constable decides to settle a claim out-of-court, the Authority must 
satisfy itself that the correct procedures have been observed in reaching the decision”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the approval on which the payment is made. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that that is 
a proper interpretation of the law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> No, I will not. I am not a lawyer. I do not know who wrote that, but whoever it was, 
he may not be conversant with a lawyer’s interpretation of the 1970 Act. The wording of section 
88(2)(b) of the Police Act 1996 is also clearly the same in referring to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“any sum required in connection with the settlement of any claim made against the chief officer 
of police by virtue of this section, if the settlement is approved by the police authority.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those powers are enjoyed by the Police Authority under existing legislation.
<P>
The Minister said that one of the fundamental differences in Northern Ireland is the way in 
which the police service is financed. I do not accept that it is fundamentally different. The wholesale 
grant may be different in Northern Ireland, but it is still public money. It still needs to be accounted 
for and someone must take responsibility for the way in which it is disbursed.
<P>
The Minister has agreed that checks and balances are needed against actions by the Chief 
Constable. The Chief Constable is paid out of a public fund given for police purposes. In his 
aggressive mode, the Minister sought to impugn Opposition Members—and certainly me—with the 
charge that we do not trust the Chief Constable and that we wanted legislation to prevent him from 
straying into wayward territory. I reiterate that that is not the case.
<P>
The record will show that I have every faith in the current Chief Constable. I have met him on 
many occasions and he may well be the best Chief Constable that the RUC and Northern Ireland have 
ever enjoyed. I do not question his conduct or abilities: we are talking about the law, and legislation 
will be on the statute book when the present Chief Constable retires, although I hope that he will not 
do so in the near future. If legal provisions are good enough for chief constables in England and 
Wales why are they not good enough for Northern Ireland?
<P>
It is erroneous to flag up a difference in financing: it is still public money, irrespective of where 
it comes from. There used to be more of a difference than there is now, and although the system has 
changed; the means of finance is not so different now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In my earlier response I told the Hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that 
my best legal advice is that the role of the Police Authority in relation to the Chief Constable is 
effectively the same in terms of their overview of procedures. As I say, that is my best legal advice. If 
the hon. Gentleman has heard differently, he should let me know. He said that he was not a lawyer. 
Let him give me the detailed references and we will check them out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am more than happy to look into that for the Minister. However, he is trying to 
make progress with the Police Authority not by direct discussions but through so-called working 
groups, which he claims to have set up. The only problem is that they are not working; they are not 
meeting. How will progress be made if the Police Authority, for whatever reason—and the Minister 
should know better than I what that is—will not take part in the working groups?
<P>
The Minister prefaced his remarks this morning with the suggestion that the Opposition are 
attempting to create a division in the tripartite structure. That is not true. We are simply being told by 
the Police Authority that it has worries and problems that are not being attended to. The Minister 
should ask the Police Authority why it refuses to take part in the working groups. I do not know, but 
perhaps it is because it received a diktat from the Northern Ireland Office to the effect that it should 
do so. Perhaps it took umbrage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman realise how ridiculous he is becoming? He says that he 
understands the Police Authority not to be co-operating because of a diktat about being consulted. We 
are trying to consult the authority. We are not preventing consultation. Does the hon. Gentleman now 
understand what I have been saying about the best way to proceed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister may think that I seem ridiculous, but when the Police Authority tells 
him what it told me yesterday, he will feel ridiculous. The way in which the matter has been handled 
was exactly the reason that it gave me for not co-operating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It has been consulted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister must tackle the problem. It is not mine, but his, he is apparently not 
intending to consider our amendments further or prepare others for tabling on Report, but means 
instead to try to use the working groups to find a way to make progress on the matter with the Police 
Authority. However, if the Police Authority representatives do not turn up, where will that leave us? 
Will the Minister approach the question from a different angle? Will he think, independently of the 
Police Authority, about how to deal with these matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I think that we can make progress. I have tried to be helpful and I do not know why 
we are continuing the debate. I have said that I am meeting the chairman of the Police Authority and 
we are trying to find a way forward, and I have set forth how that can be done. However, if I or my 
officials cannot sit at a table with those concerned to discuss the matter, I do not intend to amend the 
Bill, as I do not see an alternative to our proposal. I am prepared to listen to reasoned arguments and 
consider possible amendments on Report, but I need to see the colour and strength of the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am delighted that the Minister has clarified the position. I hope that he meets the 
authority’s chairman, chief executive and senior officials in the near future. If he sits at a table with 
them to discuss matters face to face, which I do not think he has done for some time, some of the 
problems may disappear. I am more than happy to accept his assurances and I shall not press the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister was, uncharacteristically, pretty mischievous. I had my pencil in hand 
and took down what he said. I think that the record will show that he was incorrect when he said that 
I was “stoking the fire of division”. He went to Cranhill Senior secondary school, which was no doubt 
named after an ancestor of mine, and he is smarter than to say that. He does not like disagreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> In a moment.
<P>
The Minister wants us all to sit here and, after he has presented his views on tablets of stone, say 
“Well, that’s it them. What a wonderful oration by the Minister, who has opened our eyes.” I have 
news for the Minister. He has not had that effect at all. [Interruption.] It would be especially 
pleasing if Labour Members would listen to the argument; they cannot speak among themselves and 
listen to the argument—they are not that good. I am making a serious point and they should listen.
<P>
The Minister said that Opposition Members do not understand. He might be correct. Who 
knows? Perhaps we do not have all the facts, which is why I said, in my modest contribution—
<P>
<B>Mr Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Very Modest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It may have been, but it is more consideration than the hon. Gentleman has given to 
the Bill.
<P>
I said that Conservative Members would look closely at the Official Report to see exactly what 
the Minister said, and we shall have to do that. The problem for the Minister is not that hon. Members 
do not understand—although I do not think that that is true, but it is possible—but whether the Police 
Authority understands, or disagrees. I read out the Police Authority’s views from a document that was 
printed well after that quoted by the Minister, which was produced in—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In 1994.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister has clarified the matter; it was 1994. My document gives the Police 
Authority’s views on the Bill. If I could just get out the document—although the Minister will then 
get to his feet and launch an Exocet missile, hoping to destroy the enemy—I will remind the Minister 
what it says.
<P>
The document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Authority considers this unacceptable”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it refers to what the Minister is trying to achieve in clause 29—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“and is resolutely of the view that the words ‘if the settlement is approved by the Police 
Authority’ be reinserted at subsection 2(c).”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will have to convince the Police Authority that he is right and that it is wrong, 
because my piece of paper is probably a fairer and more correct reflection of its views than the 
Minister’s document. That described the status quo ante, whereas this document gives the authority’s 
view of what will happen in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My question will not be an Exocet missile. I will try to throw a soft ball for the hon. 
Gentleman, as his hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not answer the 
question. Has the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness taken the legal advice on these matters? I 
set out an interpretation of the 1970 Act, and the statements from the Police Authority that I read out 
were based on that. The interpretation has not changed. However, if the hon. Gentleman or the Police 
Authority have received legal advice about existing legislation, it would be helpful if he could inform 
the Committee.
<P>
<H5>11.45am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Ministers and Labour Members should exercise patience. Mr. Jones, you and I are 
Celts and so is the Minister. We should all have an enormous amount of patience. If the Minister had 
been patient, he would have been able to listen to the remarks that I was intending to make when he 
intervened. It was perfectly clear that the Police Authority did not arrive at its view on clause 29 in a 
vacuum. The Minister is slurring the authority, although no doubt unintentionally, by suggesting 
otherwise. The authority did not sit down with a clerk from the typing pool—if such things still 
exist—and ask itself what it thought of the Bill. The members of the authority are experts.
<P>
The Minster is consulting his document again. I repeat that the document refers to the status quo 
ante: that is, to the legislation currently in force, not to the Minister’s future plans. The Police 
Authority has given the matter detailed consideration. However, I omitted to ask the authority whether 
it had taken legal advice but when we leave the Committee we shall go hot-foot to get legal authority. 
The Minister cannot just stand and sweep away all our objections in the way that the Government 
have begun to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It may be helpful for members of the Committee to know that one person on the 
Police Authority is a professor of law at Queen’s university. He was brought in to examine the Bill 
and the writing of amendments, so top-level legal advice has presumably been taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend is correct, and I am grateful to him. I recall the conversation in which 
that point came up. None the less, we must go back and do a bit more homework because this point is 
extremely important. The Minister said that he knows that the Police Authority is concerned about the 
matter and that it goes to the heart of objections to this part of the Bill. We must do what the 
Government must do—have a more open mind about it.
<P>
The Government do not like disagreements, which worries me. Anyone who expresses a 
different opinion or has a different interpretation from theirs is merely swept aside as irrelevant. I 
caution the Minister against doing that and ask him, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East 
Cambridgeshire did, to go back to the Police Authority with an open mind and talk this matter 
through.
<P>
I welcome the Minister’s promise to reconsider. I hope that he will do that after any meetings he 
may have with the Police Authority. If he does not have those meetings, what he has said this 
morning will not have been much of a concession. It will look good to have said it, but if the Minister 
will not talk to the Police Authority, I fear that we will have been given a bit of a sop in many 
respects—which would be undesirable, to say the least.
<P>
The Minister said that Opposition Members were trying to make the Chief Constable a puppet. If 
I did not like the Minister immensely, I would take offence at that. If he were anyone else, I would 
take him outside and buttonhole him—I could not do it here—and get my point over to him. We are 
not trying to make the Chief Constable a puppet. We are well aware that he has a difficult job to do 
and have repeated ad nauseam that we have complete confidence in him. We know that his role is 
extremely sensitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is encouraging confrontation to suggest 
that the Chief Constable would be the puppet of the Police Authority, to whom he is accountable, if he 
deferred to it on such issues as respect and consultation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made his point. The Minister listened carefully, with his pen 
in his hand, perhaps writing it down. If the hon. Gentleman does not object, I will allow the Minister 
to answer. I like the Minister and was offended by his suggestion that we wanted to make the Chief 
constable a puppet. It has nothing to do with that; it is about checks and balances. The Chief 
Constable is a responsible person who does not want to be without the checks and balances that 
operate against and with him. They protect him against rumours that can thrive and sometimes 
substitute for fact in a divided society. The amendment would protect the Chief Constable. We repose 
confidence in the Police Authority and believe that the status quo ante should prevail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall try to be brief and avoid provoking the hon. Gentleman into speaking again. 
He suggested that my old school, Cranhill senior secondary school, was named after one of his 
relatives. I always thought that Cranhill was a place; I now know that it was named after some great 
landlord. I loved Cranhill, but I shall have to reconsider.
<P>
My old school motto was “integretate”—“with integrity” to those who, like me, do not 
understand Latin. I have tried to approach the Bill with that motto in mind, and I wish the hon. 
Gentleman could tackle the measure in the same spirit
<P>
I explained my interpretation of the 1970 Act. The Police Authority wants its provisions to 
remain in place. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness nods. I asked whether the Police 
Authority had received legal advice that was contrary to my interpretation of the Act. I was asked who 
wrote the section of the document to which I referred. Roseanne McCormick, a barrister who chaired 
the general purposes committee, wrote it. Therefore an eminent Northern Ireland barrister, who 
understands the 1970 Act, interpreted the way in which it should be applied.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire says that two barristers will give two different 
opinions. But the Opposition have not presented another opinion. They have not even taken the 
trouble to assess whether their arguments pass muster and withstand proper examination.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said that I was not giving much away today. I 
want my officials to be involved in all the working groups that discuss the detailed implementation of 
the Bill. We can proceed without them, but I do not want to do that. I cannot drag people to the table. 
I have made it clear that, unless my officials can get into the working groups, ascertain the real 
anxieties, and discover whether there can be a genuine resolution of the problem, the Bill will not be 
altered.
<P>
I can table changes on Report only if I am satisfied that robust mechanisms exist to ensure that 
what has happened in the past does not recur, and that the law is properly obeyed, so that the Chief 
Constable does not become the Police Authority’s puppet, or subject to its second-guessing about the 
basis on which he makes decisions on specific claims.
<P>
I appreciate the fact that the hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness and for North-East 
Cambridgeshire are fired up about their amendment, and I expect a vote on it. I ask the Committee to 
reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have only two points to make. The Minister talks about legal advice. A professor or 
lecturer on law from Queen’s university helped to draw up the amendments that the Police Authority 
asked us to table. I do not know how eminent that person is, but legal advice has been taken. When we 
questioned the Police Authority, it said that interpretation had been considered from a legal point of 
view. The only way to test it would be by a count judgment. The hon. Gentleman did not say that 
there had been a case in law on the operation of the 1970 Act that would substantiate the planned 
changes by the Minister and his officials. If legislation is good enough for England and Wales, why is 
it not good enough for Northern Ireland?
<P>
Finally, why is the meeting with the chairman and chief executive of the Police Authority with 
officials and not with the Minister himself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Fine. The Minister said the meeting was with his officials, but if he is going with his 
officials, that is important. The Minister must ask himself why there is no co-operation at the 
moment. We have not created a division, the division exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are getting into the language of the absurd. I have explained that I spoke to the 
chairman of the Police Authority on two occasions. I will be meeting him to talk over some of these 
issues and I understand their importance, but the detailed working application of legislation cannot be 
left to a Minister. It must be dealt with by members of the Police Authority, by representatives of the 
RUC appointed by the Chief Constable and by the other leg of the three-legged structure, my officials.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am pleased to have that confirmation. No doubt when the Police Authority reads 
Hansard it too will be delighted that a personal meeting with the Minister could be held before the 
working groups with the officials start.
<P>
One ingredient is missing, and it is the opinion of the Chief Constable. We have plenty of 
opinions from the Police Authority, from the Minister and from the Secretary of State, but we never 
hear from the Chief Constable, who is an important part of the tripartite structure. What does the 
Chief Constable think about how the 1970 Act operates? What does he think about the proposed 
changes in the Bill? Are we allowed to hear what he thinks? Has the Chief Constable made 
representations saying that the 1970 Act puts him in an invidious position or that it is unworkable? It 
would help the Committee in forming a view to know whether the Chief Constable has made any 
overtures to the Minister or to the Northern Ireland Office and whether he has any problems with the 
operation of the Act. We shall return to this vital matter—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman to join me in urging the Police Authority to get round the 
table with the working groups so that we can aim for implementation of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have no hesitation in asking the Police Authority to get round the table and discuss 
these matters. We have already asked it to do that on more than one occasion. We do not seek to 
exacerbate the situation, merely to tell the Committee that it is not as good it should be. That is for the 
Minister to sort out. We will continue to encourage the Police Authority to hold discussions because 
these matters meed to be worked out. If the interests of all parties, and of the Police Authority—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I thought that we wanted to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We could have made more rapid progress if the hon. Gentleman had intimated 
earlier that that was his view. If hon. Members have been urging the Police Authority to get round the 
table and talk to my officials and to representatives of the Chief Constable and it has not done so, why 
does the hon. Gentleman continue to represent the authority’s interests in Committee when 
mechanisms are open to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is hardly worthy of an answer. It is not just a matter of just representing the 
interests of the Police Authority but of trying to get proper legislation. We were asked earlier whether 
we were just the mouthpiece for the Police Authority or were considering matters on their merits. 
Many of the amendments that have been tabled did not emanate from the Police Authority, so the 
accusation that we are just a mouthpiece is nonsense. Of course, we are urging members of the Police 
Authority to get round the table with the Minister because that is one way, outside the Committee, 
that they can persuade the Minister of the merits of their argument. They may achieve more face to 
face with the Minister than we can in the Committee, but that does not mean that the arguments 
should not be put in the Committee. Does the Minister want us to pack up and go away? Does he just 
want to rubber-stamp the Bill?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister has been responsible for two major Bills since the Labour Government came to 
power. In my recollection, no other Minister has taken two major bills on the Floor of the House and 
in Committee in the way that he has.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> All right, three, with the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill. Certainly the 
Minister must be as overworked as any Minister in the Administration, and probably more 
overworked than any other Northern Ireland Minister. The idea that he has been instrumental in 
drafting and testing the Bill and has had an opportunity to read it and to question his officials day by 
day and hour by hour about it is nonsense. Only in this Committee over a period of time can proper 
scrutiny be given. Why does Parliament have these procedures? It is because that is the way in which 
these matters are scrutinised. I shall seek to withdraw the amendment, but we will return to this issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment. The 
charge that he has levelled against me is that I am lazy, that I have not attended to the Bill and that I 
do not know the detail of it. I rebut those charges. I meet my officials regularly and we consider the 
clauses in detail. I have to justify each element of the Bill, as I have done with other legislation. The 
hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire may have been a lazy Minister but he cannnot make that 
charge against me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said no such thing; he 
did not suggest that the Minister is lazy. If the Minister had approached what my hon. Friend said 
with a little generosity, of which he has a great deal, he would know that my hon. Friend was saying 
that the Minister has a heavy work load. He has had a great deal to do in the House of Commons. We 
took the view that he probably did not have enough time to examine the details of the Bill as he might 
have done and perhaps relies too much on his brief. We simply want to be sure that he is challenging 
his officials in the manner required of a Minister. In turn, we shall spend a lot of time in the 
committee teasing answers out of him to be sure that he has done as he should. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will return to being his generous, open self. If he does, we shall all get 
back our sense of humour and be able to make progress on the Bill in a sensible and adult fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 30 to 36 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Statement of policing principles</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 20, line 12, leave out ‘may’ and insert 
‘shall’.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 86, in page 20, line 
13, at end, insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(1A) Before issuing any statement of policing principles the Secretary of State shall

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Police Authority,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the Chief Constable.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendment will make a simple change to the legislation. I commend it to the 
Committee, and I assume that it will be welcomed. The clause will then clearly define the requirement 
that will be placed on the Secretary of State and her successors to issue and, if necessary, to revise a 
statement of policing principles.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That was unhelpful. We have just given you six clauses on the nod. We are trying to 
be as co-operative as possible. It seems that you cannot except a gift when it is presented to you on a 
plate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that he should address the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The clause, and the next two clauses, deal with the Secretary of State’s power to issue 
statements of principles, codes of practice and general guidance. The clauses will profoundly 
influence the delivery of the Northern Ireland police service. The powers with which they deal will 
directly affect the duties and functions of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.
<P>
If the tripartite structure is to mean anything, it is vital that balance and fairness is achieved as 
much as is possible. Balance should be seen to apply to the apportioning of relative responsibilities to 
component parts of the tripartitie structure. No one part of the structure—the Committee is discussing 
the powers of the Secretary of State—should have undue influence and power over the other two.
<P>
Ultimately, responsibility to Parliament lies with the Secretary of State. It will perhaps, 
therefore, always be necessary to give the Secretary of State a little more power. It seems, however, 
that the Secretary of State will gain additional powers from the Bill, over and above those provided by 
current legislation—especially by the 1970 Act. The Bill seems to give the Secretary of State greater 
powers than those of the Home Secretary as set out in the Police Act 1996.
<P>
The Committee has returned to that theme time and time again. The relevant clauses seem to 
given the Secretary of State increased powers to have major influence on the way in which the police 
service is delivered. She will not have to take into account representations from the Police Authority 
or from the Chief Constable. That is an oversight. Amendment No. 86, which we had hoped to 
propose, sought to make some consultation necessary—that is all. The powers for which clause 37 
provides mean that the Secretary of State can decide of her own volition to set aims, values and 
aspirations without consultation or discussion with the two other important parts of the structure, 
which are tasked with delivering the service. That is more than an oversight: it is a slight on those 
two bodies.
<P>
The Police Authority believes that this is yet another instance of its interests being ignored and 
overridden. It rightly feels that it will have far fewer teeth than intended if the Bill proceeds down the 
present road. Clause 2 sets out the functions and duties that the Police Authority is required to 
perform under the Bill; it is tasked with an extremely heavy responsibility. 
<P>
Clause 2(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Police Authority shall secure that the Northern Ireland Police Service is efficient and 
effective.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are extremely heavy responsibilities. How can the Police Authority meet them if it does 
not agree with directives from the Secretary of State? In particular, how will it meet them if it 
disagrees with directives on—I read from clause 37(1)—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“a common set of aims, values and aspirations in connection with the exercise of their 
respective functions”?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause refers to a common set of aims. As far as I am concerned, “common” means that the 
aims are agreed between the parties to the tripartitie structure. I fail to see how we can speak of a 
common set of aims if one party does not agree. I also fail to see how there can be common values if 
the three parts are not in agreement. The same is true of common aspirations. We are asking the 
Minister to reconsider, and we might have to take the matter up on Report. How can the three 
component parts agree a common set of aims, values and aspirations if they are not consulted?
<P>
All we were asking is for a requirement to be placed on the Secretary of State to consult before 
issuing a statement of principles. We have accepted a Government amendment to the effect that the 
Secretary of State shall—not may—issue a statement. She will be required to do so fairly soon after 
the Bill is enacted. It is vital that consultation and discussions take place so the parties that will have 
to deliver can issue a statement of principles that means something and which they own. As it stands, 
the Secretary of State shall issue a statement, but will not necessarily need to consult the parties 
involved. I would have thought that that was bad legislation. It could well lead to disagreements and 
divisions and to a Police Authority that is seen by the public not to count. At the end of the day, the 
Secretary of State—whoever that is—shall decide these matters without any recourse to the 
authority’s opinions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I support my hon. Friend’s argument. Clause 37 is one of 
three clauses to which the Bill gives the heading, “Functions of Secretary of State”. It takes us to the 
heart of the tripartite structure envisaged by the Bill. If that structure is to succeed, one of its central 
features must be an achievement of balance and fairness.
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, it is essential that no one part of the tripartite structure has undue 
influence over the other two. There are many points in the Bill where Conservative Members fear that 
that appropriate balance and fairness has not been achieved because the Secretary of State is being 
given unwarranted and excessive influence. She will make considerable gains on the powers and 
responsibilities that she has under the 1970 Act. That is a theme to which we have returned time and 
again during our debates.
<P>
The missing ingredient in clause 37 and elsewhere is a due and appropriate insistence for the 
Secretary of State to consult and negotiate with the other two parts of the tripartite structure. Instead, 
she will be able, of her own volition, to make decisions without consultation or discussion. Clause 37, 
taken in conjunction with clauses 36, 38 and 39—we shall come to the latter two in due course—
injects a major imbalance into the Bill.
<P>
Above all, the interests of the Police Authority are ignored and overridden. My hon. Friend 
pointed out that clause 2 gives it heavy responsibilities. It provides that the Police Authority shall 
ensure that the police service is “efficient and effective”. Despite its being given that responsibility, 
clause 37 denies it the involvement to ensure that it can deliver its responsibilities. The common set of 
aims, values and aspirations that clause 37(1) advocates cannot be achieved unless there is greater 
consultation and involvement. I share my hon. Friend’s conclusion that clause 37 demonstrates that 
this is bad legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am beginning to find it tedious to have to confront, again and again and again, 
clauses that will mean that the Secretary of State is, yet again, able to claw on to herself almost 
dictatorial powers.
<P>
I and my party support the point that has been made by the official Opposition. In providing a 
common set of aims and values on which to issue a statement on policing principles, it is proposed 
that the Secretary of State should consult neither the Police Authority nor the Chief Constable. That 
he should not have a statutory obligation to do that runs counter to the very nature of democracy.
<P>
That is of the utmost significance in Northern Ireland where the two traditions, for whatever 
reason, are deeply suspicious of each other at best and who may on occasions, be deeply suspicious of 
the civil power. The Minister has made no effort to reassure us on that point and to tell us why it is 
expedient for the Secretary of State to claw to herself the dictatorial powers that permeate the Bill. He 
has not told us why—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have not had the chance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> We are in the ninth sitting and the Minister claims that he has not had a chance, 
but the matter does not relate just to this clause: the deficiency permeates the Bill. We have 
encountered that in clause after clause. He must tell us why it is imperative for the Secretary of State 
to claw these dictatorial powers to herself or himself. Who will exercise those powers and who will 
make decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State? The Minister knows that, in practice, it will not be 
Parliament.
<P>
In a democracy, Parliament should be answerable but some day-to-day occurrences, particularly 
in relation to policing and military matters, cannot be monitored and dealt with on a day-to-day basis 
by Parliament. The Minister is talking nonsense about that, and he knows it. The great difficulty for 
me is that instead of giving some indication that he respects the concept of a Police Authority, the 
Minister suggests that it is some sort of dissident grouping bent on creating trouble with the Chief 
Constable. He need not shake his head because that is the impression from his responses when we 
have spoken about the authority that should be vested in PANI.
<P>
We are reaching a stage in the Bill where the Minister needs to put up and tell us in detail what 
is left for a Police Authority in which society in Northern Ireland, both traditions, can have 
confidence. He must tell us what will attract principled and able people to accept appointment or 
election, as the case may be, to a Police Authority. Is there any role for a Police Authority in the 
Minister’s view? It is no good his giving me the easy answer and telling me that of course there is a 
role, if his response does not include examination of how the exercise of that role could enable the 
integrity and ability of the authority’s members to yield something positive for society. 
<P>
I again implore the Minister to hear—I know that he listens but I doubt whether he hears—our 
pleadings for the Government not to pass, as it can by weight of numbers, a Bill that will create 
division, disappointment and suspicion in Northern Ireland. The decision is for him, and I hope that 
he will not be glib or offhand in responding to an argument that, on my part and, I believe, that of the 
hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and his hon. Friends, is serious and sincere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal first with the points that have been raised by the hon. Member for 
Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I think that his argument was that we have not—either on clause 37 or 
on any other provision—debated the relative strengths and importance of the Police Authority in the 
tripartitie structure. I disagree fundamentally. I offer the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance. I 
understand not only the concept of the need for a Police Authority, but support it fundamentally. The 
role and responsibility of such an authority are important factors in the democratic accountability of 
the police—and are important too for their interface with Government. The Police Authority should 
ensure that the police operate properly within the parameters that are laid down not by itself but by 
Parliament. It should perform a communication function with respect to the interface between the 
Chief Constable, the RUC and the community, and should assist the RUC in its functions. Also it 
should allow an interface between the Government and the community. It has a rival role and the Bill 
is replete with passages setting out that role in detail.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has understood what the 
Bill is about, but we shall no doubt return to this issue time and again, and I shall continue to express 
my confidence in the concept of the Police Authority, and in the importance of its role. We have tried 
to enshrine that outlook in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) was right to mention clauses 38 and 39 in 
addition to clause 37, because similar principles underlie them. I shall explain later to the hon. 
Member for North-East Cambridgeshire why we did not debate amendment No. 86. [Interruption.] If 
we had debated it I should have been helpful. I anticipated a clause stand part debate anyway and I 
intend to take on board the principles communicated to me by the Police Authority, and which 
members of the Committee have set out concerning the need for consultation on clauses 37, 38 and 
39. However, I do not think that the amendments—particularly to clauses 37 and 39—go far enough. 
I want to give further attention to that aspect of the matter.
<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone did not suggest the 
possibility of including the Police Association in the consultation. He is an adviser to it. Its absence 
from the consultative process struck me as a possible weakness. I want to re-examine the matter in the 
context of clause 39,—and perhaps clause 37—so that the Police Association can participate in 
consultation. That would ensure that everyone who is involved in policing in Northern Ireland was 
fully consulted about the statement of policing principles, the codes of practice and the guidance about 
the exercise of the police force’s functions. I am being helpful. The hon. Member for North-East 
Cambridgeshire allowed a wheen of clauses to be accepted on the nod. He did not have an argument 
to present against them.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept the principles of amendment No. 86, which was not proposed. I shall table an 
amendment on Report. I hope that it will be acceptable, and that the Opposition will not find other 
arguments against my attempts to take account of their points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> What can I say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister did not thank me for giving him an easy time on five or six clauses. He 
tells us that if we can think up arguments, we should present them, yet we were accused of 
filibustering and of prolonging the debate when we sat until 1.30 am.
<P>
How can it be argued that we are out to delay the process and to filibuster when we agreed with 
some of the provisions? We do not devise spurious arguments. We accept the bill, we believe that the 
wording of some clauses is probably copied wholesale from previous legislation for England and 
Wales. The Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot accuse us both of filibustering and of 
having nothing to say because we cannot devise counter arguments. Sometimes I fail to understand 
the Minister. 
<P>
The Minister intends to return to clauses 37, 38 and 39 because he acknowledges that our 
arguments about consultation are valid. He suggested that he would draw the Police Association into 
the ambit of consultation. If he does that, he will have to reword clause 37 because it currently deals 
with the functions of various bodies under the Bill. The measure does not set out the sort of Police 
Association functions that would require it to be consulted about aims, values and aspirations. If the 
Minster can tackle the matter, we shall take a constructive view of developments.
<P>
The Minister failed to explain the reasons for including clause 37 in the Bill. Its provisions do 
not appear in the 1970 Act or the 1996 Act. Why is a special clause that covers aims, values and 
aspirations included in the Bill? Is Northern Ireland so different from the rest of the United Kingdom? 
Could not the aim of the clause be incorporated in another clause or under another heading?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have been asked why the clause is included. The hon. Gentleman has not argued 
against it. He has given assurances that he has read and understood the Bill. It is good governance by 
the tripartite structure to issue a statement of policing principles, because it is the social contract 
between the three elements of that structure. It is hoped that everyone can sign up to the principles. 
There will be consultation with the Police Authority and the Chief Constable, and perhaps at another 
level if that is practical, under the clause. Everyone will be aware of what should be done in policing 
the Province in the community’s name.
<P>
Clause 37 is important. I did not think that it would be necessary to explain it. I expected it to be 
welcomed as a major step forward in setting out the objective, and in terms of the codes of practice 
and guidance on the exercise of police functions to enable people to understand that the Police 
Authority is not isolated as a representative voice of the community. It was designed to bring about 
greater awareness among the wider community of precisely what policing principles are about and 
what elements are attached to them. I am sorry if I did not explain. I assumed that the hon. Member 
for North-East Cambridgeshire would have understood automatically the significance of this 
important development. It is clear that he did not. I apologise to members of the Committee for his 
failure to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thought for one brief moment that the Minster was beginning to understand 
what Opposition Members are trying to achieve I found some of his comments helpful. But then he 
began to wander somewhat. The best that he could do was suggest that I did not understand what the 
Bill was about [Interruption.] Yes, I was included too. The Minister also accused the hon. Member for 
North-East Cambridgeshire of not understanding the Bill. When he begins those flights of fancy I 
begin to worry, and to ask myself whether I and others have articulated properly our in-depth 
understanding of what the Bill could bring about if a Secretary of State was so intentioned.
<P>
When because of other duties with the talks process, I was delayed, or unable to get to the 
Committee, the Minister was quick to point out—as he did at our previous sitting—that my short and 
temporary absence suggested a lack of interest in and conviction about the Bill’s importance. It 
occurred to me only when he questioned our understanding of the Bill that he has not commented on 
the almost total absence of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), who obviously is 
interested in policing—at least he has claimed to be—but has been missing from every sitting but one.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman, like me, is exceedingly busy, and heavily involved in and committed to the 
talks process, and I am not criticising him one iota. I am suggesting that there must be a degree of 
assurance for the hon. Gentleman in what he knows about the content and the outcome of the Bill and 
the possibilities that it presents in terms of his political objectives, which are for fundamental changes 
within the structure and the nature of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
<P>
I do not begrudge the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh his right to have and to hold those 
opinions. I am constantly chided for not understanding the nature of the Bill; perhaps if I tie that in 
with the absence of the hon. Gentleman, whose objectives are completely different from mine, and 
consider the vastly increased powers that the Secretary of State is being given and the erosion of the 
authority of PANI, I could conclude that we are considering a Bill that will make fundamental and 
unacceptable changes to the entire structure of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and of policing in 
Northern Ireland.
<P>
Given the weight of numbers on the Government Benches, the Bill could certainly be passed. 
But if that leaves us with a situation in which the Secretary of State can sit down with those members 
of the police division who advise her—
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Is my hon. Friend alluding to a hidden agenda that might be round the corner? Does 
he have any inkling that ideas that are not represented in the Bill will be presented in a working 
document in the talks process?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It may be straying outside the ambit of the clause to refer to the talks, but among 
those parties—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is right in his assessment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful for your endorsement, Mr. Jones.
<P>
However, the hidden agenda part of the question may fall within the terms of the clause. We 
have not had substantive answers to our questions about the financial implications of certain changes, 
although we were promised them several sittings ago.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the Minister will understand why I have 
risen to respond to the Minister’s jibe about my depth of comprehension of the Bill’s intentions. The 
Minister seems to think that we are unable to comprehend how certain types of two-tier policing could 
undermine the whole structure. I thought that I had dropped the Minister a hint in our previous sitting 
when I alluded to the dubious junket in the Harlem district of New York and to the secretive conclave 
in the Galgorm hotel in county Antrim when two-tier policing was discussed. The Minister may think 
that I and the Ulster Unionists are unaware of those matters, but let me reassure him that we are not.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government and the Secretary of State want to slip through legislation that gives them 
dictatorial power, the weight of numbers on the Government side means that we cannot, sadly, do 
much about it. However, the Minister must recognise that it is, and will remain, a recipe for 
confrontation and for a breakdown in confidence right across society.
<P>
There is little point in the Minister’s jibing Opposition Members about their lack of 
understanding of the Bill. We understand the potential danger far more than he does. Although there 
was a glimmer of hope in one or two of the Minister’s comments, by and large, I found no great 
reassurance and he would do well not to gloat over provisions that could bring further disharmony 
into Northern Ireland society.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 37, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>Codes of practice</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 20, line 17, after ‘to’, insert ‘procedures 
for’.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 88, in page 20, line 18, at end, insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(1A) Before issuing any code of practice the Secretary of State shall consult the Police 
Authority.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I wish to speak to these two amendments. Amendment No. 87 is a small amendment. 
The Minister may or may not feel that it tidies up the grammatical sense of the sentence and that it 
states more clearly the meaning behind the subsection.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 is more important. Arguments similar to those deployed in debating clause 
37 are relevant. The amendment deals with codes of practice relating to the discharge by the Police 
Authority of any of its functions. It replicates section 39 of the 1996 Act and gives the Police 
Authority common ground with its counterparts in England and Wales. That is what the authority was 
promised in early discussions and 
negotiations about the new legislation. Members of the authority think that it would be fair and 
reasonable for them to be consulted, when the Secretary of State draws up the new codes of practice. 
<P>
When he spoke on the previous clause, the Minister hinted that he saw clauses 37, 38 and 39 as 
a group, and was considering the best way to set up consultations with the various bodies involved. He 
said that he was thinking of extending consultation about clause 37 to the Police Authority, the Chief 
Constable and the Police Association. Similarly, in clause 38, I understand that he planned to involve 
the Police Authority with the Secretary of State in drawing up the various codes of practice. that is 
important and we need not argue about it. Clause 2 gives the Police Authority heavy responsibilities, 
which it takes seriously. Members of the authority believe that the amendment would help it to 
discharge its duties under those responsibilities.
