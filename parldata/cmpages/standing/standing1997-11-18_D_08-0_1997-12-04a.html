<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 9, line 22, at beginning insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to subsection (1A) below,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 50 in page 9, line 36, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The Bank shall continue to be responsible for the overall stability of the financial system as a whole, and in particular, the stability of the monetary system, infrastructure, and the avoidance of systemic risk; and in exceptional circumstances, shall be entitled to undertake open market operations in connection with that responsibility.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a nice sunny morning in which to change gear, if I may use that analogy--not to motor in the country, much as we would like to do that on a day like this, but to consider the Government's proposals for the transfer of banking supervision to the new Financial Services Authority.
<P>
The amendments are designed to probe several aspects of the changes and to stimulate a general debate on the Government's intentions and how they intend to execute them. I say at the outset, although it may be termed a reverse health warning, that nothing that I or my right hon. and hon. Friends might say should be interpreted as an attack--covert or disguised--on the competence of the Governor of the Bank, his staff, those who are transferring to the new authority or on Howard Davies who will chair that authority. They are people whom many of us know and respect. It is, however, right for us to tease out from the Government their intentions and thinking.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 is a paving amendment, and amendment No. 50 is a substantive amendment that would reinforce the Bank's duty to be responsible for the overall stability of the financial system. It is a little unfortunate that the Bill's geography has meant that we must debate those amendments before amendment No. 48, which would leave out from the clause the provisions relating to the Bank's functions under the Banking Act 1987. I am not suggesting that we do not regard this debate as important. It is most important, but it might be easier for the Committee if I save some of my more general remarks about the clause for our discussion on the next amendment.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 50 is to reinforce the point, which I think is conceded by the Committee, that the Bank shall continue to be responsible for the overall stability of the financial system as a whole and, in particular, that of the monetary system. We want to ensure that that responsibility is clearly reinforced by the Government.
<P>
Earlier in our proceedings, I expressed concern about the transfer of monetary responsibilities. We are now debating the regulation of individual institutions. That will take place elsewhere through the authority, but the Bank will still have an overview of stability. If circumstances arise when a bank or institution is failing in its functions, we are worried that the authority may initially perceive that to be a minor regulatory "retail" matter. However, things could get out of hand, which could pose a systemic risk to the overall system. I anticipate that the Economic Secretary will respond, "Ah, that is what the memorandum of understanding is for. We will talk to each other closely and make sure that nothing like that happens."

<P>
It is important to flag up our concern that the Bill divides responsibilities that were previously the Bank's in-house responsibility. If a bank got itself into trouble, the authority would have to take an interest as regulator; but the Bank would still have overall responsibility for the financial system's stability and, as the executive agency, it would have to lend its own money--public money--to prop up the failing bank if it were deemed necessary in order to maintain the stability of the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): The hon. Gentleman referred to the memorandum of understanding. Paragraph 2 of the memorandum states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Bank will be responsible for the overall stability of the financial system as a whole which will involve...stability of the monetary system...financial system infrastructure",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>and so on. Can the hon. Gentleman explain why the wording of the amendment is identical to that of the memorandum?
<p><b>Mr. Boswell:</b> Yes, I can. The Opposition has, of course, read the memorandum of understanding. Indeed, we hang on the Government's every word, and are delighted that the wording is there reflected. All members of the Committee, particularly Labour Members, who may have to defend the Government against possible mistakes--I do not anticipate any--should know how the system is to work. One has only to draw on the analogy of the banking system in south-east Asia to realise that words are words; we need a clear assurance of what is intended.
<P>
It may be possible for the Government to say retrospectively how they would have handled the Johnson Matthey case. That would give us an insight into how the Bill should work. The concern is genuine, and not confined to our party or to the Opposition Benches; we want the system to work smoothly. The fact that people are housed in different buildings and under different labels should not inhibit the Bank from being able to move seamlessly, although not always successfully, between considering a micro-case, realising that there is a macro-threat and meeting it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentlemen mentioned Johnson Matthey. For the record, it should be made clear that the Bank was concerned not about a systemic problem but with the fact that Johnson Matthey was a major player in London's bullion market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, but it interacts for reasons other than the systemic risk with the overall stability of the financial system. Clearly, the bullion market is important, and the Governor will still have the overarching responsibility for what I might call City plc.
<P>
The amendment is not meant to be contentious. It is intended to prove the Government's intentions. As the hon. member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) rightly says, it is all set out in the memorandum. Indeed, as a keen textual scholar, the hon. Gentleman will have noticed that we have reproduced the exemplary thinking of the memorandum in several amendments. We are anxious that the Economic Secretary should put some flesh on the memorandum, explain how it will work and assure us--and, I hope, satisfy us--that it will work.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): Good morning, Mr. McWilliam, on this bright and sunny morning. This is a nice place to be on such a morning.
<P>
I accept that the amendments are an attempt to explore more fully the Government's intentions in relation to the transfer of advisory functions to the Financial Services Authority. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues arising from the significant changes in financial services in the past 10 to 15 years, especially in relation to the nature of the responsibilities of individual institutions.
<P>
I do not want to stray out of order, Mr. McWilliam, but let me first refer to the Government's intention to establish a single regulator for the financial services industry. The Government decided that there was a need for a single regulator because of the hotchpotch of regulations that had grown up to suit circumstances that have now changed considerably. For example, some household-name organisations were building societies but are now banks carrying out a wide range of activities. There have also been changes in the activities of the banks themselves.
<P>
As Member of Parliament, we are all aware of the difficulties faced by our constituents when they have a problem relating to the financial services sector; they have to approach the alphabet soup of existing self-regulatory organisations, which is confusing. People whose lives are not consumed with the detail of financial regulation may feel that the wool is being pulled over their eyes and that the confusion will let the guilty off the hook. That was the reason for establishing a single regulator.
<P>
Banking supervision is being transferred from the Bank of England to a single regime to give the regulator cohesion across the range of financial services. That also gives us the opportunity to set out clearly the specific role of the Bank of England in its monetary policy and other non-statutory obligations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry was right about my response to amendment No. 50. The amendment is unnecessary because the financial stability role of the Bank and the Financial Services Authority is fully spelt out in the memorandum of understanding. That memorandum is a public document and has been signed by the chairman and governors of the three relevant authorities; the Governor of the Bank of England, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, who are the three key players, are comfortable with the Government's arrangement.
<P>
Our intention is to improve the quality of regulation available to banks. Let me reiterate the hon. Gentleman's point, which I take fully: in exploring these issues, there is no question that we are criticising the existing system of banking supervision. Indeed, we are anxious to learn from the experience of the professionals in banking supervision and to give them a specific and more public role within the single regulator. They will bring a much-admired professionalism to the Financial Services Authority; there is great professionalism in the existing self-regulatory organisations.
<P>
The Bill is a first step. It will not transfer overall financial services regulation to a single regulator; it is but one part of the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The hon. Lady referred to the memorandum of understanding. There seems to be a proliferation of such memorandums and letters from the Chancellor to the Chairman of the Select Committee or the Governor of the Bank of England. Is not there a case for incorporating some of those documents into the legislation, so that all the rules and understandings can be found in one place?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> You are lucky to have anything specific.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should not heckle.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The rising temperature in the Room might be getting to us, although I am delighted that the temperature is rising, as it was rather cold on Tuesday. The Opposition want to enshrine the memorandum of understanding in legislation. I shall come to that point shortly.
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was determined to spell out the various stages in a memorandum of understanding because he wants to make it clear that all three organisations agree with the proposals. He also wants to provide transparency and to give responsibility to the three players in the arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Economic Secretary has glossed over--but not completely inaccurately--our intentions. May I qualify slightly what she has said? Our intention is to give effect in the legislation to the principles or the broad heads of the memorandum of understanding, but not to the operational working details. That is an important distinction. The operational details will change from time to time, but the principles on which they and the agreement are based should be more or less permanent.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall not give a specific response to the hon. Gentleman now, because I want to expand my remarks more fully. He said earlier that he is anxious to have a full debate on these matters.
<P>
Although I cannot read the memorandum of understanding into the record, it may be useful to the Committee if I describe its background and the role that is outlined in it. The purpose behind the memorandum relates to the stability of the monetary system, and to the financial system's infrastructure--a point to which the hon. Member for Daventry referred. It also encompasses a broad overview of the system as a whole. The hon. Gentleman referred to the difficulties faced in the Asian markets recently, and we recognise the need for a constant overview of events in the financial markets.
<P>
The memorandum of understanding will enable action to be taken in exceptional circumstances by the Bank undertaking official financial operations. It will also secure the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial sector with particular regard to international competitiveness.
<P>
Because the terms of the memorandum of understanding are so clear, the amendment would not add anything. The memorandum is clear on how the interaction between the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury should take place. It goes into considerable detail on that, which is necessary so that each institution's role is clearly defined and duplication is avoided.
<P>
If we were to do what the hon. Member for Daventry suggests--I accept that it is a probing amendment--we could build inflexibility into the system. The Committee should be aware that putting one aspect of the Bank's role on to a statutory basis would fail to address its other non-statutory powers. That may be a perverse way of looking at the problem, but the amendment homes in on only one aspect of the Bank's non-statutory powers. The Bank does not need its financial stability operations to be put on to a statutory basis. It is a corporation that was created by charter, so it has the capacity to carry such functions.
<P>
We are anxious not to incorporate rigidity into the system. If we do, we shall lose the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does that mean that the memorandum of understanding is not an explanation of the Government's approach? If it is not, what is the memorandum's purpose? If it describes the Government's approach, does that not make the proposals as rigid as if they were incorporated into statute?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I regret that the hon. Gentleman, in seeking to score points, did not follow the train of the argument. The point that I was about to make about the memorandum of understanding is that hon. Members on both sides of the House have recognised the inflexibility that was created by previous reform of financial services regulation.
<P>
The world changed. I do not apportion blame to anyone for not spotting that the world of financial services was going to change, but the present system cannot take changing circumstances into account. We seek by the Bill and future legislation to establish a structure of financial services regulation that can adapt to changing circumstances.
<P>
When we discuss the wider financial services regulation aspects of the Bill and of future legislation, we will have an opportunity to explore in detail how the financial services industry is expected to change in both the retail and wholesale sectors. We seek by the memorandum of understanding to give clear, defined roles to the three pillars. The people involved are not corner boys or fly-by-nights, but well-respected individuals in the financial community who are at the top of major organisations and have to answer for their actions.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): On a point of information, every member of the Committee would agree that the world of financial services is fast-moving and ever changing--hence the Financial Secretary's call for flexibility, which we acknowledge--but does not that logically entail drafting a new memorandum of understanding on changes to any of its principles? If the regime is to be flexible, will that logically entail issuing new memorandums of understanding in future?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is difficult to assess unforeseen circumstances, but the memorandum of understanding is in effect a quasi treaty between three major organisations who have described what they see as their clearly defined roles. Just as no Government can bind their successor, no organisation can bind its successor. However, I consider the present memorandum of understanding to allow a response to changing circumstances. Future Governments, future Governors of the Bank of England and future chairmen of the Financial Services Authority may seek to redefine their roles. That is why amendment No. 50 is too restrictive and confining in respect of the overall responsibilities of the three organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There is an important point here. The hon. Lady talks about the memorandum of understanding being a quasi treaty between three governmental organisations. All actual treaties are ratified in Standing Committees of the House. She praises the technical abilities of the three parties to that memorandum, but it has not been scrutinised by Parliament. My concern is that we are creating a new tier of regulation--we have seen this in the case of the Inland Revenue, with extra-statutory concessions, regulation by press release, regulation by memorandums, and handbooks used by Inland Revenue officials. Here we have another regulation that is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It may have been created by able technicians, but we do not live in a technocracy--we live in a democracy. We have too many regulations produced by statutory instrument and too many regulations that do not receive even that degree of parliamentary scrutiny.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall not kick the ball into the open goal that the hon. Gentleman has just left me, because I am anxious that we should conduct this discussion on a slightly higher level than that of some of our earlier debates.
<P>
The key point is that the memorandum of understanding is a working document--a set of working guidelines for people who have to confront issues on a day-to-day basis. In the past, there was no such memorandum of understanding. Decisions taken in the past between the Chancellor and the Governor in response to periodic crises--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to listen to the Economic Secretary, but two additional conversations are going on and it is difficult, while I am getting those in stereo, to listen to the hon. Lady who is in the middle.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Thank you for your protection, Mr. McWilliam. Obviously I am being extremely boring this morning. I shall have to think of some Celtic phrases to cheer things up a bit.<P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding, as a working document, is intended to clarify the roles of the three organisations concerned so that, in a crisis, there would be no doubt.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry rightly raised a point about systemic risk. He is obviously interested in that subject, which we have discussed in informal settings. It is clear from the memorandum of understanding that it is for the Bank to take the lead with respect to developments in its field of responsibility, which includes not just the stability of the monetary system but payment systems and the financial infrastructure. That means that the other role for the Financial Services Authority is to take the lead where problems in an institution may pose a wider threat. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North touched on that matter tangentially in an intervention. The point is to ensure the necessary co-operation in analysing and assessing the implications of potential systemic risk. Of course, the Chancellor has, ultimately, a specific right of veto on support operations. He must take into account whether taxpayers' money should be risked in rescuing an operation, in circumstances involving perhaps, not systemic but commercial risk.
<P>
The role that the Bank has long played at the heart of the financial system is recognised and the broad responsibility for perpetuating the system's stability is being maintained. However, there is no point in trying to reach a simplistic definition of that role. The memorandum of understanding sets out for the first time the practicalities of co-ordination. What we are considering is a pragmatic means for three organisations to know their responsibilities in a crisis. Similar documentation exists in many public corporations to guide senior executives.
<P>
To return to the clause, our intention is to enshrine the appropriate guidance in the memorandum of understanding, and modernise the structure of financial services regulation to take account of the regulatory responsibilities for banks in a changing world, so that they will not be regulated in isolation. Their many and varied roles should be examined in the framework of the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
We can only do so much in this House to contribute to the operation of the Financial Services Authority. We can only put down the building blocks of financial services regulation. It will be the professionalism of regulators that will make the regulation work. We must provide the tools for their job. In the memorandum of understanding the three main players, the Governor, the Chancellor and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, who will require rules, have come to an agreement on their way of proceeding.
<P>
I shall resist amendments Nos. 47 and 50, while recognising their probing function. I hope that I have answered as many as possible of the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
In this country, we are fortunate in having a financial services sector that is a world leader; we want to put in place a system of financial services regulation that is also a world leader.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I support this paving amendment and should like to draw attention to the worrying state of affairs described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) in his interventions--I am sorry, he is not yet "right honourable," but he will be. He made the point that there are important principles set out in the memorandum--no one disputes that, and the principles are helpful and vital. They are not enshrined in statute, however, and Conservative Members are worried that the proposals for the new FSA have not been prepared especially well.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The functions of SROs under the Securities and Investments Board were well trailed by the Labour party; no one could have been in doubt about its proposals in that matter. Conservative Members welcome the foresight that was shown. In Hansard of 14 December 1995, we read the now Chief Secretary's views. He made some good points about the excessive cost of duplication relating to SROs. The Labour party business manifesto of this year made it clear that a new super-SIB was planned.

<P>
The transfer of the supervisory functions of the Bank of England--primarily under the Banking Act 1987--was not well trailed, however, and we did not have adequate consultation about that. The memorandum touches on that matter, as well as the changes to the SRO regime. The Committee should have cause to pause to consider the responses to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement of 20 May 1997. The responses expressed concern about the size of the super-regulator, and the fact that it had so many functions, not only in relation to SROs, but in relation to the systemic regime for monitoring the activities of British banks and the banking system.
<P>
The comments of the Governor of the Bank of England were reported in the Financial Times on 21 May, the day after the Chancellor's statement. The Governor had told colleagues that he had not been consulted. On 22 May, the Financial Times reported that the Governor had considered resigning.
<P>
Labour Members might not consider reports in the Financial Times to be authoritative. I do, however. We discovered most of the contents of the Budget in the pages of the Financial Times, before the Budget was announced. We are entitled, therefore, to attach some importance and credence to reports about the legitimate concerns of the current Governor of the Bank of England. He spoke of a lack of consultation. There was a genuine feeling--rightly or wrongly--throughout the City that perhaps there had not been full consultation, and that the proposal had not been thought through and subjected to the appropriate public scrutiny.
<P>
With such concerns in mind, the Committee should pay attention to the comments of Conservative Members. My hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton have spoken of the important principles involved.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): Is the hon. Gentleman not exaggerating his account of concerns about the proposal? The Times stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The City, including existing watchdogs, generally welcomed Mr. Brown's proposals."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>They were welcomed by Peter Ellwood, chief executive of the Lloyds TSB group plc; and by Sir Peter Davis of the Prudential Corporation plc. The hon. Gentleman is overstating his case. He speaks of general concern and uproar, but many organisations and individuals within them welcomed the proposals.
<p><b>Mr. Ruffley:</b> I am more than happy to swap quotes with the hon. Lady. What she says may be right, but at least I can adduce evidence that hers is not a uniform view. The chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority expressed grave concern about the size of the new-super SIB and whether it would be able to discharge all its functions adequately. Of course, the memorandum seeks to find a way through that and is intended to ensure that the proposals work better.
<P>
Conservative Members have few problems with the principles set out in the memorandum, but we want to ensure adequate scrutiny. The principles governing the regulatory regime should be built into statute; we should not have to rely on non-statutory forms--good though the memorandum of understanding may be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Labour Members welcome the hon. Gentleman's earlier comments, but I cannot follow the logic of what he is saying now. He was once adviser to the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), but the previous Conservative Government did not make any of these assumptions explicit. They relied on the 1946 Act, the 1694 charter and the 1946 charter, but no assumptions about the Bank's responsibility for financial stability or the payment system were ever made explicit. We are now making them explicit in the memorandum and the hon. Gentleman takes objection to it. I cannot understand his logic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is uncharacteristically failing in his logical powers. We did not seek to create a super-SIB before 1997. We made no attempt because the system of banking supervision--
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman is discussing the wrong amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> No. The banking supervision system -- under the powers and duties of the Banking Act 1987-- was working perfectly well. I hope that we can have a grown-up and consensual debate on aspects of the SRO regime. There was duplication and the Chief Secretary's December 1995 speech contained much with which both sides of the House can agree.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North referred to my former position in the Treasury. Of course Treasury Ministers were worried that the SRO system was not working as efficiently as it might have. We were considering problems prior to 1997.
<P>
The amendment refers to the whole package--not just SROs but banking supervision. We shall debate the Banking Act 1987 shortly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I will not. I have made the point that banking supervision rules were set out clearly in statute. We want an assurance that the principles enshrined in the memorandum will be properly enshrined in statute for the reasons adduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and myself.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a narrow amendment about residual powers, but hon. Members are straying from it. I shall have to take account of that with regard to the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Economic Secretary has done her best to explain what is happening here and she has given some assurances to the Committee. I entirely endorse--I want to put it on record--her argument that, whatever is done in Committee, the effectiveness of the system will ultimately be dependent on the professionalism of individual practitioners and how they conduct their business. That is right. Our role and duty is to seek assurances and to ensure that the framework is established in the best possible way.
<P>
In that context I was disinclined to advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division. However, I want to make some closing remarks. First, on reflection, I have not drawn out the Bank's overseas role clearly enough. The memorandum and the debate have been largely couched in domestic terms, although I have referred to the recent banking problems in south-east Asia. It is beyond my memory, but I have read about evidence of the failure of international banks threatening the stability of the United Kingdom financial sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman's mother might remember.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is heckling again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am delighted to say that I do not personally remember the case to which I shall refer. In the 1930s, the fall of Credit Anstalt, together with the American situation, exacerbated the depression in western Europe. That bank has recovered and is now a major player in Austria and elsewhere. However, there is concern that something which happens abroad might have repercussions--either directly on liabilities and assets, or by producing a run or roll back in liquidity--on the United Kingdom banking system.
<P>
I want to flag up to the Economic Secretary a matter to which we shall refer in a later debate, so I understand that she might not want to respond to it now. The regular exchange of information between financial service and banking regulators in different countries might be put in the pigeonhole marked regulation. Therefore, the Bank might not hear about the systematic risk of a micro-problem that might occur in south-east Asia, Latin America or nearer home. In the spirit of what we have said, there is concern that the machinery should work smoothly to ensure that any international exposure is flagged up to the Bank because of its overall responsibilities.
<P>
I appreciate what the Economic Secretary said about matters of procedure and the Bank's operational flexibility, which has subsisted for many years under its charters. It is right that that flexibility continues. Interestingly, in interrogating my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), the hon. Member for Dudley, North asked, effectively, "Why didn't you do it". The distinction between this Administration and previous Administration is that we took some time to think about such matters, and I shall refer to them later. However, the incoming Treasury team decided to make all these changes in three weeks. That was a unwise decision.
<P>
Clearly, the Bank has much operational flexibility under its charters, and I understand why that should be so. I understand what the Economic Secretary said about setting matters down on paper in the memorandum of understanding. There is little wrong with the memorandum as drafted. I also understand the point about the need to modify the memorandum from time to time. Indeed, the memorandum contains a saving clause which says, "If we have not thought of one of two things that the Treasury should do, it can jolly well do them if it needs to". That is entirely intelligible.
<P>
However, I should like the Economic Secretary to assure us that she will consider how to inform the House of any modification to the memorandum, given that it is a quasi-treaty, as she called it, between three public bodies that are accountable, either directly or indirectly, to the House. Perhaps that could be done under statute or by assurance. Substantial changes in the memorandum of understanding might be concluded because of the pressure of events or experience. If the memorandum is a public document--our amendments would enshrine that in statute--we should be informed of, and be able to consider, any significant change in it.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have had an interesting debate about an issue of substance. May I respond first, to the point about the overseas role of the Bank of England? I refer the Committee to the memorandum of understanding, which I know is not before the Committee for discussion. When Committee members have an opportunity to examine that document, they will see that the final sentence of clause 2 (iii) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The Bank will be able to advise on the implications for financial stability of developments in the domestic and international markets and payment systems; and it will assess the impact on monetary conditions of events in the financial sector".</font></ul>
<P>
Paragraphs 15 and 16 deal with the membership of Committees and refer specifically to the responsibility of the Bank and the Financial Services Authority to continue to act on the Basle Supervisors' Committee, the European Monetary Institute Banking Supervisors' Sub-committee and on other international committees where necessary. The FSA and the Bank also have responsibility to keep the Treasury informed of relevant developments in the international regulatory community.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I also refer to the request of the hon. Member for Daventry for assurances about whether there would be further changes in the memorandum of understanding. Given that the Government have gone down the route of that memorandum as part of a commitment to openness and transparency, it follows that the openness and transparency must also exist in any changes. I shall not commit myself to any statutory involvement in that, but it is inconceivable that any necessary change in the memorandum would not be made public because that is a critical aspect of ensuring that all three organisations--
and those of us in the wider community--know their responsibilities and how they are being discharged. With that, I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he sought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I refer the Economic Secretary to my earlier point. She quotes from the memorandum of understanding as though it were a piece of statute--citing paragraphs 15 and 16, clause 3, subsection (iii) and so on--yet I have been reading the memorandum and I should like to discuss several points that concern me. Under which clause will the memorandum be discussed and scrutinised by Parliament?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has missed the point of the discussion. I seek to respond to very serious points made by the hon. Member for Daventry on the memorandum of understanding, to give him the assurances that he wanted and to be helpful. If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to go back over all my points about why we have chosen the route of the memorandum of understanding, I am perfectly willing to do so. After all, we have some five hours in which to discuss those matters.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I invite the hon. Gentleman to read all the amendments, not only the group that we are considering. We can discuss the point easily under the group headed by amendment No. 51.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Given those assurances and my references to the international responsibilities of the Bank and the FSA, which will also have to be a major player in international regulation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her comments. While I understand her point about the operational details of any memorandum of understanding, the point remains that although, as she says, it is inconceivable that any changes in the memorandum would not be published and made available to the House, at least for comment, consideration could also be given to enshrining that assurance in the Bill. Subject to those comments, rather than pursuing the matter further, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 9, leave out line 25.
<P>
In a sense, this is the substantive amendment. Because we have been fortunate in the way that the Bill has been drafted, I hope that the hon. Lady will not argue that it is a wrecking amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If it were a wrecking amendment, it would not have been selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Exactly so, Mr. McWilliam. I was just saying that we have been able sufficiently to conceal that fact. I was saying that if the hon. Lady were to present the amendment as a wrecking amendment, I would understand that, but I hope that she will accept my assurance that it is essentially a probing amendment. The amendment does not provide formally and exactly what we would want, but it is intended to elicit a debate on the reasons for the Government's change to the arrangements.
<P>
Our debate is one sided not in the sense that the hon. Lady will not reply, but in the sense that only part of the package is before us. Only the proposal to transfer banking supervision powers to the new Financial Services Authority is before us; the legislation to transfer all the other powers to that authority is not yet before us--nor will it be for a considerable time, until a good deal of consultation and further planning has taken place.
<P>
It is important to flag up that point, not least because Howard Davies, carefully and mindful of his responsibilities, has produced a document that gives a clear outline of his intentions. It states that the reader
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "may think of this document as a kind of `Pathfinder Prospectus' for the United Kingdom's new single financial regulator."</font></ul>
<P>
It continues:  "You"--
<P>
that is the reader, Mr. McWilliam--
<P><ul><font size=-1>
"may think of it as such, but I could not possibly call it a prospectus: one of my eager market regulators would undoubtedly seek to discipline me on the grounds of presenting potentially misleading information."</font></ul>
<P>
That is part of what is a trenchant and frank preface to the document. Mr. Davies also refers to the fact that is a "sketch of the plan"; the adjective derived from the word "sketch" is "sketchy".
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman also note these words of Howard Davies? He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is not an easy task, but the work we have done over the last five months has convinced us that it is both feasible, and desirable."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. I hang on every word from Howard Davies, as befits the words of a former special adviser to the Treasury--a contemporary of mine in that role, although in a different Department. We should not discuss every possible interpretation of what Mr. Davies may or may not have written, but, if it is not regarded as flippant, I refer the Committee to the good advice that he received from Paul Volcker, who is the doyen of central bankers everywhere. Mr. Davies says that Paul Volcker
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"raised his eyebrows in the way only retired central bankers can. `You have quite a job on there', he said. `I just hope you manage to retain your sense of humour'."</font></ul>
<P>
That is a proper point to make. None of us want to underestimate the magnitude or importance of the task that Howard Davies and his authority face.
<P>
My only reservation--events are perhaps solving this problem--concerns another part of the preface. I am never sure how many words of French constitute a failure to remain in order, but Howard Davies says that the authority's guideline is "vite fait, bien fait." From my limited French, that translates as, "if done quickly, it is well done." I wonder whether that is entirely wise. Perhaps "bien fait, bien fait"-- if it is well done, it is well done"--would be better.
<P>
I do not want the authority to rush into things before it has got them right; on the other hand, I do not want it to drag its feet and take too long when it could get on with the job. We are genuinely concerned that hiatuses, glitches and uncertainties will be created in the transition from the old system to the new system, which must be overcome as quickly as possible. That is a difficult balance to find, and one which the Committee should consider. Subsequent amendments will reinforce that point, and we can have a genuine debate on them.
<P>
I said that the problem of speed may have been resolved because there are already signs that some of the next stages of the planning process are slipping behind schedule. If that is because of full consultation and the proper consideration of other people's views, I will welcome it. That completes my preface about the authority. However, I add that a function will be transferred to it immediately through the Bank's supervisory powers.
<P>
When we debate the substance of the issue, I shall return to the reason for the changes. I have already mentioned the fact that they were conceived and announced within three weeks of the change of Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has already referred, with an approbation that I share, to remarks of the Chief Secretary--who is not present today--about the aspects of the different SROs that could and should have been brought together. It is surprising that, 12 months after making those remarks, the right hon. Gentleman went on record to say:
<P><ul><font size=-1>
 "A blanket approach, the creation of a 'super regulator', won't do. I know that it makes for a convenient shorthand but the idea that if all the regulators are rounded up and put into one building then we will have a system that will solve all our problems simply won't wash."</font></ul>
<P>
I an not trying to score political points, and I do not hold the Chief Secretary to every possible interpretation of his remarks. He may have been having the type of dialogue that we all--if we are sensible--should hold with ourselves.
<P>
It is clear--the Economic Secretary said something about this earlier--that, given the change in financial structures, there is a powerful attraction in treating building societies and banks together. The growth in what our continental neighbours would call "bancassurance" shows that different types of financial institutions are coalescing and offering a range of services. It might seem anomalous--it frequently is--that they should not be handled in one house. That is a perfectly sensible observation, but I thought that the Chief Secretary's later remarks seemed to be almost dismissive of that view.
<P>
I wish to flag up one concern that will come to a head when we discuss later amendments. In opposition, Labour promised an evolutionary rather than revolutionary approach. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) was then the relevant shadow spokesman. When referring to the well-founded reservations expressed by Michael Taylor, the hon. Gentleman labelled advocates of Taylor's twin peaks proposals--for which I have some sympathy, but I do not necessarily follow them in detail--as Bolsheviks. I am certainly not a Bollinger Bolshevik. However, if it is necessary to be a Bolshevik on this matter, perhaps I should declare a slight interest. One thing is quite sure: if members of the Government regard themselves as Mensheviks, they will not last long.
<P>
In something I published recently, I said that it seemed like a good idea at the time to get things together and have a single regulator. However, fears have been expressed about the expansion of SIB, which has 200 employees, into a super-SIB with 2,000 employees. If organisations of that size are to discharge their functions in detail, the dynamics, control and management needed are a different kettle of fish. The lines of communication are much more difficult.
<P>
I understand the one-shop attractions of the proposals. However, we have expressed our concerns about the interface between the various responsibilities of organisations, including the Bank and the Treasury. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred--
if he had not, I would have done--to the reported concerns of the Governor on this matter. For public purposes, all is sweetness and light and everyone is working as one and in a way that public services always claim they do. However, will the Economic Secretary tell us whether it was the attractions of a one-stop shop or other factors that drove her towards a single regulatory structure?
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, in the context of banking regulation, I wish to ask some more deeply probing questions. I am not sure whether they were asked at the initial stages of financial regulation--or perhaps they were not asked with sufficient salience. As everything will now come under one roof, we need to know the Government's response. What is regulation for? In asking that, I am conscious of the devastating question asked by the little girl who, about 100 years ago, was with her mother watching a politician making an impassioned speech. She said,"Mummy, what is that man for?" That was an important question.
<P>
What is the regulator for? There are a number of possible objectives, not all of which are incompatible and not all of which are necessarily achievable. One objective might be to stop something happening. The Economic Secretary knows of people's concern about previous banking failures. Indeed, some of her hon. Friends and some of mine spoke on behalf of depositors in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and for those who lost money in Barings.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): What answer did the mother give the little girl? Was the little girl your mother?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I assure you that the little girl was not my mother.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. She was not my mother, either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No, she was not your mother, Mr. McWilliam--I was momentarily astonished to hear the hon. Gentleman say that she might be mine. The hon. Gentleman was a little ungallant because, although my mother is a robust 87 and a half years old, she was not a little girl 100 years ago. As for the answer, I do not know. When the hon. Gentleman reads the article that I am about to publish in Teaching Politics, which poses the question, we may get a little further. I am often minded of the man who expressed confusion about a certain topic so his friend invited him to go to a conference to clear his confusion. His friend debriefed him afterwards, asking how the conference went and what conclusions had been reached. The gentleman replied, "I am still confused, but at a somewhat higher level."
<P>
My first question about the regulator is: should we try to stop something? With no foreknowledge, I am quite certain that the Economic Secretary or other hon. Members--or the regulators--would not claim that nothing could ever go wrong. That would be a remarkably courageous claim for any Government to make.
<P>
Secondly, one could claim that the regulator's function is to reduce trouble. It seems a more realistic objective that the regulator should find out whether things are going wrong and do something about it.
<P>
The regulator's third function is to be aware of and monitor what is going on and to report on it. In a sense, that will be part of the function to be discharged by the Bank on a continuing basis once the FSA cuts in with its micro-regulation. The Bank will still have an interest in the health of the system.
<P>
A fourth and somewhat separate issue--the Economic Secretary is keen on it--is the potential for punishing those who have failed, who have let the system down, or who have failed to comply with its requirements.
<P>
If I may be cynical for a moment, a final role may be to absolve people--in this case, probably Ministers--from blame should anything go wrong. I sometimes think--I shall not dilate on this--that that is one of the functions of security. From time to time, Ministers--I hope that it has not happened to the Ministers here--receive death threats or other threats of dreadful consequences, usually from persons writing in green ink and with some imprecision, although occasionally with more precision. I have never seen a Department so excited as when a death threat is received. Departmental security wakes up and gives helpful advice, special branch is consulted, Ministers are advised to change their routes and wear false moustaches or whatever is required.
<P>
I am making a serious point, however. The chances of Ministers being drilled through the head with a crossbow bolt, or whatever is threatened, may not be greatly reduced even when it is said that everything is being done to reduce the risk. There is a danger that, in asking too much of a regulatory structure, we are really asking for a whitewash-- Everything possible is being done, 
Mrs. Bloggs, but your deposit has gone down the Thames."
<P>
I rehearse those arguments because the Committee should think about what a regulator is seeking to do. I ask a related question: how will we judge whether a regulator is successful? What will the test be? Will it be that nothing ever goes wrong, or would that give rise to the concern that the regulatory structure has not been set up entirely appropriately? If one is regulating things that will go right anyway, one may claim the results as a triumph.
<P>
There is a famous story--it is the last that I shall share with the Committee--about the man who bought a kilo of mothballs. He bought another kilo the next day; clearly, he was very pleased. On the third day he bought yet another kilo. The shopkeeper became concerned and asked,"Isn't that a lot of mothballs; are you happy with them?" The man replied,"I'm perfectly happy, but you can't hit them every time." If regulators are completely successful, perhaps they are asking the wrong questions.
<P>
Despite the jocularity--I say this with seriousness--it is important that the regulator considers how often or in what circumstances failure may occur. To say or imply that everything will be done to ensure that nothing ever goes wrong is inimical to the health of the banking system. The customer sometimes needs to assume an element of risk. the phrase"caveat emptor" has a long history in the principles of law; people should not be totally absolved from being cautious in their own affairs. The Committee should be mindful of Professor Jim Gower's wise advice in initiating this process in the early 1980s: there is a distinction between making a fool of oneself--the implication is that that should not be precluded--and being made a fool of, which, I think, is the purpose of financial regulation.
<P>
I concede that those remarks are rather by and large, but they are designed to elicit a response from the Economic Secretary on the system's main objectives and how the system will work in practice. We gave some latitude when he did not press the earlier amendment to a Division but, given that the system will be general rather than precise and flexible, as the hon. Lady said, we want an assurance that there is a clear understanding of the system's objectives. Furthermore, the regulation system must have the right structure, the right relationships between component parts, as set out in the memorandum of understanding.

<P>
Having made some general remarks about the need to think about what regulation is for, I shall now flag up some matters to which we shall return in due course. Let us consider the regulated, and whether the different categories of those regulated are the same and should be treated in the same way or whether they are different and should be treated differently.
<P>
Earlier, I referred to the idea of twin peaks. I am not sure, within a single structure, whether it is not possible to take a slightly different approach according to whether the regulated person carries on retail financial services in this country or is a wholesaler operator dealing mainly with sophisticated institutions, such as other banks and commercial companies. An important distinction must be drawn.
<P>
The memorandum of understanding touches on the difference in functions between the overall structures and the necessary accounting procedures and the specific business and how it is to be conducted. We shall tease out such matters when we discuss later amendments, but I needed to flag them up now.
<P>
The new regulatory structure will not work as well as the Economic Secretary hopes, or we would wish, unless it is flexible--as the honourable Lady said. Above all, 
I would counsel against a narrow box-ticking approach. A more holistic approach must be taken. Of course, it must be on all fours, so that all institutions are treated fairly and are made to comply with certain necessary standards. No one is arguing with that. A simple pursuit of ticking the boxes, like the slightly jocular example that I quoted earlier about the departmental security officer who went down the war list if a death threat was received, is not enough.
<P>
The phrase,"the governor's eyebrows" has almost died out, but we should discuss it in Committee. There will always be a political temptation that we may ferment in the honourable Lady to add in further tests, but, however much we may loathe the details, it comes down to a matter of judgment. The system needs to see, feel and have a sense for whether an institution, group of institutions, sectors or problem areas are functioning properly and to be able to take early, appropriate and flexible action to put things right.
<P>
I am not arguing that that should be done in the vain hope that nothing will go wrong, but in the hope that the intervention--at reasonable cost and carried out fairly--
will secure that more goes right than might otherwise be the case. The City's record is regarded as largely positive; it is a world-class competitor and most of its business goes right. I am sure that the honourable Lady does not want to prejudice that position, but we all want to ensure that the system works as fairly and smoothly as possible.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) may have been referring earlier to my late mother as she was born in 1898. Such words would have been entirely consistent with her character. The rule about language is simple: by and large; it is that the Chair must understand what is being said. As I had the good fortune as a young man to live in Paris for a year, I shall say nothing about the hon. Gentleman's pronunciation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I do not want to repeat the points made so ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry in his illuminating and inspiring speech. I cannot hope to match the quality of his illustrations. He mentioned the governor's eyebrows. Unless we stop clause 21, there is a danger that the last vestiges of those eyebrows will be plucked out before the Bill is enacted.
<P>
In our first sitting, I referred to a much more significant matter than the proposals put forward in the Bill: the abolition of exchange controls in 1979. That event helps to give a perspective on the current state of affairs. The Bill's proposals are a logical reaction to the events of the past 18 years. The purpose of the amendment is to call a halt to that process, and to say that it has gone far enough.
<P>
The abolition of exchange controls is often considered in terms of its effect on the freedom of manoeuvre of City institutions, on the ability to invest abroad and on the exchange rate. There was another important effect. Before the abolition of exchange controls the Bank of England's mastery of the banking system was like that of English Heritage over a grade 1 listed building. Any payment that was to be made abroad had to have the agreement of the Bank. The Bank's grip over the vital parts of each bank ensured that it had the attention of the banking system in every other sphere.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The result of that system was that the Bank felt comfortable enough to adopt a lightness of touch in its regulation of the banking system. A lifting of the Governor's eyebrows was enough to signify to the London banks that unless they played ball, and did what the Bank wanted, their lives could be made very difficult. They had to employ an army of people to cope with the bureaucracy of exchange control. Such departments were immediately disbanded when exchange controls were abolished; more than 700 people were transferred from that division in the Bank of England, and the number was multiplied many times in the other banks.
<P>
The authority of the Bank of England lived on. It was only as a result of a series of events, which were part of the evolution of the banking system, that the moral authority left to the Bank after 1979 was gradually eroded.
<P>
Too little thought has been given to the effect of the provisions of the Bill on new developments in the City. The transfer of the Bank's functions under the Banking Act 1987 is a critical component of the proposed new system. If the City wanted to develop a new market, the system would be such a barrier that such a development would not get off the ground in time.
<P>
If we contrast that with the situation in 1981, just after the abolition of exchange controls, we see that there was a recognition of the opportunity to create a brand new market in London. The market was in what became known as financial futures, and it was obvious that letters about its establishment, and whether it was appropriate, should be sent to the director of banking and supervision at the Bank of England. Many representations were made to the director and volumes of evidence were submitted to him. He replied with a short letter, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The Bank has no objection to the establishment of a financial futures market in London."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>That was regarded as the biggest green light in recent memory and it is a measure of how slightly the Bank needed to lend its authority to such an initiative to allow it to get off the ground. If an initiative succeeded, the Bank rightly took the credit, but if it failed the responsibility would be entirely on the progenitors.
<p>That lightness of touch in the 1980s lay at the heart of the success of the City of London in many areas, when the initiative was captured from the rest of Europe and the City became the undisputed financial centre for Europe and, in many ways, for the world. Real concern is felt at the possibility that the proposed system will have such an effect on further developments in the City that that cutting-edge role in new markets will be lost. If 
that happens, the Government will bear a serious responsibility. They will have taken away the raison d'etre for the choice, by so many components of the financial services system, of London as an operations base. They make their choice not because they think that they can get away with murder here, or perform a sleight of hand that would not be allowed in Frankfurt, Paris or Zurich, but because of the depth of understanding here about the breadth of the financial markets, about their role in them and about the distinct role of the regulatory regime.

<P>
Opposition Members recognise that change must happen; the moral authority of the Bank was weakened. Johnson Matthey has been mentioned, and the Bank's triumph in sorting out that matter was that not a penny of taxpayers' money had, in the end, to be paid to solve the problem. However, in calling on banks in London to sort out the problem among themselves, the Bank drew on its last reserves of good will from the pre-1979 system. The words of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Lawson, at the time of the BCCI affair, merit careful examination. One may read in his memoirs his comment that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "it is very rare indeed for there to be a major supervisory problem in which fraud is not involved".</font></ul>
<P>
He explains that even where the problem in the system originates elsewhere, fraud is often the means by which its scale is disguised until it gets to a much more serious stage.
<P>
We should all be anxious about the fact that the proposal that we are considering does not tackle the question of how to deal with fraud. Lord Lawson's comments strike me as absolutely right with respect to several past supervisory failures. Stronger and more effective powers to root out and prevent fraud in the system would have meant that the problems that arose in the financial system would have been on a much smaller scale.
<P>
On the other hand, the prospect of increased powers to root out fraud raises the problem of where they should reside. Should they belong to the new regulator of banking supervision or to some other body? Serious issues of private and civil rights come into play here.
<P>
The issue will not go away. Fraud was at the heart of BCCI and the Maxwell scandal, and it allowed the problems at Barings to be concealed under the famous 6666 account. The Bill does not deal adequately with such an important issue. Transferring the Bank's responsibility for banking supervision without addressing one of the key weaknesses of the current system, if not a recipe for disaster, at least involves a significant risk.
<P>
I am delighted that the Economic Secretary is answering questions in our debate today. She has already been generous in her comments on previous sittings and I hope that she will take account of our comments today. However, I am curious about the absence of the Chief Secretary from the Committee this morning--

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> He is at a Cabinet meeting.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That explains it, but it is a pity. 
I understand from the book "Blair's Hundred Days":
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "After the election, Treasury staff had assumed that there would be no room for financial regulation in the already jam-packed Queen's Speech. However, Alistair Darling, the shrewd Scots lawyer and Chief Secretary to the Treasury, came up with the idea of tagging the reform proposal on to the end of the Banking Bill."</font></ul>
<P>
It is not good enough to tag this reform on to the end of the Bill. It provides only half the picture. We know about the other half from the comments of the Securities and Futures Authority about the various phases. Phase 3 is set for autumn 1999, but the SFA can become fully operational only when another Bill dealing with financial services regulation has passed through the House. Some cases may be appropriate for tagging, but this is not one of them.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr Ruffley:</B> Does my hon. Friend view that quotation as evidence showing that the Bank was not fully consulted? It supports the proposition that I cited earlier from the Financial Times to the effect that the Governor was most discomforted and considered resignation.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I personally believe in those comments and in the authority of "Blair's Hundred Days". I quote from it again:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "George"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>--referring to the Governor--
<ul><font size=-1> "has gone through an experience that all bankers dread--being robbed in broad daylight."</font></ul>
<P>
Let us consider again what the Chancellor said on 20 May:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "It has long been apparent that the regulatory structure introduced by the Financial Services Act is not delivering the standard of supervision and investor protection that the industry and the public have a right to expect."--[Official Report, 20 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 509.]</font></ul>
<P>
Those were his very words.

<P>
However, nothing in the Bill addresses the issue of financial services regulation to give us confidence that it will achieve its aims. On the contrary, there will be a hiatus between the transfer of responsibilities to the new body and the eventual folding of the self-regulatory organisations. In that context, any weaknesses in the present system are most likely to show up.
<P>
Minds will be focused, first, on whether people can keep their jobs; secondly, on how the new system will operate; and, only thirdly, on the people we are supposed to be considering here and now. Eyes will go off the ball. The Government are creating an entirely new risk in the regulatory framework and I should like the Economic Secretary to acknowledge that the Government will accept responsibility if hereafter--I hope that it does not happen--there is a supervisory failure and a regulatory problem.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does not my hon. Friend's point evoke what happened in the United States in the early 1980s with savings and loans? The transfer of the regulation of the Thrift Institutions Advisory Council from Little Rock to Dallas led to such confusion; several academics attributed the problem to that transfer of responsibilities.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That is a telling example of what can happen.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> While the hon. Gentleman is on the point--I know that he is rehearsing his speech for the Second Reading of the financial services Bill--perhaps he can tell us whether that means that the Opposition now take responsibility for the mis-selling of personal pensions that occurred under the regulatory regime set up by the previous Government?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was not a member of that Government and it is not for me to comment on matters that happened when I was not in the House and was not aware of them. I am sure that members of the Government at the time would be able to answer the hon. Lady's in any case irrelevant question.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am not sure that it is irrelevant because we are talking about supervision, interestingly on an amendment that seeks to remove reference to the Banking Act 1987. On the moral point--it is a moral point--is the hon. Gentleman, as an individual, comfortable with what previous Governments succeeded in doing in regard to the mis-selling of personal pensions?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The problem of personal pensions mis-selling must be viewed in context. It cost a large sum of money--an estimated several billion pounds, maybe 
2 billion or 3 billion--and that must be viewed in the context of the new Government's manifesto mis-selling, which has cost pensioners around the country 4 billion to 5 billion, not once but every year.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that that must be seen in context. Is not the context of 600,000 people, 18,000 of whom are now dead, who at or near retirement found that they had been mis-sold a pension, and the 
1.5 to 2 million people in the non-priority cases who may have been mis-sold a pension, relevant to our discussion? Is the hon. Gentleman not prepared to say that the previous Government should have acted?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The simple answer to that is that in talking about the mis-selling of pensions, we are talking about a performance in pension plans below what it would otherwise have been.
<H4><center>[Mr. Andy King in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wright. 
I welcome you to the Chair. We are not talking about the performance of pension funds or personal pensions mis-selling; we are talking about the failure of the regulatory system. It might be appropriate if the hon. Gentleman kept to the subject.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I find the Economic Secretary's comment extraordinary.


<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend confirm that any action that the hon. Lady is now taking on the mis-selling of pensions is within the regulatory framework and the sanctions that were set up in the previous Administration? Has he also noticed that only this week, the independent financial advisers expressed their concern about the possible mis-selling of pensions to the 3 million individuals who should be opting back into SERPS? They made the specific point that, in the absence of clear Government guidelines on whether those individuals should opt back, it is possible that they, as personal financial advisers, may be at risk because of the lack of clarity and transparency in the Government's policy?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The heart of the matter is that the Government's changes to the taxation of pensions will have a much more devastating affect on personal pensions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In a moment. The Economic Secretary has asked me many questions, and I shall begin to answer them before giving her a chance to ask any more.
<P>
The change to the tax on pensions is especially devastating to personal pensions, which companies do not top up automatically. That burden falls on the individual, not on the company. It was grossly irresponsible of the Government to proceed with their proposal with so little consideration.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that it was most irresponsible of the previous Government not to act to resolve the problem of personal pension mis-selling? Will he consider the fact that one of the major reasons why we must reform the regulatory structure is that the people of this country have lost confidence in the self-regulatory structure that the previous Government established?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I certainly do not accept the latter point. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, all the powers that the Government are using to deal with pension mis-selling were granted under the previous Government's legislation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No, I must deal with the points the Economic Secretary has made. It is hard to be interrupted with the same question half way through an answer. [Interruption.] I hope that the Economic Secretary will listen to the answer. By definition, a failure comes to the regulator's and the Government's attention only after it has occurred. No doubt, it was with the best of intentions that, in the 1980s, the previous Government promoted the idea of personal pensions. That was part of a process by which many more people took control of an important part of their lives.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?

<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No.
<P>
For many people, that was a great boon, which meant that they could do things that they could not have done before. I am not referring to those to whom pensions were mis-sold, but to those for whom personal pensions were appropriate. They clearly benefited from the changes that occurred in the 1980s.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that neither I nor the Government could have taken the actions that we have taken under the self-regulatory system, but why did the previous Government take no action when the mis-selling of personal pensions was revealed in 1990-91?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is absurd to suggest that the previous Government turned a blind eye to the problems of pension mis-selling. Much was being done, but one of the difficulties was to define the nature and extent of the loss to those involved. The cost of the schemes and how much better off people would have been if they had remained in the scheme that they contracted out of all had to be determined. Those technical problems were difficult to understand. [Interruption.] The Government were acutely aware of the costs of enforcing compliance and that they should be properly met.[Interruption.]
<p><b>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory</b> (Wells) rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the right hon. Gentleman, I must say that there has been an outbreak of chattering. I cannot think why that is so--perhaps the proximity of lunchtime is the cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) on stirring up a hornet's nest of indignation amongst the Government. Clearly, they feel extremely vulnerable on the current mis-selling scandal. I shall pass him the press release from the Independent Financial Advisers Association, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The current political confusion over the future of SERPS cannot hide the fact that recent announcements have tipped the balance of probability back towards most clients enjoying SERPS."</font></ul>
<P>
Given that the Government have not responded to that matter, that clients have been persuaded to leave the state earnings-related pension scheme or have failed to rejoin it and that there is confusion, is not there a serious risk that the private pensions scandal will gather pace under the Government? Will my hon. Friend address that matter before he concludes?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), I give the Committee a distinct yellow card about my views on clause stand part debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
My hon. Friend has made an extremely pertinent point. I recall a child carer in my constituency receiving a letter from her personal pension provider saying that, as a result of the pensions tax, she would have to pay 20 a month more into a personal pension scheme to achieve the same level of projected benefit that she received previously. Pensions mis-selling is a disgrace, but it must be seen in context and must not divert attention from this much larger issue, which affects millions of pensioners.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. One thing the Bill has nothing to do with is the pensions tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I return to the regulatory argument, which I fear the Economic Secretary is in danger of losing. She asked me about the cost--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> May I speak on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No. She asked me about the cost of regulation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No, I did not.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Indeed, she asked me whether the cost of regulation was a legitimate factor in the previous Government's handling of the pensions mis-selling problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No, I did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Indeed, she did. The hon. Lady asked me whether they had done enough--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Victorian music hall scenes are all very well, but I chaired the Committee considering the Finance Bill, so I know which Bill imposed the pensions tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> You are quite right to remind us, 
Mr. McWilliam--although I am surprised that the Economic Secretary should need reminding--that we are debating regulation.
<P>
If the regulator imposes too heavy a hand, the costs of regulation could make things far worse for those at the end of the chain. The hon. Lady may know of a company called Knight Williams. I do not know the rights and wrongs of the case, but the directors of that company protested that the costs of compliance were so great that the company was forced into liquidation, even though the pension schemes would have delivered an adequate return to investors. A problem that was serious but containable became even more serious and uncontainable, with the result that those who had invested in the Knight Williams schemes were far more out of pocket than would otherwise have been the case.
<P>
In the context of pensions mis-selling, the regulator had to be careful because the matter was complicated and the cost of calculating each individual case was considerable. It was obviously important that the process of regulation did not compound the problem, bearing in mind that most of those guilty of mis-selling pensions were substantial institutions, which, in due course, would have been able to deliver on the liabilities arising from mis-selling.
<P>
Notwithstanding the cases mentioned by the Economic Secretary, we should remember, given that the fruits of many pension schemes were not due to be paid for a number of years, that time could have been given to resolving the problem. The Economic Secretary has made many speeches about pensions mis-selling, and none of us wants to underestimate the scale of that problem. However, there is more than a hint of suspicion, not only in the House but outside, that some of the furore directed at pensions mis-selling is, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) suggested, to disguise the Government's embarrassment and shame over their own manifesto mis-selling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): The hon. Gentleman talks lucidly at times about the cost of regulation. Would he comment on the cost of a lack of regulation and the fact that, under the previous Government, many thousands of pensioners died without receiving proper compensation. He accuses us of turning a blind eye to that in the few months that we have been in power, but did not the Conservative Government close both eyes for 
18 years to those who were mistreated and mis-sold pensions?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not think that we closed our eyes for a moment to the fact that under the previous Government the pensions industry was immensely successful. This country has more money stored in pension schemes that the rest of Europe put together. We are in an enviable position. While other parts of the world face a demographic time bomb, the scale of pensions savings in this country means that we, at least, are well-equipped to cope with that problem.
<P>
The mis-selling of pensions occurred only after personal pensions became popular--after the Government encouraged them by changes to the tax system and the level of national insurance contributions. To say that we had our eye off the ball for the whole 18 years is absurd. If the Labour party manifesto had been subject to the system of supervision that pertained then, the Chancellor would have been disqualified from playing any role in the regulatory system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, far from the Labour party manifesto being even a pathfinder prospectus, such as Howard Davies offers, it was a deliberate attempt to make the British electorate lose its way?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend makes a telling point. When we consider the scare stories that were told during the election campaign about what our Government intended to do if re-elected, that adds to the shame that Labour Committee members must feel on the issue. We can laugh at the fact that they do not recognise that, but it is the laughter of despair. I can say nothing more on the matter.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The chair is supposed to be totally neutral in these matters, but the hon. Gentleman is tempting me.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> This spirited discussion should not divert us from the core point, which is whether the powers under the Banking Act 1987 should be transferred to the new regulatory regime. We have seen that the issue of fraud is key, and the development of new markets in London is also a major concern. On both fronts, the Bill does not address the real needs of financial services.
<P>
Let us consider the case of Barings, which prima facie involved a failure of supervision, but involved other factors as well. I have a little personal knowledge of the matter; I had better own up to having been the first person to introduce Barings to financial futures--the market in which, sadly, it lost its money.
<P>
I worked in the City in the early 1980s, and I persuaded the directors of Barings to view a presentation about the new financial futures market. I went to their elegant office at the top of a tower. After my presentation, they conferred briefly before the senior director looked at me across the exquisite tea service that had been laid before us and said with a smile, "Thank you for taking so much trouble, Mr. St. Aubyn, but we have decided that financial futures are not the type of business that Barings should attempt to understand". That was a good judgment on the part of the directors in 1982, and it shows that second thoughts are not always best, as it appears that even in 1995, the directors of Barings still did not really understand financial futures.
<P>
More surprisingly--this goes to the heart of the clause--it would appear that the Bank of England did not entirely understand financial futures either. When the affair blew up in its face, it became evident that the Bank of England did not understand what was going on. The directors of Barings wrote to the Bank to explain that they were transferring hundreds of millions of pounds to Singapore. They argued that that did not breach their guidelines on not lending too much to any one customer because they were lending to the whole of the financial futures market in which there are many customers.
<P>
A moment's thought would have led the directors to realise that either they were in an uncovered position and the transfer was necessary to meet margin calls--that is not a credit, but a market risk--or their operator in Singapore had a different type of contract to match his futures position on the other side. That is what he told the bank. However, if that were true, why would he need the money? His costs were on the other side and he was not being paid as fast as he needed in order to pay the exchange. A moment's thought about the principles of banking should have made the Bank of England--if not the directors of Barings--realise that, if Barings was not taking a market risk, it must have been taking a credit risk.
<P>
The failure to think in the Barings case sets alarm bells ringing. There is nothing in the Bill to give us confidence that that type of weakness will be addressed. In fact, we should return to first principles. Instead of saying that the fault was in the system and trying to score political points in a naive or childish manner at the expense of the previous Government, Ministers should recognise a more fundamental point. Banks will do things off their own bat for which they must be answerable. From time to time, they will make catastrophic mistakes. The role of the Bank is to insulate the cost of that mistake and ensure that the rest of the system does not suffer as a result.
<P>
If the Bank of England wants to employ people who are up to speed with the latest financial ideas, it will have to bankroll and poach the best people in the City to act as supervisors rather than as wealth generators. They are successful 99 times out of 100 without the need for heavy-handed regulation.
<P>
The clause is worrying because it may open up an avenue for the new supervisory body to demand more and more information. However, as we saw from the Barings case, it was not lack of information, but lack of understanding that was the problem. I should like to hear the Economic Secretary's view, but it must be recognised that there will be limits on the understanding of whoever regulates the banking system.

<P>
If the Government are suggesting that a higher degree of understanding will be achieved, they are putting their imprimatur on the system in such a way that, should a problem arise, they will be held responsible in a manner that the previous Government were not. Whatever one may say about the Barings debacle, the fact is that the taxpayer was not asked to contribute a single penny to the cost of sorting it out. There is a danger that, in assuming the new powers that ultimately reside at the top of the Chancellor's single peak of authority, we might find that he will start writing large cheques out of our bank accounts.
<P>
Finally, there is nothing in the Bill that explains how the mechanism will work when someone thinks of a new market for London. Speed in this matter is important. Let us take the case of the contract in the London futures market that trades in German Government bonds--bunds, as they are called. Extraordinarily, the price of German Government bonds is set in London and not in Frankfurt, although the volume of trade in Germany is catching up.
<P>
Under European monetary union, there will be a whole new world of euro bonds and a race to be the most successful in euro financial contracts. It is vital to the future of London as a financial centre not that we join 
the euro but that we are the market that decides not only the price but the interest rate in long-term bonds.
<P>
I am concerned that the proposals will severely hamper the speed and initiative needed by the markets that develop those new products. We could suffer a similar problem to the one that Frankfurt has had for years with the Bundesbank, which has occasionally allowed us to catch it asleep, as we did over the development of a new market in its own bonds. I believe that our competitive advantage will suffer as a result of the proposals and I look forward to hearing the hon. Lady's comments on those important points.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is looking forward to my comments. The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, so let me quote a phrase of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Consistently is the hallmark of mediocrity."<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
At least we cannot accuse the hon. Member for Daventry of mediocrity, although the charge of inconsistency could be levelled against him. His speech will guarantee that the Official Report of this sitting will be a bestseller, as it contained a number of concessions that are of considerable interest to me and other Labour members of the Committee. It encapsulated why there was a change of Government on 1 May and why, shortly afterwards, the new Chancellor announced that we would reform the financial regulation system. On 1 May, the people not only voted for a new Labour Government but signalled their distrust of what had been going on. Our rapid moves to reform financial regulation were in part a result of the blind eye that was turned to some of the devastating failures of the past 18 years.
<P>
We discussed personal pensions mis-selling. I offer the Committee a critical statistic as an example of how far greater rigour in financial regulation can bring about greater confidence among the people. When we took office on 1 May, less than two per cent. of those identified as having been mis-sold personal pensions in the nine to 10 years previously had received any compensation or redress. Seven months on, eight times that figure are being compensated, but we still have a way to go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is 16 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman shows that he can do his sums. That is 16 per cent. of the real people who come to his constituency surgeries, as they come to mine, with heart-breaking stories of how they thought that they were provided for only to discover that they were not. In reforming the regulations, the Government want to give confidence to the less sophisticated investors, enabling them to benefit from the strength of this country's financial services, and to secure a regulatory regime that gives rise to creativity and allows us to maintain our competitive edge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Lady has a great commitment to ensuring that justice is eventually done. We applaud her efforts. On a point of information, I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the valuable, crucial work of her predecessor as Economic Secretary, the former hon. Member for Erewash, Mrs Angela Knight. Many of the leaps and bounds that have been made over the past couple of years are due in large part to her.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I did not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we do not have points of information in Standing Committees. He must just ask a question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> May I provide a point of information that will allow the Committee to draw its own conclusions? 
I reiterate my statement: less than two per cent. of those who were mis-sold personal pensions were compensated by 1 May. That figure is deplorable. Opportunities were available for the same action to be taken by the previous Government that this Government have taken, but they failed to take it.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It would seem transparent that that was a complicated process but, inevitably, more cases will be solved as time goes on. There will be stages when there is an acceleration of the process. I am delighted 
that, following the hon. Lady's accession to her responsibilities, agreement can be reached with the companies that sold the pensions, so that matters can move forward. But it would be graceless and completely out of character of the hon. Lady not to acknowledge the hard work of her predecessor, Mrs Angela Knight, when she was a member of the Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sorry, but I must again reiterate that, over a period of between nine and 10 years, only two per cent. of those people who were mis-sold personal pensions have been compensated. That shows the extent to which the foot was not put on the accelerator in the way that it should have been put. If we can increase the number of settlements to more than 16 per cent. in seven months by putting on the pressure, what could have been done before and how many people would not have gone to their graves worried about the consequences for their families of their being mis-sold personal pensions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> What proportion of the increase of between two per cent. and 16 per cent. is the direct responsibility of the actions of the current Government and how many settlements would have been reached anyway?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is difficult to extrapolate such a figure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Of course it is.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is becoming over-excited. On 17 May, I met the chief executives of those companies which had the biggest number of cases to conclude. It was glaringly obvious to us all that the penny had not dropped about the seriousness of the matter. It was after that meeting that the position began to improve.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has been a Member of Parliament for some time and I am sure that he, like me, has to deal with cases of personal pensions mis-selling in his constituency surgeries. Indeed, some hon. Members have to deal with more cases than others. For example, I have a high proportion of miners in my constituency and the National Coal Board scheme was one of the schemes that created the greatest difficulty because people were specifically encouraged out of that scheme.
<P>
We are at least beginning to see signs of movement, but it is still not good enough. It is far from acceptable that upwards of 80 per cent. of people are still waiting for redress. I make no bones about it. That was in our minds when we sought to reform the financial services regulations. We recognise the importance of such services in our economy. if we are to have a world-leading financial services sector, we must have clean and efficient markets in which people have confidence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked me to define regulation and to explain the purpose behind it. It is to secure clean and efficient markets that are well-managed with a transparent system of regulation. We need transparency in financial services regulation. Until now, we have not had that transparency.
<P>
As I said in response to the debate on a previous clause, it is important that people who seek redress should know exactly which point of entry to the system to approach. At present, there are nine different structures and a plethora of ombudspersons all over the place. There should be one point of access that allows people a degree of security when they have difficulties.
<P>
At various points during our discussions this morning, there were references to the different structures of financial services in this country. The hon. Member for Daventry made an excellent point about the differences between the retail and wholesale sectors of the market. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred to remarks made by the Chief Secretary in opposition about the structure of financial services regulation.
<P>
For some time, there has been debate in this country about whether a twin peaks system of regulation would be more effective than a single regulator. After great deliberation, the Government have concluded that a single regulator would provide a more coherent system of regulating financial services. However, if that regulator sought to regulate every aspect of financial services in the same way--and that relates to some of our earlier discussions--the system would be unmanageable and would quickly dissolve into chaos.
<P>
At the lower end of the market, in the retail area, sophisticated products are sold to unsophisticated investors, who require the maximum protection. We all learnt that lesson from the personal pensions mis-selling debacle. At the wholesale end of the market, we need a different structure--a different operation of regulation. It should not be a box-ticking exercise, which would achieve very little--I take the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry on that matter. At that end of the market, caveat emptor can properly apply, because the buyers are more sophisticated and should know what they are doing.
<P>
The Government also want to leave scope for creativity. The hon. Member for Guildford mentioned new products, some of which we already know about; others will be available in the future. Perhaps they will be products that even the hon. Gentleman has not thought about. We must leave room for creativity within the marketplace. We cannot guarantee against failure; to do so would be to remove risk completely from the operation.
<P>
The removal of risk, especially at the wholesale end of the market, would have two results. First, it would restrict creativity; and, secondly, it would take away an important safeguard because risk concentrates minds. We must recognise that financial services will always entail a degree of risk.
<P>
At the same time, the financial services regulator must not suggest to less sophisticated investors that they will get recompense if their investments fail. He cannot say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "If you have been properly advised and your investments do not meet the rate of return that you hoped for, you will be recompensed,"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this case, the "you" might even be you, 
Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
If customers take proper advice and then do not get the rate of return that they had hoped for, they cannot turn to the regulator and say that that is a fault of the regulation system. They must recognise that people are free to choose. Consumer education is a key element of the new remit for the financial services authority. It will ensure that the less sophisticated investor has access to much more information.
<P>
I have ranged widely because our discussion this morning was so wide ranging. Indeed, I began to think that we had reached the Second Reading of the--as yet unwritten--financial services Bill. The Government had hoped to introduce such a Bill in the first Queen's Speech. That was not possible because the Bill before us deals with fundamental legislation relating to changes in the organisation of monetary policy, and that took precedence.

<P>
I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary. The fact that he is not in the Room makes it easier for me to do that; it is not part of the instinct of Scots to pay one another compliments. His securing of advance drafting authority for legislation was a considerable achievement. Not only can we now guarantee legislation in the next parliamentary Session, but there will be the opportunity for a considerable period of consultation. By that I do not mean just the consultation on the operation of the Financial Services Authority that has just been announced. I am reminded of the reference that has been made to the skills that Howard Davies brings to such matters. He has retained his sense of humour, and still supports Manchester City. The consultation process to be carried out by the Financial Services Authority about how it operates will be followed by consultation on the pillars of the legislation. We want the current reform of financial services legislation to result in the establishment of a regulator fit for the next century.
<P>
We have discussed competitive advantage. A regulator such as I have described would contribute to securing greater competitive advantage for financial services in the City of London and other relevant parts of the United Kingdom, such as Edinburgh. The costs and transparency of regulation are critical when global money is seeking a place to invest. It is important to engage practitioners as well as consumers and legislators in helping to develop the financial services regulator.

If, as a result of the Government's precipitate action, the current system should be weakened--there might be a cost in terms of morale, for example--would not the fault lie with the Government?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's second point is nonsense. By making it he condemns the existing regulators as unprofessional. The present chairman of the Financial Services Authority has repeatedly been reminded by Government that no eyes must stray from the ball, and one of his ways of ensuring that is to separate the team in charge of transition from the others involved in the day-to-day process of regulation. That is done to ensure that regulation proceeds at the same time.
<P>
I should like to return to the amendment that we began to debate two hours ago. One reason for the inclusion of the transfer of banking supervision in the Bill is the fact that the Bill makes fundamental changes to the Bank of England. The appropriate time for the change to be made is during our reform of the Bank. Bank of England legislation has not been revisited for 50 years. The present Bill presents an opportunity to deal with all aspects of the Bank's functioning. The Bill transfers existing structures of banking supervision. It will accomplish a reversal out of the Bank of England into the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
When the new Financial Services Authority is fully functional--there will be transitional arrangements--a key sector that will have to be taken into account is that many banks and financial institutions now perform a mix of financial services business. This is welcome news to the bank. Seven or eight regulators at a time can be dealing with some institutions. Different compliance books can be required. That is costly. The cost of financial services regulation is a critical element. If the cost is not proportionate to the benefit, the impact of the regulator is reduced.
<P>
I hope that I misunderstood the remarks of the hon. Member for Guildford about the Mike Williams case. He seemed to suggest that when a company is in difficulty, the regulation should take place with a lighter touch. That is unacceptable. When companies are in difficulty, the regulator must take a more specific interest in their activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but I was not suggesting that. Rather, I used the Mike Williams case to illustrate the risks of regulating in difficult circumstances and of imposing the full force of the regulator to remedy the situation. The regulatory authority should be aware of the possibility that its action might have the adverse effect of precipitating an even worse crisis. That is a problem for the Bank supervisor in investigating potential difficulties. If the supervisor undermines confidence in the Bank, he may precipitate a much bigger crisis than existed in the first place. I was talking about the difficult role of the regulator, not whether he should perform that role.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a case for a single peak approach to regulation, whereby regulation and supervision can be viewed together and cross-fertilisation can take place. The hon. Gentleman said that Barings was a prima facie case of failed supervision. I find that strange, as most people would regard it as a failure of management and systems, which highlighted the need for closer co-operation between supervisors--
internationally as well as nationally.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is important to clarify these matters. Barings was prima facie a failure of internal supervision at all levels within the company. I also explained that a failure of banking supervision allowed the bank to ship out vast sums of money to Singapore, way beyond its usual limit, without proper control.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> When the hon. Gentleman makes a point about the failure of supervision within a company, he is really talking about a failure of management within it. Management cannot be absolved from the responsibility of ensuring that structures are in place to allow proper knowledge and supervision of what is happening. The hon. Gentleman was amusing when he spoke about the attitude of Barings to the futures market. I am sure that there are people at the top of many companies who do not fully understand the financial instruments that are being traded in their name.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford spoke about fraud, a subject on which I have recently made some speeches. Many issues have to be addressed about regulation and criminal wrongdoing. The Solicitor-General has also recently made speeches on the need for longer-term legislative changes--for example, to allow an exchange of information between the regulator and relevant authorities regarding Inland Revenue fraud. Legislative prohibitions prevent such an exchange of information, which can often be critically important to the regulator as well as to the Inland Revenue. If the Inland Revenue can identify an unusual situation, it can often be a useful flag to the regulators that something fishy is going on.
<P>
The Government are anxious to get it across to companies that they cannot turn a blind eye. No one in the financial services industry should be able to put profit above compliance with the law on fraud. My officials and those of other Departments are carefully considering ways of improving the detection as well as the prosecution of fraud. I have met the police and private investigators in that regard. I want actions against fraud to be more coherent and better managed.
<P>
I shall move on to some other points. We got very excited about the Governor's eyebrows. I had terrible problems when I was a television reporter because I could not control the way that my eyebrows went up--so I took that point to heart. While nothing in the legislation has the intention of removing the Bank's control of, and central role in, the financial sector, a flexible style of regulation is necessary. We are committed to transparency in the system; that is important in regulation, where the rules are known to the customers as well as to the main players. If the Committee will forgive me for making a sexist point, there is something of the gentlemen's club about the current system--so and so was at school with so and so, and knows him to be a jolly nice chap. That is not enough to give the reassurance that people require in the market place, and the system needs to be opened up and transparency introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Lady says that there is no attempt to diminish the Governor's authority; why, then, is the Chancellor and not the Governor at the head of the single peak of super-SIB?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Because at the end of the day it comes back to transparency and accountability. Ultimately, the House makes legislation and the only people who can answer for it are Members of the House.
<P>
I return to the substantive point that we have almost forgotten about, but which we are here to discuss--the amendment. At the beginning of our discussion, the hon. Member for Daventry said, somewhat disingenuously, that he hoped that I would not assume that it was a wrecking amendment. The amendment would cancel the transfer of banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority but, oddly, would still allow the transfer of the Bank's functions under the second banking co-ordination directive regulations, which relate to inward and outward passporting of banks and other credit institutions, and also the transfer of the Bank's power to disapply the temporary takeover protection for demutualised building societies that have become banks. So I can only assume that the amendment was put down as a mechanism for debate rather than a serious attempt to change the Bill. If 
the amendment were accepted, we would end up with 
a completely unmanageable situation. I therefore recommend that it be rejected.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Daventry, it may be convenient for the Committee if I say that I have taken a view and will be advising my co-Chairman, the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), that Standing Order No. 68 should apply and that there should be no clause stand part debate. 
I have been generous and allowed the debate to be wide. Secondly, as a Hibs supporter, I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Croydon, Central.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I respect your wisdom, Mr. McWilliam, because we have had a wide-ranging debate. I should like briefly to draw its strands together. It was enlivened and adorned by the thoughtful contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford with his experience of, and international perspective on, the pitfalls that can arise in practical banking. However, I hope that he will allow me to give the accolade for the most interesting and revealing intervention to the hon. Member for Eastwood 
(Mr. Murphy), who referred to the cost of non-regulation. He exemplified the concern of Conservative Members, which goes back to my earlier analogy about mothballs. If there is a problem with hitting the target, the Government's apparent recourse is to apply yet more mothballs to ensure that you, Mr. McWilliam, or the person afflicted with moths, gets them next time. We must have the balance that we have been debating--and it has been a thoughtful debate--between the costs and benefits of regulation, the relative impacts in different sectors and the proportionality of the operation.
<P>
I freely concede the Economic Secretary's point about those who are relatively financially unsophisticated. Indeed, as long ago as the 1970s, I spent some time considering the position of the Trustee Savings banks, and their evolution has been remarkable. Some investors get into difficulties and are ill-advised, and I am sure that all hon. Members would like to help. I hope that the new structure will provide some benefit.
<P>
The Economic Secretary emphasised the importance of clean and efficient regulation. A single point of access and greater rigour is likely to lead to greater confidence in the system. I would not cavil against that. However, an intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford and the Economic Secretary's contribution raised some revealing aspects.
<P>
In particular, I dissent from the hon. Lady's emphasis on personal pensions--I nearly said her obsession--not because the mis-selling of pensions is not a serious issue, not even because it has gone faster than we want, because the faster it goes the better. However, if Ministers become obsessed with that side of it, it will send out two signals: first, that despite the Economic Secretary's remarks, emphasis will be placed on the retail end to the exclusion of the other; and, secondly, that Ministers will be too ready to micro-manage financial regulation, an activity that, under the memorandum, is quite properly remitted to the authority.
<P>
The Economic Secretary rightly said that we will have a further debate on Second Reading. I am glad of the delay because we all need time to stand back and think. Once the Government have presented the legislation, the authority will already be set up. However, we need to get the balance right. Interventions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford and others point to a counterpart.
<P>
The Economic Secretary made some concessions. 
I noted with pleasure her reference to proportionality. 
I noted also that she said that it was impossible to guarantee against failure. She emphasised the importance of competitiveness and the international role of the City of London. We share those views. We feel, however, that the genesis of what has been presented to us was an emphasis on worries for the less sophisticated investor at the retail end and about failure as it affects individuals. Those are important issues, but if they feed through into the riding instructions for the authority in its new guise, and for its role of banking supervision, there is a danger that it may displace the equally important international role of the City of London.

<P>
The problem with greater rigour leading to greater confidence is that if the rigour is inappropriate, however much is loaded on, there will be no wholesale financial sector to regulate. That should not be taken to mean that I would wish for some sort of soft regulation with regulatory dumping, going for the softest possible approach to international regulation. Going back to the points we made about box ticking, I would like to see a more flexible and more holistic approach to the regulation of wholesale markets, perhaps more so than the American Securities and Exchange Commission is currently practising. We might thus set an example to the rest of the world. As financial institutions grow and become more sophisticated, they need a flexible response appropriate to their situation.
<P>
As we have no details about the authority's operation, those areas between retail and wholesale, within the single peak, are still opaque. That worries me. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, I am also worried that we are in an awkward state of transition. We are in that moment of uncertainty before the new regulations come in. Although there was a certain wisdom in the Labour party in opposition calling for an evolutionary approach, bringing together the retail and wholesale sectors, there may be some difficulty in the short term caused by what is still a very hasty system.
<P>
Those are real worries. Despite the Economic Secretary's assurances and her warm words towards some aspects of the City of London, I advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.
