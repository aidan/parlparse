							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): Welcome to the Chair,
Mrs. Humble, for this afternoon&#146;s
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="0803059000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concerns about clause 44 and subsequent clauses centre on the extensive
power that they will give to the Secretary of State, and I hope that
the Minister will shortly be in a position to give us greater clarity
on the proposals.</div>
					<a name="0803059000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
principal concern is that companies that will be asked, or will
volunteer, to build nuclear power stations will want as much clarity as
possible. The clauses give the Secretary of State tremendous powers to
alter what is required of those companies. Will the Minister give us
information on the possible time scales? Do the clauses relate to
programmes before decommissioning starts, or will the power relate to
changing the decommissioning programme once it is in place? There could
be a major difference in how it is
applied.</div>
					<a name="0803059000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">What if
significant extra costs are involved which the decommissioning fund is
not initially set up to cover and the programme
becomes very expensive? That comes back to the Liberal Democrat
amendment proposed this morning. How will those extra costs be factored
in when the Secretary of State requires those companies to be involved
in the fund? How much notice will the Secretary of State have to give
of the changes that are being proposed? If the notice is given
while the decommissioning is under way, is there provision whereby he
can say, &#147;This must start tomorrow or next week&#148;, or will
he expect those arrangements to allow for many years of planning before
they come into
force?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000455"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b> Welcome to the Chair
for this afternoon&#146;s sitting, Mrs.
Humble.</div>
					<a name="0803059000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
permission, Mrs. Humble, I would like to correct for the
record a response that I made this morning, as it might be helpful to
the Committee. In answer to the hon. Member for Cheltenham, I explained
that the Paris convention, to which the UK is a signatory, sets out a
financial limit for operator liability in the event of a nuclear
incident above which public funds may be used to meet third-party
liability. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>should have referred to the fact that the convention, not EU law, sets a
minimum level rather than a limit. That was my
error.</div>
					<a name="0803059000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Paris
convention, the usual limit is currently 15 million special drawing
rights, which is about &#163;12 million. The UK has gone further than
that; we have chosen to exceed the normal maximum limit per incident in
our implementing legislation by setting the normal level at &#163;140
million.</div>
					<a name="0803059000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
are currently analysing options for nuclear operators to obtain
financial security for new heads of damages set out in the amending
protocol to the Paris convention. We intend to publish a
consultation document on the amended convention later this year. I
apologise to the Committee for getting that wrong. Nevertheless, I hope
that what I have said further satisfies the Liberal Democrats in
relation to taxpayer protection.</div>
					<a name="0803059000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden raised the issue of what we mean by
&#147;unreasonable delay&#148;. Again, I would like to be as
helpful as I can in answering, but I cannot be arithmetically precise.
First, the time involved in considering the proposal will depend on its
quality and complexity. If it is of a lower quality, we will
understandably wish to seek clarity, which will necessarily involve
additional time. If the proposed programme involves complex financial
arrangements, for example, that will also be likely to involve a longer
period of
consideration.</div>
					<a name="0803059000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are statutory procedures that we must follow, such as consulting
the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment
Agency, or its equivalent in Northern Ireland. In addition, we would
expect to consult the new board, which might also need to obtain expert
advice. Thirdly, if the Secretary of State was minded to require a
modification, he must give the operator and others with obligations
under the programme an opportunity to make written
representations.</div>
					<a name="0803059000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
try to give a more precise answer to the hon. Gentleman, we might be
talking about three to six months for the straightforward cases. For
more complex cases, it could take a month or two more than that
estimate. Estimates will necessarily be linked to the particular case
under consideration. However, it is in no one&#146;s interest for
that process to be either rushed, or unnecessarily or unreasonably
delayed.</div>
					<a name="0803059000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked whether the Secretary of State&#146;s power
unilaterally to modify an approved programme might create uncertainty
for the operator. When the Secretary of State approves a programme, he
does so to ensure that prudent provision has been made for the
technical matters and for the financing of designated technical
matters. Where he approves a programme, the Secretary of State is
saying that it meets this requirement and that it adequately addresses
the matters set out in the guidance, currently out to consultation, to
be issued under clause
50.</div>
					<a name="0803059000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that the Secretary of State retains the power to modify an approved
programme because it is an important part of the enforcement regime. In
such circumstances, the Secretary of State might exercise the power to
modify or impose an obligation to ensure that the necessary actions
were carried out to bring the programme back into line with the
approved programme. He might impose obligations to ensure that the
breach did not occur again. It also enables him 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>to respond to changes in circumstances such as a change of control of
the operator, as set out in more detail in the funding guidance as part
of the funded decommissioning programme guidance consultation currently
under way.</div>
					<a name="0803059000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State might make a modification or
impose an obligation where it is felt that the
programme no longer meets the principles set out in guidance, or
perhaps where the robustness of an associate body&#146;s provision
for financial security is reduced. That would be one answer to that
question.</div>
					<a name="0803059000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
procedure for making a modification is set out in clause 45 and, for
example, we must consult the interested bodies before making a
notification. Ideally, we would work with the
operator to make a modification. However, in a quick change in
circumstances, such as when there is a change in the control of the
operator, the modification might have to be very quick indeed. The hon.
Gentleman will understand that I cannot be precise, but I hope that is
a helpful
answer.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000456"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The clause sets the procedure for
modifying an approved programme whether the
modification is proposed by the Secretary of State or by other parties
such as the operator. It sets out who should be informed of the
proposed modifications, ensures that the Secretary of State is informed
in writing of any proposed modification, if not made by him, and
approves all modifications.</div>
					<a name="0803059000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to have the ability to modify a programme once it has been
approved. The power will provide the necessary flexibility for approved
programmes to take account of the kind of changes I mentioned in
relation to clause 44. Requiring the Secretary of State&#146;s
approval to any modification will ensure appropriate oversight of
operators&#146; programmes.</div>
					<a name="0803059000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regardless of
who puts forward the proposal, the clause allows for any costs
associated with the consideration of the proposed modification to be
passed on to the operator. These costs might arise from seeking
verification of the impact of the proposed modification on, for
example, the cost of managing waste. We will set out in regulations how
the charges will be calculated and when they will be payable.</div>
					<a name="0803059000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a duty on the Secretary
of State to give the operator, any other person with obligations under
the programme and any person on whom the proposed modification will
have an impact the opportunity to make written representations. That
will mean that all those who have or will have obligations as a result
of the modification will be given a chance to express their views on
the impact the proposal might have on their activities. He will also
need to take into account those representations, of
course.</div>

							<b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): Will the Minister clarify
something? Will there be a right of appeal against decisions that were
made despite
representations?</div>
					<a name="0803059000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000458"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I hope to cover that important question in due
course.</div>
					<a name="0803059000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">When deciding
whether a modification is to be made, this clause, like clause 41,
requires that the Secretary of State must exercise his power only with
the aim of securing that prudent provision is being made for the
technical matters, the financing of the designated technical matters
and the cost estimates of those matters.</div>
					<a name="0803059000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Secretary of State proposes to make a modification, he will have to
determine that the programme originally submitted no longer makes
prudent provision for those matters. In determining that, the Secretary
of State will make reference to the guidance in force. Additionally,
the Secretary of State will take into consideration comments made by
the interested parties.</div>
					<a name="0803059000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the appeals procedure, as is
the case with all issues across Government where the Secretary of State
has the power to make the final decision, disputes between the operator
and the Secretary of State can be settled by recourse to administrative
law procedures. Therefore, an appeals procedure is not necessary. I am
advised that that is also consistent with analogous legislation such as
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and also in terms of legislation for
offshore renewables.

Wicks:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The Secretary of State can make regulations
so that the procedure set out in the clause does not apply to certain
modifications. Regulations made under the clause could set a material
financial threshold for operational and technical changes in terms of
their impact on decommissioning and waste management cost estimates, so
that any changes below that level&#151;or, indeed, any cumulative
changes over a certain period&#151;would not need the Secretary of
State&#146;s
approval.</div>
					<a name="0803059000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
tiered approach is consistent with that of the Health and Safety
Executive and its enforcement of safety standards under licence
condition 22 of the nuclear site licence. This power is important
because it allows the operator to concentrate on running the station
without having to seek approval for modifications which, for example,
do not impact significantly on the costs of waste and
decommissioning.</div>
					<a name="0803059000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
ensure that the clause does not have negative
implications for health, safety or environmental
matters, the Secretary of State is required to consult interested
bodies prior to making the regulations. Regulations made under the
clause will also set out how the operator is to inform the Secretary of
State of such modifications. That will ensure that the Secretary of
State is made aware of any changes to an approved programme, even 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>if he does not have to approve them. The Secretary of State has other
powers in the Bill and the programme to obtain information about such
changes.</div>
					<a name="0803059000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0803059000460"></a>
							<b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): I have just a brief question in
response to the Minister&#146;s comments. We are in the strange
situation of deciding that although clause 45 has decent provisions and
sets out how things should be done, clause 46 states that the Secretary
of State does not have to do any of that if he does not want
to.</div>
					<a name="0803059000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I first
read that, I imagined that it was an emergency
provision&#151;something changes which means that it is important
that the funded decommissioning plan is suddenly changed. I can
understand why we would then disapply the careful safeguards set out in
the previous clause, but the Secretary of State&#151;I mean the
Minister; I am getting ahead of myself&#151;is saying the opposite,
in that the proposal is de minimis and these are piddling, if I may use
that word, little changes. He says that the Government do not want big
paraphernalia because they are only changing small things, but that is
not remotely apparent from reading clause 46.</div>
					<a name="0803059000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Cheltenham will try to catch your eye, Mrs. Humble, to raise
slightly separate issues, but my worry is that the proposal is so vague
and all-embracing that, essentially, we have agreed a set of procedures
that seemed reasonable in clause 45, but we are now giving the
Secretary of State carte blanch to rip them all
up&#151;albeit after consultation&#151;on unspecified grounds which
may be specified later. It seems so sweeping. Will the Minister reflect
on whether the power is too broad and will rip up what we have just
agreed to? The clause might say that it is to be used only in cases in
which the regulatory burden of applying clause 45 is excessive and so
on, but we do not even have any clues on that. I think that clause 46
is far too broadly
drawn.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.

pleasure it is to see you in the Chair, Mrs.
Humble?</div>
					<a name="0803059000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise a question which I asked earlier on consultation. I am equally
concerned about the rather broad terms of the clause and that changes
might be made that would have an impact on the local
population almost without it knowing about them. Will the Minister
describe the changes that could occur and give us an inkling about
their size? Does he think that there might be a need to consider
consulting on the matter, in the way that he promised
earlier?</div>

					<a name="0803059000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed a
number of amendments under clause 42 this morning, one of which we will
later press to a vote. We will not press amendment No. 42, but it seems
appropriate to refer to it in the context of this clause. It is about
the right to consultation of the nuclear liabilities financing
assurance board and whether that body will be consulted or informed
when changes are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>made. The Health and Safety Executive, the Environment
Agency and others are listed and will be consulted by the Secretary of
State. However, the very body that is supposed to deal with the
financial arrangements of a funded decommissioning programme will
apparently not be consulted because it is not
specified.</div>
					<a name="0803059000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will the
NLFAB carry out its functions if under subsection (3) modifications can
be made by reference to the financial consequences of
a decommissioning programme and yet there is no provision for the
involvement of the very body that is supposed to exercise scrutiny over
this matter? According to the White Paper, the NLFAB is supposed to
provide advice to the Secretary of State on the regular reviews and
ongoing scrutiny of funding arrangements. How will it do so if it will
not even be informed when modifications to funded decommissioning
programmes on the basis of financial consequences take place? Perhaps
the Minister will clarify how that process will work in
practice.</div>

							<a name="0803059000463"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The hon. Member for Northavon was worried about the
implications of a get-out clause. I am not sure if that was his phrase,
but some might put it like that. I reassure him that we will lay out in
regulations by negative procedure the circumstances in which the
modification procedure under clause 45 will not apply. I will give him
more reassurance on that matter later if I can. It will be debatable in
the House, if appropriate, and we will look at the implications of it
in regulations, taking into account his
concerns.</div>
					<a name="0803059000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northampton, South talked about the local community and the
local authority in an earlier discussion. I think that that is more or
less within the same family of questions. I said this
morning that I would look at the matter and come back to the Committee.
I do not think that either hon. Gentleman is saying that the local
authority should have a role over the financial arrangements or the
actuarial issues regarding the fund. They are concerned that there
could be a change to the environment, for example because of a new

local authority should have a role. I am taking advice to see whether
such things are covered under existing planning law, but I do not think
that I will receive it today. If it is not covered, I will find out
whether there needs to be further action and will come back to the hon.

the nature of the board this morning and talked about what it is and
what it is not. It will give regular advice to the Secretary of State.
We do not feel that it needs the powers that the hon. Member for
Cheltenham is prescribing because it will be there as part of
government&#151;with a small &#147;g&#148;&#151;to advise us. I
see no danger that we will not be able to benefit from its advice. I do

						</b> According to the White Paper, the purpose of the
nuclear liabilities financing assurance board is not simply to give
advice but to provide scrutiny, specifically with respect to the
financial arrangements. However, the clause is about changes to funded
decommissioning programmes, with specific reference to their financial
consequences, and yet there seems to be no mechanism or expressed
intention to involve the scrutiny body that we are just about to set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>up in changes to the funded decommissioning programmes as they happen.
Surely that is an essential prerequisite. Indeed, it would be useful to
know what kind of financial consequences the Government have in mind in
subsection (3). I would be grateful if the Minister could reassure me
that the body will be involved in these
processes.</div>

be set out in the annual report that the operator will have to submit
as part of the programme. That is part of the transparency&#151;or
scrutiny&#151;process. The Secretary of State has powers in the Bill
to obtain more information if he is not satisfied with the changes that
the operator has made. There will be transparency about these changes
and the board will therefore be able to hear about them and give us
advice on that if there is a concern.</div>

had originally been submitted for approval under clause 42. This means

<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>date on which the notice is given. This means that he cannot set a date
for the modification to be required to take effect before the
operator had notice of it. However, this does not prevent the Secretary
of State from imposing a modification in a very short time scale. This
mirrors the process used, for example, by the HSE where, in extremis,

two circumstances. The first instance is referred to as Condition A.

an obligation that is subject to clause 44 and the full modification
procedure under clause 45. If condition B applies, the Secretary of
State can request the information or documentation from any of those
persons who would have an obligation under the programme if the
modification were to be made. If an operator fails to comply with a
request for information, the Secretary of State can make an application
to the High Court for an order. If the order is granted, it may require
the person to take such steps as the High Court may direct in order to
comply with the Secretary of State&#146;s notice. If the person
failed to comply with the court order, the normal penalties for
contempt of court would

confidence. This is one of the difficulties that we
are grappling with in these situations. Let us always remember that we
are talking about private companies and that there will be competition
between those companies. Issues about commercial confidentiality are
therefore very important. However, information will, of course, be

Under the previous few clauses, we have discussed the necessity of
modifications and how those are likely to take place. We have talked
about the changing circumstances that might apply, which might even
change the foundation on which some of the funded decommissioning
programmes were established. They might change the whole nature of the
companies with which the programmes had been established. Some might be
facing liquidation or merger

						</b> Before I turn to the amendment, perhaps I could
give a late answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for
Wealden. Essentially, he was asking why we needed to request
information. The answer is that the Secretary of State&#146;s powers
to refuse to approve a proposed funded
decommissioning programme would act as a strong incentive for any
operator to provide information on request. However, where the
Secretary of State is considering a modification and does not have
information to help him to decide, this same strong incentive would not
exist. Such a power, therefore, ensures that the Secretary of State can
get the information that he requires. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman

that the Minister

give an answer that relates to a clause that we have gone past. I
wonder whether I may ask for guidance from the Chair? May we ask for a
suspension of the Committee when it is not possible to get an answer to
the questions that we have raised so that the Minister can get the
briefing that he requires and we can make a proper informed decision on
each clause? We will be reluctant to vote against a clause simply
because we do not have the information available. We wish to make a

From time to time a member of a Committee will ask a perfectly

							<a name="0803059000485"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Now to the amendment, which raises the important
issue of reviewing a funded decommissioning programme. The purpose of
clause 49 is to allow the Secretary of State to acquire information at
any time from the operator on the operation of the programme and the
ability of the programme to meet the operator&#146;s future
liabilities. Given the power contained within clause 49 and what we
have said in the draft guidance about our intention to review
programmes, the amendment does not add anything further to the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers. Therefore, we feel that the
amendment is unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="0803059000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have stated in the draft
guidance that the operator will be expected to carry out both annual
and quinquennial&#151;as the Committee now knows, this means every
five years&#151;reviews of the programme. Reports of such reviews
should be submitted to the Secretary of State. Under the guidance, the
persons responsible for managing the independent fund will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>also have to report to the Secretary of State on an
annual and quinquennial basis. Therefore, the amendment would duplicate
this requirement.</div>
					<a name="0803059000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would expect the annual reports to set up those changes that have
occurred during the year and have an impact on the operator&#146;s
liabilities. The size and performance of the fund should also be
reported on. The reviews that take place every five years will ensure
that the cost estimates of the operator&#146;s liabilities remain
accurate and up to date and that the funding arrangements remain
capable of yielding sufficient funds to meet the operator&#146;s
liabilities. We believe that that approach fits with the
Government&#146;s intention to create a principles-based
framework in which the Government set the parameters for the operator
to work within. By placing that type of prescription in the Bill, we
would be directly undermining our principles-based approach. I am
confident that setting out our approach for monitoring and reviewing
programmes in guidance is the right way ahead.</div>
					<a name="0803059000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the programme to be approved
at the outset, the Secretary of State will need to be
satisfied that the reporting structure proposed by the operator is
acceptable. Once approved, should the operator fail to comply with the
reporting requirements agreed with the Secretary of State, it will have
failed to comply with the approved programme, and proposed sanctions
under this chapter of the Bill will apply. I therefore ask the hon.
Gentleman to consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>

The Government have laid this technical amendment. I hope that, by
setting out what clause 49 proposes, I can explain to hon. Members why
the amendment is necessary and why the Committee should accept its
inclusion in the Bill. Clause 49 allows the Secretary of State to
require information to allow him to review an approved programme. The
clause allows the Secretary of State to issue a notice in writing to
obtain information for the express purpose of determining whether a
programme is being complied with, whether it will be possible for
future obligations to be complied with and whether the programme makes
prudent provision for technical matters and certain designated
technical matters. Where the Secretary of State decides, on the basis
of the information submitted as a result of the notice issued by him,
that the programme is not being complied with, that it will not be
possible for future obligations to be met or that the programme no
longer makes prudent provision for technical and certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>designated technical matters, then the clause allows
the Secretary of State to require further information from the
operator, persons with obligations under the programme or any
associated body.</div>
					<a name="0803059000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
further information will help him to decide whether to modify the
programme. Where an operator fails to comply with an initial notice
from the Secretary of State requiring information or with a subsequent
follow-up notice, the Secretary of State can make an application to the
High Court for an order. Further detail on the content of reviews by
the Secretary of State and the information that the operator will
submit is set out in the draft
guidance.</div>
					<a name="0803059000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

to this clause. The amendment adjusts the threshold that the Secretary
of State needs to reach for him to require additional information by
issuing a second notice. The Bill uses the word
&#147;determines&#148; and we consider that it sets a higher
threshold than we think appropriate. Without the amendment, the
Government believe that the Secretary of State would be inappropriately
constrained in his powers to require information, since he would have
to be more or less certain that a modification needed to be made, in
which case he would not need to obtain further information under the
following provisions.</div>
					<a name="0803059000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It therefore makes sense to
reduce the &#147;determines&#148; threshold to one in which the
Secretary of State has &#147;reason to believe&#148;. That will
make it easier to request further information,
helping to ensure that the Secretary of State has the necessary
information that he needs to decide whether to propose a modification,
thereby ensuring that the programme continues to make prudent provision
for the relevant matters. The amendment strengthens the regulatory
framework, improving the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to make
informed decisions on modifications. I duly ask hon. Members to
consider accepting this technical
amendment.</div>

						</b> I hope that the Minister will let us into the
secret of how he manages to get all of his amendments accepted by the
Committee, but somehow none of ours are. Maybe there
will be some clarification in due course and we will manage to persuade
him to see the error of his ways and accept some of the ideas that we
are putting forward. I shall be grateful if the Minister can give us a
legal definition of &#147;has reason to believe&#148;. It seems to
be a very vague phrase. Clearly, we do not want to set the threshold
too high for the Secretary of State to be allowed clarification on a
situation, but this is very woolly indeed. Would it be one letter that
might give him reason to believe? Would it be one Westminster Hall
debate that might set off that investigation, one article in the media,
or whatever? The Minister does need to give us greater clarity for what
he has in mind, because he is asking us to accept this and on the face
of it, we are willing to do so, but some greater clarity is
required.</div>
					<a name="0803059000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">There does
also seem to be a general point, that the Government rather like woolly
phrases. I think that is bad law. People should not have to take test
cases to find out exactly what the law means. The more detail there can
be in the Bill, so that people know if they are complying with the
law&#151;the spirit of the law&#151;the

						</b> I would like to offer some support to the
Minister on this amendment. Given the concerns about secrecy in the
nuclear industry, as well as fears about cost overruns and the adequacy
of these funded decommissioning programmes, it seems to me that, very
far from not setting the threshold too high, we should set it as low as
possible in requiring information from site operators. It is clearly
difficult for the Secretary of State, in the words in the clause,
actually to &#147;determine&#148; that a programme is not being
complied with. One imagines the Minister being some kind of detective.
It would be rather more easy for him simply &#147;to have reason to
believe&#148;. The hon. Member for Wealden seems unduly
worried&#151;all that we are asking for is a lower threshold for the
release of information, it is not some great imposition on the site
operators or some great breach of commercial confidentiality. It seems
to me that that threshold should be as low as possible to allow the
Government maximum flexibility in holding these site operators to
account and making sure that no subsidy means no
subsidy.</div>

brought to him, concerns may have been voiced by Members of this House,
or there may have been a newspaper report that seemed to have an

Wicks:
						</b> Clause 50 confers on the Secretary
of State a power to make regulations, under the
negative procedure, about the preparation, content, implementation and
modification of funded decommissioning programmes and for the charging
of fees. The clause enables the Secretary of State to prescribe details
about how operators will be expected to prepare and implement
programmes and to ensure that they have the adequate protections in
place. It is analogous with provisions in the Energy Act 2004, which
sets out the regime for offshore renewables
decommissioning.</div>
					<a name="0803059000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause allows regulations that make provision for how radioactive and
other hazardous waste will be managed during the operation of the power
station and will then be disposed of; how the power station will be
decommissioned and the site cleaned up; the estimation
of the costs that might be incurred during
decommissioning and waste management, such as how they should be
developed and about the manner in which such estimates should be
verified; the financing of such estimates, including the security
arrangements required; how payments from funds to pay for
decommissioning and waste management are to be made; how information
prescribed or of a description prescribed by regulations is to be
supplied to the Secretary of State; and how fees charged by the
Secretary of State are to be calculated and when they are to be paid.
Regulations can also create offences where specific provisions of the
regulations are contravened. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>Penalties created by the regulations are subject to the same limits as
the offences contained in the Bill, namely a fine not exceeding
&#163;5,000 in a magistrates court, or up to two years&#146;
imprisonment or an unlimited fine in a Crown
court.</div>
					<a name="0803059000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The negative
procedure is considered suitable for the making of regulations under
this power as the content of the regulations will be largely technical.
As I have already mentioned, the provision mirrors the approach set out
in the Energy Act 2004 for the decommissioning of offshore renewable
installations. For example, under that Act, the Secretary of State has
the power to prescribe what security should be provided and to set
sanctions.</div>
					<a name="0803059000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
enabling regulations, the clause confers on the
Secretary of State a power to publish guidance about the preparation,
content, modification and implementation of funded decommissioning
programmes. A copy of any guidance published must be laid before
Parliament. Guidance enables a principles-based approach to be adopted
rather than the more prescriptive approach that is typical of
regulations. The guidance is expected to set out certain baselines or
minima, which the operator would be expected to meet. However, the
Secretary of State recognises that operators may be able to put forward
more effective or efficient methods to decommission their stations and
to clean up their sites, as well as to accumulate the moneys necessary
to do so. Guidance, which is based on principles, enables operators to
put forward such proposals, which may be approved, provided they meet
the
principles.</div>
					<a name="0803059000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior
to the publication of the guidance or the making of regulations,
subsection (6) requires that the Secretary of State consult interested
bodies. The Government do not consider it necessary to subject the
largely technical guidance to a parliamentary procedure, but the
guidance will be laid in the Library. It is not the intention for the
guidance to prescribe how decommissioning programmes should be
formulated and carried out, but rather to allow operators the freedom
to develop their own programmes, within a framework. The guidance will
guide operators in preparing programmes, which may be approvable by the
Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="0803059000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
approach of the clause is analogous to the existing safety and
environmental licensing regime for nuclear, whereby the Health and
Safety Executive and the Environment Agency issue guidance concerning
the exercise of their statutory powers. The HSE
issues guidance on its functions under the Nuclear Installations Act
1965 and the Environment Agency on its functions under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993.</div>

							<a name="0803059000499"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> This is an important clause and raises a number of
substantive issues. I hope that the Minister can paint a picture of the
way that one of these funds will operate. I want to draw an analogy
that he&#151;as a former Pensions Minister&#151;will appreciate,
and it is between one of the funded decommissioning
programmes and an occupational pension scheme. I hope that he will
humour me with the analogy as it helps to illuminate my point. With an
occupational pensions scheme, there is a set of long-lasting
liabilities. The work force might be aged 21 now, but they may need
pensions when they are 100. We are talking about similar time
scales.</div>
					<a name="0803059000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is that the sums of money involved can be very substantial. When
I originally heard about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>the funded decommissioning
programmes, I thought that they would be nothing like occupational
pension schemes and that we were talking about smaller amounts.
However, this morning, the Minister said that the typical
decommissioning cost would be &#163;600 million and the typical
disposal cost would be &#163;300 million. Presumably, and I apologise
if I have got the wrong end of the stick, one of those funds&#151;for
a single operator for a single, typical plant&#151;might at some
point need up to &#163;900 million. If I understand correctly, an
operator could also be running more than one plant, and therefore we
could be talking about literally billions of pounds at peak. Clearly,
there is an inflow and an outflow, which I will return to, but
nevertheless we are talking about huge amounts of money.</div>
					<a name="0803059000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a big
issue about the adequacy of the funds&#151;which we will come to in a
couple of clauses&#151;and about the control of inflow and outflow.
We have been very focused on the inflow into the funds but, under
clause 50, the regulations also talk about the circumstances under
which a site operator can take money out of a fund. That is a critical
point. Presumably, the money must be lumped in up front quite heavily,
and I would like to probe the Minister further on the profile that he
has in mind. I assume that a lot of money has to go in early and then,
as the life of the plant progresses, the operator will start coming
back to the trust fund. I want to stress that the nuclear White Paper
published in January said:</div>
					<a name="0803059000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Independent funds,
outside of the control of nuclear operators, should be created to
accumulate and manage payments from the operator to meet the full
costs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0803059000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">They are
independent funds.</div>
					<a name="0803059000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
suppose, however, that I were an operator who had been running for a
while and who now had some nuclear waste that I wanted to get rid of.
Would I go to the fund and say that although I had put &#163;700
million in so far, I would now like to take something out to start
meeting some of my liabilities? Is it the case that I could not take
any money out until I had put in everything that I would ever want to
put in? Is the process similar to a one-way valve? Is it the case that
money keeps going in until it reaches an absolute maximum of all the
money that will have to be spent and it can then be drawn upon? Will I
not incur new liabilities, potentially increasing the amount that must
go in at the same time as incurring costs that I must now spend to
undertake some clean-up for the generation that I have already carried
out?</div>
					<a name="0803059000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an operator,
could I spend my own money&#151;which has never gone through the
trust&#151;on clean-up and then tell the trust that it does not need
to ask me to put in that gross amount as I have already spent some
which I can offset against my liability? These are important questions.
I cannot speak for other members of the Committee, but I do not get a
sense of how the funds will work. Returning to the pension analogy, the
occupational pension fund structure was supposed to do precisely that
kind of thing&#151;ring-fence money for long-term future liabilities.
It failed catastrophically for 100,000
workers.</div>

cash flow into the operating plants that want to
decommission more rapidly or meet their other liabilities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>with regard to fixed costs of the work force and so on. Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that we need to allow the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority and other operators of nuclear facilities around the country
to maximise their commercial revenue streams in order to offset costs
to the taxpayer and to ensure a greater amount of surety when it comes
to meeting those costs? I am talking about fuel manufacture,
reprocessing and so on.</div>

Webb:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am not sure that I follow the hon.
Gentleman when he talks about off-setting the costs to the taxpayer. My
understanding is that there are no costs to the taxpayer if someone
wants to go into business to run a nuclear power plant with no public
subsidy&#151;if the Government plan to allow them to do so. I would
not see that it is the Committee&#146;s job to help such companies
offset costs that I do not think should arise in the first place;
indeed, that should not be the Government policy. I hope that I have
not wilfully misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, but I do not follow him
on that point.</div>
					<a name="0803059000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to my analogy, the kind of structure that we
are talking about has failed catastrophically. Interestingly, the
answer to the failure of occupational pension funds to meet their
long-term future liability was the creation of an insurance
scheme&#151;the Pension Protection Fund&#151;to insure against
trust funds failing to meet their long-term liabilities. I have an
interesting question for the Minister&#151;it could almost be a
dissertation question. We cannot create occupational pension funds that
do not need insurance. If it was so easy to set up a pension fund that
could be guaranteed to meet its long-term liabilities, we would have
done so. However, pension funds need an insurance scheme. Why are we
confident and how can we be sure that the sort of regime set up under
the regulations allowed for in clause 50 will meet its future
liabilities? The position is almost exactly analogous. In fact,
insurance funds are much more predictable&#151;a company pension fund
is based on how many workers it has, how long they will live and how
much they earn. The costs that we are talking about are much more
difficult to estimate.</div>
					<a name="0803059000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no idea of the margin of
risk. The Minister has still not given us a clue
about its magnitude&#151;it could 10 per cent., 100 per cent. or
1,000 per cent. Clearly, if the margin is huge, many of my concerns
would disappear, but the Minister has not been able to tell us, even to
within a number of zeros, what the margin is.</div>
					<a name="0803059000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a roundabout way, I am saying
that we do not have a clue. I hope that the Minister does, and that he
will share his insights on the operation of the funds. To take that
point further, will he say whether the money that will go into the
funds is as incredibly front-loaded as I believe it will be from what I
heard in the evidence sessions? As the hon. Member for Copeland said,
companies will obviously make their revenues over the lifetime of the
plant. However, because there is a risk, as with any commercial
enterprise, of companies going to the wall, they cannot say that they
can rely on their year 40 profits to meet their
liabilities, because they might not get to year 40. The money must be
in the trust much earlier in the process. That is my understanding of
how the system will work. How front-loaded is the money? As the
operation of the plant unfolds, how far 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>are the future decommissioning and disposal costs that it accumulates
front-loaded? It is simply not
clear.</div>
					<a name="0803059000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be a brief
friend of the nuclear industry, it will want to know before it signs on
the dotted line how much of the total future liabilities of the sorts
and numbers we have been talking about will be needed in year one, and
how much will be required of it. The industry will immediately take a
view about the profile of its costs and revenues, but what will the
Government ask of the industry?</div>
					<a name="0803059000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who are the trustees?
Regulations will provide for that under clause 50, but we do not know
who they are. How independent will they be? Clearly, they will need
expertise on nuclear liabilities but, presumably, they will be
independent of the industry under the Bill. Will the Minister tell us
more about who the trustees will be? If a company wants some money out
of the fund to do some clean-up work and the trustees say no, what will
happen?</div>
					<a name="0803059000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
are consulting on the clause, but they will give widespread
regulation-making powers, and the Committee needs to know in some
detail how the Minister envisages the powers operating. What scale of
process, what profile of payments and what guarantees are there? The
attempt to create a similar regime in pensions failed catastrophically,
so much so that an insurance scheme was needed to back it up. How can
the Minister be confident that the same model, which features an
arm&#146;s length independent fund with trustees, will work when it
has not worked in a similar
situation?</div>

							<a name="0803059000502"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman gave an interesting analogy.
However, there is a difference between the two funds. A problem for the
pension funds was that they had an unpredictable inflow. They did not
employ as many people as they had done historically, so the amount of
money coming in to the funds was not as great as they had expected.
However, they had a commitment to how much they were going to be paying
out. That is not the case with these funds; there will be a predictable
inflow. There is also a difference in that there will be no significant
calls on the fund while the plant is operating. The main calls will be
once it has closed. All the decommissioning costs will come once the
plant has ceased to operate and it will then be called upon to use the
fund in that respect. The storage of nuclear waste above ground or at
the site will not be covered by the fund. Only when the waste is moved
into a long-term store will the fund be called upon. That is many years
off. Assuming that the natural lifetime of one of the plants will be 40
or 50 years, one will be well into that process before there is a
significant drain on the decommissioning
fund.</div>
					<a name="0803059000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister could clarify his thinking on how nuclear waste
should appropriately be handled. The Government document
published in February, the &#147;Consultation on
Funded Decommissioning Programme Guidance for New Nuclear Power
Stations&#148;,
said:</div>
					<a name="0803059000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Operators
will be obliged to provide safe and secure interim storage facilities
that are technically capable of being maintained or replaced to last
for at least 100 years from the time when waste or spent fuel is first
emplaced in them.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>
					<a name="0803059000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it
the Minister&#146;s view that 100 years is the appropriate length of
time to store the waste above ground where one can keep an eye on it
directly, or is that figure in the document because he feels that that
is time that might be necessary before a final deep repository is
available and the legacy waste has been put into it, making it
available for new waste? Is 100 years the correct scientific period or
is it based on a practical decision? If it is a practical decision, I
presume that if the waste could be moved to the long-term storage
facility at an earlier stage, he would be in favour of
that.</div>
					<a name="0803059000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
also tell us whether he believes that on-site storage should be in
tanks or&#151;as in the United States&#151;stored on the surface?
Although that does not make a fundamental difference to our approval of
the clause, it would be useful to know what he thinks about the
appropriate technology and how long it takes for the waste to cool to a
level at which it can be handled and dealt with more appropriately.
Some say that it takes three to five years; is that his
understanding?</div>
					<a name="0803059000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, I spoke this morning about the Swedish working model, an
example that shows how the Swedes plan to dispose of nuclear waste for
the longer term. Some 10,000 people a year go to see it and there is 80
per cent. local support for the approach. Has the Minister considered
whether we should have something of that nature here? We are some way
off identifying a suitable location, but would it at some point be
appropriate to have such a working model so that people could see what
it is like, be reassured about the process and have their safety
concerns taken into
account?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> I am slightly loth to pursue the comparison with
pensions. The hon. Gentleman and I have been in this Committee
room&#151;or a similar one&#151;discussing the establishment of the
Pension Protection Fund and I can therefore see the analogies. Of
course, we acknowledge the responsibility of the then Liberal party for
establishing the first national insurance regime in this country. I am
not saying that the party is at fault for any difficulties that might
have arisen in that fund&#151;but why
not?</div>
					<a name="0803059000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
what we are talking about, in simple outline&#151;it will obviously
get more complex&#151;is a separate fund for each nuclear
installation, which will be at arm&#146;s length from the company and
will therefore be protected in terms of insolvency law, as we will
discuss later. The fund cannot be touched for any other purpose. Yes,
there will be trustees. One imagines that they will have expertise not
altogether different from that of the people who will staff the new
board that we are establishing, including finance experts and, no
doubt, those with some expertise of nuclear itself, fund management and
investment. The first payments to the fund will be made straight away,
and the aim will be to build up the fund. From time to time, it will be
reassessed to see whether payments need to be increased or, perhaps,
reduced.</div>
					<a name="0803059000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
broad outline, that is what we are trying to achieve, so that at the
end of the day we have sufficient moneys for successful decommissioning
of the structure; for putting the site back into greenfield condition,
wherever that is appropriate and possible; for storage, both short
term&#151;although it could be 100 years or so&#151;or longer term;
and for the share of the geological
repository.</div>
					<a name="0803059000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
go through this in a little more detail, cost estimates will be
regularly reassessed, and contributions to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>fund modified accordingly. We believe that the costs for decommissioning
are predictable, and more predictable than for pensions given its
issues around longevity. However, I am not saying that the costs will
be easy to predict, and I can see that there is a thesis to be written
about that statement. The fund will aim for more than 100 per cent. of
expected costs. On the premium, we have emphasised that we want to be
as sure as we can be that the taxpayers&#146; interest will be
protected.</div>
					<a name="0803059000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, if
the fund is insufficient for whatever reason, the
additional securities&#151;for example, insurance, a financial
instrument or some other guarantees that the Government
require&#151;will kick in. If the fund is insufficient, the operator
must make good the difference, and the provisions in the Bill aim to
ensure that they are required to do
that.</div>
					<a name="0803059000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been asked
whether money could be taken out of the fund
only when it is full. The funded decommissioning programme must set out
proposals for disbursement from the fund. That is covered in more
detail by the draft guidance currently out for consultation; we are
consulting on all of this. Of course, decommissioning costs, by
definition, are incurred after operation ceases and when the fund is
complete. Costs incurred during the operating life of the
station&#151;for example, for low-level waste disposal&#151;will be
paid for from operating expenditure. Some through-life costs, such as
the construction of interim stores, will be paid for by the fund and
regulated by fund managers. During decommissioning, expenditure from
the fund will be monitored annually and every five years against the
progress on decommissioning and waste management, to ensure that moneys
are being spent on the right
thing.</div>

						</b> Will the Minister provide some clarification? He
referred to facilities where waste might be stored. If waste were going
to be kept for a time in a pond on the site, would the construction and
maintenance of that be covered by the fund? Is that what he is
saying?</div>

							<a name="0803059000505"></a>Malcolm

						</b> Yes, I am saying that. I am not talking about just
the final deep geological storage. I am not a technical expert and
would not pretend to be, even for the sake of this Committee, but I am
talking about a possible range of storage facilities, including, as the
hon. Gentleman suggested, storage that could last a long time. I am not
talking about 100 years, but it is clear that interim storage can be
for a very long time, as we know from
experience.</div>

						</b> Can the Minister give me an idea of the timing
that he has in mind for ensuring that moneys are in place for
decommissioning, recognising that we are talking about perhaps 50 or 60
years? The estimated mean cost for decommissioning is some &#163;640
million, and those who say that it is higher would give a figure of
almost &#163;1 billion. When does he expect to have that sort of
money in the bank and available for
use?</div>

							<a name="0803059000507"></a>Malcolm

						</b> In the situation that we are talking about, it is
important to appreciate the time scales. We are legislating for a
long-term future. I recognise all the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>difficulties involved; one must be sensible about
it. The most optimistic suggestion seems to be that the first nuclear
reactor could be up and running by 2018&#151;some say 2017, while
others, perhaps more safely, say 2020. At about that time, the first
moneys would be paid into an arm&#146;s-length fund. I do not know
whether I am addressing the question.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Although none of us can predict, a
reasonable estimate is that 40 years later a new nuclear plant might be
decommissioned, and the moneys would be needed then. Some say that it
could take 10 more years than that, but who knows? It is not for us to
worry about that now. In relation to the fund, the aim of the
fund&#146;s trustees and the national board that we are setting up is
to ensure that the funds are on course to build up the moneys required
by the middle of this century. I hope that is
helpful.</div>

						</b> I ask for clarification but if the Minister has
already answered this question, I apologise. To use the pension fund
analogy that we were given, will people be allowed to take holidays
from paying into the fund or make deferred
payments?</div>

							<a name="0803059000511"></a>Malcolm

						</b> I recall from recent social history that holidays
for pension funds have created some difficulties for us. Therefore, it
is not for me to say. The important thing is to ensure that the fund
builds up at the right momentum for the right time period. The duty of
the trustees, the national board and the Secretary of State is to
ensure that that happens. The premiums could vary depending on whether
they need to be increased; possibly they could be reduced. The purpose
is to have adequate moneys at the end of the day. If anything, we are
over-egging the pudding. We may well have more money than is
required.</div>

						</b> This is a critical issue, relating to something that
the hon. Member for Wealden asked the other day. The Minister keeps
saying &#147;enough money by the end of the day&#148;. The danger
is that the end of the day might come not in 40 years&#146; time but
in five&#151;if, as the hon. Member for Wealden said the other day,
the technology changes dramatically, or if the cost of producing
nuclear energy is uncompetitive so that the nuclear industry cannot
sell its power at the price for which it has budgeted and becomes
insolvent. Surely the goal is for the funds to build up enough money
not at the end of the day and by gradual accumulation, but quickly
enough so that if something happened suddenly, the money would be
there.</div>
					<a name="0803059000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not clear
about the profile. Will the liability that the fund must meet be
incremental, or will most of a plant&#146;s future viabilities be
guaranteed once it is running, so a lot of the money must be put in
early on? I am not clear what the Minister is saying about
that.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> If a nuclear reactor were to stop after five years,
although I do not think that anyone is assuming that that will happen,
various things that we have discussed&#151;the liability on the
parent company and so on&#151;would have to come into the equation
and the arithmetic. In terms of the schedule of payments, operators
must put forward their proposals for the schedule of contributions to
the independent fund. Of course we favour the front-loading of
contributions in the early years of stations&#146; operating life.
However, the Government might accept what might be called
straight-line payments, as long as our principles are
met&#151;&#151;in other words, as long as the fund is sufficient
before operations cease and as long as adequate alternative securities
are in place to top up the fund should the liabilities crystallise
earlier than expected in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
Such securities will include insurance or bonds or parent company
guarantees. Payments to the fund must begin from day one of electricity
generation at the station, as I hope I have emphasised. I hope that
helps him a little. It looks as if it did not, but he is of that nature
sometimes in his most difficult
ways.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> I found the explanation quite helpful, so I am
grateful to the Minister. We have discussed how much decommissioning
might cost, and the hon. Member for Copeland suggested the figure of
&#163;600 million, which seems to be a widely regarded figure. If a
plant closed one year after operation, it would cost as much to
decommission as if it ran for 50 years; the facility would have been
used and the decommissioning costs would exist. The point that the hon.
Member for Northavon is trying to get at is whether the &#163;600
million will need to be in the pot on the day that it starts generating
electricity, so that it is available for decommissioning if it closes
down early, or whether &#151;I think this is the answer from what the
Minister just said&#151;as long as there are other guarantees to make
up the money to that level, the plant will not have to have that money
in the pot to begin with, but there will have to be guarantees that the
money will come from other sources.</div>

							<a name="0803059000518"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> We do not envisage all the money having to be in
the pot on day one. We have talked about the possibility of earlier
payments&#151;front-loading. However, I said that when we felt that
there was adequate security, through insurance, bonds or clear
commitments from the parent company, the issue could be straight-lined.
That is the important point. The important thing is that we make sure,
as reasonably as possible, that the money exists from the company, from
the fund, but not from the taxpayer, to ensure appropriate
decommissioning.</div>

							<a name="0803059000521"></a>Mr.

						</b> Just one more intervention, because I hope that it
may help the Minister. One assumes that the fund will be held
centrally. We are talking about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>more than one station, and I assume that it will be held in a central
holding and there will not be any separate accounts for separate
stations.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000522"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> It is not a Government fund; it will be for the
company to establish an independent fund at arm&#146;s length run by
independent trustees. As civil nuclear is rolled out, there will be a
number of different funds, all separately accountable. There will be no
pooling of funds or sharing of risk in that sense. The only
modification to which I might need to return is when one company is on
one site with more than one nuclear reactor. Indeed, I shall return to
it straight away, because I am so intrigued by the question.</div>
					<a name="0803059000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman will know
that it is for the operator to set out in its decommissioning programme
its proposed fund structure. Operators may decide to create a
single fund or establish separate funds for their decommissioning,
waste management and waste disposal costs. Whether a company has
separate funds for each reactor or one company fund is a matter for its
judgment, but there will be no pooling across different companies or
across all new nuclear reactors in the land. I hope that that clarifies
the situation; I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman asking me about
it.</div>
					<a name="0803059000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
emphasise those points, although I am in danger of repeating myself. It
will be possible to make payments out of the fund only to meet the
costs of waste management and decommissioning. I think that I have made
clear the structure of the fund and our plan to ensure that there is
sufficient funding. The hon. Member for Northavon asked whether money
can be spent outside the fund and claimed back from it. I think that
that was the burden of his question, and the answer is no. We must be
very clear about what the fund is available for and what permissions
are necessary to draw on it.</div>
					<a name="0803059000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Northavon
asked me about the timing for ensuring that moneys are in place for
decommissioning. It would certainly have to be in reasonable time
before the date on which the station is expected to cease electricity
generation to ensure that the appropriate moneys have been built up.
Certainly, sufficient moneys must be in the fund, having regard to
expected investment
performance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000523"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am puzzled, because the Minister is talking
about bonds and insurance as alternatives to money in the fund. I think
that that is an accurate understanding. In oral evidence, Dr. Higson, a
departmental official, said that because many of the costs will be
front-loaded, either the money would have to be in the fund or bonds or
insurance would have to be in place. The implication was that that will
be an alternative to having cash in the fund. If bonds and insurance
are good enough, why bother with a fund at all? Why not just have bonds
and insurance? What is the added value of the fund? If it has one, how
can we have confidence in it, if it only builds up enough money decades
into the process? I am
confused.</div>
					<a name="0803059000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000524"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Let me see if I can help the hon. Gentleman with
his confusion. Centre stage is the concept of the fund, which will be
at arm&#146;s length from the company, so that it cannot draw on it.
Generally, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>the fund will not be distributed among those calling on the company or
creditors for money if the company goes bust. It is for nuclear
decommissioning and waste disposal.</div>
					<a name="0803059000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are consulting on that
matter, but it is early days, and want to seek expert
advice and to hear from the industry and others. We are saying that a
company could front-load a scheme. I do not mean that it would write a
cheque for, say, &#163;600 million on day one&#151;it could, if it
wanted to, but I doubt that it would&#151;but that it might
front-load in the early years to build up a reasonable amount of money
to guard against eventualities. However, if the company felt that it
would rather take a more rational and straight-lined approach, it would
be allowed to do so only if other securities were available. We are
discussing that with the industry. A company wishing to take a
straight-lined approach could say, &#147;Here are some bonds&#148;,
or, &#147;Here is an insurance scheme.&#148; That could be an
alternative if the company could provide clear guarantees from the
parent company. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is happy with
that.</div>
					<a name="0803059000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wealden asked for clarification on the length of time
it takes for waste to cool before it can be disposed of and on the
Government&#146;s strategy for interim storage. Our base case, set
out in the guidance, assumes that spent fuel will be stored in cooling
ponds for a period following removal from the reactor, which follows
best practice and advice from experts. The length of that period will
depend on a number of factors and will need to satisfy the requirements
of the regulators. Spent fuel will then be transferred to interim
stores, the design of which must be agreed with regulators and meet UK
regulatory
requirements.</div>
					<a name="0803059000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Member for St. Albans asked about payment holidays. Having
read a note that I have received, I think that I have dealt with that.
The crucial things are that the moneys build up to the necessary level
and that the fund will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it is on
course.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000525"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I shall not sleep tonight, unless I get this
straight in my head. My assertion is that company pensions went wrong
and did not have enough to meet the liabilities, despite all the
safeguards that we are talking about, because there
were quinquennial reviews. A lot of this money will presumably be
invested in the stock market, although not necessarily in a risky way.
However, this is a long-term investment so presumably it will be risky.
Stock markets can fall 5 per cent. in a day, so how can the Minister be
confident about what will happen the moment the balloon goes up or the
insolvency event happens, or whatever? There is a way of keeping an eye
on things annually. However, the Minister used the word
&#147;quinquennial&#148;. We know that when such things happen over
time things can change dramatically, funds can be underfunded and the
taxpayer might have to fill the gap. Since that is and was a concern in
respect of pensions, why could it not happen in this
case?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000526"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I could say, but I would not convince the hon.
Gentleman, because in this case a former Pensions Minister, namely
myself, is in charge of the strategy. When the hon. Gentleman was the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>Liberal Democrat pensions spokesman, the argument never seemed to
reassure him, so I doubt whether it would reassure him in this
instance.</div>
					<a name="0803059000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, there are sometimes significant fluctuations in the value of
equities. In the United States, for example, there has been a credit
crunch. I should have thought that one of the implications
here&#151;it is similar for prudent financial management&#151;is
that the trustees and the board that we are establishing would want to
consider this matter in due course and ensure two things. First, they
would want to see that there is the usual reasonable spread of
investments, as in any fund. Secondly, to make a useful comparison,
when a person is reaching the age at which they wish to retire they
will ensure, wherever possible, that their moneys move into safer
havens&#151;I do not mean tax havens&#151;such as bonds and post
office or building society accounts. They would have to choose a
building society carefully&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Actually, it
is not a building society, so I should not have said that. It should
have stayed a building society, arguably. Nevertheless, as people move
into safer investments on retiring, I assume that 10 years before
decommissioning it would be sensible for even safer investments to be
made. In that way, trustees would do their best to ensure that
all is well with the level of the
fund.</div>

						</b> One thing is for certain: if Robert Maxwell had

the nuclear waste, so that would have been an
improvement.</div>
					<a name="0803059000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was concerned by the Minister saying that there would be either a
single fund for each nuclear power plant or a joint fund to cover a
range of plants. I am not clear about that: I think that it is being
consulted on, rather than being set in stone. However, that worries me
considerably, because if there is a fund for a group of nuclear power
stations and one is sold there will have to be a difficult
reconciliation of the funds&#146; relationships and which plant is
being dealt with to ensure that a fund moves with the sale of the
plant. In addition, if there were a downturn in the stock market when
the first plant was due to be commissioned, more might have to be drawn
out of the fund than was anticipated, which means that money that had
been intended to be used for other power stations&#146;
decommissioning may be taken out earlier. I urge the Minister to
consider having just one fund per installation to provide the security
that we all feel is necessary in this
area.</div>
					<a name="0803059000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister

discussing whether it is sensible, almost for administrative
convenience, to have one group of trustees. We are consulting on that.

Wicks:
						</b> Let me say a few words on the clause, although I
was tempted to let it go, given the hour. The clause allows the
Secretary of State to make regulations setting out the circumstances in
which he may rely on advice provided by a third party to verify
financial aspects of a programme. The regulations might apply when the
Secretary of State is considering whether to approve a programme or
when a modification to a programme that has already been proposed is
being considered. The Secretary of State will not be an expert 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>on the financial matters that might relate to a programme, so it is
important that he can call on expert and independent advice when
seeking to verify such matters.</div>
					<a name="0803059000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition to
the clause, and as detailed in the nuclear White Paper that we
published in January, we intend to create a new independent advisory
body&#151;the nuclear liabilities financing assurance board. Aside
from providing independent scrutiny and advice on the suitability of
decommissioning programmes submitted by the operators of new nuclear
power stations, the board will advise the Secretary of State on the
financial arrangements that operators plan to put in place to cover
waste management and decommissioning. Our debate just now illustrates
the importance of those plans.</div>
					<a name="0803059000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board will
also advise the Secretary of State regarding the regular reviews and
ongoing scrutiny of funding arrangements once programmes are approved
and new nuclear power stations are operational. Given the importance of
providing the taxpayer with adequate protection, it is
appropriate&#151;indeed, necessary&#151;to have an additional level
of scrutiny on those financial matters, because they are fundamental to
ensuring that operators meet the full costs of decommissioning and
their full share of waste management costs.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> This clause sets out clear rules on
decommissioning and waste handling programmes. We would all agree that
this could not be a more serious issue, which goes right to the heart
of the debate about the safety of a new nuclear programme. Anyone
breaking laws on this will be in absolute breach of the rules and
regulations that Parliament has put in place to ensure that new build
nuclear programmes will be as safe as possible, not to mention the
breach of trust of all the assurances that would have been given. We
need penalties that would reflect the seriousness of such an
offence.</div>
					<a name="0803059000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

					<a name="0803059000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">so that it
would be clear that the action has been wilful and deliberate. If the
action happened accidentally or inadvertently, it should be treated
with a different level of severity. Amendment No. 35 relates to the
severity of the penalty for such breaches of the law. Two years does
not seem a very serious jail sentence for someone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>who has failed to comply with an approved funded
decommissioning programme. Such a failure could have serious
consequences for public health, and a sentence of five years&#146;
imprisonment seems more
appropriate.</div>

							<b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): Who does the hon.
Gentleman mean by the person? Does he mean the person
who inadvertently did the wrongdoing, in other words the worker, or
could it be the manager or his boss who instructed him to do
the job in the first
place?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000549"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> It is the person described in the Bill. The Bill
has already referred to the person to whom the fine would apply. One
assumes that it would be the person who has taken the decision and has
been in a position of authority. That is one of the reasons for my
earlier amendment. If someone might be considered as a worker within
the facility where something had happened wrongly and could not be
perceived to carry responsibility for those acts, that should be taken
into account too.</div>
					<a name="0803059000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes do not explain the level of the fine involved so
perhaps the Minister could clarify that. Amendment No. 37 relates to
the penalties for those who have supplied false information to the
Secretary of State. It includes the term &#147;false or
misleading&#148;. I fully understand why a person
who has knowingly or recklessly supplied false information should be
liable to punishment, but I am concerned about the term
&#147;misleading&#148;. It is a very subjective term and could lead
to people being convicted who have supplied information that is deemed
misleading by the courts, when that was never their intention when they
provided the
information.</div>

							<a name="0803059000550"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> The amendments are puzzling. Amendment No. 36
introduces the phrase</div>
					<a name="0803059000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a case of dishonesty&#148;</div>
					<a name="0803059000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">into
subsection (3)(b), thereby raising the threshold for a judge using
prison as an option. Otherwise they will simply impose a fine. We have
a problem with our prison population and there may be a feeling that
the thresholds that apply to imprisonment when violence against people
or property is involved or when it is unsafe for someone to be allowed
outside should be enforced, but that other crimes perhaps should not
allow that option.</div>
					<a name="0803059000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting that the Conservative party should suggest raising the
threshold for which prison is an option when there might be a serious
threat to life and health from one of these
decommissioning programmes not being properly carried out or when there
might be a threat to Government finances from a body corporate as well
as an individual acting in a deeply negligent way. It seems better, and
I shall be interested to hear any further comments from the hon.
Gentleman, to leave cases like this to a judge&#146;s discretion
rather than trying to prescribe it too closely in the Bill, lest we be
thought to be soft on nuclear
crime.</div>
					<a name="0803059000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 35, by contrast, seems to go in the other direction and seeks to
increase the prison population by sending anyone who is convicted to
prison for five years not two years. Perhaps this is proposed for fear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>that the Government might not be able to fill all the new prison places
that his hon. Friends want to build. I do not know. Again, that seems
not to have an obvious
justification.</div>
					<a name="0803059000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000551"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> Is there not an inherent contradiction in what the
hon. Gentleman is saying? He accuses my hon. Friend of raising the
threshold for conviction, but if he examines the next amendment he will
see that my hon. Friend suggests raising the penalty. Rather than being
soft, surely we are being hard?</div>
					<a name="0803059000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000552"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> In his slight confusion, the hon.
Gentleman has reinforced my point that the amendments
propose contradictory things. Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 would raise the
threshold for punishment, where as amendment No. 35 would increase the
punishment, so they point in opposite directions. Amendment No. 37 is
mysterious in seeking to remove the offence of supplying misleading
information to the Secretary of State. That could be just as damaging
and dishonest as supplying false information. Why are we raising the
threshold for corporate responsibility and denying judges the right to
impose those kinds of penalties? We will not support the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0803059000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000553"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> We are trying to say that the full power of the
law should not be used against people who inadvertently get into a
position where there has not been wilful deceit and dishonesty. We
would raise the threshold of proof that must be demonstrated in order
to prosecute. Having raised the threshold, the penalties for those
people should be higher. At the moment, people who have not been
fundamentally dishonest may end up being prosecuted, and we want to
avoid that. We are also saying that where people have wilfully and
dishonestly acted in this way, two years does not seem to be enough;
five years seems more appropriate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000554"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I was about to conclude my remarks, but I am
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He has clarified
the rationale for amendment No. 35, at least. If taken with the other
two amendments, and only then, that amendment makes some sense in that
it is a higher punishment for a higher threshold of crime. However, I
still do not see why, since in other parts of the law we punish
recklessness and the supply of misleading information, we should not
punish it on this occasion. I would be happy to see the clause remain
as it is.</div>
					<a name="0803059000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000555"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Let me act as a referee in these interesting
discussions between the two former great parties of our nation, which I
always enjoy. Rather like those on the Liberal Democrat Benches, I have
wondered whether there was a connection between recent announcements
and the amendment. The hon. Member for Wealden would never take the
Committee for granted, but I had wondered whether, in
announcing 5,000 new prison places, his colleagues were being prescient
about the way in which he would sway the Committee to support this
amendment for further imprisonment. He may, sadly, be disappointed. I
notice that the leader of his party has recently, perfectly properly,
talked about the importance of education and training programmes in
prison. Perhaps he would like to table a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>later amendment to suggest that among the training programmes should be
masters degrees in nuclear science, so that people will be properly
enabled to re-enter the community.</div>
					<a name="0803059000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 35 and 36 relate to clause 53, which makes it an offence to fail
to comply with a programme. Amendment No. 37 relates to clause 56,
which makes it an offence to supply false or misleading information. We
have made it clear, both in our White Paper and in the draft guidance,
what a new nuclear operator&#146;s obligations will be in the context
of meeting decommissioning and waste management costs. We believe that
the framework that we are putting in place will achieve that outcome.
We are therefore confident that no one will be sent to
prison.</div>
					<a name="0803059000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to be
as clear as possible about what the obligations are. We are requiring
that operators put robust requirements in place to meet their
liabilities and underpinning the framework with criminal sanctions for
non-compliance. Clause 53 makes it a criminal offence for an operator,
or a person with obligations under an approved programme, not to comply
with the programme, unless they prove that they exercised due diligence
to avoid committing the offence.</div>
					<a name="0803059000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000556"></a>Anne
Main:
						</b> I am delighted that the Minister is acting as a
referee between the various opinions. Has there been any examination of
the structures in place for companies that operate abroad in terms of
legal proceedings against people who recklessly, knowingly or willingly
mislead? Have the Government examined that and tried to put something
similar in
place?</div>
				
					<a name="0803059000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000557"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am not sure whether I can supply the hon. Lady
with information about that. I might consult the hon. Member for Stone
(Mr. Cash) to find out whether it is appropriate to use
European models. We will look at that and possibly return to the
matter.</div>
					<a name="0803059000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="0803059000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The failure to
comply with a programme could mean that the decommissioning and waste
management costs are not fully provided for, which puts public funds at
risk and therefore warrants the use of criminal
sanctions. We can draw on outside expertise, but in this instance, it
is for the UK Parliament to make judgments about these important
things. The clause forms a crucial part of the overall regulatory
structure, because it provides the key deterrent to companies and
others, as appropriate, against failing to comply with their
obligations under the programme.</div>
					<a name="0803059000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
35 relates to the question of what the suitable penalty should be for
someone who fails to comply with an approved funding decommissioning
programme. In developing the penalties under clause 53, we have looked
at other legislation and at other requirements to
have in place decommissioning programmes&#151;namely, in the oil, gas
and offshore renewable sectors. It should be noted that the provisions
for new nuclear power stations will complement legislation and
conditions that apply to existing nuclear power stations&#151;for
example, under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, which contains
offences and penalties for contravening certain licence conditions
regarding the use of a nuclear site.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>
					<a name="0803059000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
35 would increase the sanction from two to five years, but it would
have no material impact on the incentive for an operator to comply with
a programme&#151;it might give them slightly more time to write their
first novel or play, but it would not have a serious impact.
Furthermore, it would take the sanctions for nuclear out of step with
the decommissioning regimes that we have in place for offshore
renewables and oil and gas installations.</div>
					<a name="0803059000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to remind the
Committee that the provision aims to ensure that operators comply with
their requirements to set aside adequate funding for decommissioning
and waste disposal. The measure does not concern health and safety or
environmental issues, which will continue to be dealt with by the
Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and the
statutory provisions and sanctions that support those
agencies.</div>
					<a name="0803059000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
36 would reduce the effectiveness of clause 53, so that the maximum
sanction only bites when the breach of a programme has been committed
dishonestly. That amendment would reduce the deterrent effect of the
clause and undermine the robustness of the regime as a whole. I
recognise that, in conjunction with amendment No. 35, amendment No. 36
would result in the maximum penalty under clause 53 being higher than
that proposed in the Bill. Taken together, those two amendments would
also ensure that breaches of the programme because of carelessness or
negligence would only be punishable in a magistrates court, where the
fine does not exceed &#163;5,000.</div>
					<a name="0803059000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider
that the threat of prosecution in the Crown court in such cases, with
the attendant enhanced penalties, provides an additional and important
deterrent. There is a risk that the proposed amendments might send out
the wrong message, which is that the Government will only prosecute in
one specific circumstance: dishonesty. We want to send out the message
that, where there is a breach, the operator will have to demonstrate
that they did everything that they could to avoid committing the
breach, which is what the clause will achieve.</div>
					<a name="0803059000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context
of offences, I should also mention clause 87, which sets out that,
where offences are committed by bodies corporate, directors and other
officers of the operator may also be prosecuted personally where the
relevant acts were committed with their consent or connivance or were
attributable to their neglect. The clause creates a significant
incentive on the part of the management of the operator to ensure that
the company complies with the programme. It seems unnecessary and
disproportionate to increase the penalty further, as proposed in
amendment No. 35, in view of that additional
sanction.</div>
					<a name="0803059000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
37 is similar to amendment No. 36, as it seeks to remove the term
&#147;misleading&#148; from clause 56. Again, I do not believe that
that amendment should be accepted, as it would make it acceptable for
an operator to submit information that, although not false, did not
provide the full picture in relation to a particular issue&#151;for
instance, an attempt to cover up a breach in a programme. In my mind,
the act of misleading is deliberate, and I am not sure that the public
would be comfortable with a Minister saying that it was acceptable for
a person to submit misleading information without
facing sanctions. That amendment would undermine one of the foundations
of the regime, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>which is that the Secretary of State must be able to
take decisions based on full and accurate information. For that reason,
it should not be accepted.</div>
					<a name="0803059000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 53 and 56 are designed
to send a clear message to operators about acceptable behaviours; if
those behaviours are not maintained, the Government will have recourse
to a sufficient sanction. If we were to accept the amendment, I believe
that, overall, the Government would send out a less robust message. I
therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0803059000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000558"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I also asked the Minister to clarify what level
the fine will be, as that is not to be found in the explanatory
notes. Most sections of the explanatory notes that deal with fines
explain that, if a case goes to the Crown court, an unlimited fine can
be imposed, but the notes on these clauses do not provide that

should be much greater severity, and the public would expect there to
be some difference. However, I understand what he said about the
punishments available elsewhere in the

a person has not complied with an obligation imposed on them by the
programme, or if the Secretary of State believes that that person has
been engaged in unlawful conduct that he believes may affect the
programme, under the powers in the clause, he can direct the person to
take action to comply with the obligation or to remedy the effects of
any breach. As for unlawful conduct, the person must have been
convicted of a criminal act by a United Kingdom court and, if relevant,
for the period of appeal to have expired&#151;or if an appeal is
made, for it to have run its course.</div>
					<a name="0803059000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before issuing a notice to

will allow the Secretary of State to apply to the High Court for an

with the direction, it can order the person to take whatever steps are
necessary to ensure that the notice is complied with. Without the
clause, there would be no way of ensuring that remedial action could
take place if it was considered necessary. At the same time, the
constraints contained within the clause, such as the need for an appeal
to have run its course, will ensure that the powers cannot be misused.

a programme, such as trustees, or a body corporate associated with the
operator&#151;between the Secretary of State and the interested

						</b> Obviously, this is about new nuclear. The powers in
the Bill will not affect Scotland, largely because the Scottish
Executive, who are the planning authority for power stations of this
kind, have made it clear that, at present, on planning grounds, they
will not allow new nuclear to be built in Scotland. I personally hope
that Scotland will one day open the way to what will be an important
modern industry in the 21st century, and there may come a time when
these issues will need to be revisited. However, none of the key

					<a name="0803059000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that bodies corporate associated with the operator are caught
within the scope of the clause, because those involved in financing and
supporting such an operator are as important to the sustainability and
viability of the programme as the operator&#146;s ability to fund it.
It is therefore only right that, if one of the interested bodies had
information about an associated company that might have an impact on
the programme, the regulator could be required to share that
information with the Secretary of State. We will work with interested
bodies to draw up a memorandum of understanding that will set out how
the Secretary of State and individual regulators should work together
not only in sharing information, but in ensuring that the process for
approving, monitoring and reviewing decommissioning programmes is
understood by all those involved. That will also enable operators and
persons with obligations under a programme to understand what they can

Wicks:
						</b> This clause will ensure that an operator can be
held to any obligations under a programme, even when the original
operator ceases to hold a nuclear site licence in relation to the site.
This approach reflects the policy on the decommissioning of oil and gas
installations under the Petroleum Act 1998, whereby the Secretary of
State can pursue the licensee in relation to its obligations under an
abandonment programme. The operator would only be released from its
obligations when given notice by the Secretary of State. The notice may
release the operator from all or only specific obligations, and it may
relate to all or a specific part of the site, or to all the nuclear
installations on-site or to one specified in the notice. It may also be
unconditional or subject to
conditions.</div>
					<a name="0803059000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where an
operator wishes to relinquish ownership of a station, for example, the
clause will enable the Secretary of State to require the outgoing
operator to take the necessary action to ensure that the programme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>is up to date before releasing it from any obligation under the
programme. The Secretary of State could, for example, require the
existing operator to make good any shortfall in the programme, such as
a funding deficit or a failure to complete the building of certain
waste facilities by a certain
date.</div>
					<a name="0803059000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally, the
original operator might well wish to sell the station
to another entity that does not have the necessary financial security
arrangements in place and for which, if it had applied to have a
programme approved, the Secretary of State would not have granted
approval or would have put certain conditions in place. Using the
clause, the Secretary of State could hold the original operator to
certain obligations under the programme until such time as the new
operator can make provision for that security.</div>
					<a name="0803059000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will therefore provide an important protection to ensure that recourse
to public funds is remote at all times, by ensuring that the current or
previous operator meets the full decommissioning costs and its full
share of waste management costs. The Secretary of State&#146;s powers
to approve a programme submitted by a new operator will enable the
Secretary of State to distribute responsibility for such action between
the old and the new operator, as he considers
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0803059000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have underlined in the draft guidance the importance of the operator
informing the Secretary of State of an impending change to the identity
of the licensee&#151;through a merger or acquisition, for example.
However, the fact that consent will be needed to release the operator,
in line with the clause, should encourage the relevant persons to
inform the Secretary of State of the change as early as
possible.</div>
					<a name="0803059000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an argument that the clause could engage with article 1 of the first
protocol of the European convention on human rights, which deals with
the protection of property: although the licence, not ownership, can
pass from one operator to another, the Secretary of State could, by
using the clause, require the original operator to continue to make
further payment to the fund. However, the Government do not believe
that the clause engages with article 1. It is perfectly acceptable that
such payment should be made, and that can be justified, because it is
the Government&#146;s stated policy that operators should be
responsible for the decommissioning and clean-up of the station and
that such payments should not come from public funds. Alternatively, it
is a control-of-use provision.</div>

setting out the way that the clause will work and the matters to which
it refers.</div>
					<a name="0803059000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we
want to be sure that, if a nuclear installation changes ownership,
people cannot simply walk away from their responsibilities. However,
how would the process of transferring those responsibilities to the new
owner work? How would the Government ensure that a new company, which
could be foreign-based, would take on the responsibilities of the
previous owner? Simply by saying that they would not release the former
owner from its duties, would the Government expect it to sort them out
with the new company, or would the Government have a more direct
involvement in that process?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>
					<a name="0803059000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the
Government have powers to block sales outside the competition rules for
people whom they felt that they could not hold to the same duties and
responsibilities? For example, they could be companies outside the
jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, where they could not be held to
account in the same way as the companies that had initially sought the
responsibilities and initially had the duties put on them. What would
happen in those
circumstances?</div>
					<a name="0803059000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
also seen that, over time, some companies simply fade away. Not a
single company currently in the FTSE 100 was in it
100 years ago; every one is different. Some companies demerge, are
closed down or are bought by foreign companies. In those circumstances,
how do the Government intend to ensure that the obligations on a
current owner are transferred effectively to someone
else?</div>
					<a name="0803059000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically
on demergers, if a conglomerate that owns the nuclear plant at the
outset demerges into a number of smaller parts, what happens to the
duty? The Secretary of State could not impose a duty on, for example, a
French company that had fragmented or simply to decide which element of
that French company should bear the responsibilities. I am interested
to know how that responsibility would be
enforced.</div>

							<a name="0803059000568"></a>Malcolm

hope that I more than touched on some of it in my opening
speech.</div>
					<a name="0803059000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Operators will
be released at the discretion of the Secretary of State. That
essentially means that he may or may not release them. He is likely to
release them when he is confident that the liabilities can be met by
another organisation. If he is not confident about that, they will not
be
released.</div>
					<a name="0803059000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government must be notified in good time before a change in ownership
or control of the station. The Secretary of State must approve the
revisions to the funded decommissioning programme. The Secretary of
State would not expect to release the former owner or controller from
their obligations unless and until satisfied that the arrangements
under the new owner or controller are adequate. Breaching the
obligation to notify the Secretary of State of the change or to submit
the relevant parts of the funded decommissioning programme for approval
will amount to a criminal
offence.</div>
					<a name="0803059000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the hon. Member for Northavon and myself must not keep drawing
comparisons with pensions, it strikes me that there is an interesting
comparison to be drawn in this matter. The Pensions Act 2004, which he
and I discussed a few years ago, set up the pension regulator and the
Pension Protection Fund, and it is interesting that pension liabilities
are now, properly, part of the equation in company takeovers and
possible mergers. One can well imagine that, when a company seeks to
take over another company, nuclear liabilities will be on the balance
sheet in the negotiations and in the discussion. That is perfectly
proper.</div>

						</b> Let me briefly refer to the clause and the earlier
debate on companies disappearing or demerging. I want to emphasise
that, if at any time, the circumstances of an associated body with

trigger a modification to the funded decommissioning programme and
would need the Secretary of State&#146;s approval. I want to
emphasise that theme, which I was developing
earlier.</div>

listeners. I know that some have finished before
me.</div>
					<a name="0803059000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 61 makes it
clear that, even if the operator complies with section 11 of the
Nuclear Installations Act 1965, which contains an offence of
contravening the restrictions on uses of a nuclear site, they may none
the less commit an offence if they fail to comply with clause 43. I
remind the Committee that clause 43 will prohibit the use of a nuclear
site in the absence of an approved funded decommissioning
programme.</div>
					<a name="0803059000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43
sets out the penalty for a person who is guilty of that
offence&#151;I do not want to trigger another death-by-hanging from
the hon. Member for Wealden. The penalty on summary conviction is a
fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, which is currently
&#163;5,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, or, on conviction
on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to
a fine, or
both.</div>
					<a name="0803059000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Criminal
sanctions will ensure that the operator of a new nuclear power station
complies with the waste and decommissioning framework in the Bill. That
will enable the Secretary of State to ensure that
operators meet their duty to have an approved funded decommissioning
programme in place. It is important to have a criminal sanction,
because without a funded decommissioning programme, the power station
operator might not make adequate provision for back-end liabilities.
That would create the risk of taxpayers having to assist in meeting
those liabilities. Operators must take full responsibility for meeting
the cost of decommissioning and waste management, and the clauses in
this chapter seek to ensure that the operators of any new
build do
so.</div>

obligations under the Bill&#151;for example, through certain company
structures.</div>
					<a name="0803059000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I go
any further, it is important to emphasise that the clause does not
define which associated bodies are automatically
fixed with liability under the programme. That depends on the exercise
of the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to approve or modify the
programme. However, it does define the scope of the Secretary of
State&#146;s powers to impose obligations on associates. The clause
provides that one body corporate is associated with another if one of
them has a significant interest in the other, or a third company has a
significant interest in both of
them.</div>
					<a name="0803059000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
definition in the Bill, company A will have a significant interest in
company B if it has either a 20 per cent. interest in company B or if
it has the power directly or indirectly to ensure that the affairs of
company B are conducted in accordance with its
wishes.</div>
				
					<a name="0803059000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0803059000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
that is an appropriate threshold for the inclusion of associated
companies, given the nature of nuclear waste and decommissioning.
Setting the test for significant interest in that way ensures the
robustness of the programme. For example, a situation might arise in
which the Secretary of State formed the view that the operator might
not be able to fulfil its obligations under the programme. In such a
case, the clause sets out which associates of the operator could be
required to ensure that some or all of the
operator&#146;s decommissioning and waste liabilities were provided
for. The clause seeks to provide legal certainty to operators of new
nuclear power stations in that regard by defining the associates that
can be captured in that way.</div>
					<a name="0803059000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is also designed to
ensure that prudent provision is made for the decommissioning and waste
liabilities where there is no single parent. For example, a consortium
might come forward with a structure in which three or more bodies each
have significant influence over the operator but none holds 50 per
cent. or more of the shares. Those so-called parents would all be
beyond the Secretary of State&#146;s reach if the threshold were set
at 50 per cent.</div>
					<a name="0803059000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
that some concerns have been raised by the industry about the 20 per
cent. threshold that we have set, so I want to use this opportunity to
explain why we believe that 20 per cent. is right. It has been said
that alternative thresholds of 30 or even 50 per cent. should be
considered, but I have concerns about both of those
figures. In the case of a single corporate body
undertaking new nuclear build and owning the operator, the practical
difference between a 50, 30 or 20 per cent. threshold is unlikely to be
of material significance, given that the operator will be part of that
group and the group will wish to exercise control over the operator at
all levels.</div>
					<a name="0803059000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
contrast, where a joint venture is undertaking the new nuclear build
and there are several interests in the operator, the threshold is
important. In establishing a consortium, one does not have to be unduly
creative to structure the interests of those participating in the
programme below either a 50 or 30 per cent. threshold and still ensure
that those participants enjoy significant influence over the operator.
If the threshold is set at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>relatively high level of 50 or even 30 per cent, there is an incentive
for those involved to put in place a structure that enables them to
minimise the risk of being fixed with liability under the
clause.</div>
					<a name="0803059000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">They might
choose to do that even though it might add to the risk of increasing
costs and complexity in both the structure and
operation of the consortium arrangements. That is because the benefit
derived from avoiding the potential risk exposure of obligations under
a funded decommissioning programme is likely to outweigh such
additional costs and operating complexity. With a 20 per cent.
threshold, I would expect the complexity of putting in place and
administering each consortium&#146;s arrangements to be increased,
thereby reducing the incentive.</div>
					<a name="0803059000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that, at whatever
level the threshold is set, there is the possibility that some people
might seek to create a structure that avoids the consequences of the
powers in the Bill, but I believe that setting the
threshold for significant interest at 20 per cent., together with other
provisions in the clause, strikes the correct and appropriate balance
between the commercial interests of prospective operators and investors
and the proper interests of the Government and taxpayers.</div>
					<a name="0803059000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to emphasise that our policy is not &#147;nuclear at any
cost.&#148; We have discussed the potential effect of the clause with
the industry and will continue to do so if needed, but I shall be clear
that operators will be expected to meet their full decommissioning
costs and full share of waste management costs, and the clause will
provide further safeguards behind that important principle. A 20 per
cent. threshold will also ensure that such shareholders want operators
to take sensible decisions on waste and decommissioning costs in order
to minimise the risk to their own shareholders and associates. That
will put further pressure on operators properly to fund and implement
their programmes.</div>
					<a name="0803059000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 20 per
cent. threshold reflects existing legislative precedents, because I can
anticipate the question of where the 20 per cent. comes from. For
example, paragraph 20 of schedule 4A of the Companies Act 1985 refers
to a significant interest over operating and financial policy where one
undertaking holds 20 per cent. or more of the voting rights in another
undertaking.</div>
					<a name="0803059000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also provides for indirect holdings to be taken into account in
deciding whether a person with holdings of that nature has obligations
under a programme. In this context, indirect holdings arise when one
company owns a stake in a different company, which in turn has an
interest in an operator of a new nuclear power station. When the
holding is indirect, the Secretary of State may impose obligations on
the holding company only if it has more than 50 per cent. of the shares
in the company that has an interest in the nuclear operator. I believe
that to be the right
level.</div>
					<a name="0803059000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider that
a 20 per cent. threshold for indirect interest would bring a
disproportionate number of bodies within the scope of potential
liability under the programme. We have balanced that consideration
carefully against the anti-avoidance risk, involving setting the
threshold at 50 per cent. Furthermore, where the holding of such a
company is less than 50 per cent., but it is exercising a de facto
control over the operator, it will still be caught by the provisions
relating 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>to the power of a third company to ensure that the affairs of the
operator are conducted in accordance with its
wishes.</div>
					<a name="0803059000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
threshold for control is akin to those in the decommissioning
provisions on associates for bodies corporate for offshore renewables
and oil and gas decommissioning installations, which apply a 50 per
cent. threshold across the board. The clause applies to limited
liability partnerships that are associated with the operator, with
appropriate amendments, given that limited liability partnerships do
not have shares. It is recognised that such organisations might have a
role to play in new nuclear or as part of a corporate group involved in
the area. Had we not extended the clause to include limited liability
partnerships, we could have created a situation in which companies were
incentivised to restructure themselves as such partnerships to avoid
the consequences of the clauses in this chapter. Our approach is
consistent with provisions concerning other decommissioning liabilities
in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000571"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Will the Minister explain further why the
distinction in this clause is different to that in other parts of the
Bill? Why has he gone for an ownership threshold of 20 per cent. in
this sector, but a 50 per cent. threshold for the decommissioning of
offshore renewables and oil and gas installations? Will the liability
of organisations or investors relate to the size of
their ownership stake, so that if a company owns more than 20 per cent.
of the operator they will be liable for that exact proportion of the
decommissioning costs, or will there be some other structure? If so,
will he explain how that will
work?</div>
					<a name="0803059000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, will
the structure take account of how long investors or
organisations have had ownership of their portion of the company? There
is a great difference between the returns that an investor or a company
will have if it has been an investor in a company that is operating in
nuclear facilities for many years and one that has only recently become
an investor. Will their liabilities be equal and based purely on their
shareholding, or will other factors be taken into
account?</div>
					<a name="0803059000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister also clarify what will happen if the parent company is
owned by a foreign Government and is essentially the sovereign fund of
another country? Will the legal duty rest on the parent company or with
the Government of that
country?</div>
					<a name="0803059000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000572"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> In his introductory remarks, the Minister addressed
some of the concerns that I had on reading the clause. There was a
worry about the potential for organising corporate structures to avoid
the knock-on liabilities. He seems to be saying that there is a
trade-off in such matters. A 20 per cent. threshold implies that if six
parents share the ownership of a business, they can avoid the knock-on
liabilities. If I understand him correctly, he seems to be saying that
six companies would have so little control or power that they would not
want to do that. However, perhaps they would if they knew that they
could avoid their exposure to liability. I am not quite clear about his
reasoning. I understand the point that the lower the threshold is set,
the less control the parents or owners have, but I do not understand
why there is not still an incentive to structure the ownership in that
way. Will the Minister clarify that point?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>
					<a name="0803059000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden made an important point about the inconsistency with
clause 77 on oil and gas, for which the threshold is 50 per cent. There
is clearly a different figure in this clause, and it would be
interesting to know why it should be different for nuclear compared
with oil and
gas.</div>
					<a name="0803059000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for what is probably a lack of understanding on my part, but
will the Minister explain in lay terms how in this clause the 20 per
cent. and 50 per cent. numbers relate to one another? One appears to
relate to direct ownership and the other to indirect ownership, but
indirect through what mechanism? Is it a holding company, a parent
company or something else? Will the Minister clarify what the two
different numbers are exactly? More to the point, why is 20 per cent.
right for one and 50 per cent. right for the other? He explained what
they were, but not necessarily why 50 per cent. was right for the
other.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000573"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I hoped that in my speech I had tackled many of the
issues raised. Although the hon. Member for Wealden is asking for more,
as he did last week, I thought that I had clarified the position. When
he reads the report of the Committee&#146;s proceedings, he may have
some questions that we can consider in another way. I thought that I
had, at some length, done my best. Clearly, whether the number is 20
per cent. or 18 per cent. is a matter of judgment. I explained that we
had taken something of a precedent from section 260 of the Companies
Act, which refers to a participating interest as having a shareholding
of at least 20 per cent. of the undertaking. At the end of the day,
these will be arbitrary figures. Let me, however, deal with the issue
of the parent company being based in another
country.</div>
					<a name="0803059000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the clauses do not have extraterritorial effect, the Secretary of State
would not expect to approve a programme that did not make prudent
provision by way of security for the costs of decommissioning, waste
management and disposal. That would include a case in which the parent
or associates of the operator were based overseas. At the beginning of
the process, issues of extraterritoriality have to be uppermost in the
minds of the Secretary of State and his
advisers.</div>
					<a name="0803059000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon asked whether there was now any incentive to
structure around 20 per cent. We believe that the complexity of
structuring around a 20 per cent. position would act as a disincentive.
Again, I concede that these things are a matter of judgment. I will
leave it there, if I may. I seriously think that there might be a way
in which we can correspond on this issue if I did not make myself
clear, which perhaps I did
not.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000574"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I am grateful for that, because the one thing that
the Minister clearly did not do in his introductory remarks was say why
different approaches were being taken on nuclear as distinct from oil
and gas. The thresholds in an almost identical
clause&#151;clause 77&#151;for what
&#147;associate&#148; means are just different. What is it about
oil and gas that is different from nuclear that results in different
thresholds being
used?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000575"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I think that soon we move on to issues relating to
oil and gas decommissioning. Therefore, if I get the comparisons wrong,
or rather if I am allowed to get them even more perfect in the future,
we may be able to consider the matter in that respect. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>In terms of nuclear, yes, unless we are very prudent and think of all
the issues, the risk to the taxpayer could be significant, but together
we are going to get it right in Committee, are we not? The 20 per cent.
threshold seemed to us to be right, for the reasons that I hoped I had
explained.</div>
					<a name="0803059000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden asked about a situation in which ownership was more
than 20 per cent. Certainly we would expect associated companies to set
up their own contractual relationships to share liability should any
event occur. If we were to give a commitment such as he seeks, that
could encourage avoidance. Again, we need to be careful about that, but
I am aware that we might need to explore some issues further in
correspondence if any doubts remain in the minds of the hon. Gentlemen
when the record has been read. I appreciate that my speech was quite
complex and

Horwood:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in
clause 63, page 50, line 14, at
end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">&#145;&#147;disposal&#148;
for solid nuclear wastes (including nuclear materials declared as
waste) means emplacement in a long term storage
facility;&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0803059000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to define carefully &#147;disposal&#148;,
which is not currently in the list of words defined
in clause 63. &#147;Disposal&#148; is important because it crops up
earlier on in the Bill, in clause 41. It is one of the technical
matters, along with &#147;treatment&#148;, &#147;storage&#148;
and &#147;transportation&#148;, covered by the funded
decommissioning programmes. Such technical matters, which the funded
decommissioning programme must contain, include details of the steps to
be taken and estimates of the costs likely to be involved. That is
crucial and central to the whole programme of funded decommissioning
programmes.</div>
					<a name="0803059000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
might think that &#147;disposal&#148; was a fairly straightforward
concept, which just means getting rid of the nuclear waste. However,
nuclear waste does not really go away in that sense. We all know that
we cannot just dispose of it in landfill&#151;or perhaps we are
dealing with a variation of landfill. I raised the matter during the
evidence sessions with Dr. Roxburgh, who gave evidence for the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority. He talked about waste disposal being
included along with the cost of
decommissioning&#151;</div>
					<a name="0803059000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so
the complete life cycle cost would have to be
recovered&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0803059000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
other words, recovered from the private operators. I asked, to be
clear:</div>
					<a name="0803059000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
long-term life cycle, do you mean thousands of years in the future,
potentially?&#148;</div>
					<a name="0803059000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about the complete life cycle of nuclear materials here. He
replied:</div>
					<a name="0803059000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the
sense that once waste is placed in a deep geological repository, I
assume that it becomes a property of the Government, or at least that
it is on some sort of lease. That issue has yet to be
addressed&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>
					<a name="0803059000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, strangely, it suddenly
becomes rather unclear whether &#147;disposal&#148; in the terms of
the Bill as currently defined means disposal by and at the expense of
the private operators, or whether there is emerging some new kind of
public taxpayer liability, albeit a long distance into the future. I
asked Dr.
Roxburgh:</div>
					<a name="0803059000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So
you are expecting there to be no costs attached to that that will not
be covered.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0803059000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
replied:</div>
					<a name="0803059000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
will have to ask the Government about
that.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Energy Public Bill
Committee, </i>5 February 2008; c. 59, Q112-114.]</div>
					<a name="0803059000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what I am doing right
now.</div>
					<a name="0803059000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
&#147;disposal&#148;, in the terms of the funded decommissioning
programmes, being interpreted&#151;perhaps hopefully by the
Government&#151;as simply taking the lorry to the gate of the
long-term storage repository? Or is it, as our amendment would make the
Bill clearly state, talking about emplacement within it? That is
critical, because the long-term storage repository is not simply a
neutral facility but something that the Minister himself described as
perhaps remaining uncapped and potentially accessible for as long as a
century. Potentially, I suppose, if future Governments, in a
century&#146;s time, thought it was unsafe to cap it completely and
make it inaccessible. They might choose to leave the repository
uncapped and maintained at some minimum level long into the future. We
can imagine that, on the kind of time scales that we are talking about,
even a low level of maintenance could rack up quite a bill for the
taxpayer. Even the light bulb in a &#147;Keep out&#148; sign
maintained for thousands of years would add up to quite a substantial
cost to the public purse. These are serious
issues.</div>
					<a name="0803059000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I was in legacy fundraising for Oxfam, occasionally people left
substantial gifts to Oxfam in their will. The legacies quite often came
with a little proviso that we, for instance, maintained a headstone in
perpetuity, because people wanted graves maintained. We are talking
about a different kind of grave here, but the risk is the same. Oxfam
always removed that provision, by deed of variation, from those wills,
because over time those costs build up&#151;they add up to a
significant long-term storage liability, to take the analogy a bit
tastelessly far. I want to extend that principle to the Bill and make
it absolutely clear that the Government are not allowing the Bill, by a
small loophole of definition, not to mean actual disposal in the
long-term geological repository. The cost of doing that for new nuclear
power stations should be recovered from the operators, as was the
intention and as was the sense of the Government&#146;s and the
Opposition&#146;s
statements.</div>
					<a name="0803059000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Government think that the legacy programme bears some kind of
responsibility for the long-term repository, and that in some strange
way it is paid for by the taxpayer on a more reasonable basis, because
the legacy programme exists and we have to work out what to do with the
waste. That is true, but over a very long time that will even out
considerably. If the nuclear programme continues into the future, in
time, the original legacy programme waste will be a minor part of the
nuclear waste being disposed of. Therefore, before the Government go
down the path of building new nuclear power stations, it is important
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>establish the principle that the cost of very long-term storage will not
be borne by the taxpayer.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0803059000577"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> On at least two occasions I have had
the opportunity to specify what costs will be paid
for by the company. Let me approach the issue again. The Government are
tackling the waste issue, and we recognise the importance of continuing
to make progress on waste management and disposal. We set out, in the
nuclear White Paper, our policy for managing and disposing of waste
from new nuclear power stations. The Government believe that it is
technically possible to dispose of new higher-activity radioactive
waste in a geological disposal facility. That is a viable solution and
the right approach for managing waste from new nuclear power
stations.</div>
					<a name="0803059000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government consider that it would be technically possible and desirable
to dispose of both new and legacy waste in the same geological disposal
facilities. That should be explored through the Managing Radioactive
Waste Safely programme. We also consider that waste can and should be
stored in safe and secure interim storage facilities until a geological
disposal facility becomes
available.</div>
					<a name="0803059000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the draft guidance on funded decommissioning programmes, we
acknowledged that operators would need certainty over the date when
they can pass the liability for their intermediate-level waste and
spent fuel over to the Government for disposal&#151;that is the nub
of the question. To meet that need, we will agree a schedule with each
operator for when title to and liability for waste and spent fuel will
pass to the Government. That schedule will be based on a conservative
view of the estimated dates of availability of disposal facilities, and
it will not begin until the operator&#146;s decommissioning programme
has been completed.</div>
					<a name="0803059000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
described earlier our approach to setting a fixed unit price for the
disposal of intermediate-level waste and spent fuel. I highlighted that
it was right and proper that the Government should bear the risk of
building a geological disposal facility, since we would need to do it
to dispose of our legacy waste regardless of the position on new build.
New build operators will have no influence over the project to deliver
the geological disposal facility, so it is right that they should not
bear the open-ended risks of delay to the
project.</div>

way?</div>

							<a name="0803059000579"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Let me proceed, as I think that it might help the
hon. Gentleman. My first few attempts have not helped him but this one
may.</div>
					<a name="0803059000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is equally
right and proper that operators pay for the certainty that they will
get over their costs for the disposal of intermediate-level waste and
spent fuel. The fixed unit price that operators pay will include a
significant risk premium to cover the risk that geological disposal
facilities will not be available according to the schedules agreed with
operators. Operators will be expected to dispose of low-level waste
promptly in the facility currently operating in west Cumbria or a
successor facility. We will not set a fixed unit price for the disposal
of low-level waste.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>
					<a name="0803059000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me emphasise something about
who owns waste once it is placed in a geological
repository. The Government will take title of the waste at a date or a
schedule agreed with the operator at the same time as their funded
decommissioning programme is approved and alongside setting a price for
the waste disposal service. We expect the schedule to be aligned to the
estimates for availability of disposal facilities, whatever those
estimates are at the time that operators come to the Government for a
firm view on a fixed price and would not begin until after the
operators&#146; decommissioning programme had been completed. The
issue is clear: up to a certain point in the process, the company must
meet the full costs. That has been much of the burden of our discussion
today. However, given that the waste will lie there for a very long
time, there will come a time when the title to that waste and the
responsibility for it passes from the company to the
Government.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister for his
reply. I understood the earlier explanations about having a fixed unit
cost attached to bringing the waste to the Government and effectively
passing the title and the liability over to them. However, will that
cover the cost of long-term storage with regard to new nuclear? The
Minister suggested that the new nuclear industry should not bear any
part of the cost for the repository because it would be needed for the
legacy waste. I do not really accept that.</div>
					<a name="0803059000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us imagine&#151;and I hope
that this does not happen&#151;that the new nuclear industry
continues for many years into the future. It could become the largest
contributor to that geological repository in terms of the overall
amount of waste being stored in it, and that will increase
exponentially over time if the nuclear industry continues. Why should
not the new industry contribute towards the cost of establishing that
repository as it will be for their use? It will be a public subsidy in
effect, as it will provide them with free, very long-term
storage.</div>
					<a name="0803059000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the assumption that the repository will never be full and that it can
never run out of capacity for new nuclear waste. At this moment, we
have no idea where that repository will be or what form it will take.
Therefore, we have no idea whether that will be the case or whether, at
some stage in the future and having established the principle that the
Government will pay for repositories, public funds will yet again be
used to make a new repository entirely to cope with new nuclear
waste.</div>

						</b> I think that what I will say might help the whole
Committee in its interpretation of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment. It is to do with the amount of radioactive material that
will be stored from a new fleet of reactors in a future
repository. All the estimates, which are credible, reliable
projections, are that if we were to replace all of our current fleet
with a new fleet of nuclear reactors and those reactors were to run for
their lifetimes&#151;the lifetimes in this period are assessed as 60
years, not 40 or 50&#151;the overall waste inventory in the country
would increase by less than 10 per cent. The assessment and judgment is
that it would grow by approximately 8 per cent, so we would need 8 per
cent. more capacity within a repository.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
technical knowledge on the issue. I assume that he talks about the
volume of waste in that respect. However, surely the important thing
when disposing of nuclear waste is not its volume, but its
radioactivity. I am not sure that that answer is very
reassuring.</div>

							<a name="0803059000583"></a>Mr.

						</b> In terms of cost, which is the issue that we are
addressing here, the volume is the all-important thing. In terms of the
repository, when we come to look at design safety, the radioactivity is
not that relevant.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman&#151; he reassures me to some extent. However, even 10 per
cent. of the cost does not seem to be unreasonable if that turned out
to be the situation. Why should not 10 per cent. of the cost of what, I
presume, is a very expensive exercise in building a long-term
geological repository be recovered from the nuclear
industry?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Act one is where we accept that we have a legacy
problem. I have still not worked out whether the Liberal Democrats
agree that we have such a problem and have to bear the costs of that
from public funds. In an era of new nuclear, we have said that, as far
as reasonably possible, we will do out utmost to ensure that the full
share of new nuclear waste is paid for by the companies&#151;it is
not just about the decommissioning, and attendant costs.</div>
					<a name="0803059000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the hon. Member for
Cheltenham to hear this point, as I think that it
will satisfy him. Given that the geological repository will need to be
larger than a repository for only the legacy of nuclear
waste&#151;although, as he says, people can exaggerate how much space
is required&#151;we have said that new build operators will pay a
contribution to the fixed costs of the geological repository as well as
the costs directly attributable to them. I hope that ensuring that
operators pay their full costs shows our good faith, but there will
come a time, if only for the sake of the important consideration of
national security, when the state will take over
responsibility.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> My background is in business as well as charity.
The Government have the only facility available and a captive market of
nuclear companies wishing to dispose of their waste. Why stop at new
nuclear companies when private companies are producing waste at
existing nuclear power stations? Should the investors in those private
companies not be expected to contribute some of the cost of long-term
geological repositories?</div>
					<a name="0803059000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">The market price commanded
should be more than enough to guarantee that any long-term costs will
be more than covered. I am not clear from the technical advice given by
the hon. Member for Copeland exactly how much of the cost is expected
to be covered, or how the 10 per cent. will be calculated. It is
difficult to imagine how we could calculate the cost far into the
future. If the repository is to be maintained for 100 years or so, and
the nuclear industry continues, perhaps with other nuclear power
stations replacing the 60 years&#146; worth that we have immediate
plans to build, how can we have the idea that it should somehow
ultimately be a long-term Government liability? Why can we not make it
a liability on private companies?</div>

					<a name="0803059000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that a risk premium might be included in the fixed unit
costs for disposal, but that that was to guard against the possible
unavailability of repositories. Presumably, the long-term costs of
maintenance have not been factored in. Dr. Roxburgh did not answer that
question for me, and nor has the Minister. What calculations have been
made about the likely long-term maintenance of any uncapped storage
repository, and is it intended that the costs should be entirely
recovered from the unit costs, either by way of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>a bond or insurance premium or through some other financial mechanism?
We are simply trying to establish whether the Bill contains yet another
loophole to bring in a public taxpayer liability by the back door, or
whether we are taking every possible step to ensure that all the
long-term costs that might emerge will be met by the nuclear
industry.</div>
