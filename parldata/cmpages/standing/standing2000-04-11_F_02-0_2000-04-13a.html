<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 15, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to the range and balance of experience between the various members of the Council'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am pleased that you, Mr. Benton, and my colleagues and I have made it to this early start. I was metaphorically motoring down the Corridors to be here on time. Before I generate any notes, as I may need to later, I thank the Minister for honouring his undertaking at the previous sitting to supply details of the application pack for appointments to the Learning and Skills Council, which I have received. In fact, I have received a duplicate set of documents. It is not the first time that that has happened at the Department and it delayed me momentarily, because I needed to check whether there were any differences between the documents, as with the child's game in which one looks for differences in the picture and lists them.

<P>
Being a literary man, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) will no doubt remember the Latin tag bis dat qui cito dat, which means he gives twice who gives quickly. In this case, the Minister has done better than that, because he has supplied the information quickly and supplied it twice, so I thank him for that. We will no doubt have an opportunity to study the ideas in the long years of the Committee-if it goes on that long-or on another occasion.

<P>
Our discussion at the previous sitting and the amendment raise important issues in connection with public appointments. I think that it is probably unwise-certainly for Opposition Members-to spend too much time reminiscing about ministerial experience. In some parts of the British Isles, people who have been abroad on colonial service are known to the locals as ``when I's'', because their sentences always begin, ``When I was.'' I shall not do that, but I think that it might be germane in this case, because the Minister has the responsibility for making public appointments and I have some experience of that. It is a complicated and difficult matter.

<P>
I will make one general point. The Minister had to change his timetable because Second Reading did not take place in the Commons first-that is an open secret-and he was therefore unable to start the selection process, so he should take his time and not feel obliged to hurry to make the appointments. Picking up on my breathless remarks a moment ago, it is important that we do not make early selections that we later regret. The Minister should consider carefully what he is trying to achieve with the balance of the appointments, which brings me to amendment No. 4.

<P>
The Secretary of State has to appoint the members of the Learning and Skills Council. Under subsection (3), he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>must have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience relevant to the Council's functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a personal test. I would be extraordinarily surprised if the Minister were disposed to receive advice supporting the appointment of anybody who was not a serious player in the business of education or did not have a serious interest in the subject. The Minister would have failed us badly if he appointed such a person, and I am sure that he does not wish to do that.

<P>
For people to establish their bona fides, they must have experience. The Minister will remember the rather jocular exchanges we had at the previous sitting, pointing out that Members of Parliament might have relevant experience. Plenty of hon. Members have been active in further education. They would have to disqualify themselves from membership of the House, but so be it. I do not think that many volunteers have rushed to fill in the Minister's application pack yet. However, it is unlikely that a person lacking in experience relevant to the council's functions would progress through the sifting process, although it is sensible to provide for that possibility, and that is much precedented in earlier legislation.

<P>
Unless the Minister's response is particularly inept, I will not be disposed to press the amendment to a vote. The purpose of the amendment is simply to sound out the Minister's intentions on the wider issue. He can make a limited number of appointments-between 12 and 16, as specified in subsection (2)-so he does not have much headroom, and he will be under huge pressure when making appointments. It will be of no surprise to anyone familiar with the public appointments process to learn that, as Ministers in another place have already made clear, it is not common or wise for Ministers to appoint representatives of specific interests. That is not what we are about. We want good people.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcom Wicks) </b>indicated assent.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is nodding.

<P>
We do not want people who regard themselves as delegates of a particular interest group. Our amendment is designed to probe for information not about the competence of the individual, because that is already covered, but about how the Minister will build up his team-from his Cabinet, to use the political analogy-and achieve a range and balance in his appointments. We should spend some time on that important subject.
Mr. Boswell
<P>
I have formulated the amendment to allow for a series of tests. The first and most controversial test would be for a degree of political balance. I would have no complaint if the Minister appointed people who had no political connections. They may have a distinguished record in public life or in education, but no political handle. We must avoid any skew in the political bias of appointments-we touched on that rather obliquely during the previous sitting. The Minister will know of Dame Rennie Fritchie's recent report on appointments in the national health service. I appreciate that he was not personally responsible for making choices in that Department, but he may have had collective responsibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that Dame Rennie's report, which is available from the Vote Office, clearly shows that there is no evidence of bias towards Labour party members in the national health service posts that are within the gift of Ministers and others, and that Conservative appointments still hold overwhelming sway in the NHS?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With respect, there may be different interpretations of the position, and that is not my understanding of the overall report. Of course there is a lag, and it would be neither reasonable nor sensible to remove people appointed by another Government until they had reached the end of their natural span of appointment. In my local experience of health authority appointments in Northamptonshire, and in Dame Rennie's findings on the national position on new appointments, there is some concern about the level of bias. I say that to the hon. Gentleman without intending to be too controversial.

<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): The hon. Gentleman talked about his local situation, which reminds me that a Liberal Democrat local councillor was appointed as a non-executive director in north Staffordshire a few weeks ago. One might think that it would be difficult to estimate the lady's politics given that she is a Liberal Democrat, but it is clear that she was not a Labour nominee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady will have to do better than to cite a particular example to make a general cae.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Ruane </B>(Vale of Clwyd): The chairman of my local health authority, Michael Griffiths, was once known as the quango king of the country, having been appointed to three quangos by the Conservatives. He is a known Conservative, and was reappointed as recently as last October by a Labour Administration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. I have a feeling, Mr. Benton, that you might become somewhat weary of rehearsing the cases cited by hon. Members. There could be other cases, and I am concerned, for example, about the political affiliations of appointees to the east midlands regional development agency and, therefore, about its political balance. However, we shall not go into that now.

<P>
I am glad that I have got the point of controversy out of the way at the start-it will have woken everybody up, if they were not already paying attention. However, my substantial point is that there is the potential in any public appointment mechanism for a political skew. The Minister does not seem to be the kind of person who sets out in the morning saying, ``How am I going to dish the Tories today? Well, I have a choice between A, B and C. C is a Tory, so he is out, and I'm not certain about B, but A is a darn good Labour Member.'' There is, of course, the interesting issue of whether appointees are old Labour, in which case I might have a dialogue with the Minister, or new Labour, in which case I would be less sympathetic. However, that is a problem for other members of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I have woken up. The issue is the need for transparency. To come back to education, I tried to find out the political affiliations of school adjudicators. The Minister told me that that was not a question that we asked. I then found out that the adjudicator who is about to make a decision on the closure of three primary schools in the north-east was the deputy leader of Sheffield city council when the Secretary of State was its leader. The man might be perfectly honourable, decent and capable, but the fact that that connection is lurking in the background raises the suspicion that something might not be quite right. That is the point that the hon. Member for Daventry is making and which we want to be clarified in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That is precisely the point to which I was coming. There is no suggestion-nor need there be in this Committee-that the Minister will promote a biased set of appointments or that individuals with political affiliations and those who, to use the Nolan terms, have recently indulged in political activity should be barred from the process. However, we all need to know what is going on.

<P>
I had a brief dialogue with the Minister on the separate issue of appointments to further education corporations, which are less directly controllable, and I have asked a question about that. Again, there is a public interest in being able to establish beyond doubt that there is no systematic bias in appointments. That is one area that we have rehearsed fairly fully, and there could be a question about balance.

<P>
I have used two terms of art-range and balance-and I do not have ownership of them. However, another issue occurs to me-the regional balance of appointments. The United Kingdom suffers from a south-eastern focus, and I say that with no disrespect to the Minister, who is a London Member-my constituency is within striking distance of the metropolis. The English media are largely concentrated in London, and it is necessary for hon. Members to meet in London for many of their debates. I am sure that the Minister intends to have a sensible regional representation.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
I hope that, in conducting his tours, although it will sometimes be inconvenient because of other pressures on his time, he will go round the United Kingdom as actively as he can to see the provision in different parts of the country. The essence of further education provision is primarily to service local needs and to be locally conducted. To achieve that, it is important to have a sensible regional balance.

<P>
On the relationship between the various sectors and interests, people may have experience of higher national diplomas, or further education as a precursor to higher education, and persons in higher education may have a specific interest in further education. For example, Sir Richard Southwood, former vice-chancellor of Oxford university, whom I hold in high regard, once said to me that he was interested in further education. My initial reaction was to think to myself, ``Perhaps that is what vice-chancellors of Oxford university say when they are in an inclusive mood.'' I live near the city of Oxford, and I had independent corroboration from people in the further education sector who said to me, ``Yes. The vice-chancellor is extremely interested in what we do.'' That is welcome. Given that, in later amendments we shall address concerns about the links between further education and higher education, and we may have to explore the boundaries.

<P>
There are also links with the compulsory sector for the under-16s. In order to achieve range and balance, it is desirable for some members of the council to have an association with the school years, especially as I suspect that, like Opposition Members, the Minister is becoming increasingly concerned about disaffection and social exclusion and is considering ways in which to motivate young people in key stages 3 and 4 to try to find sensible and attractive routes for them to stay within the formal system and not to vote with their feet by bunking off school and joining the ranks of the socially excluded. Although the snapshot of the Learning and Skills Council is wide, it must not fail to take account of the borders between the higher education and compulsory sectors.

<P>
We must not forget the balance of abilities and the balance between different providers. In further education, for example, we tend to speak of the state financed sector, but there are private providers. As for training, some is provided with assistance from the public sector, some is entirely private and some is carried out in firms at their expense. There is a range of interest, and I have reservations, not of the Bill as drafted, but of some contexts. The training perspective may be lost, because although people had different views about the training and enterprise councils, that specific focus was part of their remit.

<P>
The final issue is what might be loosely be called representative balance. The one, firm rock in the uncharted waters of ministerial appoinments is the Secretary of State's assertion, made at the time of the White Paper and repeated by successive Ministers and in another place, that 40 per cent. of the appointments will be made from the business sector. Forty per cent. may seem a high figure and it would probably mean five or six places for persons with a business background, considering the size of the council, but it is a smaller percentatge than in the TEC's, in which the typical business representation is two thirds. The people involved are chairmen or chief executives-big hitters in local business. If the Government are committed to the figure of 40 per cent., why are they reluctant to put it in the Bill? There may be a technical explanation for that ommission and, if so the Minister should give it.

<P>
What will be the nature of the business experience of those appointed? Someone classified as a business person may have been in business 20 years ago, without great success, and then taken up a career in the public sector. That is very different from a person who is an active chief executive. One problem is that high flyers work hard in their own businesses and it may therefore be difficult to release them; the Minister may want to think about that aspect.

<P>
We have not tabled an amendment specifically to prescribe the percentage of business participation, but we may wish to return to the matter at a later stage and in the light of the Minister's response. He owes it to the Committee to explain what he has in mind.

<P>
We have some concerns about local authority representation and what is described as the Bill's democratic deficit. Local authorities represent local interests and local democracy; I shall leave their undoubted expertise in post-compulsory education for another debate. I understand that the Minister is minded to put one local education authority representative on the councils. I am critical of the Liberal Democrat proposals for regional councils, because a balanced representation at any unit larger than a sub-region for the local learning and skills councils would be extremely difficult.

<P>
I live 30 miles from the county town at the edge of a county which is also an LLSC area. It is unlikely that one of my local councillors will be selected as a local authority representative on the local learning and skills council, let alone on the national LSC.

<P>
Other further education representatives must be considered: for example, the providers of education, students in further education and training and trade union members. I understand that there will be one trade union member on the council. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) knows that I have considerable respect for the education activities of the trade union movement. I hope that we will have some debates that are not politically supercharged abouthow best to involve trade union members in the process. We may be at one on some of these issues.

<P>
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education has expressed concern to members of the Committee about the release of people to fulfil these public duties-the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) is nodding-and this is a legitimate matter for discussion. Again we find ourselves with a common understanding of the objectives. Nevertheless, there is a need for reassurance from the Minister on such questions as how we avoid political bias and promote transparency. We need to be told why business should be involved, and why the Minister is nevertheless diffident about putting his commitment in the Bill. We need to hear how the other interlocking parts of the jigsaw will be compounded, and to know how the Minister will deal with this difficult process.
Mr. Boswell
<P>
The Government have proposed that the council be made up of between 12 and 16 members-numbers closely similar to those of the Further Education Funding Council. We cannot rely on single-function people as representatives, and certainly not as delegates with particular interests, nor can we rely on their overall ability. The ideal is to have people with genuine experience in a range of activities related to education, employment, training, skills, public administration and higher education. As the clause suggests, they must be good as individuals. We want the Secretary of State to have regard to the range and balance of experience among the council's members. Our amendment would cover that wider duty in the composition of the interlocking jigsaw. We look forward to hearing hon. Members' contributions and the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman's arguments. The amendment's aim is clear. The Committee would support the proposal for range and balance in choosing of members of the council, because that is the Bill's intention. The hon. Gentleman did not explain why there should be 40 per cent. business representation. I am not questioning whether that is a good idea.

<P>
One reason for dispensing with the TECs-a move that I support although I know that other Members have different views-is that they have not been an unqualified success; indeed, in some instances they were an unqualified disaster, although others have done a great deal of excellent work. There is no evidence that the predominance of business representatives on the TECs produced arrangements that meet the needs of learning and skills training. Will the Minister explain why the Government chose 40 per cent. business representation, and say what it is that the business community can offer that other providers and groups cannot?

<P>
Let us consider the record of colleges. Despite criticism, our further education colleges have done a remarkable job providing education and training for young people, yet they do not have a secure place at the table. There is ample evidence that some superb people on local education authorities have done excellent work over a long period, yet LEAs have been disregarded in the composition of the LSC. We are not saying that there should not be business people and the many other groups mentioned by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), but why do we have this preconceived idea that business somehow has the answer? Perhaps the Minister could produce some survey data or research to show that business people possess the magical qualities necessary to move us forward. If so, we will support him wholeheartedly.

<P>
At the moment, however, any such evidence is unavailable. In fact, evidence suggests that successful business people are too busy running their own businesses to be sidelined into something else. If the council is to be successful, we need people to concentrate their entire attention on it. It is that important. We look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Good morning, Mr. Benton.

<P>
We are pleased that the hon. Member for Daventry-and, I hope, other hon. Members-received a pack and appreciated our thoughtfulness insending him a second one for his bedside table. He was obviously reading it early this morning. I am glad that it worked.

<P>
Amendment No. 4 would require the Secretary of State to have regard
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the range and balance of experience between the various members of the Council''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's intentions in tabling the amendment because it provides us with an opportunity to debate the important and difficult task of striking the right balance between different sections of the community. I shall try to deal with all the points that have been raised, including the sordid question of politics.

<P>
I fully understand and share the concerns of hon. Members that the membership of the national Learning and Skills Council should reflect, and be able to speak with authority for, the views of the consumers of learning-both individuals and employers. I shall deal with the matter of 40 per cent. representation in a few moments.

<P>
There is nothing between us in our desire to have a wide range and effective balance of experience on the Council. That is certainly the Government's objective, which is why we stressed repeatedly the importance that we we attach to ensuring that the national council and the local learning and skills councils represent the whole community of interests in post-16 learning. That includes people who understand the needs of local communities, the needs of the disadvantaged or excluded, those of young people, people with special learning needs, difficulties or disabilities, of adult learners and of people who face discrimination. Our prospectus sets that out clearly.

<P>
We are doing our best to encourage a range of interests. As stated earlier this week to hon. Members, we wish to bring this measure to the attention of good men and women because their country needs them. We have had discussions with the Commision for Racial Equality as to how best to encourage applicants from ethnic minorities to apply.

<P>
The provision for 40 per cent. representation for business raises two issues. The first is whether the 40 per cent. figure is right. I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Daventry believes that 40 per cent. is too low. He made a comparison with the larger representation on TECs. Obviously, if representation of the business community were two thirds, the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the need for other interests to be represented would be exacerbated on the basis of simple arithmetic. Only a few places would be available for the remaining wide range of interests. We believe that 40 per cent. is right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was awaiting the Minister's response for precisely the reasons suggested by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). We need to know the principle behind the Minister's thinking. We also want to know why, if 40 per cent. is a principled commitment, that figure does not appear in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I was about to come on to the principle of the issue when I gave way. Let me explain why business representation is important. I will not pretend that there is something scientific about 40 per cent. as opposed to 45 per cent. We should not try to dance on the head of a pin on the arithmetic, but it comes down to the overall purpose of what we are about in the Bill. As we said on Tuesday, we want learning, training and post-16 education for young and old alike. We want the Learning and Skills Council to be led by concerns about demand and need in the community. This is about demand rather than supply and much of that demand, although not all of it, is from the business community.

<P>
In some communities, particularly in areas of high unemployment, businesses cannot recruit people with the skills that they require. It is therefore important that the business community should have an important voice so that our objectives for learning, training and post-16 education can be fulfilled. Our judgment, given the importance of that point but also the need to balance it with other important interests, is that about 40 per cent. is right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Will my hon. Friend also look at the range of experiences of those business people? Few of those whom I meet work in manufacturing. They tend to be service sector based, even though a third of Worcester's economy is manufacturing based. How can that be brought in within that 40 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question. Much will depend on the applications that we receive, but it is vital to strike balances between the different sectors of the economy and therefore to balance the needs of the manufacturing base and the needs of what some describe, often unhelpfully, as the new economy. The Government has given assurances on this matter. Much depends on the applications, but the early indications in the national posts makes us optimistic about the levels of interest. We are determined to have the 40 per cent. on the national and local councils, but we do not feel that that should be in the Bill.

<P>
I understand the concerns of the hon. Member for Daventry; but we are not playing games here. We do not say that someone who might have been in the private sector 40 years ago would be included in the 40 per cent. Our documentation clearly refers to substantial recent business and commercial experience. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that assurance from me. When it comes to other interests-I pause here to agree with the hon. Gentleman that we do not want to have people around that table who represent an interest in a narrow way and we have made it clear that they are not there as delegates-we need to resist any temptation to play a numbers game. We should not say that one sector should have one and another should have one and a half and so on. That would not be helpful.

<P>
When we were pressed on the local government issue we said that we would expect local government to have a chair-or more than one chair, because we are not being restrictive-around that table. We have repeatedly said during the passage of the Bill in the Upper House that we expect at least one member to have current local authority experience, but we have resisted calls, I believe rightly, to specify a quota.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is making heavy weather of somewhat uncharted waters. Will he explain whether the nature of the commitment to 40 per cent. business is different in character or quality from the nature of the commitments to which he has just referred in relation to local authority representation? For example, is he saying that he will have 40 per cent. business come what may, although he is reluctant to put it in the Bill, but he would rather like to have one local authority representative, which in mathematical terms is about 8 per cent? There seems to be a certain mismatch between making a mathematical, percentage commitment to business and a vague undertaking in relation to other interests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Uncharted waters occasionally entail heavy weather in my brief experience of the sea, and we shall certainly try to avoid rocks in our deliberations. Let us not make too much heavy weather. We have said that 40 per cent. business representation is right. Clearly, much depends on applications coming forward. We are confident that good applications will be made. We have had regional meetings about the Bill and there has been good business interest throughout the country. We are confident that we shall be able to fulfil that percentage.

<P>
We have made a clear statement, which I shall not repeat, about the importance of local government and its need to be represented.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> May I tease out from the Minister his thinking on the relationship between learning and skills councils and local councils, and the RDAs? There appears to be a conflict in that the Government have set up nine RDAs with the distinct objective of regenerating the economic development of an area. Yet a learning and skills council has an overriding objective of dealing with the skills shortage and deficit. The Liberal Democrat party strongly supports the Government's intentions with both of those, yet there does not appear to be the close relationship that one would expect between the new RDA movement and the Learning and Skills Council, both at national and local levels. Does the 40 per cent. business representation have any relationship to the RDAs? Or may they simply pass like ships in the night-as we are following nautical analogies today rather than cricket ones.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a strong interest in RDAs. As a head teacher he may have had to tell pupils at the back of the class to remember the last lesson. We had a full discussion about RDAs earlier in the week, stimulated by the hon. Gentleman's amendment, and he will see from Hansard that I specified the close relationship that we want to strike between RDAs and LSCs. However, if he is still unclear I shall be happy to take it up with him at a later stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> There is a disjunction between Labour policy on RDAs and the way in which, for good, logical reasons, the LSCs have been set up geographically. I agree with the Minister that to try to put numbers on the make-up of the councils would be unnecessary, at this point at least. Will he agree to look again at the way in which, when the board is made up, a positive membership link between the RDAs and the LSC could be established? That would go a long way towards rewelding the connections that need to be made and-perphaps unusually-it might also satisfy the Opposition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I hope to respond soon to the hon. Gentleman's question. Meanwhile I give way to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is an amplification of the point made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton. Will the Minister accept that some of us have been concerned, in organisational terms, that the linkage between the Learning and Skills Council and its local equivalents, and the RDAs has been a dotted line relationship in what has been seen as a complex, but coherent organisational model. That goes to the heart of our concerns. We need to know how the two will connect.

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Again, I refer back to an earlier discussion. We had a stimulating amendment on the matter that we felt we had to resist. We tried to explore the relationship between RDAs and learning and skills councils. I said on that earlier occasion that there would be one senior RDA figure on both the national Learning and Skills Council and on four of the local learning and skills councils. I think that that is firmer than a dotted line and a clear way to link RDAs and learning and skills councils.

<P>
Our concerns are essentially about economic development at regional level. They relate not only to issues of skills, but to how we relate the regional perspective on economics to a more local, sub-regional approach to learning and skills. That requires closer contact with local communities. If, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman would like more reassurance and information, I shall be happy to provide it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We are not trying to be difficult, but RDAs do not have the sub-regional structure described in the Bill. If the Minister is saying that he will suggest to his hon. Friends that RDAs should have a sub-regional structure, that makes sense, but in reality the structure is disjointed. All I am trying to achieve is that, when we have finished with the Bill, we have a development in learning and skills that matches that in the regions, not the disjointed structure that prevails at present in the TEC movement and the plethora of other organisations that try to fill the skills shortage and the gap in training.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand that. In the previous sitting I referred briefly to that need. Life can be complex, and it is clearly a complex task to relate national policies and the needs of the national economy to the local dimension. It is the function of RDAs to consider the regional dimension. There is disagreement between us, but the Government feel the need for a more local dimension for learning and skills, hence the 47 learning and skills councils. In different ways, we need to get the relationship right.

<P>
Because of the interest in the subject and its importance, I shall look at the Hansard report of this part of the discussion. If I think that it would be useful to write to hon. Members with greater clarity or more detail, I shall be happy to do so.

<P>
As I have stressed, because of the need to get the balance right between different interests-in the best sense of the term-we have asked all interested partners and stakeholder organisations to encourage their people to apply for posts, according to the Nolan principles. Earlier this month we openly advertised the key posts and we shall ensure that an independent assessor will sit on the appointments panels. Those panels will make recommendations to the Secretary of State on the best candidates for the post. I repeat the assurances that the Government have given on many occasions, including when the matter was discussed in another place, that all appointments will be made in accordance with the guidance of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. A person's ability to do the job well over the period of appointment is the significant criterion for appointment. We shall strive to achieve a balanced council that reflects the diversity of the population, which is the purpose of the amendment. As I said earlier, the amendment has been useful for stimulating good discussion. However, we do not need extra words built into the Bill to achieve the objective. Action is already taking place.

<P>
Before I conclude, I should like to deal with political balance. There is always controversy and concern on that matter. I wish to assure the Committee that we want the best people from different sectors-regardless ot their political views. I understand, however, that in charged situations an assurance may not be enough. The application forms for the prospective chairman of the Learning and Skills Council include a section-section 5-on political activity. I was able to tick most of the boxes, my party chairman will be pleased to know. We wish to monitor the situation: activities of a political nature are covered and space for stating the name of the party for which the activity was undertaken is included on the form. I hope that that provides some assurance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I realise that the Minister is trying to assist the Committee and I wish to be sure that I have not misunderstood him. I assume that he is concerned to monitor the prior experience and activities of individuals who put their names froward for consideration and also their continuing activities. Some political activities could continue after appoinment, which were not precluded by the terms of appointment, that could give rise to allegations of unfairness in carrying out the council's duties. Will the Minister clarify the position on that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The purpose of this section on the application from is to allow us to undertake proper monitoring and to respond, if necessary, to parliamentary scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman raised an important point about future political activity. At this stage, I undertake to reflect further on the matter. It will crop up again later in the Bill when we reach clauses on financial and other interests of Council members. We intend to deal fully and properly with that. If appropriate recommendations about a wider code were made, we would be prepared to consider them. I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee on this matter latter.

<P>
I wish to assure the Committee of our good intentions and I shall cite one notable example. Tony Newton, the former Member for Briantree, is now in another place. I remember him as a helpful Leader of the House when I introduced a private Member's Bill for carers, which became legislation. He has been appointed to the Further Education Funding Council and is doing an excellent job. He is a one nation Tory and he provides a good example of our intentions.

<P>
With those assurances and particularly the reassurance that the Government share the objective behind the amendment of striking the right balance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has sought to appear as the soul of reasonableness. Let me respond to his comments about political affiliation by saying that he has satisfied our concerns in some measure. My association with my noble Friend, Lord Newton of Braintree, goes back to the days when he was my first boss, some 35 years ago. I shall share the Minister's appreciation of my noble Friend's political abilities. I am also delighted about his involvement with the Further Education Funding Council. Across the Committee, we seem to concur that there is no reason why a person who is or has been politically active should be precluded from putting his name forward.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, we need transparency and accountability. The Minister said that he would carefully monitor the pattern of appointments, which meets our concern. He also said that he would consider the issue of members' subsequent conduct, and I do not seek trouble in that regard. I have perfectly good relations with people in local authorities and regional development agencies whom I know to be of a Labour affiliation, and that is not a problem. However, it is important that such people are seen to act fairly, particularly when making controversial decisions-for example, on recommendations for the closure of a college. It is important that decisions are not seen as politically driven. I respect what the Minister said in that regard, but I would like further assurances. That is very much in the spirit of the modern approach to administration.

<P>
I felt less convinced on the more general issues. As I said on Second Reading, it is difficult to caricature the Minister as a mad axe man who will set off on his own agenda, unconcerned about any collateral damage. The word ``balance'' has often sprung to my lips, but some cynical and critical people will not regard it as sufficient or adequate-to borrow words that seem to resonate in this regard. Ministers must be a little sharper and clearer about their intentions. The Minister has said that he will draw on the abilities of persons with experience in LEAs, and I have no doubt that he will. I am sure that he will do his best to accommodate the multiple interests in the sector. Ideally-we are not at odds on this-he will bring in people whose curriculum vitae demonstrates experience across the sector. However, I am concerned that the Government, who have discovered that they cannot survive without being business friendly, have, characteristically, adopted a virtual business friendliness. They assert their friendship, but conduct a cyber relationship, not a substantive one. That is demonstrated by our exchanges. The Minister say that he wants 40 per cent. representation. The exact figure is a matter of judgment, and I will concede the Minister his choice for the purpose of this argument. However, we did not get a full answer on whether his commitment on that differed from that to involve a local authority representative or an RDA representative; he has not said whether it is a soft commitment or a firm intention. However, it should be in the Bill if it is a firm intention, and the Government have certainly tried to convey that impression to the business community, which is bruised and concerned because of the dismantling of TECs and the feeling that business interests are being marginalized. If the Minister's commitment is merely the same as every other commitment, business will draw its own conclusions and might withdraw from some aspects of its involvement in the council's activities. No one wants that.

<P>
This has been a useful exchange, because it has shown that although the Government go around saying that they have good intentions, they have no plans to enshrine them in the Bill. That may or may not be right, but the problem must be exposed. It might be better to leave matters as they are, reflect on them-as the Minister has undertaken to do-and return to them later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Clause 1 is obviously important, and one or two points need to be made before we pass on to the rest of the Bill.

<P>
We have had a good and lively debate, notwithstanding the time. I am glad that we have got away from cricketing analogies, not least because I cannot offer the wealth of cricketing history and anecdotes that have entertained the Committee. It would not be fair to compare the Minister's performance with the circketing season so far, which, as we all know, has been washed out. The Minister's responses have been far from a wash-out. I pay tribute to the way in which he has courteously and with patience and good humour responded to the debates. However, he is at some risk of slow scoring and possibly falling behind the over rate because some concerns remain.

<P>
At the top of our list of concerns, are the following points. First, will the structure that is being put in place underneath the clause be as responsive to local needs as the TECs have been? Secondly, will it involve the same amount of genuine business leadership as the TECs, at their best, have shown? I am fortified by a submission that we have received from the Confederation of British Industry because those points are top of its list of priorities, too. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The CBI believes that business involvement and local flexibility are necessary for the new system to work effectively.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Will the system bring about the same level of business involvement, which is very much needed? Hertfordshire TEC, which has had a substantial degree of business involvement, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The `new' workplace needs a new workforce of people with up-to-date skills who have positive attitudes to work and lifelong learning. If this challenge is to be achieved employers and the business community must play a central role in determining educational and skills needs. The Bill must seek to establish a culture where employer investment in training and in raising the skills of the workforce is a high priority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Hertfordshire TEC has got it right. We need to create a culture of employer investment. Certainly the TECs have had a great deal of success in bringing that about. Will the new edifice build upon that good work? We still have many doubts on that score.

<P>
The needs of individuals seeking training in the system are not in conflict with the demands of business; the two are in many respects coterminous. Of course we need poeple who have skills that are relevant to businesses in their area. I speak as someone who is convinced of the need for local responsiveness on this. I have seen in my constituency the long-term problem of potential work forces who do not have the necessary skills to service a dynamic and growing local economy. I pay tribute again to the way in which Hertfordshire TEC has come into disadvantaged areas in my constituency and tried to give the work force the skills and education that they need.

<P>
I am conscious that I am making these remarks on a morning when the Office for National Statistics has revealed that the gap between rich and poor has grown in the past few years and that the poor have become relatively poorer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Under a Labour Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That has certainly happened under the first few years of this Government. I mention those statistics not in a political way but with some caution. I saw the explanation from No. 10 Downing Street-the spin, as some would say-that was put on those statistics. The comments remind me of those that were made 15 years ago under a Government of a different complexion. It is right to have some caution when one is talking about relative concepts of poverty, but is is certain that relevant skills and education are a good way of bringing people out from that bottom layer of society and giving them a better standard of living. 
<P>
Against that background, we ask whether clause 1 bodes well for the local economy and the independent business leadership that is needed. There is a big question mark against that. We note that under clause 1, the Secretary of State will appoint all the members of the council and the chairman, not just when the council is formed, but permanently. The council will never choose its own chairman. The members of the council at a national level will presumably be people who could safely be left with the task of choosing a chairman, to say the least. A chairman chosen by the council itself would enjoy greater confidence.

<P>
The clause states that the chairman is to be a member of the council. It is not until we reach schedule 1 that we learn that the chief executive will also be a member of the council. The process of appointing a chief executive was explained in the other place. It is apparently intended that the Secretary of State will appoint the first chief executive and the council will appoint subsequent chief executives. The Government also intend that the chairman or the proposed chairman of the council will be involved in the appointment of the chief executive, which is natural. Is the Minister satisfied that there is justification for making a distinction between the appointment of a first chief executive and subsequent chief executives and is that conducive to the best possible working relationship? We will doubtless come back to that, but we wonder about the quality of relationships under the provisions of clause 1, in which the chief executive is separated from the council.

<P>
In taking powers in clause 1, the Secretary of State gives himself a free hand in how he exercises them. All that he must do when making appointments is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience relevant to the Council's functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already observed just how bald a provision that is and it is unclear what it will mean in practice. The Secretary of State could hardly appoint to the central council someone who is completely inexperienced. Is subsection (3) anything more than a fig leaf?

<P>
I do not wish to go over the debate about business expereince, save to make one observation. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough tried to tease out the Government's thinking on this. The Minister told us that the Government judge that business membership should be 40 per cent., but it is still unclear on what basis that judgment was made and how that stands in relation to other members of the council from other backgrounds. The magic of 40 per cent. has yet to be fully explained.

<P>
In addition to the needs of business and the provision of training, we are also interested in the implications for school sixth forms. We shall come to that in greater detail later on, but clause 1 has some relevance. The Learning and Skills Council will have important new responsibilities for the funding of sixth forms. The clause appears to stand at the top of an additional tier of bureaucracy making decisions about sixth forms in addition to those that will be taken by local education authorities. What will happen to school sixth forms in practice? Talk of levelling up between sixth forms and colleges will not bring much comfort to the former if they reflect on what happened to the former grant-maintained schools after they received similar assurances of levelling up in the passage of the Schools Standards and Framework Bill.

<P>
Those concerns were revealed by a survey that we carried out of 93 secondary schools in London with a sixth form, which revealed that 60 per cent. of the heads thought that their school was under threat from the Government's proposals and 97 per cent. thought that pupils should be able to choose between school sixth forms and other providers for their further education needs. Against the background of those serious concerns, will the structure to be put in place by clause 1 result in more or less choice for people? Many see grounds for foreboding about the issue of choice and future school sixth forms in the centralised, top-down system for which clause 1 paves the way. Already in the course of the Committee there has been common ground between the Liberal Democrat and the Conservative parties on this issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> This is an important point that must be established early on. We must recognise that choice at 16 is an exceedingly important aspect of tertiary education. Under the Conservative Government, the provision in some areas was confined solely to sixth form centres and tertiary colleges, purely on economic grounds of sparsity of student numbers.

<P>
We are trying to establish a genuine opportunity for 16-year-olds, at an important point in their education, to choose the institution that is most suitable for them, given the guidance that they may receive from appropriate sources. I want to make the point at the beginning of our consideration of the Bill that Labour party policy is to move away from the position under the previous Government to one in which more, not less, choice is available at that critical age of 16. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take what I say as genuine and sincere. The Bill will go some way towards ensuring that youngsters, their parents and advisers will have those genuine choices.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am in no doubt about the hon. Gentleman's sincerity, and there is certainly no shortage of good intentions in the Committee. What concerns us is the structure being put in place and the threat that it poses to the future of school sixth forms. The structure for which clause 1 paves the way is in addition to whatever decisions local education authorities may have taken in the past. Decisions will be taken at a different level, and there is real concern about the outcome of those decisions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept from someone who in a previous ministerial capacity had to make decisions about whether schools should have or continue to have a sixth form, that when I made those decisions I was politically accountable in this place, whereas the council, however well intentioned, will be at one remove from the political debate and its responsibility?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has neatly demonstrated from his own experience yet another aspect of the democratic deficit in the Bill. We shall discuss later the way in which the new system is to operate and the effect that it will have on sixth forms, particularly when sixth form numbers change. That is another ground for real concern. Suffice to say that for today's purposes clause 1 paves the way for a highly centralised structure, which has some serious implications for the future of our sixth forms. We should note that such a centralised structure puts a big question mark against the existence of school sixth forms.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not wish to go over the issue of sixth forms, to which I am sure we shall return time and time again during the Bill. However, the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) is correct. Although the clause only contains a few lines, it is incredibly powerful. It gives the Secretary of State unprecedented powers over a huge area of our education and training system. The Committee needs to note that. We shall come back to it on Report and at Third Reading because we genuinely believe that the way that the Government are setting up this organisation is wrong.

<P>
There is no truth in the rumour that the right hon. Member for the Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) is not present because he attempted to bribe the Committee yesterday. I gather that he has another engagement, but I wanted to make that absolutely clear.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
We have three major concerns about the clause. First, the lack of clarity about the composition of the Learning and Skills Council is totally unsatisfactory. We have not had an appropriate explanation of its composition. For a Minister to say that the 40 per cent. figure ``feels right'' is utterly unacceptable. If the previous Administration had said that they would have been ridiculed, as the present Government should be ridiculed for that statement. The Minister has not produced one shred of evidence, either today or in any of his briefings, to back up the figure of 40 per cent., nor does he give any evidence about what he means by the 40 per cent. business composition or the types of business to be involved.

<P>
Secondly, the lack of co-ordination between the bodies being set up under the Learning and Skills Council and those that already exist in legislation is especially sad, given the desire of the Government and the Prime Minister for more joined-up government. I hope that the Minister will reflect on what has been said in the Committee this morning, and will establish greater co-ordination between the various organisations. I look forward to receiving his letter which may explain some of his thinking.

<P>
One of our great sadnesses-I hope the Minister, on reflection feels the same-is that there is absolutely nothing in clause 1 and nothing in what the Minister or the hon. Member for Daventry have said that brings higher education into our thinking about this part of the organisation. The idea that we can set up, on a national or regional basis, a Learning and Skills Council-an organisation for the future-that totally ignores the essential role of higher education is a flaw in the Government's thinking. Given the Minister's passion on the subject, I am sure that he will recognise that our universities have a huge role to play in our economic regeneration, particularly in the regions and in the area of research and applied research. Not to include them is a gross error. I hope that the Minister will tell us the reasoning behind that rather than say that it is just too difficult to take on the vice-chancellors.

<P>
It is a great sadness that a new education and training post-16 organisation is being set up but there is not one single word in schedule 1, clause 1 or any of the advice about the university for industry, which will be an essential tool in the programme. Will the Minister tell us how the university for industry will interface with that organisation? To have a totally different organisation being set up and run from Sheffield with no interface either with the RDAs or the Learning and Skills Council is quite staggering.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> This has been a useful discussion. It has reminded us of the debates that we have had so far and enabled us to look forward to later discussions on sixth-form education.

<P>
I shall not detain the Committee for long as some issues have been well rehearsed and discussed already. I said earlier that we would not be partisan on the subject of appointments to the learning and skills councils. However, the politician in me occasionally looks forward to my next general election address. In the manner of novelists who boast of good literary reviews on the back cover of their latest work. I have written down a couple of possibilities, ``Not a mad axeman''-Daventry and ``Not a wash out''-Hertsmere. That is a good start, but I hope that there will be some improvement, although not necessarily from Liberal Democrat Members, given the early hour.

<P>
The LSC will not take decisions about the closure or the changing nature of school sixth forms. The current structures, involving the Secretary of State and the school organisation committees and adjudicators, remain in place. We shall have ample opportunity to discuss this matter later in our proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Simply for the record, there are no formal powers for the LSC to close sixth forms, but we are worried that a sixth form could be functionally closed by starving it of LSC funding. The Secretary of States imprimatur would be merely a formality.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand the Opposition's anxieties, which they will have an opportunity to articulate later. As I said on Second Reading, I am truly sorry that the Conservative party wants to make political capital by mounting a campaign to involve schools in politics and writing to head teachers, which I deplore. I have seen the shadow Secretary of State's letter, which could raise unnecessary fears among parents and children. We are committed to the school sixth form as an important element in the education of 16 to 19-year-olds and I do not understand the scaremongering. A few months ago, in my capacity as Parliamentary Under-Sceretary, I had to judge whether a school in Sutton should have a sixth form. On the balance of the argument, I decided in favour of the proposal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Do we know whether, in addition to moderating the language, the Conservative party has also corrected the grammar in its letter to schools?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The poor grammar is still in place in that document. We maintain our crusade to tackle basic skills and we shall do our best in that respect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I advise the Minister not to set too much store in the matter of grammar, spelling or orthography, especially in relation to his Department. Particularly memorable was the mis-spelling of the word ``vegetarian'' on a pile of sandwiches in the Department.

<P>
Is the Minister's saying that it is not part of the duty of Her Majesty's Opposition to seek the views of head teachers on the threats that schools are likely to face under the Bill? It cannot be wrong at least to ask them, or do the Government want to abolish democracy for schools as well as for the councils?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> That is a matter for the Tory party. It would be perfectly reasonable because Members of Parliament discuss these matters with schools in their constituencies. A political party involving schools in a political campaign, using Tory party printed news material, is something else. But is is for the Tory party to decide how it approaches such sensitive decisions.

<P>
The hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough mentioned the university for industry. For the record, there has been close consultation at both local and national level to ensure that the UFI vision of life-long learning in the digital age can be achieved. The UFI's aim is to stimulate demand for life-long learning among businesses and individuals, and to promote the availability of, and improve access to, high quality, innovative learning opportunities through the use of information and communication technologies. That is a clear requirement in the university for industry pathfinder prospectus which was published in March 1998. Local learning skills councils will try to ensure flexible and accessible provision and build on the learndirect network established by the UFI.

<P>
Higher education is a big subject. Perhaps the appropriate setting in which to discuss it would be on Report. Given the autonomy of universities, it was not our judgment that they should be brought within the ambit of the Bill. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot express concern about over-centralisation, over-direction and too much bureaucracy-the charges levelled at times such as this-and at the same time build into the arrangement universities that pre-date many of us, and much modern government. There is room for discussion-although not-about how we build on the good practice of many universities that are involved in local business and economic development-and therefore the skills agenda-but I do not think that it is right to make provision for that in this Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I will not let the Minister get away with that. The majority of British universities are not as old as the Minister: they are relatively new organisation that were created out of the polytechnics. They are the basis of the regional university system-the bedrock organisations on which the Prime Minister has set his heart and wants 50 per cent. participation at level 4. It is unacceptable for the Minister to say that because some older universities have charters that give them an independence that we will not challenge, the higher education system should not play and integral part in the development of skills that industry and people need to meet the challenges of the new millennium.

<P>

<B>Mr Wicks:</B> I am not doing very well in getting the hon. Gentleman's endorsement.

<P>
<B>MrWillis:</B> An honourable Friend.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Indeed, we are close, although I put it to my hon. Friend that, if we are to be consistent, we must be careful about accusing Government of over-centralisation and over-bureaucracy while simultaneously wanting universities, which pride themselves on their independence, to be brought within the Bill's ambit and what, if the term were used pejoratively, would be regarded as bureaucratic arrangements. There is a problem, but I appreciate that being a Liberal Democrat is never having to be consistent. [Hon. Members: ``Ooh.'']

<P>
I will go a little further. I tremble slightly before you, Mr. Benton, because I wonder how far you will allow us to discuss higher education. But it may help the Committee if I quote a letter from my noble Friend the Minister of State, Baroness Blackstone, to my noble Friend Baroness Warwick about her role with regard to the university sector. She wrote:
 <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In maintaining the links between the sectors, and to help develop and inform its work, the LSC will draw together authoritative advice on skills supply and demand by convening, with the HEFCE-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the higher education funding body-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and other agencies, an advisory group of leading experts in the field of skills research and information. The Council will also work closely with the HEFCE and with HE institutions to achieve the National Learning Target for Level 4-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the first degree equivalent. The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our LSC Prospectus emphasises the importance of close links at both national and local level. We want the national and local LSCs to benefit from Board members who understand the needs of young people and adult learners and the national Council will invite the Chief Executive of the HEFCE to its meetings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that helps the Committee.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that elucidation through correspondence between Labour colleagues in another place.

<P>
Does the Minister intend that the LSC-which is yet another advisory body-should meet ad hoc for an initial study, or will there be a continuing study, in which case it will be yet another consultee and a further complication in the system?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> My mind was temporarily on my response to another point, Mr. Benton. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would repeat his question. I apologise to members of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I feel tempted to say to the Minister that I hope he will listen carefully to members of the Committee. I shall ask my question only once more.

<P>
Two points are relevant. Is the proposed advisory body referred to in the noble Lady's correspondence intended to meet ad hoc to establish a local appraisal of skills and to inform the joint work of local higher education institutions and the LSC and their activities at national level? Will it be a temporary construct or will it have continuing advisory activity? If it is the latter, does not it constitute yet another loop in an already complex consultation process? The Minister should give the Committee an answer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for so graciously repeating the question. My mind was on another question which I wanted to answer. [
Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman made it clear that he stands no nonsense and that he will not ask the question a third time, although I am sure that the third time would be even better.

<P>
Baroness Warwick, as the chief executive of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, clearly has an important role in all this. Baroness Blackstone communicated with her very much in that spirit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Let me deal with this question or I shall forget it and be in deep trouble with the hon. Member for Daventry. I am pleased that the right hon. Gentleman now has his pads on and has joined us at the crease.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He cannot call for proper links with higher education-although the Government contend that it is not necessary to put a provision in the Bill-while arguing that the proposed new council will be another bit of bureaucracy. With respect, the debate has to have a rational basis. We think that the new body will enable us to involve other higher education institutions in the overall agenda. I am unable to tell the Committee how many years it will exist, but we need such arrangements, including at local level. Learning partnerships, for example, have the capacity locally to involve the higher education sector. If there were a debate about this on the Floor of the House we could say more, but I do not think that it is useful to do so at this stage.
 
<P>
On the issue of business involvement, the hon. Gentleman for Harrogate and Knaresborough was dissatisfied with my treatment of questions about the 40 per cent. provision. I do not think that it is weak to state that that is our judgment. I fail to see how some scientific formula could convince the Committee that 40 per cent. is better than 43 per cent. or whatever. Given the Bill's objectives, we want a strong voice for business. That is one of the reasons why we are grateful to Nick Reilly, who heads Vauxhall, for bringing together a group of business men and women to help us with our deliberations in the Department to sell the Learning and Skills Bill and the Learning and Skills Council to a wider group of business people. I thank Nick Reilly and his colleagues for doing that. We are enthused by their enthusiasm.

<P>
We also note the helpful comments of the Confederation of British Industry, who has welcomed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government's commitment to business involvement<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
via the Bill and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The recognition of the need for the Learning and Skills Council  to take into account the sectoral skills needs of industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We welcome that. It is reasonable for hon. Members to raise legitimate concerns, but I hope that within the Committee-as well as outside-we shall all do our utmost to ensure that the men and women that we need on the councils, from business and elsewhere, come forward and are encouraged. None of us wants them to be thwarted by partisan debate.

<P>
In conclusion, I welcome the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster to the Committee. I put in a plea on behalf of my hon. Friend the Welsh Minister who has whispered the admission to me that he knows next to nothing about cricket. Given his ethnic origins, that can be forgiven. It is important that by the time we come to the Welsh clauses, we draw stumps.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the context of the admission by the Welsh Minister, one of my difficulties when serving in Government was that Mrs Thatcher had a similar unfamiliarity with the game, which reduced the effectiveness of my representations to her.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Although it is not my instinct to use cricketing metaphors or analogies, not least because I find that women colleagues in Parliament and elsewhere become wearied by them, now that I have been told that that Prime Minister hated cricketing metaphors, I may change my mind and bring in one or two to show my independence.

<P>
The Learning and Skills Council represents a new opportunity to tackle more effectively the learning and skills deficit in the United Kingdom that causes concern. The deficit has held back our economic performance and, as importantly for many of us, retarded the development of the inclusive and fair society that we seek to create.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I sense a change of gear and possibly a change from cricketing analogies, save only to say that there is a natural alphabetical order of things, but that in his performance in the clause stand part debate, the Minister found himself far down the batting order.

<P>
I shall move on now to a different sort of analogy-that of Greek tragedians-in respect of issues raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster. My right hon. Friend and perhaps other members of the Committee will be aware that Greek tragedians operated with a system of stichomythia-rapid and staccato dialogue between actors, usually not exceeding one sentence-in order to pursue a line of argument. With a view to dealing with the clutch of amendments to the schedule and on the hopeful assumption that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will return, we shall proceed through stichomythia by raising points in turn.

<P>
I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 6 and 66. To calm the Minister down, let me say that they do not pose momentous issues, but deal with important matters of detail. We wish to clarify the Government's intentions or to suggest more flexible and helpful provisions.

<P>
I shall deal first with amendment No. 66 Paragraph 2(2) of schedule 1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On ceasing to be a member a person is eligible for re-appointment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is unexceptionable. However, the previous paragraph 2(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person is to hold and vacate office as a member or as chairman or chief executive,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in distinction, as it were, from membership of the council. Amendment No. 66 is intended to tease out whether it would be desirable to specify in paragraph 2(2) that a person ceasing to be a member includes a person ceasing to be either the chairman or the cheif executive. The one provision refers to the chairman or chief executive and the other excludes them, which could mean that someone who had been a chairman or chief executive and had ceased to be so would not be eligible for reappointment. I hope that the Minister will reassure me on that point of detail. We are not trying to be difficult. If the chief executive or chairman have done a good job and deserve reappointment, they should not be ruled. out. We are anxious simply to ensure that that does not happen by accident.

<P>
I raise a similar point in relation to amendment No. 6. A chief executive holds his position either directly through appointment by the Secretary of State or through appointment by the council with the approval of the Secretary of State. In the normal course of events, a chief executive might wish to retire and the council-in consultation with the Secretary of State-will have to consider appointing a successor, perhaps from outside. If one goes and another arrives, the number of appointments will not alter. However, the chief executive could be unable to continue-perhaps due to infirmity, overwork or family commitments-but would remain a valued member of the council. In those circumstances, we do not wish to preclude continuation. If the numbers on the council are already at full stretch and the Secretary of State is faced with having to discharge the previous chief executive as a member of the council in order to accommodate a new chief executive, amendment No. 6 would allow for the possibility of increasing by one the maximum number allowed on the council.

<P>
Amendment No. 66 is intended to probe the Government's intentions regarding the reappointment of the chairman or chief executive and amendment No. 6 is intended to offer the Government a slightly higher degree of flexibility in circumstances that are difficult to envisage. The amendments are not intended to create difficulties and, in particular, are not intended to allow numbers on the council to creep up to an unmanageable level.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Amendment No. 6 comes as a surprise, because the Opposition tabled amendments in another place, which sought to remove altogether the provision in schedule 1(1) whereby the chief executive can be a member of the council. I welcome the change of heart.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, let me interrupt the Minister. Members of the Committe will be aware that it is often necessary to tease aroung both sides of an argument. Logically, if our argument in another place had been sustained and had been built into the Bill, the chief executive would not be a member of the council. The amendments were tabled to deal with circumstances in this Bill, which allows the chief executive to be a member of the council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As I said, I welcome the helpful intention behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment. It is, however, unnecessary, and I shall explain why. Schedule 1(1) already ensures that the chief executive is a member of the council. It needs to be read in conjuction with paragraphs 1(5) and (6), which ensure that, irrespective of whether an incoming chief executive is already a council member, the term of office as chief executive will determine the period served as a council member. In other words, they will be one and the same.

<P>
I shall illustrate the point with two examples. First, when an existing council member is appointed as chief executive, his existing period of office as a member will be adjusted to make it consistent with his period for the chief executive post. As long as he or she remains as chief executive, he or she will continue to be a member of the council. Once the appointment as chief executive comes to an end, he will cease to be a member of the council. Paragraph 1(5) provides for that.

<P>
My second example is the case of an incoming chief executive who is not a member of the council prior to taking up the appointment. For the same reasons, if the chief executive post falls vacant, there must also be a vacancy on the membership of the council. Even if the new chief executive were appointed from outside the council membership, there would still be a maximum of 15 council members and a vacancy resulting from the departure of the previous chief executive. That vacancy would be occupied by the incoming chief executive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am a little concerned. I can understand the Minister's mind-set and I shall need to study the position carefully. The Minister referred throughout to the chief executive, who is empowered and empanelled by paragraph (1), but the amendment also refers to the chairman, who is not so equipped as to appointment by that paragraph. The appointment of the chairman as a member of the council hangs on clause 1, which we have just despatched. Can the Minister provide the same assurances regarding the continuation of the chairman as he did for the chief executive?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, I can give that assurance. When a chief executive stands down, for whatever reason, but wishes to remain on the council, I think that the Secretary of State would wait until there was a vacancy to consider his or her application, no doubt alongside other applications. We certainly would not wish to extend the membership for that kind of reason. In such situations, it would be uncomfortable for the new chief executive officer if the former chief executive officer were still on the council, and certainly if there were no break in-between. Although I understand that it is useful to tease that out, I would resist the implication of that specific example.

<P>
After promising us careful scrutiny of the Bill-I speak as a tail-ender of course-the hon. Member for Daventry has been as good as his word. I recognise that his intention in tabling amendment No. 66 is to ensure that there is no doubt that both the chairman and the chief executive, who hold roles in addition to membership of the council, are eligible for reappointment to their additional roles. I share his view and accept the amendment in principle. I would accept it outright, were it not for the fact that he has caused me to pause for thought about whether we need to make similar adjustments elsewhere to achieve consistency. For that reason, I hope that he will allow me time to consider the matter further. With the assurance that the Government will table a similar and perhaps more comprehensive amendment on Report, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am satisfied with the Minister's thought processes on amendment No. 6 and it has been useful to tease them out. On amendment No. 66, I am overwhelmed by his generosity. It is useful-and a good signal for further deliberations on the Bill-that we seem to have secured a minor improvement at an early stage. I do not want to dwell on the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 58, line 32, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or may suspend him from his office for a period not exceeding six consecutive months'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a modest amendment that would introduce a little more flexibility into the Secretary of State's dealings with members of the Learning and Skills Council in some circumstances. Paragraph 3 relates to the removal of members from the council. It says that if the Secretary of State is satisfied that a member has been absent for more than six months or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is unable or unfit to carry out the functions of a member<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he may remove him from office. We make no bones about giving that power to the Secretary of State. Clearly, it is necessary for such a power to exist in those circumstances to ensure that members are doing their jobs properly.

<P>
With the amendment, we are asking whether it might not be wise for the Secretary of State to have a power to deal with a member in a way that is short of the drastic step of removal. The amendment would give the Secretary of State the power to suspend a member of the council. It might be that such a power was used only rarely, but it might be valuable in some circumstances.

<P>
I will give one example of a case in which such a power might be appropriate. Charges or allegations may be made in respect of a member of the council who strenuously denies them. While such charges are outstanding, it might be inappropriate for that member to continue exercising full membership of the council. However, it might be unfair permanently to remove him from the council when he denies the charges.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a compelling argument. Does he also agree that the Secretary of State would be put in the invidious position of deciding between-if I may use shorthand-using the nuclear deterrent of discharging a member from the council and allowing the situation to continue when he has serious reservations about it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an apt point. Moreover, there is the question of how the situation appears to the council member who has been removed yet denies the charges. It might be prejudicial to that member, for other purposes, to have been removed while the charges were pending. Clearly, however, it would be inappropriate for that person to continue to be a member of the council on a long-term basis in such a situation. That is why the amendment provides the power to suspend for six months, although the period is only a suggestion. The purpose of the amendment is to give the Secretary of State a little more flexibility to deal with certain circumstances, which would hopefully be rare, but which might arise. We do not know what the Government would lose by including such a power in the Bill. It could prove to be a useful addition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As we have heard, the amendment would provide the Secretary of State with the power to suspend a council member for up to six months in certain circumstances. The amendment's objective was said to be to give the Secretary of State a sanction short of removal to be used as an alternative when removal of the member was not clearly justified.

<P>
I must make it clear that we expect that the Secretary of State would exercise the power of removal fairly and reasonably, in rare circumstances when it was clearly justified, and then only on the advice of the chair of the Learning and Skills Council. The Secretary of State would exercise his power to remove members only if the circumstances justified that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister says that the power of removal would be exercised only with the chair's approval. What would happen if the chair were the person under criticism, and therefore unable to give an opinion? If he or she gave an opinion, it might well be contrary to removal, because that might act against his or her interests and admit guilt.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Obviously, in that circumstance, we would wish to have a procedure for the whole council or a majority of it to make proper representations to the Secretary of State. In the appropriate guidance, I will ensure that we allow for such an eventuality.

<P>
The Secretary of State would dismiss a member only in the most extraordinary circumstances, but we know that such circumstances can occur in our extraordinary world. My Department has obviously given some thought to the amendment. In the helpful example given of someone who faced charges, it might be appropriate-depending on the charges-for the member to seek advice from the chairman of the council. If the charges were serious, the member and the chair might agree that the person should not attend meetings until the case had been dealt with in court. We do not suggest, however, that the Secretary of State should ride in over the council and dismiss a person whose innocence in law we would always presume. Similarly, for example, if a council member became mentally ill for hopefully only a temporary period, we would hope for such a circumstance to be dealt with sensibly and fairly within the Learning and Skills Council, which would have a code of conduct to cope with such questions. We have carefully considered the amendment, but we are not convinced that we require it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Does not the Minister's example of someone who is suffering from a mental illness undermine the approach that he is advocating? Such a person might be unwilling to co-operate or to seek the chairman's advice. Sadly, some people do not accept that they are suffering from a mental illness.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I deliberately raised that example because it is something that we need to test and because I wanted to scrutinise my own Bill. One could reasonably imagine that the Learning and Skills Council would be able to deal with the majority of cases.

<P>
<H5>11 am<w7></H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I have been listening carefully to the debate. Would not a stronger response be needed where someone was accused of something? The public would expect the relationship between the council and individuals accused, for example, of a sexual offence involving young people to be formally broken while the courts were proceeding and that individuals would be reinstated only afterwards. That element is missing from the current framework. Simply to say that the problem can be sorted out locally will not be enough to satisfy the public in such unfortunate circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> What I heard myself saying was that much will depend on the seriousness of the offence. I do not want to give too many examples, but some minor offences are also serious. Speeding and other offences can be extraordinarily dangerous, but it is not unreasonable to say that a code can cover such eventualities. If members are accused of serious offences of the kind mentioned by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), it would be appropriate for them to take no part in the council's proceedings until the court makes a judgment about guilt or innocence. We should not make heavy weather of that, because the Government's intentions are clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On that point, the Minister should reflect on the circumstances of members of the council who might absolutely rebut allegations of, for example, a sexual offence. They might feel that any action that they take on their own initiative to suspend themselves from the council's activities would be presumed to be an admission of guilt. If such action is standard procedure, however, it would be neither here nor there and would lead to no presumption either way. However, making the individual suggest that there must be something in the allegations because he has stood out of the proceedings is invidious to his human rights.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Again, we need to cover that in the code of conduct. We must allow for all eventualities. We should be clear that a member of a council who faced serious allegations, which would attract local attention, would have to stand down for the necessary period. We would need to take the advice of the whole council and of the chairman on that. If someone were stubborn and, therefore, disruptive, that might constitute the kind of extraordinary case in which he or she could be dismissed by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister referred to a code. Does he envisage that the role of the chairman as an intermediary and interlocutor between the member and the Secretary of State will be built into the code, or should such a provision be in the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We want to resist putting too much detail in the Bill. As we sometimes learn in the House, the good intentions behind details sometimes lead to difficulties several years later. However, we need a strong code, and the matter that the right hon. Gentleman raised would be covered in it.

<P>
I am sure that hon. Members would not want the Secretary of State to intervene regularly and in marginally justifiable cases, but that might be the consequence of the wider range of lesser sanctions proposed in the amendment. It is doubtful whether the LSC chairman would seek or welcome such intervention, especially as a member on suspension could not, by definition, contribute to the effective steering of the council. The sanctions would damage, rather than assist, the local learning and skills council.

<P>
The manner in which the LSC chairman and members are expected to carry out their functions and to manage the council's business will, as I said, be governed by a code of conduct. The code will be drawn up in line with the recommendations of the first report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which requires that all non-departmental public bodies have such code, and will form part of the members' terms and conditions. However, we shall reflect on the useful teasing out of the circumstances that may arise in real life.

<P>
For the reasons that I have given, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will ask leave to withdraw this probing amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the tone of his latter remarks; I was surprised by his initial response to the amendment, which was tabled helpfully and with a view to catering for all circumstances, even rare ones, which is part of our responsibility in scrutinising the Bill.

<P>
I am far from convinced by the Minister's reasons for not including the power in the Bill. In view of our earlier remarks about the Secretary of State's position, we do not think that he will rush to invoke that power, but there may be circumstances in which it would be useful for him to have it. The Minister's argument that it would put too much detail in the Bill to include such a power is not convincing. The power to suspend commonly appears in provisions and it is useful to have such a power, which falls short of the drastic step of removing someone. In the debate, we teased out circumstances in which a member of the council may not be prepared either to seek or act on the chairman's advice and may not be willing to comply with the code of conduct.

<P>
In order to put down a marker and to aid the Minister's reflection on the inclusion of this useful provision, I am inclined-

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the light of the Minister's emphasis on fairness and reasonableness, does my hon. Friend recall that the definition of an act of God in Black's law dictionary is an act which no reasonable man would expect God to commit?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a valuable point. One cannot always rely on people to act reasonably in these circumstances. Thus, against my initial expectations and because the matter is important, I shall press the amendment to a Division.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 67, in page 58, line 37, leave out sub-paragraph (2).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 8, in page 59, line 7, leave out sub-paragraph (3).

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was somewhat disturbed by the exchanges in the previous round because what began as a probing amendment turned into an issue of substance. These are probing amendments and I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us on them. The first is in relation to members of the Council and, presumably, this will include the chairman and chief executive respectively in relation to their remuneration, which seems to be secured by this paragraph rather than elsewhere in the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 67 seeks to probe what the Minister is trying to do in paragraph 4(3) of this schedule, asking what it may mean in relation to the council paying or making
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provision for the payment of such sums by way of pension, allowances and gratuities to or in respect of him as the Secretary of State may determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That follows on from paragraph 4(1) that is to do with the pay itself. Paragraph 4(3) is to do with the fringe benefits. There is a reference to making ``provision'' there. What I am not clear about is whether this is designed to embrace circumstances where the member does not receive pay and there would be no national insurance or pay-as-you-earn on that pay, but in some way the pay or the benefit is transferred to a third party. I am aware of at least one case-and I have no objection to it-where a distinguished person in the field of education, with much experience in the area we are discussing, acts on a Government body under statute and the arrangement appears to be that the Government body pays to the institution of whom he is chief executive a fee for his services. I am not clear whether that is the kind of situation that is envisaged by the suggestion that there should be ``provision for'' payments rather than that payments should be made. It may be that that is the case. If it is the case, it is important for public accountability that the Minister explains to the Committee what happens in relation to the tax and the national insurance liabilities, or the liabilities to corporation tax or otherwise of the institutions involved. This is not because I am seeking to suggest that there is anything improper either going on in a particular case or necessarily likely to happen, but because the Committee does need to satisfy itself that everything is fair and above board, particularly in relation to any remuneration or benefits in kind paid to persons on the council who are leading the sector in future.

<P>
Amendment No. 8 relates to staff. The circumstances here are slightly different. Paragraph 5(3), which my second amendment seeks to delete, carries the suggestion that the council's right to appoint staff and pay appropriate remuneration requires the Secretary of State's approval. We all know that the Secretary of State's approval is something of a term of art. On the face of it, the provision might suggest that every contract of employment, for example for a cleaner at the Learning and Skills Council headquarters in Coventry, would have to appear on the Secretary of State's desk and be ticked off. That cannot literally be the case. I hope it is not. It may well be that all this provision seeks is for the Secretary of State to be ultimately responsible for the pay and employment policies of the council. There may be overriding public expenditure concerns-in relation to future pay policies, for example-about which the Government have so far told us nothing, but for which they now feel it convenient to make provision, so that if they felt that the council was going over the top, the Secretary of State could intervene and say, ``I'm sorry. I wish to impose conditions.''

<P>
Having said that, as has already been expressed by Opposition Members, the Secretary of State has considerable powers in relation to the council. If, as the sub-paragraph suggests, the powers run to interfering-micro-management is the phrase that I have used at least once already-in every jot and title of employment and arrangements for contracts for people who work in any capacity for the council, it may not be a good idea. The Minister must tell us how he sees the provisions operating.

<P>
To summarise, one of the amendments is designed to ensure that the pay, allowances and other benefits available to members of the council, who have a high profile job which is within the remit of the Secretary of State, are fair and above board. Secondly, in relation to staff, while we need the assurance of proper accounting by the council, we need to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot dig the whole thing up by the roots every 10 minutes in pursuit of a policy that allows his tentacles to go into the straightforward relationship between employers and employees at a level where he has no business to interfere.

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Amendment No. 67 would prevent the LSC from making a payment of salaries, fees or allowances due to a member to another person. This is a new provision and differs from the corresponding provisions applying to the Further Education Funding Council. I can understand, therefore, that it might be helpful to the Committee if I were to explain why we think it right for the LSC to be able, if it chooses, to authorise payments to ``another person''.

<P>
We have previously stated that the national council will consist of members who have the necessary skills and experience in order to best serve the LSC. We have said that we want people on the LSC who understand the needs of disadvantaged groups and people who are traditionally under-represented in learning and who have experience of delivering learning in the voluntary sector. This will undoubtedly result in representation, for example, from charitable and voluntary organisations. The commitment of the members of the LSC will mean that they will have to spend significant time away from their offices on LSC business.

<P>
Some of those organisations may be bodies that will have no choice but to make alternative arrangements to cover for the members' absence and thereby incur considerable additional costs. It is, therefore, only fair that in such circumstances those bodies are compensated for their costs. Schedule 1, paragraph 4(2) makes provision for any fee that would normally be payable to the member to be paid directly to such voluntary and charitable organisations to contribute towards the costs incurred by them during the members' absence for LSC business. Under current arrangements, the FEFC can only make payments direct to the individual member concerned, and that has led to practical problems for the individual in reconciling the FEFC arrangements with those made with his or her employing institution.

<P>
That is the sole intention behind the provision. Without it, we may be unable to attract people with relevant experience from the voluntary sector. Any payments made under the provision will be made by agreement between the LSC, the LSC member and the other organisation. I give a commitment that all payments and any such arrangements will be made openly and will be declared in the annual accounts of the LSC. In order to prevent abuse, the details will be clearly stated in, among other documents, the terms of appointment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is helping the Committee. Will he give two specific assurances? First, somebody might be appointed to the LSC or the local learning and skills councils and be in receipt of allowances paid to a third party-for example, an NGO or a charitable organisation-on account of his services. Will the Minister confirm that, while such people are discharging their duties in respect of the council, they are fully responsible as members of the council, notwithstanding the fact that their payments are being made to another body and that probably they are still in receipt of a salary or honorarium from that body? In other words, their loyalties are to the council and not to the body.

<P>
Secondly, it is important that any of those arrangements, even if transparent, should not be conceived as a means of avoiding tax burdens that would otherwise arise from a direct payment of remuneration. Will the Minister give that assurance to the Committee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> On the first point, I fully understand that the loyalty of the member will be to the LSC. This is simply an arrangement, but a significant arrangement, that will enable bodies such as those in the voluntary and charitable sector not to lose out financially and be impaired in their work by those arrangements. I give that absolute assurance.

<P>
On the issue of tax and national insurance, with your approval, Mr. Benton, I will write to the hon. Gentleman because it is a complex matter and I need, as always, to get it absolutely right.

<P>
I now turn to amendment No. 8 LSC staff will be public servants working for a non-departmental public body. The Bill provides that the terms and conditions of the LSC's staff are for the LSC to determine but that the Secretary of State must approve such a determination. Amendment No. 8 would remove the Secretary of State from the picture.

<P>
Exactly the same amendment was proposed and debated in another place. I had hoped that my noble friend the Minister had on that occasion, by fully explaining the matter, been able to reassure the Opposition. Let me have another go now. The provision in the Bill replicates the provisions that were routinely applied by the previous Administration. That is well established for other NDPBs and replicates provisions made in respect of the FEFC's terms and conditions by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The LSC will be responsible for spending some 6 billion of public money and employing between 4,000 and 5,000 staff. It must be right and proper for the Secretary of State to have the authority to approve the employment policy, including pay policy, of such an important public sector body.

<P>
Let me emphasise that the Secretary of State will not be involved in approving the terms and conditions of individual staff. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no wish to become a pay clerk to the LSC. Rather, the role of the Secretary of State is to ensure that the terms and conditions applied across the LSC as a whole are appropriate to public sector policies-for instance, in line with other NDPBs. That is how the provision is used in current legislation governing the current funding councils, and it is how we intend the provision to be used in the future. It is to make sure that public money is properly spent on learning and skills. That seems only right when it is the taxpayer who will have to foot the bill. Given those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Further consideration adjourned.-[Mr. Betts.]
