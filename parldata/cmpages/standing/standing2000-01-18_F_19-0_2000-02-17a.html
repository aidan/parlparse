<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 239, in page 37, leave out line 22.
<P>
No. 240, in page 37, leave out line 23.
<P>
No. 248, in clause 40, page 44, leave out lines 40 to 42.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I welcome you back to our proceedings, Sir David. We are trying to make them as exciting as possible.
<P>
At the end of our previous sitting, I said that we should consider the reasons why a scheme would be wound up. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) used the term ``whistle blower'', and I thought about that after I had left the Room. I would like to put that phrase to bed immediately. It describes someone who blows the whistle on a problem in an existing scheme, so it cannot apply to schemes that are being wound up. We do not want to curtail any activities, but I assume that whistle blowing generally applies to an on-going scheme in which no problem such as insolvency has arisen, unlike a scheme that requires winding up for reasons such as those that are set out in the explanatory notes. That is why I will not deal with her point about whistle blowing.
<P>
When an employer is insolvent, it is important that a trustee is in place to ensure that decisions are taken about the scheme's future, especially as insolvency can trigger the winding up of a pension scheme. There is now no requirement for the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority to be notified when an employer becomes insolvent and there is no trustee. Schemes can be left in limbo, so the clause introduces a requirement for Opra to be informed, in some circumstances, when an employer sponsoring an occupational pension scheme becomes insolvent. That will help to ensure that, following the insolvency of an employer, trustees are in place to protect members' interests and prompt decisions are made about the scheme's future.
<P>
Trustees, or those defined as persons involved in the administration of the scheme, must now notify Opra when a scheme that should have an independent trustee has none, or when an insolvent employer that was the sole trustee is no longer able to fulfil that role. If it appears that Opra is already aware that there are no trustees or that the insolvency practitioner is due to appoint a trustee within specified time limits or at times specified in the regulations, that requirement will not apply. Opra can inquire about the position and arrange for a trustee to be put in place.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 238, 239 and 240 would include employers, trustees and scheme actuaries and auditors as persons involved in the administration of the scheme for the purposes of the obligations in the clause. We want Opra to be told quickly when an employer is insolvent and either there is no independent trustee or the insolvent employer is the sole trustee. The obligation should fall on those who are likely to become aware of the employer's insolvency fairly soon.
<P>
We do not want to identify those who are involved in the administration of the scheme generally. We want to limit the requirement to notify Opra to those persons involved in the administration who are best placed to do so promptly. Trustees are not included because, when there are trustees, the requirement to notify Opra, if an independent trustee has not been appointed, already falls on them. Including them in the definition of those involved in the administration of the scheme would place the obligation on them twice, which would be out of order.
<P>
An employer whose insolvency triggers the requirement for an independent trustee is unlikely to continue to be involved in the administration of the scheme following his insolvency. He may not be aware whether an independent trustee has been appointed. In practice, it is therefore more sensible to place the notification requirement on those administering the scheme, who would still be in place after the employer's insolvency. When the employer is the sole trustee of the scheme and no independent trustee is required, it makes no sense for him to have to report on himself.
<P>
Not everyone who is involved in the administration of the scheme would have sufficient regular involvement to be aware of the employers' insolvency shortly after it happens. For example, auditors and actuaries may not become aware of the employer's insolvency for some months. I was not sure whether I should say that, because I thought that auditors were supposed to be the bedrock of society. However, I live in the real world and when the Financial Times reports on something that has happened, the response often is, ``What were the auditors doing?'' [Interruption.] They usually have a valid professional explanation that gets them off the hook. Nevertheless, they may not be aware of what is happening in, say, small firms.
<P>
We are introducing a new requirement and if, in the light of experience, it seems that the requirement to notify Opra should fall on others or that there are others involved in the administration of the scheme who should not be required to notify Opra, the regulations will allow us to make the changes. In other words, the matter will be under constant review. We are trying to speed up the winding-up process. That it could take 20 years is ridiculous. To avoid confusion, an almost identical definition of persons involved in the administration of the scheme is included in proposed new subsection 72B to which clause 40 refers. The new subsection will allow Opra to direct that specific information should be provided or action taken during winding up.
<P>
Amendment No. 248 would make the same changes to that definition of persons involved with the administration of the scheme as amendments Nos. 238 to 240. Regulations will enable directions by Opra to apply to others who may be excluded from the definition of a person involved in the administration of the scheme. I regret that I have had to stick to my prepared notes, as I have had cause to do in respect of one or two clauses recently. Given that people who are involved in such matters read the report of our proceedings, this is not a subject on which I can extemporise. I hope that the hon. Lady now accepts that we have fully met her concerns.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I, too, welcome you, to our proceedings, Sir David. If we can keep you awake, we will have achieved something.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. The matter is complex and I now have a much greater appreciation of the reasons why the clause is so drafted. When the right hon. Gentleman was describing the role of an auditor, he may have been aware of a snort from my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). My hon. Friend then muttered to me that he thought that the purpose of the auditors was to revisit the battlefield after the antagonists had left. There was an air of sympathy in the Room for that point. However, we must not malign auditors, as they do a good job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): If my hon. Friend is going to quote me, she should do so in full. I said that the role of auditors was to revisit the battlefield after the battle was over to bury the survivors systematically.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am good at précising and editing on my feet. We all appreciate that auditors have an important role and are highly professional people. I shall not continue on that subject.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation, and for suggesting that the Department intends to keep a close eye on how effectively the new provisions work. We will do the same, and I am sure that we shall be alerted quickly if changes are needed, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 276, page 38, line 8, at end insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In section 178(b) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (regulations providing for who is to be treated as a trustee of a scheme), at the end there shall be inserted ``or sections 22 to 26C of the Pensions Act 1995''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 287, 289 and 291.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> These are technical amendments to deal with an error in an earlier amendment to section 178 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. The earlier amendment led to the erroneous inclusion of sections 22 to 26 of the Pensions Act 1995, which deal with the independent trustee provisions, in the provisions about who should be treated as the manager of an occupational pension scheme. The correct place should have been in the provisions about who is to be treated as a trustee of the scheme.
<P>
Amendment No. 276 corrects the error and the other amendments are consequential. It also ensures that new sections 26A to 26C, inserted by the clause, are included in the provisions that allow regulations to specify who is to be treated as a trustee of a scheme.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 37, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>Modification of scheme to secure winding-up</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 39, line 27, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) The exercise of this power shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court on application of any interested party.'.
<P>
The clause allows an occupational pension scheme to be modified by order of Opra, but does not allow for any appeal mechanism or other process to change the authority's decision. I want to tease out from the Government the thinking behind that, as it is unusual not to have an appeal mechanism, given the many parties involved in the winding up of pension schemes. I sympathise with what the Government are trying to do, and I understand that it can take a long time for winding up to take place.
<P>
At the same time, there must be fair and due process of law. In the United Kingdom, we like to think that our legal system is fair and that everyone has some recourse to appeal mechanisms. I do not necessarily- suggest that the courts are the only mechanism; we are giving the Government some options about instituting an appeal process.
<P>
Involved in any pension scheme are pensioners, employees who expect to become pensioners, members of the scheme, employers, fund managers, actuaries, accountants and lawyers. Many people and organisations will have an interest in that pension scheme. If it is the small sort of pension scheme to which the Minister of State alluded in our previous discussion, or where no employer is involved, an exception might be made because relatively few people are involved. However, it seems bizarre for the authority to have such a draconian power that could be to the detriment of members of the pension scheme.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We will come later to the role of the ombudsman and to people's right to complain to him. In the absence of an appeal mechanism, I can envisage the disgruntled taking Opra to the ombudsman and clogging up a system that has delays built into it. Why is there no appeal mechanism? I accept that there are vexatious litigants, but there are mechanisms to deal with such people. It seems unfair that there should be no appeal procedure for people who could be affected by the winding up of a pension scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall not speak for long on the amendment, which gives us an opportunity to examine our treatment of the beneficiaries of pension schemes.
<P>
Several references to the Robert Maxwell scandal were made this morning. For reasons that I suppose are obvious, given its location, I have many Maxwell pensioners in my patch—including one or two of the key activists. I have seen them on several occasions. Such people spend their entire working life saving up and getting everything sorted out, with the assumption that things will be okay when they retire, When they reach retirement, however, it is striking how relatively powerless they feel. Only a couple of weeks ago I had in my surgery a chap who is the beneficiary of the pension scheme of a large pharmaceutical company. Because it is a multinational company, he compared and contrasted his rights, as a British beneficiary, to those of a beneficiary in Germany and France, in terms not only of the ability to appeal and so on, but of his lack of feeling of involvement with his former employers, to whom he had devoted 30 years of his life. He felt cut off from them.
<P>
The amendment would allow an interested party to go to court—as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said, that can go wider than the beneficiaries of the pension scheme offer, an opportunity to challenge the order and provide further protection if any person or body were likely to be disadvantaged. Who is likely to be disadvantaged? The mechanisms could have considerable effect on the amount that various classes of scheme members—deferred or current pensioners—eventually receive. The Minister may, as he has done on several occasions, completely satisfy us on the matter, but this seemed a good place to insert such safeguards.
<P>
The Hansard of this morning's debate will show that we discussed trustees and the like. Openness exists only on paper; in practice, the average beneficiary of a pension scheme feels pretty powerless. There is nothing much that he can do in relation to the election of trustees, for example. He has no idea who the trustees are or whether they are worthy. The right is given by Parliament, and we do not find ways for Joe Public to make a difference. The amendment is designed to make a difference, and, just as important, to elicit a response from the Government about people who feel that they have been materially disadvantaged as a result of a particular decision about a modified order to a scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I would be distressed if I felt that I could not satisfy the Opposition on this matter. Their suggestion is entirely reasonable; indeed, I would expect my hon. Friends to say, ``Hang about.'' However, I can satisfy hon. Members—all of them—by saying that the matter is already covered in law. Section 96 of the Pensions Act 1995 makes comprehensive provision for the review and revision of Opra's determinations and orders, and for reference on legal questions to be made to the High Court, or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. Opra's powers can be challenged in the courts.
<P>
The clause is part of a package of measures designed to enable Opra to modify scheme rules in order to allow the winding up of a scheme to be completed properly, but only when the employer is insolvent. Opra will be able to make only the minimum changes necessary to allow the scheme to be wound up, so a restriction has been provided.
<P>
When a scheme is set up, detailed attention is not always paid to the rules that govern its winding up, and winding up can be delayed by problems caused by scheme rules. In the absence of an employer to agree to changes to scheme rules, it may be difficult for trustees to make even the straightforward changes necessary to wind up a scheme. Trustees may ask the court to modify scheme rules to allow winding up to continue, thereby causing further delays and unnecessarily taking up more of m'learned friends' valuable time.
<P>
The clause will provide trustees with a low-cost way to amend scheme rules if, and only if, amendment is needed to complete winding up. It is intended that interested parties will be told about an application to Opra for a modification of scheme rules and the reasons for that application. Regulations will ensure that the scheme's trustees tell members about such an application, and time will be available for representations to be made to Opra before the application is decided.
<P>
Amendment No. 241 is unnecessary. Provision for the courts to challenge, review and revise Opra's determinations already exists. The arrangements provide an appropriate means of redress for interested parties who believe that an order made by Opra to modify pension scheme rules was made in ignorance of a material fact, is based on error, or is erroneous in law, or that a relevant change in circumstances has taken place since the order or determination was made. In such circumstances, under existing law, Opra would be called to account if it did not consider those factors.
<P>
The amendment is therefore unnecessary. I freely admit that the provision is crucial, but it already exists in the 1995 Act. I hope that my response has satisfied Opposition Members. If need be, I could give more details about the procedure that the 1995 Act requires Opra to follow and how Opra could be called to account.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I accept that the 1995 Act already makes provision for appeal to the courts. We are reassured by his comments. I could not imagine that a Labour Government would not allow appeals to the courts, despite the aspersions that were cast on my learned friends. In general, the Committee has been quiet during our discussion of pensions, but I am sure that it would not have remained as quiet if the appeal provision had not been in place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 242, in page 39, line 46, leave out subsection (9).
<P>
I assure those civil servants who are listening to our discussion and those who read Hansard that I have no intention of attacking their pension scheme. I was a recipient of that pension scheme until I moved to the parliamentary pension scheme—I, too, have an interest in the public pension scheme. When I worked in the civil service, there was very high inflation under the Labour Government, of about 25 per cent.—
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury):</B> Twenty-seven per cent.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I stand corrected—it was 27 per cent. I was giving a broad-brush figure.
<P>
I was asked how I could justify the civil service index-linked rules. I discovered—I hope that this is no longer true, although it was the case in the 1970s—that the reason that the civil service could afford the scheme was that civil servants are so devoted to their jobs that about 50 per cent. of them had died within two years of retiring. That is the most appalling statistic and I sincerely hope that the situation has improved. That was the justification that was used to explain how the Great British public could afford to index link the public pension scheme.
<P>
I was reminded of that fact by an article that recently appeared in Money Mail. For those who have not read that journal, I am afraid that I have sad news for civil servants—there is a plan to close the pension fund and to put civil servants in the same position as the many people who are in a closed pension fund. The plan is to introduce a money purchase scheme. The public sector pension fund will be similar to other occupational pension funds, and it will suffer all the problems that are associated with those funds, including difficulties in winding up or with trustees. I hope that the civil service will not experience difficulties in securing taxpayers' money to pay pensioners. One could argue that the public sector pension fund should be brought under the Bill's provisions because it will be similar to an occupational pension fund and will experience similar problems. That might suggest a way to solve some of the problems that the police and the fire brigade have with their pension funds.
<P>
Does the Minister believe that there are stronger similarities between the civil service pension fund and a private sector occupational pension fund than in the past? If so, should it be governed by similar rules to occupational pensions?
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady tempts me to have a debate about the differences between public and private sector schemes. I did not know that she was a former member of the civil service pension scheme. I know that she has had two spells as a Member of Parliament, but I have forgotten when she entered the House—
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> 1992.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> She would therefore have been present, and would clearly have voted for what is now section 72 of the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I was on the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady probably spoke to it. Under that section, public service pension schemes can be modified by a Minister or the relevant Government Department. The powers given to Opra in the narrow area of winding up as a result of insolvency are therefore already in existence, because they are exercised by a Minister of the Crown or a Government Department. Public service pension schemes are set up by statute, and their framework is totally different from that of private sector schemes. I accept the point about the fire service pension scheme: one of the people running the scheme in the west midlands, which is a huge area, said that there was a danger of becoming a pension scheme that occasionally fights fires instead of a fire department that runs a pension scheme. All hon. Members are aware of the problems of the fire service pension scheme, which are the same as those of the police pension scheme. Although I feel accountable as a Member of Parliament and a Minister, my Department does not run those schemes. There is no plan to wind either of them up as a result of insolvency.
<P>
I am neither a lawyer nor a parliamentary draftsman, but given that the relevant powers are already available to a Minister of the Crown or Government Department, I am not sure why the Bill should say, ``Opra cannot do that''. Opra clearly cannot do that, because someone else does it. However, it is necessary for the drafting to be specific on what Opra can and cannot do. That is the reason for subsection (9).
<P>
That explanation may be inadequate, as I have nothing more to add, but I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am minded to withdraw the amendment, and I do not want to embarrass the Minister—
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Oh.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> No, it is unfair to embarrass the Minister. However, the new pension fund, as it is described in Money Mail, does not strike me as one that is unfunded—in fact, it would be funded by the civil service and the staff. It is therefore clearly beginning to parallel the private sector. I do not want to pursue this point at length. However, if that is the direction being taken, surely some thought should be given to whether the regulation of the pension fund would be more appropriately done by Opra and the ombudsmen than by a Minister, who will undoubtedly act with the greatest propriety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> There are some 400 public sector pension funds, which is a huge number. I have not seen a list, although all hon. Members could probably rattle off about half a dozen of them. I was not certain what the hon. Lady was quoting. Was it the Daily Mail?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Yes, Money Mail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I thought that the hon. Lady was quoting from one of the enormous number of professional magazines that deal with pension specialists. I am not decrying the Daily Mail, but a former leader of my party once described it as the forgers' gazette and, to a certain extent, he was right. I shall not knock Money Mail, which is very useful. To be honest, I cannot answer the point that she made about the change, but I shall look into the matter. Clearly, the fund will remain in the public sector, so the Department and Ministers would be able to make the necessary changes were it to be wound up.
<P>
We are talking about winding up pension funds, so that they do not hang around for many years because of constant delays and a blockage in respect of powers. The hon. Lady has raised a nice hare but I am not going to run with it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 243, in page 40, line 30, leave out `Subject to subsection (4),'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 244, in page 40, line 36, leave out subsection (4) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Any report made under this subsection will be available to any member of the scheme on request.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 245, in page 40, line 41, leave out subsection (5) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Any copies of the report requested under subsection (4) above shall be provided free of charge within seven days of receiving the request.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 246, in page 40, line 44, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
No. 247, in page 41, line 13, leave out paragraph (c).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The key amendment is No. 244, on which amendment No. 243 is consequential. The clause deals with yearly reports on the progress of windings up, and will allow Opra to postpone sending reports. It will grant a period of six months either side for the postponing of a report, which is far too great a time lag, given that the Government are putting in place measures to speed up the winding-up process. Taken literally, there could be only a six-month gap between reports, or an 18-month gap. The amendment would tighten up the amount of time that the authority could allow trustees or managers to postpone making a report.
<P>
Amendment No. 244 would require that a copy of such a report be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>available to any member of the scheme on request.
<P>
</UL></FONT>As we have said, a wide variety of people are interested in these schemes. Should questions arise about a particular scheme, the fact that a report appears not to be readily available to those with a legitimate interest in it could contribute to the difficulties that those trying to wind it up might experience. It is reasonable for those with a legitimate interest to be able to obtain copies of the report.
<P>
Amendment No. 245 would alter the requirement that copies of a report be sent only if requested, by requiring that they are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provided free of charge within seven days of receiving the request.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would ensure that reports were more readily available to those with a legitimate interest and delivered to a much tighter time scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I support the principle behind the amendments, but I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions.
<P>
The explanatory notes say that the clause is designed to give Opra a more active role in managing and accelerating the winding-up process, but that does not seem to be translated into the clause, which puts in place, through the subsections, a series of devices to allow delay. I assume that, as Opra is capable of more detailed monitoring than in the past, that will ensure that delays do not take place. This is another case where it would have been helpful if the clause had been introduced and the Minister had then explained the thinking.
<P>
Why was it felt necessary to make so many provisions? Indeed, subsection (8), which contains regulation-making powers, can amend the primary legislation further and change the reference to 12 months in subsection (5) to something else. The clause seems to contain a great deal of flexibility. As the hon. Member for Beckenham said, the parameters are set quite wide. That is why we support the aim to tighten up the provision. I should be interested to hear why the Government feel—if they do—that they cannot do so. The Bill, taken as a whole, may provide for that, but members of a scheme should have the right to obtain the reports, not least to satisfy themselves that the winding-up procedures are being followed. The amendments that deal with that seem to be helpful.
<P>
When the Minister responds to this group of amendments, will he say why it is necessary to have three subsections that, in varying degrees, allow for delay, when the explanatory notes say that the purpose of the clause is the exact opposite of that—that Opra should be more proactive in accelerating the winding-up process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): The reporting requirements are clearly laid out and are therefore wholly predictable. I cannot see any reason why a delay should be granted. There would be only two reasons for delay—first, that the administration is not competent to deliver the report and, secondly, that the information required to complete the report is absent. In either case early reporting of those two facts is essential, instead of allowing them to be delayed. The amendments stand on that fundamental principle.
<P>
The provision to make the information more generally available is consistent with the need for greater transparency in these matters, given our lamentable history in this respect, with various celebrated cases over the past 20 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We should take it for granted that every time a speech refers to any other case, Hansard can automatically insert ``Maxwell'' without hon. Members having to mention it. That would be useful.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It would save time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It would save time, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary says.
<P>
On the face of it there is a contradiction, as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said. On the one hand this group of clauses is aimed at speeding up the winding up. On the other hand, schemes can take from one year to, as happened in one case, 20 years to be wound up. There are an enormous number of schemes in the country, and I suppose that no two are alike in every particular.
<P>
Flexibility is necessary, although the clause contains limits. It defines the start date because there have been disputes about when winding up started and lawyers have had to argue about that. Therefore, we have introduced a tighter definition. A first report will be required when a scheme has been winding up for three years or more. Many schemes are in the process of winding up as the Bill approaches the statute book, and we want Opra to concentrate on the oldest cases first. The requirement to provide reports will have to be phased in—it is not possible to introduce it in one go because of the number in the pipeline. That will be done by means of regulations, and the first reports will be required from 2002.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Schemes that started to wind up before January 1990 will have to provide their first report from April 2002; those that started to wind up before January 1993 will provide their first report from April 2003; those that started to wind up before January 1996 will produce their first report from 2004; those that started to wind up before January 1999 will produce their first report from 2005; and those that start to wind up before January 2003 will produce their first report from April 2006. The three-year period will not be triggered until 2006 for schemes that start to wind up from 2003. A catching up process is necessary.
<P>
Regulations will set out the information to be contained in the reports, which will include action already taken and a plan of future action. The purpose of the requirement is not to provide an essay on what has happened in the past, but to ensure that there is action in the future.
<P>
The provision includes a definition of when winding up starts and a requirement for a record to be kept of the decision to wind up. There have been problems with that in the past and the provision should prevent confusion about when winding up starts and, therefore, when reports are due. When the three-year period has triggered the first report, subsequent reports will be required every 12 months. That was the thrust of the questions from the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). The clause then allows the 12-month period to be varied.
<P>
Opra should be able to extend the period if it is important to do so and if a delay would enable Opra to receive more up-to-date information and more comprehensive details—for example, when the outcome of a course of action by the trustees would be known shortly after the next report is due. The regulations made under the clause will allow the period for follow-up reports to be varied if a period of 12 months is inappropriate.
<P>
I shall not nit-pick each amendment, but their overall effect would be to remove any flexibility on the timing of the follow-up reports. Trustees would be required to provide reports at 12-month intervals, regardless of the circumstances of the scheme. No two schemes are alike and the amendments would remove from Opra the flexibility to examine individual cases and to extend the period when it is reasonable to do so. Someone must pay for preparation of reports with time and financial resources, and inflexibility would add to the expense. Amendment No. 247 would remove the flexibility to change the 12-month reporting period and to extend it by regulation. It is important to maintain that.
<P>
The package will eventually lead to faster winding up of schemes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We share the objective of faster winding up. I shall be honest and admit that I have not read up on the subject as much as I should have, so I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I missed the figure. Have the Government expressed any aspiration in respect of the degree to which they expect the measures to speed up the winding up process?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I cannot be precise about that, given the huge number of schemes in the system. In one extreme case, the figure is 20 years. Phasing in the measure over the period that I have stated will involve a big acceleration of the process in order to get the reports in. As matters stand, schemes could have been winding up for a dozen years with no reports having been made. That will not happen in future. After three years of an agreed, verifiable decision on insolvency and winding up, the report must be available.
<P>
Amendment No. 247 would remove the flexibility with regard to the 12-month reporting period. In future, the period of three years before the first report is made may prove to be too long. Three years is an opening gambit that is considered reasonable, given the circumstances of all known schemes. In future, when three years has been established as the norm, it may be thought desirable, in the light of experience, to reduce the period. We shall need the power and authority of the clause if we wish to do that. If the three-year trigger were to be changed, the follow-up reports would have to be made more frequently.
<P>
Speaking off the top of my head, if, at the time when the three-year period was established, it could be brought down to two years, we might think, ``Hang on, we don't need to wait another 12 months for the next report; we can get it more quickly.'' The idea is to pursue the winding up as quickly as possible in the best interests of the members of the scheme. Amendment No. 247 would remove that flexibility, and should therefore be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 244 and 245 would introduce a requirement for any report that is made to Opra to be made available to members on request. I agree that it is important that that should be the case, but it is not necessary to stipulate it in the Bill. The clause contains regulation-making powers, and I assure members of the Committee that we will use those powers to ensure that scheme members are able to receive copies of the reports that are made to Opra on the winding up of the scheme of which they are a member. We intend to consult on certain elements of the regulations, such as the time scales of the reports, before issuing them. We do not want to make changes to the Bill in advance of that consultation. Furthermore, we want as much flexibility as possible, so that if, as a result of the consultation, we can make changes to speed up the process, we will be able to do so. Accepting the amendment would unnecessarily restrict the actions of Opra and the Government on behalf of scheme members.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> While I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks, they have brought one or two further questions to mind. I understand and appreciate his aims in instituting regular reports and ensuring that information is available to Opra through a simple and orderly process. However, he referred, almost in passing, to the trustees, or whoever conducts the winding up, in such a way as to suggest that, potentially, they could be complete amateurs. I was worried by the implication that the people involved in winding up a pension scheme may not have access to money, so that it would take longer to produce the report than if a professional organisation that could afford to pay, such as the fund manager or auditor, were involved. I might have misinterpreted the Minister on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I did not mean that, and I regret that my remarks may have come across in that way. I meant that it would be undesirable to go to the unnecessary expense of producing a report simply because one was bound to do so by a rigid, 12-month timetable, if information was going to be available a month later that would make the report much more up to date. I was not implying that money was not available for a report; I meant that it would be wasted if a report was produced according to a rigid timetable, rather than waiting for a month or two until Opra could be provided with the best, most up-to-date information. That was the point that I was making in relation to funding.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I find that reassuring and I shall move on to my next question. Having established a pattern of annual reports, if a report were then published earlier or later than the prescribed date, would the subsequent report be published 12 months after that publication, or on the prescribed date according to the annual pattern?
<P>
The Minister gave the impression that one of the main reasons for postponing or bringing forward reports would be to help a scheme to wind up more quickly than if the rigid schedule were adhered to. Would that be among Opra's principal criteria in offering guidance on the speeding-up or delaying of a report at the final winding-up? The Minister promised consultation on this matter, which will be welcomed by the interested bodies, but will he guarantee that there will be plenty of time for that consultation, and that it will not be backed up against the slot in the parliamentary timetable for the regulations to be introduced? We are already suffering from similar problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady's last point is the easiest to answer. I cannot guarantee anything, because that is a matter for the business managers and for the usual channels. However, my Department will do everything possible to ensure that the regulations are available as quickly as possible, commensurate with the timetable for bringing all parts of the Act into force.
<P>
I draw the hon. Lady's attention to proposed new subsection (3) to new section 72A, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Subject to subsection (4), each subsequent report made under this section in the case of a winding-up shall be made no more than twelve months after the date which (apart from any postponement under subsection (4)) was the latest date for the making of the previous report required to be made in the case of that winding-up.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Regulations can be made under this section to allow the period for follow-up reports to be varied in the future, should the period of 12 months prove to be inappropriate. Let us say that, at some point, Opra accepts that there will be a period of 18 months between two reports. Bearing in mind the circumstances of that delay, it may be thought unreasonable to require a further report only six months after the second report. The flexibility to allow Opra to take that view is built into the clause. For the process to be rigid along the lines suggested by the amendment would reduce that flexibility. Opra must be reasonable, because what it does is open to challenge. It is not a free agent: it exists for a purpose and its actions can be questioned. I hope that my explanation has satisfied the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. The amendments were tabled with a view to teasing out the thinking behind such flexibility in the Bill. I am now more reassured and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 294, in page 41, line 25, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) If, as a result of failure by an officer of any Government Department information needed by the trustees or managers of any scheme as a prerequisite to completing the winding-up of a scheme is not provided within three months of a request for such information, section 10 applies to any officer who has failed to provide such information.'.
<P>

<P>
No. 296, in Clause 40, page 44, line 10, after `(c)', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an officer of any Government Department; or (d)'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that the amendments, which were recommended by the National Association of Pension Funds, do not cause ripples in the Committee. They would ensure that Government Departments do not delay the winding-up process. The purpose behind them probably arose out of an experience that pension funds may have had, in which complex, controversial or political cases—to reassure the Minister, I can think of many such cases—were stuck in the public sector system.
<P>
The whole drift of this part of the Bill is to accelerate the winding-up of pension funds. We broadly agree with that objective, but we are aware that, from time to time, delays result from certain areas of the public sector system having come to a gentle halt or slowed down. That does not always happen at the civil service level but—dare I say it—sometimes matters get stuck on Ministers' desks. Horror, shock; that is unusual, I know. No one could ever dream of that happening.
<P>
The drift of the amendments is to set some parameters of behaviour for the public sector to help to achieve the Government's objective of accelerating the winding up of pension funds. Parallels are emerging between the civil service pension funds and the private sector pension funds. Responsibility is more clearly defined in the private sector than in the public sector and it would be helpful to those pension fund operators to know that the public sector was operating under similar rules to them.
<P>
Should there, for unforeseen reasons, be delays in the public sector that would be a cause for concern to management in the private sector, there should be the same level of responsibility as that in the private sector. Any system of punitive measures often refers to some form of compensation, but the weakness in the argument in this case is that it could come from taxpayers' money, and none of us wants that.
<P>
The subsequent amendments are about where responsibility lies. Performance related pay, which suggests responsibility lies in the private sector, is becoming more widely available in the public sector. The time-honoured fashion in the House would be to reduce the Secretary of State's pay to £1. We would not go that far, but it is a way of showing where we think that responsibility lies, and could be used if a problem was more of process and procedure than of substance.
<P>
The NAPF suggests that there should be clear responsibility for any delays caused by the public sector or at a personal level, and we have been happy to debate that.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> As the hon. Lady said, the NAPF suggested the amendments to various hon. Members. They raise some important issues about the winding-up process and the way in which clauses 39 and 40 achieve the Government's intentions, As we know, clause 39 is about reports, and the provision of information in a timely fashion is key to them. Both clauses oblige a range of parties to provide information in a more timely fashion than they have hitherto been obliged to.
<P>
Amendment No. 294 would introduce a subsection to clause 39. Its wording might sound a little harsh, and it might be inappropriate to make a failure to provide information a matter for the civil courts. However, the amendment tries to put mechanisms in place to ensure that Opra—which is being given a leading, more powerful, proactive role—can treat not only with the private sector and individual trustees, but with the relevant Departments in the same way. The principle Department involved would be the Department of Social Security, but the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise, on value added tax, may also be involved.
<P>
The Minister has told us that there is a big programme to enable catching up to take place, so there may be a massive acceleration in work load over the next four to six years. That must have implications on the pressure of work for the Department. We know that, in its various guises, it has financial restrictions that may, in turn, lead to reductions in staff resources. It would be interesting to know whether it is being protected from such changes, and whether budgetary revisions will be made to enable it to deliver.
<P>
It would help if the Bill contained provisions—perhaps not precisely those in the amendment—to enable Opra to treat with Departments in the same way as it treats with trustees and other parties in the private sector, so that no part of the system could hold up the outcomes. As the hon. Lady said, a consequence of delays, especially those caused by the likes of the national insurance recording system, would be compensation costs that the Government would have to bear. To fulfil the obligations that we are placing on Opra, we must avoid the need for compensation by enabling the expeditious provision of information.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will assure us that clear targets will be set to achieve compliance in the public sector, so that we can realise our common ambition of accelerating the winding up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> These are useful probing amendments, but there must be a limit to the length of any probe. The debate has been useful in exploring the subject of the availability of information, but it is not proper that amendment No. 294 would require that proposed new section 72A(10) of the Pensions Act 1995 should apply where an officer may have been responsible for the withholding of information. Should something of that sort happen in the private sector, the ordinary course of events is that the organisation has the legal identity, takes the rap and pays compensation. If it discovers that the incompetence or maladministration of certain individuals was responsible, it can deal with that accordingly under its internal procedures.
<P>
I do not see why public sector officers and employees should be subject to a different standard, nor why it should be specified in law that they should take personal and individual responsibility. That would not be helpful. The organisation concerned—in this case, the Department—should take responsibility for the actions of its officers and sort out through its internal disciplinary matters whether an officer was at fault.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall make a couple of preliminary remarks in response to the speech made by the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne). I am not a lawyer, but the top and bottom of matters so far as I understand them is that all that officers of the Department would do is name the relevant Minister. The Minister would be responsible in the event that anyone was ever daft enough to make such an amendment to a Bill, as that is where the ultimate accountability lies. Ministers have to be accountable. They take the rap when things go wrong, and the whole team shares the credit when things go right. I tell those to the left and the rear of me that that is right and proper.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham has not been in the House long enough to know that Ministers' salaries would not be reduced to £1, but to £1,000. I was present when that vote was carried one night. It applied to Eric Varley, which shows how long ago it was, and we had to return the following day to put it right.
<P>
I suspect that the draftsmen at the National Association of Pension Funds had some fun putting the amendments together. To the best of my knowledge, I do not think that they suggested them to us. Today is not the day to ask me for favours for the National Association of Pension Funds, given its remarks yesterday about ethical investments and the Government's proposals for socially responsible investment regulations. To imply that the Government are encouraging terrorism against financial offices by introducing those regulations is outrageous.
<P>
I must put all that behind me and deal with the amendment in a fair and careful way. To be honest, it undermines the three speeches. It may come as a bit of a shock to hon. Members, but the managers of pension funds or schemes are ultimately responsible for keeping all the records. The Government have no statutory obligation to supply information about individuals from our computers to scheme managers, and so the issue of compensation goes out of the window—it is all discretionary.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Contracted-Out Employments Group, which acts on behalf of the Inland Revenue, is not required by law to provide schemes with information held on the national insurance recording computer. The service is purely discretionary, but like Topsy, it has grown and become custom and practice. It seems to have the force of statute, but it does not. It is extremely convenient for schemes to be able to access the information on the Government computers, but they are responsible for keeping the records of their individual members. Private sector occupational pension schemes are not run by the Government.
<P>
We must put the responsibility back where it belongs. We are happy to co-operate, because that facilitates good administration. Because it is custom and practice, people in the industry have got used to having our co-operation and probably think that that is the norm, and that they have a right to the information—but they do not. I suspect that the amendment was prompted by the recent delays in transferring voluntary information from the new national insurance recording system—NIRS2. This is not the place or the day to go into the history of NIRS2. Suffice to say that we did not order it, but our job is to get it right and working again.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): And you have not.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We must not be distracted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We are making considerable progress. Since 1 October 1999 we have identified membership details of over 3,300 schemes, and have plans in place to complete the remaining cases by August. There are delays in obtaining the information. There is further work to do with the computer, but we aim to resolve most outstanding problems by the end of next month. We are working with the pensions industry on a phased recovery programme following the catastrophe caused by the new system.
<P>
The clause is part of a package to accelerate the winding up of schemes, and it is important that the difficulties of NIRS2 do not get in the way. Winding-up problems have existed for years, but they occurred with the previous system, had nothing to do with the computers and happened long before NIRS2 was ordered. I do not know the average figure, but it is not exceptional for winding up to take six years or more. That may seem unbelievable but it is the reality.
<P>
Part of the difficulty in agreeing details of contracted-out liabilities is that scheme records are not always accurate enough for the trustees to be certain that they have established all the liabilities. In order to assist with the winding up of schemes, the Contracted-Out Employments Group supplies the administrators with information. The administrators then have to cross-check their own records. The whole thrust of my argument is that the service is discretionary—a taxpayer-funded service to the private sector, which we are able and happy to provide. As we are featherbedding an inefficient private sector that has not kept its records properly, I take a dim view of the fact that we get it in the neck with constant complaints when something goes wrong and there are delays. I am going to get carried away if I am not careful, but I think that I have made the point.
<P>
We can forget compensation. We can forget attacks on named civil servants. That is out of bounds—there are no grounds for it. We are getting on top of the problem. Clearly, we shall not block the information. We must continue with custom and practice. It is an expensive project; enormous resources are being put into getting NIRS2 to work and, when it does, there will be a flow of information to scheme providers. That is important. The thrust behind the amendments is a little bit of fun that someone at the National Association of Pension Funds thought that he or she would have at the Government's expense and, frankly, it has not worked.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> May I, on behalf of the National Association of Pension Funds, apologise to the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary for their not having received copies of the amendments. I was assured that all members of the Committee would receive them. If I had realised that Ministers had not, I would have been happy to have given them copies of the copies that I have been sent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I do not want to turn the debate into a whinge about the association, but we received copies of the amendments yesterday and only then had the opportunity to evaluate them.

I shall not pursue the issues that the Minister was becoming aerated about, but I shall have a word with him outside the Room about the effect of the socially responsible investment policy on a pensioner in my constituency, who is being targeted by the animal rights movement. I stress that my constituent is a pensioner and has nothing to do with Huntingdon Life Sciences.
<P>
I was interested that the Minister said that the co-operation between Government Departments and the pension funds had grown up via custom and practice. I am sure that the pension funds will take note of that view. It has been useful to have on the record some of the points that the right hon.

<P>
Many of us have experienced unduly protracted wind-ups, especially from 9.30 pm when we are looking forward to going home after the Division at 10 pm, Clearly, they do not happen during social security debates.
<P>
The clause introduces a requirement for trustees to keep records of decisions to wind up and also a definition of when winding up starts. Such information is vital, particularly as the date on which winding up starts will be the trigger point for reports to be made to Opra. In the past, that has not been clear and the date has been a matter of dispute.
<P>
Amendment No. 277 would ensure that regulations specify the detail of the record that must be kept. That is important, as it would reduce any potential for confusion and misunderstanding that may arise in future. We intend the regulations to include the detail of how the decision is to be recorded, such as the names of those who took the decision and the date on which it was taken, as well as how the information must be presented. That could include, for example, the order in which the information appears in the record or how it is to be categorised. I urge members of the Committee to accept the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 279 to 281.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The clause is part of a package of measures aimed at speeding up the winding up of occupational pension schemes. It gives Opra the power to direct both action and the provision of information during the winding up of the scheme. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State will give more details about the operation of the clause when we debate amendments Nos. 249 and 250.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 278 and 281 will make it clear that Opra can direct that information be provided to persons involved with the administration of the scheme as well as, or instead of, the trustees or managers. It may be more appropriate for those people to have that information if they are carrying out most of the work connected with the winding up of the Scheme. Regulations will list other persons to whom Opra can direct that information must be provided.
<P>
We also want regulations to enable Opra to direct action on grounds other than that reports from the scheme are due. Amendments Nos. 279 and 280 will ensure that, by amending subsection (3) of proposed new section 72B of the Pensions Act 1995 to allow regulations to prescribe other circumstances.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Amendments Nos. 249 and 250 concern duties of confidentiality. Amendment No. 249 is a probing amendment, as most have been this afternoon. As I understand it, the proposed section 72C(5) of the 1995 Act will override any duty that one person might owe to another not to provide information requested under new section 72B. The amendment would turn subsection (5) on its head and make breach of such confidentiality a reasonable excuse for not providing information. If the duty of confidentiality could be overridden, it would start a dangerous trend. We all know that small beginnings can become creeping realities.
<P>
Amendment No. 250 would add a new subsection to overcome the problems that could arise if the Government—miracle of miracles—accepted amendment No. 249. It would require regulations to provide for an appeal process to resolve questions that could arise over duties of confidentiality. It could deal with attempts to avoid providing information by hiding behind duties of confidentiality, and provide protection when there is real concern over confidentiality. It does not take a great deal of imagination to realise that any breach of the duty of confidentiality could lead, in the long run, to an undesirable effect on our legal system. A duty of confidentiality should be respected. Will the Minister comment on whether our interpretation is correct? Alternatively, does overriding legislation exist that would satisfy our concerns? I am sure that the Minister would not want a duty of confidentiality to be overridden. I hope that he will be able to reassure the Committee on that point.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Amendments Nos. 249 and 250 attempt to draw the line in terms of matters of confidentiality. Obviously, some disclosure is necessary. We live in a world in which information is swiftly removed—even information that is given in confidence, as Senator Pinochet is discovering to his cost, can end up on the internet. The problem with amendment No. 249 is that, if it was made, people could use it to declare: ``No, we cannot possibly discuss that matter; it is far too confidential.'' The amendments therefore represent a shield and a sword—a shield to protect confidentiality, and a sword to ensure that information is not withheld unreasonably.
<P>
Ministers are regularly subject to requests for information from journalists, members of the public and various interested bodies. The more we move towards freedom of information, the more confidentiality will be an issue. The more we try to regulate information, the more restricted information will become. In combining the two amendments, we want to ensure that people who have a reasonable right to information receive it. That ties in with our argument in an earlier debate that beneficiaries of various schemes sometimes feel powerless. In conjunction, the amendments would protect confidentiality while ensuring that reasonable information could not be denied by hiding behind a banner of confidentiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I hope that I can satisfy Opposition Members. Clause 40 is long. In relation to Opra's power to give directions, subsection (5) stipulates that they must be in writing. Although Subsection (8) uses the word ``may'', it indicates that regulations will be able to impose limitations on the steps that a person may be required to take by a direction. We must remember that Opra is a regulatory authority; it is not the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. A restricted amount of information is required to accelerate the winding up of pension schemes. It is not a fishing expedition. As I said, the actions that Opra takes are subject to appeal, and even revision, in the courts.
<P>
Those winding up the scheme must have support when there are problems. Amendment No. 249 would allow those who are directed by Opra to provide information to refuse to do so on grounds of confidentiality.
<P>
I understand the sentiments behind the amendments, but I can assure the Committee that Opra will not be able to require all manner of information. Directions must be made in writing, and must be germane to the specifics of winding up a scheme. The regulatory authority—which will operate at arm's length but, in effect, for the public good—must be able to direct the provision of information on narrow grounds Even without Opra's involvement, that is neither more nor less than trustees would need to conduct the process. By definition, if everything were done by trustees and matters were hunky-dory, Opra would not be required.
<P>
The provisions do not allow a breach of confidentiality as a reasonable excuse for failure. I accept that some professionals and scheme administrators have a duty not to disclose information, and the duty imposed on them by the clause will take precedence over any other duty of non-disclosure. When directed to provide information by Opra, they will not be in breach of any other duty. As professional members of institutions with codes of conduct, it is important that they are, as it were, covered. Opra is a regulatory authority and is restricted in what it can require by way of information. It must give specific reasons for requiring information, and it can be challenged in court if necessary. It will look for no more or less in the way of power than trustees would exercise in winding up a scheme. If a penalty is imposed as a result of failure to comply, provisions in the Pensions Act 1995 will enable the matter to be dealt with in court.
<P>
The clause is long and I agree that it is deserving of an explanation. It contains caveats in respect of conducting fishing expeditions in writing, and there are restrictions on the sort of information that can be required. Nevertheless, under the powers in the Bill, when information is required, those with other duties of non-disclosure will be covered. In the circumstances, and given that an appeal mechanism exists, that is wholly reasonable.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that explanation. I rather suspected that there would be a lucid explanation for the clause's drafting and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Investigations by the Ombudsman</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 186, in page 46, line 46, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) give every party to a complaint and every person against whom allegations are made in the complaint an opportunity to make oral representations to the Pensions Ombudsman where such oral representation shall be limited to a maximum period of one hour for each party or person unless in exceptional cases where the Pensions Ombudsman deems that additional time is required.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not believe that I am out of order—doubtless you will tell me if I am, Sir David—in mentioning that, last week, I proposed an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which would require that the pensions ombudsman be considered part of the overarching ombudsman organisation established by the Bill under the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
A constituency case of mine raised many of the questions that prompted the tabling of these amendments and, indeed, my amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill. Although one particular case has brought these issues to mind, they deserve wider consideration, because they are not unique.
<P>
Amendment No. 186 relates to making oral representations to the ombudsman. The ombudsman, who is doing a good job, has resolved many pensions questions and problems. The remaining cases are complex and difficult and often in new territory. Therefore, the ombudsman must spend a lot of time looking into ways of working, rules and standards.
<P>
These complex cases often took place many years ago and in circumstances where people were innocent of what the problem was because it emerged only many years later. Most normal people would not keep detailed records. They believe that the advice and information that they are being given is fair, decent and honest. They perhaps accept what they have been told and only later do the consequences emerge, by which time there are no written records, or only cursory ones. The information that is needed for a case to go to the ombudsman can only be obtained by taking statements, the equivalent of giving evidence to the police: one makes a statement to a lawyer or the appropriate authority, saying, ``To the best of my recollection, this is what happened'', and one signs it. There is no true written record of the circumstances at the time when decisions were taken or options offered.
<P>
The ombudsman has a right to hold oral hearings. In an answer to a question from me on 16 December, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Pensions Ombudsman holds oral hearings where the facts of a case are in dispute or where there is an issue concerning the accuracy of evidence. To require mandatory oral hearings in all instances would lengthen the process, make it more costly and adversarial for those involved and, therefore, we do not propose to change the law in this way.''—[Official Report, House of Commons, 21 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 554W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can understand the Minister's reservations about cost and delay. However, where there is no written record, an oral hearing can often be the only way that a single pensioner can make his case. I acknowledge that the clause would create class actions for pensioners: a single pensioner does not have the knowledge, the authority or even the physical strength—he could be well into retirement before these issues emerged—to give the written evidence that is required. An oral hearing enables pensioners to make their case in the best way possible. Because we are conscious of cost and time, the amendment would limit the amount of time that the ombudsman need give a person who wants an oral hearing.
<P>
Given the difficulty of many such cases, and the extent to which they may be based on memory, the ombudsman should be much more open to requests for oral hearings, and should be empowered to offer them much more readily. I take on board the Minister's comments about potential cost and delay. In line with that, the amendment would limit the time that the ombudsman has to spend, and hence the cost involved, in taking evidence in oral hearings.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Minister does not accept the amendment, I hope that he will consider further whether, given that the ombudsman has done such a good job in solving the simpler cases that comprised his initial case load, he needs more help, support and guidance in helping complainants in often complex and difficult cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): As my hon. Friend explained, the amendment is a probing amendment. As such, it is a useful exercise. I expect the Minister to respond that the Government are anxious not to put undue burdens on the pensions ombudsman. Having spent my entire political life proposing less—rather than more—regulation, I am sympathetic to such an argument.
<P>
The amendment gives us the opportunity to discuss the ombudsman's role. My hon. Friend made a fair point: it is often difficult, especially for people of pensionable age, to deal with complex matters in writing. On the other hand, it might be equally difficult to deal with them in an oral hearing lasting only an hour. It is a case of the devil and the deep blue sea. We need to find a simple way of giving people who feel that they have been subject to some difficulty, abuse or injustice the confidence that they can have recourse to an ombudsman.
<P>
As Members of Parliament, we have all had dealings with the local government and parliamentary ombudsmen over the years, and know that the process is difficult. Of every 100 cases that we may bring to an ombudsman's attention, only a small proportion will receive a full investigation. There is a great deal of misunderstanding among the general public about the role of ombudsmen. However, the pensions ombudsman might be a different creature.
<P>
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham has facilitated a useful debate about these complex matters and the ways in which members of the public who feel aggrieved over their pensions can gain some redress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Generally, when constituents telephone me to request that I meet them to discuss their problems, my secretary stresses that they will expedite matters if they put their problem to paper. I receive their letter within a day or so and am able to take appropriate action to deal with the inquiry or problem. If they were to insist on seeing me because they had a right to express their case verbally, as the amendment would require, it could be some time before I was able to see them—at best a week, but more probably 10 days to two weeks.
<P>
Although the approach generally works, we sometimes overestimate the ability of many of our constituents to communicate in writing. My secretary usually prompts people to write, but I often have to meet the person afterwards because the problem that confronts one on paper is almost indecipherable and meaningless. People who are quite capable of stating their case logically when one meets them face to face at a constituency advice session cannot do so on paper. The amendment deals with that difficulty.
<P>
People should have a right to a verbal hearing to put their case. Many of the people in the two pension cases that I have dealt with as a constituency Member of Parliament were not financially sophisticated—that is why they ended up in difficulty and did not have appropriate records. This useful amendment would safeguard our constituents' rights.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I should like to add my voice to those of my hon. Friends. The matter may be complicated and time-consuming and the Minister may argue that the pensions ombudsman's job is difficult enough without having to conduct oral hearings. In anticipation of his response, I stress the alternative approach, which has already been well expressed by my hon. Friends. I may repeat their arguments, but that may stress the importance of them.
<P>
I have similar surgery cases to those of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West. Nowadays, I find that many people prefer it if a Member of Parliament rings them back to discuss their case. I ring perhaps half a dozen people a day to discuss their problems. Like my hon. Friend, I am keen for them to put figures in writing, not least because my own handwriting can be dodgy on occasion. It helps to have details in their handwriting on a piece of paper because I might send it to the Minister so that he can check that their benefits are appropriate and accurate. On the whole, it is helpful if people put their case in writing.
<P>
One can usually establish pretty quickly whether it would be helpful to see someone so that they can put their case logically and sensibly. They may have become confused about their situation, their rights and how the law could further their case. One often has to see someone and, in view of the rapacious nature of our work, to spend more time with them than one would like. Spending a lot of time with one person can have a knock-on effect. However, as a Member of Parliament, one has to judge how one should spend one's time. People may have a good case, but one might have to tease it out of them to make it sensible and in order to put it to the relevant authorities so that justice can be done.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have said, the pensions regime is difficult and complex, which means that people may not put their case as well as they could—they certainly do not do so on paper. However, a face-to-face interview can elicit the natural justice of a case in a way that a piece of paper does not do as readily—not least because keeping records is a bore for all of us. When we do not always realise the import of the mail that comes through our doors, keeping relevant documents or having proof of what someone said is too big an expectation for some people, if not everyone.
<P>
A court of law is designed to elicit the truth. A case that seems straightforward may become different when interested parties are allowed to make their points. The ombudsman's decisions will be binding and the parties concerned must abide by them, so he will have a semi-judicial role in these important matters. If there is a paucity of written evidence, the law of natural justice should allow people to make oral representation, but my hon. Friends are right to say that there must be a limit. We all have constituents who are fanatical about an injustice that has been done to them and, sadly, we cannot always put matters right, even when right is on their side. It can be difficult when people simply will not accept that there is no solution to their problem or that their problem is not quite as they perceive it.
<P>
We understand the need to limit oral representation, but when people are allowed a face-to-face interview and the expert in front of them knows the rules under which they are operating, the truth and justice of their case is often revealed in the way in which they put their case and handle themselves, especially if the appellant has difficulty in putting his thoughts into writing. The natural justice of allowing oral representation is straightforward, and I hope that we can look forward to a sympathetic response from the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> As I understand it, the purpose of clause 42 is to give more powers to the ombudsman and, in view of the previous court case, it is necessary to change the law to enable the ombudsman to make decisions that may affect not just the complainant but others who have not complained. I understand the need for the provision. Our amendment would give every party to a complaint and every person against whom allegations are made the opportunity to make oral representations. That is important. I have had cases concerning the financial services industry in which people against whom a complaint was made not only had very little chance to defend themselves, but were charged for the privilege, even when the case was won. That analogy is not directly relevant, but if the amendment were accepted, those circumstances would arise less frequently, which would be helpful.
<P>
I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West on this matter, as on many others, although I shall never be as eloquent or as colourful as him. We try to encourage people to write to us with their complaints, although if it were that simple, we should not need to hold surgeries at all. It is not that simple, and we need to hold surgeries once a week or a fortnight to examine the more complicated cases. With those few words, I add my support to the amendment.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not intend to detain the Committee for long. I recognise that if the Committee had a colour, it would be described as going through a beige patch at the moment. However, we want to concentrate on matters that deserve an airing, of which this is one. We make no apology for that; it is an important issue. It relates to the point that I made earlier: it is easy to endow various folks with certain rights in a Bill, but more difficult to get those rights enacted in practice.
<P>
I hope that I shall not embarrass my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham by saying that she has been quite a champion of the role of the ombudsman and influential in making Conservative Members re-examine some of the questions. My experience leads me to agree with her point that, when things go wrong in the process, the problem always has a long history. One can go back decades and usually find an appalling mess. It may be difficult for people to remember various points of reference if there is a long time-lag.
<P>
One's heart sinks when people bring such problems to the surgery, although the opposite kind of case—one in which all the records have been kept—often causes the same reaction. When one sees a constituent arrive with a great bundle of papers, saying: ``I've put all this together, Mr. Pickles, because I thought you'd like to see it,'' one's heart sinks, and one's inner voice says: ``You must be joking.''
<P>
However, most cases are not like that. In most cases, people just drift into the difficulty. They arrive with a problem, only half understanding what is going on, and it takes a fair amount of persuasion for them to understand the main points. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said that, because one has been through the process before, one can often get people to marshal their facts. They have the information, but they often do not know how to put it across.
<P>
I am acutely aware of the necessity of the proposal because of our experience of the changes to the state earnings-related pension scheme which were kicked around for many years. People were misinformed, which I regard a scandal. I have made that point not only in Committee but on the Floor of the House. I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister, because this is one of the most difficult problems that he will have to unravel during his term of office. I recall the great shock that was felt by Labour Members in Committee when they realised that 18 months or two years into the life of this Parliament, misinformation was still being given out.
<P>
The relevance of those comments to the clause is that much of the information given out is verbal information communicated over the telephone. No one keeps records of those conversations, and folks have to make a judgment as to what is true. The Minister will find it very difficult to make a decision on this matter because it will be impossible to sort out the people who have genuinely been misled from people who have not been misled but who recognise that an opportunity exists for compensation. That is why a verbal hearing is so important.
<P>
We recognise that such hearings can drag on, which is why we would allow people an hour to make their point. The amendment is designed to give a human face to the process and to allow people to have contact with someone who knows the relevant facts and can marshal them as we do in our surgeries, but more often it would provide an opportunity for the ombudsman to judge the veracity of the case. It is generally possible to distinguish people who have genuinely been misled and have arrived on a path that they did not intend from people who jolly well knew what they were doing, deeply regret it and now want to blame someone else.
<P>
We know how long it can take ombudsmen to deal with such problems. They are overworked and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said, the public sometimes misunderstand their functions. The amendment is not perfect or even approaching perfection. However, increasingly, records are lost and people make allegations and are more certain about their rights. We must give people that vital opportunity to have their say and to have a great injustice righted, or at least to be given a reason why it cannot be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I welcome the amendment because it enables the Committee briefly to celebrate the work of the pensions ombudsman, which goes unsung in the generality of public life in this country. I do not want to jeopardise discussion on the following amendment or on clause stand part, but the debate has been fairly wide-ranging, and a few points should be made.
<P>
The category of cases with which the ombudsman may deal is currently restricted. If the case relates to winding up, death benefits or use of a surplus, for example, he cannot touch it; those involved must go to court. The purpose of the clause is to increase not the ombudsman's powers but the rights of the public to have their cases examined by the ombudsman. That purpose is important, and I am sure that it enjoys the Committee's support.
<P>
Many points have been made about work load. At the start of 1998–99, the case load of the ombudsman, Dr. Farrand, was 1,361. During the year, he determined or settled 674 cases, and 332 cases remained in progress. To reach that stage, he had to reject or refer nearly 2,400 cases. Even after he had done so, 719 remained, putting the total at more than 3,000. It is not an excuse, but there are only 8,760 hours in a year, even if he worked every hour available.
<P>
The ombudsman referred 700 cases to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, which relates to the point about people being able to present their case. OPAS has regional connections throughout the country. The London headquarters is on the same floor as the ombudsman. When I visited it a couple of months after I came into office, I met the person who was dealing with a case that I had referred to it some time earlier; the case was really dodgy and I needed some help with it. At the time I thought that the occupational pensions advisory board still existed; the change had passed me by. The person concerned had himself referred many cases. I do not know how many of them came back to him when a solution could not be found, but some of them must have done.
<P>
Where the ombudsman considers an oral hearing necessary, he will allow one, but to give every complainant the right to an hour's hearing would fundamentally change the pensions ombudsman service. At the moment, he operates as an inquisitor, seeking facts and information to arrive at a solution or determination. He also ruffles feathers, for which I pay tribute to him, because it means that he is genuinely doing the job of an ombudsman. Occasionally, of course, my learned friends in the courts of the land disagree with him, but he tries tenaciously to find solutions to problems and I celebrate his work. Where he believes that an oral case is needed, he will choose that. That is a bit like the constituency case. People ring or write about an issue and usually that is enough to enable one to deal with it, but sometimes one thinks: ``No, I need a couple of minutes face to face on that''—such meetings are worth 10 closely written pages without margins or paragraphs.
<P>
Dr. Farrand is in the same position. He will say that he needs to see someone and he has the power and discretion to arrange that. All the parties to a complaint see one another's paperwork so they are able to comment on it—the process is very paper-based—and in most cases Dr. Farrand and his staff can locate the information that they need to make a determination. It is not as though the ombudsman or his staff take the view that they do not want face-to-face contact with complainants. The very nature of their role is to find the solution to a problem.
<P>
The Occupational Pensions Advisory Service provides an extremely useful national network of advice, on the telephone and face to face, from practitioners and professionals on a voluntary basis. I do not have at my fingertips the figures on the number of cases that it deals with. If solutions cannot be found, the service will assist in preparing a case to go down the corridor, as it were, to the ombudsman. I suspect that its work acts almost as a sifting service for the ombudsman process. The ombudsman may be thought the best person to take on the remainder of a really tricky case that requires extra information and digging.
<P>
People can request an oral hearing; where fairness requires, that would be granted. Not many oral hearings are taken because the ombudsman can find solutions without them; 80 per cent. of his investigations are completed within 18 months of the issue first having been raised. Apart from anything else, if an oral hearing had to be held in all cases it would be difficult to find acceptable times and places—London might be the capital city but it is not the most convenient.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The right hon. Gentleman gave us some figures—does he have a specific figure on the number of cases in which there is an oral hearing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is a handful—fewer than 10 in 1998–99. That is a very small proportion of the grand total of 674 cases that were determined or settled by the ombudsman in that year. I am not aware of any ground swell of complaints by people who have been to the ombudsman and who have then said either through their Member of Parliament or directly to the Department, ``This is not fair. I could not put my case and give the facts.'' If any member of the Committee has such information, I shall be more than happy to revisit the matter. This is not the time to do so, however. The clause will increase the rights of the public to take a different range of cases to the ombudsman, so his case load will certainly increase.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister's response is fair. There is not a great deal between us on this issue. If a member of the public requests to see him as a Member of Parliament, I am sure that he would never turn away that constituent. Given the tone of his remarks, he is saying that the pensions ombudsman acts reasonably in such matters and that if a member of the public really wants to see him, the pensions ombudsman will seek to accommodate that person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> At that point, the ombudsman would have received the paperwork from the complainant and the party about whom the complaint was made. That is right. It is open season in my surgery. I have a queue; it is first come, first served. All I want to know is whether the people who come to see me are constituents. I then listen to them.
<P>
If people write to me, I do not respond by saying: ``Well, your letter was very interesting. Can we have a chat about it?'' If enough information about the person's case is contained in the letter, I can deal with it. Even if people come to see me carrying a suitcase full of papers, I ask them to tell me in one sentence what the matter is. Sometimes, it is put in a nutshell and I know to whom to write about the case—and then that person can deal with it. Members of Parliament take such action in their ombudsman role. We find the correct authority to deal with the matter about which our constituents are aggrieved. After all, they are not aggrieved about me. It is a matter of finding a gem of information that directs one to the right avenue.
<P>
I shall be happy to pursue such matters if anyone has serious grounds for wanting me to do so, but I have no evidence to suggest that the lack of an automatic right to an oral hearing is a major problem. We need to give people the right to have their case assessed outside the courts. The post of ombudsman exists to solve problems and avoid the use of court procedure. I do not know about the success rates, but people are usually satisfied when they know that their problem has been examined at the highest possible level.
<P>
There are no arguments to be advanced about costs, because the ombudsman is paid by a levy on schemes. Such a matter is as long as a piece of string. However, changing the administration method would alter how the ombudsman works and given that, as a result of the clause, substantial changes will be made and he will have an increased work load, it would be inappropriate to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have listened with care to the Minister's comments and those of my hon. Friends. My hon. Friends made a strong case for the need for the pensions ombudsman to be more open to oral hearings. The case that has prompted my concern about the matter has not yet been brought to the attention of the Minister, because it has not reached the appropriate level. If we cannot change the situation, it will be brought to his attention. Given the involvement of several pensions lawyers with whom I have been in contact because of the case, the concerns expressed to me are more widespread than he might be aware. People with cases that stem from many years ago might rely on oral evidence. They come into our surgeries with suitcases full of papers, but not the papers that were relevant at the time from which their cases date. Several pensions lawyers have advised me that, in some cases, the ombudsman has refused to hear the oral evidence and has even complained about the lack of written evidence. There is no written evidence; it has to be given orally.
<P>
I hope that the Minister accepts that the matter has implications that go wider than my constituency case. I understand that extra work will land on him, and I welcome the burden that will be imposed by the clause. I hope that we have a chance to discuss the matter in a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The amendment is intended to set down a marker for problems that will occur with various changes in pensions. Does my hon. Friend agree that most Members of Parliament have been scarred by one or two cases of the type to which she referred?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am reassured that I am not by myself in having to deal with complex pension cases. We have put down markers, and perhaps the next group of amendments will put down further markers relating to our concerns about the details of the pensions ombudsman's role. Perhaps we shall discuss some of the other issues in a brief clause stand part debate.
<P>
As we have aired our concerns about oral hearings, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 47, line 28, after `Ombudsman', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(subject to the Ombudsman ensuring suitable remuneration for such other person who may be appointed by him where such person is not a party to the complaint or the investigation).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 184, in page 47, line 32, after `legal', insert `and actuarial'.
<P>
No. 187, in page 47, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) for the payment of some pre-emptive costs out of funds held for the purposes of the scheme to which the complaint or reference relates to be decided by OPAS.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I referred to further problems that the case brought up, and I reiterate that there is evidence of more such cases. The Minister of State pointed out that the pensions ombudsman, who deals with only occupational pensions, is funded by the occupational pension schemes via a levy. We referred in a previous debate to the fact that the trustees of the pension funds rightly try to maximise the income to their members, and are therefore careful about how much money goes to the ombudsman.
<P>
The ombudsman's signal achievement in reducing the backlog has hit me squarely in the face. We have already agreed that more cases will occur, but he has achieved a great deal by reducing the backlog, even with a skeleton staff. His last annual report beggars belief in its account of how many actuaries and lawyers help him. Apart from an in-house litigation solicitor, he has the help of half a lawyer and no actuary at all, yet many of the cases involving pension schemes rely on actuarial evidence.
<P>
Amendment No. 185 would not impose an actuary on the ombudsman, but would enable pensioners with a complaint who do not have the money to pay actuaries' fees to be given expenses for actuaries and to get advice, for which payment is made, from expert witnesses, not lawyers. Indeed, we welcome the fact that subsection (5) provides that some legal expenses should be paid, but the range of expert witnesses that someone with a genuine case could call on, even if they are living on a relatively modest income, should be expanded.
<P>
Amendment No. 185 provides for the ombudsman to recognise people who are necessary to the case and pay them reasonable expenses; amendment No. 184 would help those who need actuarial advice; and amendment No. 187 suggests that pre-emptive costs should be met.
<P>
I understand that the Home Secretary has already considered pre-emptive costs, but little progress appears to have been made. The problem is how one decides when a pre-emptive costs order would be acceptable and reasonable. It is difficult for someone with a complex case to make progress, because they do not have the money and cannot afford professional advice, and we must remember that the cases that the ombudsman gets may be difficult to decide. It could be argued—this is a live debate—that professionals should be able to take on such cases on a no-win, no-fee basis, but there is considerable wariness about that, so we must work on the practical basis that we are used to dealing with situations where people need expert advice.
<P>
It would not be impossible for a limited assessment to be made available to decide whether an applicant or a complainant had a reasonable case. OPAS does that to a certain extent, but even in a case that OPAS is considering someone should be able to obtain the additional expert advice that is required. OPAS may even be able to pay the fees itself.
<P>
I have briefly run through the thinking behind the amendments. We want to help those who desperately need help to bring a case. If they feel that they have not had justice, the hurt will fester and will bring into disrepute a system that has worked well and should continue to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This Committee will now take a well-earned tea break and will resume at 19 minutes past 5 o'clock.

Sitting suspended.

<H5>5.19 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> As I said in response to amendment No. 186, the clause will change the role of the ombudsman and will extend the rights of the public. I shall explain our thinking on costs, because that issue seems to underpin the amendments. In general, individuals should bear their own costs in putting forward a case, and should not incur costs in the expectation that someone else will pay them. That principle will apply in the vast majority of investigations. We want to prevent individuals from commissioning work on a case in the expectation that the scheme will meet the costs.
<P>
In addition to permanent office staff, the ombudsman has other resources on which he can call. He can buy in actuarial and legal advice if he considers it necessary. Cases requiring the making of cost orders will be very rare. In such cases, it will be more appropriate for costs to be channelled through a solicitor. The procedure rules will make that clear.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does that imply that, under the Bill as drafted, a solicitor could, if he thought it germane to the case, pay expert witnesses, or will legal costs relate entirely to his own costs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Solicitors would do well to seek advice on who will eventually meet the costs. There are procedural rules, and solicitors acting on behalf of, say, complainants should be aware of them, because they will want to know that their costs will be met. People should not incur costs in the expectation that someone else will foot the bill, but the rules will specify the process through which a cost order will be made, the time limits for seeking such an order, and the type of evidence that would be required to justify incurring costs. In complex cases, it is only fair that all parties have access to appropriate advice, depending on the circumstances of the particular case. In such instances, applications for a costs order will be made to the pensions ombudsman, who may grant an order on the basis of the procedural rules.
<P>
On amendment No. 184, the term ``legal expenses'' will encompass actuarial expenses. We anticipate that cost orders will be made in more complex cases involving several parties, which might include a group of individuals such as pensioner members. In such cases, a solicitor would usually commission appropriate advice—actuarial or otherwise.
<P>
As for amendment No. 185, there is a practical intention behind allowing representation of those with an interest in an investigation. Where a case involves many members, it would be impractical for all of them to represent themselves. The rules will allow the pensions ombudsman to appoint a representative to speak for a group of members. Clearly, we do not want to limit the range of potential representatives to those with a direct interest in the case; to do so would exclude, for example, a trade union representative. It is anticipated, however, that representatives will serve in a largely unpaid capacity. Paid representation will be necessary in cases where there is a need for legal advice, and such representation could be funded via a costs order. Again, the procedural rules will make that clear.
<P>
Amendment No. 187 is slightly different because, in effect, it would turn the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service into an adjudication authority—a role for which it is not suited, and which would detract from its primary advice function. The ombudsman is best placed to assess whether, in a particular case, the parties' costs should be met from the scheme. Parties would make their applications to the ombudsman, and to require OPAS to assess whether such a costs order should be made would, as I said, fundamentally change the nature of that organisation. We shall consult fully on those procedural rules, which will give people ample opportunity to discuss how such cost orders should be made. It would be wrong to place conditions in the Bill and, to that extent, the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>
Solicitors can instruct others—actuaries, for example—and the process will come under the terms that apply to legal expenses, so the costs can be met. The definition works both ways. In the comparatively few highly complex cases, it will be possible to meet the spirit of the hon. Lady's proposal. However, the proposals about OPAS would involve a fundamental change to which we cannot agree.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am pleased by the Minister's comments. I appreciate that retrospection is a bad word, but will the new legal expenses regime be applicable to those complex cases that are unresolved and currently with the ombudsman? I throw that proposal in as a thought on which the Minister could consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I should have to take advice on that. Frankly, I have said more than once that people should not enter into expenses with the expectation that someone else will meet them, and on that basis my probable answer is no. If that is not correct, I shall write to the hon. Lady due course.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I want to suggest—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have just got a nod, so I am right.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I appreciate that the Minister now believes that his response was correct. Perhaps the complex cases that I mentioned have not incurred costs. That may be why they have taken so long, are so difficult to resolve and are causing problems for complainants. I throw my proposal in as a suggestion for the Minister when he consults on his ideas about legal costs.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his response. He has reassured me, and I accept his comments on OPAS. Our proposals were a way in which to open the discussion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I put firmly on the record the fact that we welcome the clause's effort to correct the difficult position that the ombudsman was placed in by the case that stopped class actions. This may be an on-going debate. Is it rational for the occupational pensions ombudsman to be separated from the rest of the ombudsman set-up? The justification for that separation is the fact that occupational pensions are not financial products, which is the definition that is used by the other ombudsmen in relation to the Financial Services Authority. With the advent of stakeholding, I predict that there will be huge confusion about the role of ombudsmen, of Opra and of the FSA. We should have a more public debate about the role of the pensions ombudsman. In modern circumstances, is he most effective in his current place in the structure of what I could call the ombuds-system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I treated our debate on amendment No. 186, in effect, clause stand part debate, and I do not want to reiterate the comments that I made then. I did so because I thought that it would be useful to put the amendment in context.
<P>
The hon. Lady suggested that we could perhaps debate the role of the pensions ombudsman, but, regrettably, the clause and the Bill are not the place to do so. I do not rule it out, but to the best of my knowledge we have no plans to do so.
<P>
Changes are inevitable over time. Occupational pensions are changing; stakeholder pensions will come in. The Bill will change the ombudsman's work load, but that will be a matter for others to deal with—I am not saying that there are any plans—rather than the Department of Social Security. Where the ombudsman fits is almost a matter for the machinery of government, because of the changes with the FSA and everything else. Therefore, I prefer not to enter into that debate: first, I am not briefed on it; secondly, it would not be relevant to the Bill. However, the hon. Lady has raised a legitimate question, and I am sure that it will be debated.

Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> On a point of order, Sir David. My point of order relates to the point of order raised this morning and the changes to the order of business on Tuesday. I promised that I would report back to the Committee.
<P>
I repeat my thanks for the Committee's co-operation on Tuesday. Following Tuesday's decision to vote against clause 29 and change the order of consideration, I am pleased to confirm that the Government will table amendments tomorrow that deal with the calculations in old clause 29 alongside the arrangements for the new rebate structure for the state second pension. It will be a new clause and a new schedule, plus the new clause 29, which will be shorter than the previous one, which we debated to death. I regret the inconvenience, but the new package will enable us to have a more rational debate on the impact of the rebate structure at the end of our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I thank the Minister for that information and for tabling the new provisions so quickly. We look forward to spending the short recess trying to understand them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Further to that point of order, Sir David. I am sorry to interject a note of discord into our proceedings, but I was talking to somebody this morning who follows parliamentary proceedings carefully and is knowledgeable about our history, and he expressed amazement that a Standing Committee had been interrupted in this way. He thought that it happened very rarely. There appears to be a shortage of parliamentary draftsmen, which is putting the Government into some difficulty, but we in Parliament should know what is going on. It is extraordinary that a Committee should stop halfway through simply because the Government cannot get their amendments written in the right form on time. If there is such a shortage of parliamentary draftsmen, perhaps we should have less legislation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> A shortage of parliamentary draftsmen is not a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Further to that point of order, Sir David. When the Minister supplies us with explanatory notes, which I am sure will be of the same high quality as they have been for the rest of the Bill, I hope that we shall also be given additional material that exemplifies how the contracting-out procedures will work in practice. Some material is already in the public domain through the actuary's report and so on, but I hope that the Minister will be able to supply any other material that may cast light on this subject and so enable us better to consider the clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> As the Committee will not sit next week, I shall move heaven and earth to ensure that, before we debate these issues, members of the Committee will have as good quality notes on clauses and examples as they had when we were discussing the original calculations. Although the new clause and schedule may look weighty and complicated, the state second pension is a simple concept. I am assured that we shall need the help of the hon. Member for New Forest, West, who is an expert mathematician, because an algebraic formula is deeply buried within the provisions.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, he is entitled to complain, and I accept full responsibility for the difficulties caused. However, it is as well that we did what we did, because otherwise we would have ended up with less opportunity to debate the issues on Report—we all know about those pressures—than in Committee. Our actions stemmed from my late realisation of the connection between the new clauses and old clause 29, which, if we had made it stand part of the Bill, would probably have ruled out the selection of the new clauses. For that, I do not apologise.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Further to that point of order, Sir David. You were probably in the Chair when we discussed the difficulties with clause 29 and the need for high-tech equipment. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee concluded that it would be useful always to have a clause stand part debate at the beginning so as to allow the Minister to introduce the complexities of the subject. I am sure that it is not beyond our wit to table amendments that would give rise to that debate. Would you look kindly, Sir David, on allowing us to do that?

<H4><center>Pensions: MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS AND ALTERNATIVE TO ANTI-FRANKING RULES</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 310, in page 85, line 15, leave out from `which' to end of line 17 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`attributing an amount of benefits equal to the amount computed in accordance with Step 2 to rights accruing before 6th April 1997 would leave any such rights unused;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 311 to 314.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The amendments make technical changes to what are known as the alternative anti-franking rules, which are set out in schedule 4(15). As the provisions are technical, it may be helpful to the Committee if I begin by defining some terms.
<P>
Anti-franking rules are designed to ensure that an individual's rights in a scheme are protected, and that where the rules apply, a pension derived from one type of right is not offset against other benefits that are provided in the scheme. The prohibition on offsetting also extends to the right to a statutory increase. That is done by applying a test. Where the rules apply, a pensioner's benefit under the scheme must not be less than the notional benefits that would apply if the calculations in paragraph 15 were made.
<P>
The purpose of the legislation is twofold. First, it provides schemes with the statutory framework on which to base their own benefit formulae. Secondly, it provides individuals with a measure of protection by ensuring that their pension is underpinned by a statutory minimum. Under the new rules, administrators will be required to identify and calculate any pension rights that an individual has built up in the scheme or that have been transferred in from another scheme. The aggregate of those rights underpins the total scheme pension payable. In combination, amendments Nos. 310 and 311 clarify the legislation to ensure that schemes have a sound basis for apportioning an amount of the overall scheme pension to rights arising from pensionable service prior to 6 April 1997.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 312, 313 and 314 ensure that interaction between the notional calculations in steps 3 and 4 of the alternative anti-franking rules and the existing rules relating to the increase to guaranteed minimum pensions, or GMPs, accurately reflects the policy intention. To be more specific, for the purposes of the minimum benefit test, the amended legislation will require an individual's GMP to be increased in line with earnings until the member leaves salary-related pensionable service or reaches state pension age, whichever is earlier. The current provisions require amendment because they permit those increases to continue after the member has reached state pension age. That distorts the amount of statutory minimum pension that the scheme is required to pay—I thought that that might clinch it. As the rules create a minimum benefit test, it is important to iron out any apparently minor defects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Hang on. I have not finished yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We are waiting for the punch line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not have a punch line.
<P>
The term ``franking'' is an old-fashioned description from an earlier, bygone age in which documents were franked. For some unknown reason that we have not been able to explore, it was used in modern legislation in the previous decade, so we are stuck with the phrase ``anti-franking''. No one knows what it means, but we recognise it when we see it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 48, line 37, leave out `on that ground'.
<P>
We now move, in this rather mixed bag of a Bill, to the War Pensions Agency. The clause seems to be designed to streamline the WPA's procedures. We are worried that the onus for streamlining seems to be placed on people applying for pensions, people who already have pensions and want more help, and people who are involved with the WPA. We want to protect people who are vulnerable, who fall into several different categories. Some are of pensionable age and receive a war pension. Some are negotiating for a pension because of what has happened as a consequence of their service, and some are fighting for the recognition of the need for a pension, like one of my constituents, whose elderly parent sickened and died while in negotiations with the WPA. Several groups of people are vulnerable. Although I am sure that the purpose of the measures is to get speedier decisions, so that people know where they are, many of the proposed changes seem further to disadvantage those vulnerable people.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should declare an interest in that my mother is a war widow. My two brothers and I would have had a much harder upbringing if she had not received that pension. My father, who had been a Japanese prisoner of war, died in 1960 and my mother received a pension only because the illness from which he died resulted from his imprisonment. Therefore I have sympathy with people who claim war pensions who have problems in proving illness and in justifying their claim. Although my mother was hale and hearty in 1960, I was conscious that getting a pension is a bit of a battle; if people are debilitated by illness caused by service, or of an age where they are due to claim a pension, they tend to be vulnerable, ill or elderly. Life may be getting on top of them. Until now, they have had a generous amount of time in which to appeal, reply to and interact with the agency. Those are precisely the people who need that extra time because they may not have a lot of family around them, they may find it difficult to get out, and they may not want to share their problems with a citizens advice bureau. In that connection, I should mention the superb work done by the various benevolent funds, such as the Royal British Legion—which I understand has been consulted on, and is broadly in favour of, the changes. The representations that I have received from people with an interest in the area are to the effect that the measure is a bit tough on some of those vulnerable people.
<P>
I tabled the amendment to delete the phrase ``on that ground'' because many people involved with the War Pensions Agency have complex problems and may be vulnerable to various illnesses. It is not just a matter of simple cause and effect.
<P>
Removing the phrase ``on that ground'' widens the grounds on which an appeal can be made. In effect, it returns us to the old system, as do most of the amendments. Whereas I accept that, technically and legally, a person should be able to appeal only on the grounds on which people have always been able to appeal, I am aware that, because we are dealing with vulnerable people who have complex problems, another problem, illness or disability can often emerge in the process leading up to the appeal. Instead of sending such people back to the beginning of the appeal system, the amendment provides a way of passporting them through to a decision that is taken on their condition at the time that the decision is taken.
<P>
I realise that, when the process is widened to such an extent, decisions can be delayed, but we are dealing with people who do not want and do not have the energy to spend all their time appealing yet again to the War Pensions Agency. It is almost on the grounds of compassion that I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider the amendment. There are people out there who need greater consideration than that proposed under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady is right. We have reached an important part of the Bill that necessitates sensitivity and humility on the part of people of my generation who were born during the early part of the war. I have constituents who became war pensioners in the late 1980s and early 1990s—sometimes after a bit of a battle with the authorities, and sometimes unexpectedly. For many of them, it is as though the war was yesterday. I cannot put it clearer than that.
<P>
The hon. Lady's probing amendment concerns appeal rights. I expect that she wants to broaden the scope of the appeal rights to include all decisions, regardless of whether or not they are included in the regulations. That would be a major problem. The clause provides new appeal rights relating to war pensions. It also gives war pensioners statutory rights to receive a notification that gives grounds on which the decision has been made. The language is similar to other sections of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943 under which appeal rights are given.
<P>
I am not trying to avoid discussing the matter, but I can tell the Committee that, at a later date, regulations subject to the affirmative resolution will stipulate where the appeal rights lie. We cannot go into detail at the moment, but there will be plenty of opportunity to debate them. The tribunal process is valuable. It provides an independent review of the Department's decision-making processes. Access should not be denied. People should have a right to question the judgment of officials. We intend to provide war pensioners with the right of appeal against certain supplementary allowance decisions. We shall provide full details of that when the regulations have been laid. The proposals will enable the tribunals to examine those decisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 158 would broaden the scope of an appeal, so that it is not restricted to the grounds specified in the decision. It could go well beyond that. All administrative decisions leading up to the decision could be appealed against and that would cause considerable difficulties. Tribunals should not be asked to consider matters that have been part of the decision-making process, but which did not affect the decision that was reached. They are there to assess on appeal those aspects of the case on which the decision was based. If there was no dispute about the procedures leading to that decision, it could be onerous to include an appeal on all the other aspects involved.
<P>
If the appeal were accepted, the administrative aspects of the process, such as whether the decision maker could make a right decision if he lacked a service background, could be subject to an appeal. In common with social security policy, we do not intend to provide appeal rights for such issues. We want to ensure that the tribunal's time is used effectively, and that other appellants do not have to wait because the system is blocked with appeals that concern matters that need not be referred to the tribunal. No one wants to restrict matters that should properly be referred to tribunals, but blocking the process would cause considerable problems.
<P>
I do not want to bamboozle the Committee with statistics, but it is reckoned that the average time taken by the War Pensions Agency to clear an appeal is 255 days. That could be improved reduced to 150 days when the new decision-making and appeals programme is completed. That is a substantial improvement in anyone's book; it almost cuts the time in half.
<P>
It is important to give people the decisions based on the issues that should go to appeal rather than delay that reduction by blocking up the process. We are not trying to undermine the amendment, but I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw it in due course.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I should like to ask the Minister a question about the statistics that he gave, about the reduction in the average number of days that the War Pensions Agency takes to clear an appeal and about the Government's target of 150 days. What part of the reduction will be at the appellant's expense and what part of it will be due to the War Pensions Agency speeding up their procedures?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, I cannot answer that question.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry to have embarrassed the right hon. Gentleman. It was not entirely deliberate. We believe that much of the pressure will be put on the appellants, not the agency. The Minister gave me some cause to believe that some matters about which I was fearful may not come to pass and, on those grounds, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 44 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 45</center></H4>
<H4><center>Time limit for appeals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 49, line 13, leave out subsection (l).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No, 261, in page 49, line 36, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
No. 262, in page 49, line 41, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
No. 263, in page 49, line 44, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Anyone reading the amendments would think that we want to delete the whole clause, but the others in the group are consequential because we are concerned about how the pressure will fall on the appellant, not the War Pensions Agency. I shall not repeat our arguments, but we are conscious that, for example, Gulf war syndrome sufferers make up the most recent group of people whose problems are still to be resolved. There are fears that the War Pensions Agency and the system will, in due course, not be as sympathetic to those veterans as they have been to others who have been affected by war.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is best to keep in mind what the Government's changes will do. We want to introduce into the war pensions' system the decision-making appeal changes that have led already to a dramatic reduction in the backlog under the social security appeals' system. We want to extend appeal rights in the war pensions system. They have traditionally been separate and administered differently from the social security appeals' system. We also want to regularise some of the matters in the war pensions' appeal systems that we take for granted in the social security appeals' system.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State referred to extending appeal rights, for example, to supplementary allowances, which mirror many of the social security benefits at a more generous level—non means-tested and tax-free—in the war pensions' system. Previously, when a decision was handed down about an appeal for such a benefit, no reason had to be given for the appeal being turned down, and there were no appeal rights. The changes introduce those appeal rights, as well as the system of notifications, which were introduced with decision-making appeals. Decisions can therefore be explained as the rights are extended. The new system will therefore be much more user friendly.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When considering how the tribunals can best do their job, we must also consider the problem of delays in the War Pensions Agency. At the moment, the average waiting time before appeals are heard is 126 weeks, which is two and a half years. When we came to office, we said that the seven-month backlog in social security system appeals that we inherited was unacceptable. When many of the appellants are old, waiting times of such a length are even more unacceptable. Many of the appellants are very old, and we know what can happen when an old pensioner is waiting for the result of an appeal—
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Like General Pinochet.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not going to bandy that issue about in the Committee. It is not appropriate. I have explained the background to the Government's proposals.
<P>
In order to deal with backlogs and reduce average waiting times, appeal limits must be introduced. That was debated during the passage of the Social Security Act 1998. Otherwise, tribunals have to deal with old information and out-of-date appeals. It is often difficult to establish the facts because they have been forgotten or the papers are out of date. Clause 45 introduces a six-month appeal time limit for entitlement and final assessment appeals for war pensions. Opposition Members should not confuse that with time limits on making claims. Claims can be made for war pensions if qualification is derived from having served in the armed services during conflict. That is unaffected by the clause.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 260 and 262 aim to retain the current provisions of a 12-month appeal time limit for final assessment appeal and a 12-month appeal time limit for entitlement appeals, which in practice, are currently treated as open-ended. Those provisions were introduced more than 50 years ago, during the last war. Times have moved on, and the provisions are out of date. It might help the Committee if I explained the Government's thinking on the introduction of new time limits.
<P>
We do not intend to deny war pensioners the opportunity to appeal—as I said, we are extending their opportunity to appeal—but we want to encourage them to submit appeals early. Appeals that are submitted many months or even years after the decision was notified can result in the tribunal spending inordinate amounts of time trying to establish the facts at the time of the decision. That was the experience in social security appeals before the changes in the decision-making appeals process, which appear to be working well. It is a question of having timely facts and information.
<P>
It would not be helpful to the appellant if the existing process were to remain. It would not be in the interests of justice, nor would it be helpful to other war pensioners whose appeals are delayed because tribunals have to sift through complex and out-of-date information that has been submitted late. Although a one-month limit has been applied to decision making and appeals changes, with an extension of a further month in certain circumstances, it will not be applied to social security appellants. Instead, we shall apply limits of six months and three months. War pensioners, many of whom served in the last war, have rightly received preferential treatment, and enjoyed generous appeal times in a more generous system. It would not therefore be appropriate to make a substantial leap from appeal time limits of 12 months—or open-ended appeals, which currently apply—to a time limit of one month.
<P>
We recognise that a requirement for appeals to be submitted earlier needs to be balanced with the obligation to provide war pensioners with sufficient time to consider the decision and to decide whether they wish to appeal. I am confident that the move to an appeal time limit of six months is sufficiently generous to give war pensioners the time to obtain information, consult people and take any other appropriate action before they decide to submit an appeal, and that the ex-service community will have sufficient time to support them.
<P>
We have consulted the appropriate organisations on this matter, especially those that represent war pensioners at tribunals. They recognised that the appeal time limit should be changed, and were reasonably content that we had got the balance about right. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for explaining the Government's intentions. I have one or two remaining concerns, on which I hope that she will be able to reassure me so that I can withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I take it that no one currently in the system will be affected by the measure, and I also assume that there will be widespread and effective publicity for all those who will be affected by the new system. I also trust that the new system will not be introduced too speedily, so that people will be able to benefit from the information about the changes before they are implemented.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I can reassure the hon. Lady on all those points. There will be a transitional scheme, as there was for the changes in the social security tribunal system. Those people whose cases begin before the changes come into force will be subject to the old system; there will then be a transition into the new system. The regulations that will put these changes into effect will be laid before the House; there will be publicity about them and a chance to discuss them. Plenty of time will be allowed for us to work with the ex-service personnel organisations to ensure that the changes are understood and anticipated before they come into force.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> These amendments are part of a package that we have tabled to support people who feel vulnerable in the light of the proposed changes. They explore the reasons behind the reduction in the number of members of the appeals tribunal. I realise that the Government are trying to simplify and streamline the system, as they did with the social security system. However, there is a fundamental difference in the make-up of those appeal tribunals. Vulnerable people feel reassured if there is, for example, a member of the services of the same rank, or someone with a disability, on the tribunal. They then feel that their case is being properly heard by people who understand their problems. That is the reasoning behind the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Amendment No. 264 deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a service member and a person with a knowledge of disabilities.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That would add to the Bill provisions that are stipulated in the explanatory notes. Will the Minister explain why a provision that is in the explanatory notes cannot be put in the Bill? The amendment seems sensible and unrestrictive, and, as the hon. Member for Beckenham has said, its provisions would give comfort and reassurance that the people considering the appeals have relevant experience in the determination of these cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I hope that I can reassure hon. Members. There are many reasons behind the proposed changes; some are related to the sands of time. As the years go by, there are inevitable consequences for people's ability to continue to be available to perform some of those functions. Service members will remain as members of tribunals and there is no question about that. I cannot tell the Committee how many appeals have been delayed due to lack of service members, because no statistics are kept, but a problem is developing as service members reach an age at which their appointments can no longer be extended and there are other reasons for changes.
<P>
Currently, appeals are heard by a pensions appeal tribunal, which may comprise either a legal member, a medical member and a service member, or two medical members and a service member. The conditions for the service member are set out in existing legislation, but we are altering that to create more flexibility to cope with the work load. The Bill provides new appeal rights and every tribunal will be chaired by a legally qualified member to ensure that matters relevant to the appeal are considered, which is important, and that extraneous matters are not pursued at length. That is similar to your role, Sir David, in ensuring that we speak about the point at issue. That is crucial in an appeal.
<P>
The president will have the power to decide the composition of a tribunal which will be drawn from legal and medical members and others, and may include people with knowledge and experience of the services and of disabilities. There is a more flexible arrangement for the composition, and the Lord Chancellor will have that role. When appointing people, he must take account of their knowledge or experience of service in Her Majesty's forces and, as the years go by, of their knowledge or experience of matters relating to disabilities.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 264, 265 and 266 would reduce flexibility in making appointments to tribunals by narrowing the definition. We want to ensure that the legislation provides for appointments to be made when availability of service members is declining, which is a natural consequence of time. We do not intend to cease appointing service people to tribunals. I shall repeat that. We do not intend to cease appointing service people to tribunals. Their experience and insight is often invaluable, but, as the services have changed over the years, there has been increasing difficulty in appointing suitable people with service experience that is similar to that of the appellant.
<P>
We also recognise that tribunals should be composed of people with the appropriate skills, expertise and experience to decide the issues. The criteria for appointment should not be narrowly prescribed, but should allow the presidents to constitute tribunals that match the matters before them. Someone with knowledge of disability issues may be able to provide an insight into the level of disablement. Existing lay service members will remain on the panel, but we intend to broaden the scope for appointments so that tribunals can be composed of people with experience that the presidents consider appropriate for specific cases or types of case. The presidents may decide that a tribunal should include both categories of lay members and the clause does not prohibit that.
<P>
I do not accept that every appeal will require the same level of expertise: the circumstances of the case will decide the composition of the tribunal. In some cases the presence of a disability expert may be of limited value—for example, if the question is whether the person served in a unit of the United Kingdom forces. On the other hand, knowledge of service may be of limited value where all parties accept that the disablement is the result of the service and the question is the degree of disability.

<P>
Records were not perfect, particularly during the 1940s and 1950s. I have constituents who claim that they are nuclear veterans. There is not a shred of documentary evidence that they were ever in Australia. They tell me the boat they went out on—I think it would be called a ship; a boat is a submarine. One has only to visit the Public Record Office to see what used to happen. There would be bits of paper of different sizes, typed or handwritten, or typed on the back so that one misses it if one does not turn the paper over. Therefore, there are disputes about whether a person was in the services. The degree of disability may not be the issue, so a different kind of expertise is needed. Inevitably such cases still arise.
<P>
The inclusion of people who are not necessary to the process should be opposed. Despite people's best efforts, attending tribunals can be intimidating. We should allow the presidents the flexibility to ensure that the appropriate expertise is there. Again, I place on record that it is not our intention to remove service personnel from the tribunals. As long as we can find them and as long as they are available and meet the criteria for serving on the tribunals, we shall embrace their public-spiritedness in making that valuable contribution, but, as time goes on, a more flexible approach will be required.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> As the Minister's words are so reassuring, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 282, in page 51, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Deputy President of Pensions Appeal Tribunals for any part of the United Kingdom shall carry out such of the functions of the President for that part of the United Kingdom as that President assigns to him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 47 sets out the requirements in relation to the workings of the pensions appeal tribunals. It puts on a proper legislative footing the appointment of a president and the power to appoint a deputy president if the tribunals' work load warrants it, which is in line with the practice of other tribunals.
<P>
The legislation that we are amending is the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act 1943. The provision is simply a modernisation that represents the kind of process that happens in other tribunals. I hope that, with that explanation, hon. Members will accept the amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall be brief. The amendment, which is one of a group that we tabled, would ensure that we retain the knowledge of those currently involved in the system. I am sure that the Minister will be able to produce the same reassuring words as he did on the previous set of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am convinced that I can. Indeed, if I could not, the provision would not be there, because we have spent some time on this issue.
<P>
Because of the emotion and sensitivity aroused by this part of the Bill, we have ensured that we are comfortable with the changes. They have come through the system, which is right, because we are sending a signal to people outside. I want to say something about the background to the clause. We could then have a clause stand part debate, but the two debates could run together.
<P>
The Central Advisory Committee on War Pensions is designed to consider matters put before it by Ministers for advice. It is currently made up of 22 ex-service members: 12 are war pension committee chairmen and 10 are representatives of ex-service organisations.
<P>
The central advisory committee was established in 1921, when only a small proportion of war pensions committee chairmen were appointed to represent the views and interests of their colleagues. Some three decades ago, when the condition for appointing 12 war pensions committee representatives was set, 149 war pensions committee chairmen were in post. I regret to say that I have not checked that information, but I suspect that all of them were indeed men. Due to restructuring, the number of committees has reduced from 149 to 29, so a central advisory committee consisting of 12 representatives is disproportionate. Originally, a dozen war pensions committee chairmen represented one in 12 war pensions committees; currently, they represent one in three.
<P>
Moreover, war pensions committees are due to be reconstituted in January 2001. In December 1999, the central advisory committee endorsed the general principle that war pensions committees should continue to operate after 2001, and that the number of war pensions committees and the size of their membership should be reviewed. That review is under way, so it has yet to report, but it is possible that numbers may reduce further. It is against the background of this continuing climate of change that we must put in place a structure that will allow a fair and balanced representation of war pensions committee chairmen to serve on the central advisory committee.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 267 and 268 would prescribe a set, albeit small, number of appointments of chairmen to the central advisory committee, but they do not allow flexibility for future change. Our intention is purely to achieve flexibility while retaining a minimum requirement, and I can assure Committee members that we have no plans to reduce representation of war pensions committee chairmen to that minimum requirement. Indeed, I can offer the further assurance that, on the reconstitution of the war pensions committees during next January, we do not intend to reduce representation even to the three to which the amendment refers. The phrase ``at least one'' has been used because it can be clearly interpreted as nothing more ominous than a minimum requirement. Any other figure, including the figure to which the amendment refers, would not achieve that objective and might be interpreted as the desired number of representatives.
<P>
I am happy to repeat that point—[Laughter.]—but I think that I have made the right noises, and I hope that my answers to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Beckenham were not merely sympathetic but positive.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
