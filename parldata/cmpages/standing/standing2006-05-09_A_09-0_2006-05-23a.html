<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000402"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this

morning, Mr. O&#146;Hara. When we considered clause 54, the Paymaster

General was keen to say that she would be happy to examine any examples

of difficulties caused by these clauses to charities or institutions. I

have been given such an example, upon which amendment No. 92 hangs. I

shall put it to the Paymaster General to hear her

response.</div><a name="060523115000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause as drafted requires the primary purpose and non-primary purpose

of a charity to be divided into two separate traits. One might

reasonably infer from that division that the expenditure apportioned to

the non-primary purpose would be non-charitable expenditure. However,

the argument has been put to me that such expenditure might be for the

charity&#146;s benefit&#151;not simply for tax

avoidance&#151;without being exclusively for the charity&#146;s

purposes.</div><a name="060523115000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

come to the example. Let us suppose that a university college seeks to

mitigate losses on its primary purpose trade&#151;providing services

to students&#151;by undertaking catering and conferencing. Unless the

amendment is accepted, colleges in which catering and conferencing are

small-scale&#151;that is, colleges that do not trade through a

wholly-owned subsidiary&#151;and many smaller and less financially

sophisticated charities might find themselves at risk of challenge by a

tax inspector. I should be interested to hear the Paymaster

General&#146;s response to the

amendment.</div><a name="060523115000036"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000403"></a>The

Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> Good morning, Mr.

O&#146;Hara. The amendments would allow a charity to opt for the

rules that it wants to operate within. It was interesting that the hon.

Gentleman picked a university and mentioned the line between being a

business and having a charitable educational objective, because that

area of tax law is quite complex.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 294</div><a name="060523115000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s example, I do not know whether

it is a real or theoretical one. As he knows, the boundaries between

charitable and business objectives&#151;particularly in

universities&#151;and the issue of which set of rules therefore

applies are quite an interesting challenge already. I can give the hon.

Gentleman a straight answer on the Government&#146;s view. Allowing

businesses to opt, so that a charity could decide whether it is

charitable or partly charitable, would mean that a small number of

cases could be kept in. I am still not convinced. I think that he needs

to find another example that does not involve universities, because

that is a complex area of tax for lots of

reasons.</div><a name="060523115000038"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000404"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> Will the right hon. Lady give

way?</div><a name="060523115000039"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000405"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Just a minute. I will finish the first point

and then the hon. Gentleman can come back. The amendment would create a

hugely complex set of rules about when charities may or may not opt in

or out. It would do so for all charities and so would cause a problem

for all of them. That is what I seek to avoid. In earlier amendments

the hon. Gentleman probed by suggesting that it would be difficult if

there were extra record keeping, yet here he proposes that all

charities should face that. Therefore I am not attracted to the

amendments.</div>

<a name="060523115000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither

amendment fits very well with charity law and the definition that it

uses to permit charities to conduct limited non-primary purpose

changes. Not only is the hon. Gentleman adding more complexity in

amendment No. 92, but amendment No. 93 appears to be disadvantageous to

charities. While I appreciate his point about universities and the

complex relationship between their business and charitable status, I am

sure that they are not conducting the type of misuse of charities at

which the clause is targeted. Therefore I am still of the view that the

rules are entirely proportionate. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw

his amendment on that basis.</div>

<a name="060523115000041"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000406"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> We will have to come back to this and I shall

explain why. I understand why the Paymaster General does not like the

amendment. She understands that it is essentially a probing amendment

in relation to the example that I gave. She said that this was a

complex area and that I would have to find another example. But it was

precisely to establish what the clause will mean in relation to complex

areas such as universities that I tabled the amendment.</div>

<a name="060523115000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that the Paymaster

General did not address my example directly and say whether a

university in that situation would find itself unexpectedly open to

tax. She asked whether it was a real life example: it was given to me

by a university that was worried that carrying out some catering and

conference trading as a secondary objective would leave it open to tax.

The Paymaster General has not really addressed that point. I shall not

press the amendment to a vote because it was a probing amendment and a

very blunt instrument, but I give her notice that we need to return to

this matter in the light of what she has said and, more significantly,

what she has not said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060523115000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Primarolo:</b> May I place on the record my thanks to the Law

Society? Members of the Committee will have noticed in the briefing on

the Bill that it has suggested that the clause would have some

unintended effects. It would prevent a company from benefiting from

gift aid where a charity owned shares in it. That is not the intention

and I am happy to move these amendments to clarify that point. I hope

that the Committee will therefore accept

them.</div><a name="060523115000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060523115000410"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I shall make

two brief points. I am grateful to the Paymaster General for her

comments on the Law Society. In the Committee of the whole House on

another topic she was a little dismissive of law firms and professional

advisers and questioned whether such advisers would know more than

Treasury officials. In this case, it has emerged that they

do.</div><a name="060523115000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

should declare an interest: the Law Society&#146;s recommendations

and comments were produced by the law firm Travis Smith. The lawyer who

noticed the error in the drafting of the Bill was one Mrs. Rachel

Gauke, who is my wife. I wish to place on the record the fact that

during the Committee stage, one member of the Gauke family has managed

to persuade the Government to change the

Bill.</div><a name="060523115000050"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000411"></a>Dawn

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000414"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I shall pass over that interjection, in case it

finds its way into <i class="I">Hansard</i>, which I fear it has. I do not know

whether the Paymaster General was suggesting that the amendment would

be illegal, but I can understand her impatience as I am about to tax

her again with one of the examples that I have a way of raising. I hope

that she will address it more directly than she did the previous

example.</div><a name="060523115000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

will extend restrictions on gift aid payments by close companies to

non-close companies. The argument has been put to me that it is likely

to hurt charities that run substantial corporate benefactor schemes and

that the maximum benefit of &#163;250 is minimal and will discourage

companies from entering into such schemes. An example was given to me

by, needless to say, the Charities&#146; Tax Reform Group. Let us

suppose that the National Trust were trying to raise &#163;500,000 to

repair a property and a corporate benefactor agreed to donate

&#163;250,000. The National Trust might begin to raise the rest by

holding a fundraising dinner, selling tickets at &#163;100 a head.

The corporate benefactor might be given a free table in recognition of

its generosity and to encourage other substantial contributions. If the

benefit to the benefactor exceeded &#163;250, the charity would lose

gift aid on the whole &#163;250,000 donation. The argument put to me

was that if the Government are unwilling to delete clause 58, at the

very least the upper limit should be raised from &#163;250 to

&#163;2,500 to allow charities to devise effective corporate

benefactor schemes and to encourage companies to be generous in

entering

them.</div><a name="060523115000352"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000415"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b><b class="B"> </b>Company gift aid is a tax relief

specifically designed for gifts to charities, not for payments that

convey potential, substantial benefits on the donor company and those

running it. In the Government&#146;s view, the existing benefit

limits are sufficient for charities to express their gratitude for a

donation. We are talking about the benefits conveyed to the donor

company by the charity when it says thank you for a donation. I say to

the hon. Gentleman that there is no evidence to suggest that ensuring

that donations to charities benefit principally the charity and not the

giver&#151;that is precisely what the clauses before us will

do&#151;will harm corporate giving.</div>

<a name="060523115000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">A balance needs to be struck

to ensure that companies do not benefit if they make a payment to

charity with the aim of benefiting principally themselves and not the

charity. The limit is there to prevent the glorious events that are

designed to benefit those attending, but have little charitable

benefit. That goes to the heart of the purpose of gift aid. I hope

therefore that, given the narrow focus of the limit, the hon. Gentleman

will accept that it is appropriate.</div>

<a name="060523115000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the Committee that

this series of clauses will deal with the misuse of charitable status

by those who would put pressure on charities, or use them in order to

benefit themselves, but not the charity. I want to reinforce that

point. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that explanation of

why amendment No. 95 is unattractive and why I do not want the

Committee to pursue it.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 297</div><a name="060523115000061"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000416"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> In short, the Paymaster General argued that the

Treasury accepts the principle of a limit because charities might

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): The Government

introduced the regime to change the way in which company cars are taxed

several years ago. I think that I am right in saying that the majority

of new cars bought in the United Kingdom are still company cars. The

Government have had huge success with the regime. It has really changed

the way in which company cars are bought, and the CO<span class="Sub">2</span>

emissions of the company car fleet have been falling year on year in

contrast to the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions of private average cars, which

have been increasing in the past couple of

years.</div><a name="060523115000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would probably term what I am

about to say as an early bid for next year. I welcome the proposals

under clause 59 at the lower end of the scale so that, when the 3 per

cent. diesel supplement is dropped, some cars will drop to a 10 per

cent. valuation for company car tax purposes. However, having had such

success with changing buying plans for company cars in recent years,

the Government have missed a major opportunity by not greatly

increasing the figure at the upper end of the scale. I urge my hon.

Friend to take such action next year.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 298</div><a name="060523115000098"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000446"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> The hon. Gentleman was certainly right about the

lower end of the scale. Will the Financial Secretary comment on the

remarks of Stewart Whyte, the director of the Association of Car Fleet

Operators, about the clause? He

said:</div><a name="060523115000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Generally,

it is a broadly neutral budget for the fleet industry with no major

changes. However, the further tightening of company car tax in 2008-09

is a minor disappointment. It is clear that vehicle manufacturers are

having some difficulty in driving through the technological changes

that will see a significant rise in the number of very low

CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-emitting cars on

sale.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We certainly

explored that issue in the debate on vehicle excise duty. He went

on:</div><a name="060523115000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We hope

that all parties will work together to ensure that the typical car

becomes much more fuel- and CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-efficient&#151;and

therefore tax-efficient&#151;so that the impact on drivers of the tax

change is neutral. We cannot have a company car tax system which takes

no account of the technical realities of the vehicles available and, as

a result, penalises company car drivers through no fault of their

own.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000100"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000447"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> Clause

59 is a further step in the reforms that we put in place in 2002 to

base the company car tax system on carbon dioxide emissions as a

contribution to meeting the challenge of climate change. My hon. Friend

the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is right to say

that it has been a success. Our first stage evaluation demonstrated

that the average emissions of company cars in 2004 were some 15 g per

kilometre lower than they would have been had we not put the reforms in

place. On his point about top rates, he is nothing if not consistent.

He made the same point in relation to top rates of vehicle excise duty

in earlier discussions on the Bill. He is right that I will not accept

the argument at this stage in the debate on this clause, but I will

take it as an early Budget representation for 2007.</div>

<a name="060523115000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are making two changes to

reinforce the environmental effect of the company car tax regime.

First, the clause reduces the level of carbon dioxide emission

qualifying for the lower threshold by 5 g per kilometre to 135 g per

kilometre from 6 April 2008. That will provide a continuing incentive

for company car drivers and their employers to choose more

fuel-efficient cars. It will also encourage manufacturers to produce

cars with lower carbon dioxide emissions.</div>

<a name="060523115000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wycombe

(Mr. Goodman), is right to quote Stewart Whyte, and Mr. Whyte was right

to say that the measure is broadly neutral for the industry. It is also

neutral for the Exchequer. We do not anticipate an impact on revenues

from the company car tax regime when the changes come in in 2008-09. If

the hon. Member for Wycombe has discussed it with him, Mr. Whyte will

also have pointed out that the industry was expecting the Government to

move in this direction. We have been discussing it for some time, and

did so again in the run-up to the Budget. The point about setting the

rates three years in advance is that that is not just advantageous for

companies that make cars available to their employees for private use;

it is also a useful long-term signal for car designers and

manufacturers about the policy direction of the Government.</div>

<a name="060523115000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause&#146;s second incentive for company car drivers and their

employers to choose more fuel-efficient vehicles is the introduction of

a new 10 per cent. rate for company 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 299</div>cars with carbon dioxide emissions of 120 g per kilometre or below.

Setting the levels now for 2008-09 gives drivers a degree of certainty

about how much their company cars will cost them for the next three

years. Because company cars are typically held for three or four years,

setting the threshold for that period in this Finance Bill enables

businesses to plan ahead sensibly for their car fleets and company car

drivers to calculate the full cost of company cars that will be

reviewed in the next three years. On that basis, I hope that the

Committee will accept the clause.</div>

Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): May I, too, welcome you to

the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara? The most controversial part of chapter 5

of the Bill, which deals with personal taxation, is undoubtedly clause

61, which paves the way for the abolition of the popular home computing

initiative, a decision that is still very much to be regretted, but

that we dealt with in some detail in the Committee of the whole House.

Clause 60 is an associated though less immediately controversial issue.

Essentially, it seeks to limit to one phone any tax reallocation of

mobile phone use by an employer to an employee. It was covered by the

same regulatory impact assessment as clause 61, to which I shall refer

shortly.</div>

<a name="060523115000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

am</div><a name="060523115000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two

areas in which it would be helpful to have clarification from the

Paymaster General on the intended operation of the clause.</div>

<a name="060523115000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">To begin with, there appears

to be a residual ambiguity as to the permitted degree of personal

use&#151;if any&#151;of the one mobile phone to which the clause

refers, and on the tax implications, because there are differences

between what is said in the Bill and the explanatory notes on the one

hand and in the subsequent regulatory impact assessment on the other.

</div><a name="060523115000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 61, the

Government now say that people who are provided by their employer with

a computer at home for business purposes will not be taxed on that

computer as a benefit in kind, provided that any personal use of it is

not significant. After debate, the Paymaster General offered to consult

employers to define the term &#147;not significant,&#148; and I

understand that that work is ongoing. However, I should like to know

the parallel position under clause 60 in relation to mobile phones that

are provided for business

purposes.</div><a name="060523115000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

explanatory notes initially implied that there was to be no attempt to

regulate the extent of such private use for the purposes of identifying

a taxable benefit in kind. Paragraph 1 of the notes states, fairly

clearly:</div><a name="060523115000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

clause replaces the exemption for employer provided mobile telephones

in section 319 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. It provides

that no tax will be due when employers make only one mobile telephone

available for private use and removes the availability to family or

household tax-free.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 300</div><a name="060523115000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 16 of the notes then

says:</div><a name="060523115000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

clause re-focuses the relief provided by the exemption, keeping

administrative burdens for employers to a minimum where a mobile

telephone is provided for business use and private use is also

made.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, when

one looks at the clause, one sees that new section 319(1) to be

inserted in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003

says:</div><a name="060523115000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No

liability to income tax arises by virtue of section 62 (general

definition of earnings) or Chapter 10 of Part 3 (taxable benefits:

residual liability to charge) in respect of the provision of one mobile

telephone for an employee without any transfer of property in

it.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far,

so good. However, the associated regulatory impact assessment, which

was signed by the Paymaster General on 24 April&#151;a fortnight or

so after the changes made by clause 60 came into effect&#151;observes

that there are now some 50 million mobile phones in use in the United

Kingdom. That is a very large number. The RIA does not attempt to break

it down into phones provided primarily for business purposes and those

that are for personal purposes, but at paragraph 41 it

states:</div><a name="060523115000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Employers

will still be able to benefit from the deregulatory objectives behind

the mobile phone exemption when only one mobile telephone is made

available for private use or where a mobile phone is provided for

business purposes and there is insignificant private

use.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, paragraph

23 of the RIA, entitled &#147;Implementation and Delivery

Issues,&#148; states more

explicitly:</div><a name="060523115000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where

additional mobile phones are made available for private use or where

private use of a business mobile phone is significant it will be liable

to a tax charge and Class 1A National Insurance in the same way as any

other benefit in

kind.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">So a

literal reading of the RIA implies that there could be a benefit in

kind in certain circumstances of provision of an individual mobile

phone. If that were the case, employers might be expected to define for

taxation purposes the amount of personal use of that mobile phone, even

if they had provided only that one mobile phone to their employee.

There might be a considerable compliance burden for companies that

sought legitimately to remain on the right side of the line. The

regulatory impact assessment acknowledges the potential compliance

burden at paragraph 54:</div>

<a name="060523115000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Compliance costs would

arise from employers having to report to HMRC the benefits in kind that

would be subject to tax and Class 1A NICs under these proposals, the

potential need for records to be kept and the implementation of extra

coding notices for

employees.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The length

of that process might be considerable. For example, if a mobile phone

were provided primarily for business use, employees and employers might

have to spend hours trawling through mobile phone bills to identify

incidental private use and establish whether it was significant. That

decision would in itself be subjective, and it might lead to

unnecessary disputes between employers and employees, and then, indeed,

employers and HM Revenue and Customs.</div>

<a name="060523115000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, as is often the case in

this day and age, the employer paid a fixed monthly amount and call

charges were free up to a certain limit, how would

&#147;significant&#148; be determined? How should the employee

quantify the additional cost to reimburse his or her employer in order

to avoid a tax charge? Put another way, assuming that the employee does

not or cannot 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 301</div>identify the cost of private calls, how should the employer compute the

taxable amount in order to remain on the right side of the

line?</div> <a name="060523115000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute

of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales considered the issue, and

it made the following point about this clause:</div>

<a name="060523115000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If significant private

use of mobile telephones is to be taxable once again, we suggest that

there should be a flat rate charge, as was the case before it was

abolished from 6 April 1999. This proposal will avoid the need for

complex benefit calculations resulting from the availability of a wide

variety of payment

plans.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

clarification, will the Paymaster General confirm exactly how the new

regime is intended to operate? Specifically, will there be a tax charge

for a benefit in kind even on one employer-provided mobile phone if the

private use of such a phone is deemed significant? Can we expect new

guidelines to define insignificant as opposed to significant personal

use? We will be given guidelines in relation to home computers, for

instance, and paragraph 73 of the regulatory impact assessment implies

that guidelines will apply to both.</div>

<a name="060523115000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are going to receive

guidelines relating to mobile phones, when are they likely to be made

available, given that the measure is already supposed to be in force?

Who will be involved in drawing up such guidelines, and what

consultation, if any, will take place? There appears to be a dichotomy,

so will the Paymaster General clarify the issue for the Committee

before we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill?</div>

<a name="060523115000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an

associated point that requires clarification. It concerns BlackBerrys.

They are becoming increasingly common in business&#151;and in this

place, too. I thought that in making this point, I had best declare a

personal interest, if only for safety&#146;s sake. In a post-Budget

note on employer-provided mobile telephones, Deloitte and Touche called

for clarification of the status of BlackBerrys, as did KPMG. In

addition, in a recent tax alert note on the subject, Ernst and Young

pointed out the following:</div>

<a name="060523115000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No guidance has been

given from HM Revenue and Customs to employers about how to determine

whether a device&#146;s primary purpose is a mobile phone or whether

the mobile phone capability should be considered a secondary

feature.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

(4) of proposed new section 319 defines a mobile telephone as

&#147;telephone apparatus&#148;, which means,</div>

<a name="060523115000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wireless telegraphy apparatus

designed or adapted for the primary purpose of transmitting and

receiving spoken messages and used in connection with a public

electronic communications

service.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

key phrase is &#147;primary purpose&#148;. BlackBerrys usually also

encompass a mobile telephone capability. However, arguably, they are

not designed primarily for that purpose. Therefore, they appear to be

in a grey area as they can also be used for transmitting messages such

as e-mail and for obtaining information from the internet. The more

modern BlackBerrys allow us to surf the world wide

web.</div>

<a name="060523115000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060523115000449"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I must confess to having

an interest. Although I do not own a BlackBerry, I own a Palm Treo,

which has the same impact as a BlackBerry. My hon. Friend makes an

excellent point about non-verbal communication. What may be helpful is

the fact that all my bills, and I believe all of his, when they are

telephonic are itemised. Therefore, any tax 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 302</div>inspector of the Revenue can see clearly what is for business and what

is for personal use. Perhaps we should be considering that as well,

because those devices are for both written and verbal

Francois:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that

intervention, which serves to amplify my point. BlackBerrys have a

multi-functionality. The question for tax purposes is, which

functionality will be taxed in that instance? Will the Paymaster

General confirm whether the clause will define BlackBerrys as computers

rather than mobile phones? If so, it would presumably be possible to

have one of each without incurring an additional tax charge as a

benefit in kind. Following the associated changes to clause 61, that is

assuming that any personal use of the BlackBerry, if it were a

computer, is deemed not to be

significant.</div><a name="060523115000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">To clear

up the ambiguity, can the Paymaster General clarify exactly how clause

employer-provided mobile phone? If so, what are they? Can the right

hon. Lady say how BlackBerrys are to be categorised for the purposes of

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I wish to ask the

Paymaster General to clarify one matter. I am sure that she will easily

be able to answer my question. Under the old system, multiple mobile

phones could be provided by the employer without incurring tax

liability. If replacement multiple phones are provided now by an

employer, will they come under the old regime or will they be caught by

the new

regime?</div><a name="060523115000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000452"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I am in some difficulty in answering the

questions that I have been asked because most of them have nothing to

do with clause 60. I shall deal first with that clause. I shall then

take your guidance, Mr. O&#146;Hara, on the other

points.</div><a name="060523115000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause

60 replaces the tax exemption that prior to6 April enabled an

employer to make available a mobile phone for private use. Business use

is separate. It is in a different part of the tax Acts and is not

affected by the clause. The mobile phone is for private use of the

employee and, as it turns out, members of the employee&#146;s family

and household. The clause will give exemption to one mobile phone per

employee for private use. There is no need for significant private use,

business use and so on. The mobile phone is for private use and always

was.</div><a name="060523115000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

am</div><a name="060523115000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause limits the tax exemption so that only one mobile phone can be

made available to each employee tax free, but it excludes the

employee&#146;s family and household. The clause also makes it easier

for employers to provide that mobile phone, as prior to 6 April, a tax

charge arose on the provision of a non-cash voucher or credit token to

make mobile phones available for private use. They were often used by

smaller employers who found it easier to give employees credit tokens

to go to a mobile phone shop and buy the relevant phone. The 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div>clause has nothing to do with requirements in respect of business and

business use, which are quite

different.</div><a name="060523115000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) asked one other relevant

question, about BlackBerrys and personal digital assistants. Last year,

sustained lobbying from the home computer initiative providers and

accountants persuaded the HMRC that the functions of the new generation

of PDAs and BlackBerrys made it more appropriate to include them in the

exemption under computer equipment. Therefore, they are not covered by

the

clause.</div><a name="060523115000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Gentleman raised the matter of a commitment to upgrading mobile

phones every 18 months or where there is an interaction with the

Consumer Credit Acts and arrangements should have been made on transfer

at the time. If an employer and an employee have entered into a salary

sacrifice arrangement that entitles the employee to the private use of

a mobile phone&#151;I am talking about private use only&#151;and

extends for more than 18 months, the agreement is covered by the

consumer credit legislation. Guidance has already been given and if

employers found themselves in difficulty, the HMRC would take that into

consideration and so would the Office of Fair Trading.</div>

<a name="060523115000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is

always discussion about which side of 6 April the arrangement

was entered into. The employer will have to show the HMRC that, prior

to 6 April 2006, it was in the process of setting up a scheme that

involved making mobile phones available to its employees for private

use, and the arrangement would then roll forward; it is quite a well

used measure. My advice is that in each case if there is a renewal or

if arrangements have been entered into but have not quite been

completed, they will be covered as long as the employer can demonstrate

that to the HMRC.</div>

<a name="060523115000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The questions about

significant private use and business use are not relevant to the

clause, but I can answer them briefly if you think it would be helpful,

Mr. O&#146;Hara. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in respect of

business mobile phones, where an employer makes more than one mobile

phone available&#151;for example, if an employee is travelling and

goes into different world tariff zones, it is easier to have more than

mobile phone&#151;there is a rule, which has been in force since

before 1999, that where there was significant private use, or where the

private use was insignificant but the phone was given for business

purposes, the private use would not be counted and would not be taxed.

As a result of changes to clause 61, there have been requests for a

restatement in guidance of what was operational before.</div>

<a name="060523115000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discussions

are taking place between the HMRC and a number of different

organisations such as the CBI, the Institute of Chartered Accountants

in England and Wales and the Chartered Institute of Taxation. That will

lead to published guidance so that there is no doubt about the

provision of business phones for private use. The provision of a

private phone, tax free, simply for private use was supposed to help

employers with the divide between business and private use. This

provision is about a mobile phone given to an employee for private use

tax free and the clause simply restricts it to one phone per employee

instead of the entire family. That is entirely

appropriate.</div><a name="060523115000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000453"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that

clarification. There appears to have been some 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 304</div>confusion, including among some professional accounting firms, about

what the Government were trying to do. The whole purpose of going

through the Bill clause by clause is to clarify those matters. I am

glad that we have had an opportunity to do that this

morning.</div>

<a name="060523115000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

want to transgress the border between clauses 60 and 61, but as the

Paymaster General referred to the guidelines on the definition of

clause 61, which will affect the definition of significant personal use

of a business mobile phone&#151;I understand the distinction that she

made&#151;could I with your indulgence, Mr. O&#146;Hara, ask her to

give us some idea of when she believes those discussions will be

complete and when those guidelines will be made available? All members

of the Committee would be interested in an approximate timing if she

can provide that before we move on to the next

clause.</div><a name="060523115000139"></a>

time to look at the guidance before it is issued. There is always a

difficult balance to strike here. If people want to comment on the

draft they will have to do so speedily because it is intended that the

when I spoke earlier, Mr.

O&#146;Hara.</div><a name="060523115000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will

my right hon. Friend explain a technical drafting matter? We have had

debates on mobile phones and, under clause 62, we did not have the

debate on eye test vouchers. Why are those matters in primary

legislation whereas, in clause 63, vouchers for benefits in kind are to

be covered by Treasury regulations? In one case, we are using primary

legislation and, in the other, we are broadening the net by requiring

regulations under proposed new subsection 96A of the Income Tax

(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, as set out in clause 63. What was the

guiding principle on the

matter?</div><a name="060523115000146"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000456"></a>Dawn

employment related, which I am sure that no hon. Member would dispute.

When we examined the issue of eye tests and corrective glasses for VDU

users, it became clear that it was more sensible to have a

regulation-making power to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div>enable their provision. That will give us the opportunity to respond far

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000457"></a>Mr.

clause. In doing so, I declare for completeness an interest as a member

of the Conservative Friends of

Israel.</div><a name="060523115000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

exempts from tax payments by UK and foreign banks and building

societies to holocaust victims and to their heirs for dormant accounts.

The issue is sensitive and I do not think that it needs to be rehearsed

at length here. It seems that the consultations on it have been

successful, and we welcome the

clause.</div><a name="060523115000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060523115000458"></a><b class="B">Ms

Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): May I say to my right hon.

Friend that the clause is very welcome in Hove and Portslade where

there is a large Jewish population, many of whom moved here in the

1930s and 1940s or are the children of the people who did so. Many

local families fled central Europe, and some of them still remember the

horrors.</div>

<a name="060523115000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

reassuring that the clause was drafted after negotiations with the

Association of Jewish Refugees. I realise that the provision already

existed as an extra-statutory concession, but enshrining it in law will

give victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs the security of

knowing that their family money can be retrieved without loss. That is

why I support the clause

wholeheartedly.</div><a name="060523115000154"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000459"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I join my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh in

welcoming the clause. We do not often congratulate the Paymaster

General on her written ministerial statements, but it was heartening to

see the intention that she expressed on 19 July last year carried into

effect in the

Bill.</div><a name="060523115000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The numbers

involved are small, both in terms of the assets involved and the people

who stand to receive them. <i class="I">The Times</i> estimates that since 1998

claimants in the UK have shared nearly &#163;7.5 million from the

Claims Resolution Tribunal, which handles claims on deposits in dormant

Swiss accounts. The average award has been approximately

&#163;74,000. <i class="I">The Guardian</i> is, unfortunately, a little more

parsimonious, stating that the Government estimate that those affected

in the UK are owed an average of &#163;31,000 and that around 1,000

people will benefit from the clause. The Exchequer cost is also minimal

if we accept the Government&#146;s estimate of between &#163;5

million and &#163;10 million.</div>

<a name="060523115000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

principle of the clause is important. Payments under Restore UK to

those who are eligible should be indistinguishable from compensation

under comparable international schemes such as the Claims Resolution 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 306</div>Tribunal. That has not been the case under the existing extra-statutory

concession, which in applying only to the domestic scheme has

introduced an unwanted distortion into the taxation of compensation

payments.</div><a name="060523115000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

am</div><a name="060523115000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">David

Rothenberg, treasurer and vice-chairman of the Association of Jewish

Refugees, has responded positively to the proposals and the thorough

consultation that preceded them. He

said:</div><a name="060523115000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are

delighted that the Government has responded positively to our request

to introduce this important extension to Holocaust victims and their

families of the concessions which applied to compensation from British

banks so that the families of Holocaust victims will receive the full

benefit from their compensation

awards.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

also welcome the fact that the tax exemption will be given a statutory

footing rather than being couched as an extra-statutory concession. It

is important that the tax exemption should carry the weight of

parliamentary approval rather than bearing the stigma of being

perceived as a Revenue fiddle. HMRC describes extra-statutory

concessions as necessary</div>

<a name="060523115000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when strict application of the

law would create a disadvantage, or the effect would not be the one

intended.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

would argue the toss whether a simple and equitable tax system should

need such concessions to unintended consequences, but there is a

consensus that the exemption of compensation payments from taxation is

morally right. That being so, I think that we would all agree that a

clause in the Finance Bill dedicated to that purpose is preferable to

the Revenue backhander that has persisted for the past six

years.</div><a name="060523115000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is good to see the Government taking a clear lead on the issue, and I

congratulate them. Elsewhere in Europe, those who suffered from

national socialist persecution still face an uphill battle to receive

the compensation to which they are justly entitled. For example, the

Austrian general settlement fund, a&#163;210 million

compensation fund created in 2001, is still experiencing problems

administering claims. As of last November, not a single claim had been

paid out. For once, the Government are in a position to lead by

example. Let us hope that other countries catch

on.</div><a name="060523115000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000461"></a>John

Healey:</b> Clauses 65 to 68 deal with the status of

activities relating to the Olympics. As part of London&#146;s bid for

the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympics, the Government gave an

undertaking to introduce the necessary legislation to exempt the London

Organising Committee of the Olympic Games from corporation tax. Clauses

67 and 68 would do the same for the International Olympic Committee and

for non-UK resident competitors and support staff. That is a recent

innovation by the IOC, and all bid cities were required to give such

tax undertakings.</div>

<a name="060523115000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 65

and the supplementary provisions in its sister clause 66 will provide

the exemptions required for the London organising committee as well as

powers to enable that exemption, where appropriate, to be extended or

restricted as the committee&#146;s plans and arrangements for

delivering the Olympics in 2012 become

clear.</div><a name="060523115000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an

essential part of a major event, not just for London, but the country,

and to which I think that we are all looking forward. The exemptions

are important also so that the committee can deliver the best ever

Olympics, and do so in

London.</div><a name="060523115000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060523115000462"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I welcome you,

Mr. O&#146;Hara, to the Chair. I shall speak briefly to clause 65,

and not trouble the Committee by referring to the clauses linked to it.

I shall take this opportunity also to put on the record my

congratulations to the London bid team for its remarkable achievement

in bidding successfully for the 2012 games. Given, as we have heard,

that the provisions in the clauses were a requirement for the bid to

have been made, there is no question but that the Government should

honour the undertakings made in it.</div>

<a name="060523115000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Financial Secretary

tell us whether the clauses are expected to cost a significant amount?

One would not necessarily expect the London organising committee or the

IOC to raise significant revenue, but it would be useful to hear any

information that he might have on

that.</div><a name="060523115000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will

the Minister comment also on the points raised by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants about whether the model for the exemption could

be useful for charities as well? A number of complications with

charities in general might make the model inapplicable, but I thought

that it was a constructive idea from the institute, and I would welcome

his thoughts on the

matter.</div><a name="060523115000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

realise that it is not strictly related to the clause, but may I urge

the Treasury to keep a watchful eye on the overall cost of the

Olympics? I have raised that point with the Financial Secretary on the

Floor of the House; it is of particular concern to my constituents in

Chipping Barnet, who are London council tax payers who will pick up the

bill for cost overruns, along with the

lottery.</div><a name="060523115000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

budget for the London organising committee has increased already from

&#163;1.46 billion, envisaged last year when the London Olympics Bill

went through the House, to around &#163;2 billion, as confirmed by

the Minister for Sport in Westminster Hall last week. He indicated that

the increase was due to inflation, presumably over the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 308</div>period until the games in 2012. However, that increase would put

inflation at 33 per cent. over that 6-year

period.</div><a name="060523115000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,

the heightened security needed following events on 7 July must surely

have an impact on the overall cost of the games and could presumably

drive it up further. I believe that the funding package on security is

about &#163;220 million, which was set before the 7 July attacks. The

Government have said plainly that they will not meet the cost of

overruns and that those must be shared by the lottery and London

council tax payers. However, the Minister must be aware that if the

games go badly over budget, there will be pressure on the Government to

step in. For the sake of London council tax payers and to guard against

future demands on the Exchequer, I urge the Government to do all that

they can to ensure that the highest standards of procurement are

applied to Olympic projects so as to avoid the cost overruns that have

dogged many previous

games.</div><a name="060523115000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">If Olympic

construction projects are late, we cannot just shift events to Cardiff,

as we can the FA cup. I hope that we can learn lessons from Wembley and

public procurement disasters such as the Scottish Parliament. I am told

that the residents of Montreal are still paying for the games that it

held over 30 years ago. Sydney&#146;s budget was &#163;1 billion,

but its games ended up costing &#163;2.8 billion, I believe. The

Athens Olympics overran massively, with costs spiralling from &#163;1

billion to &#163;5 billion, much of which was due to security

considerations, which of course will be more significant in London. I

appeal to the Ministers here, as representatives of the Treasury and

guardians of the public purse, to ensure that that sort of overrun does

not happen in 2012.</div>

<a name="060523115000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060523115000463"></a><b class="B">Ms

However, I seek clarification of paragraph 13 of the explanatory note

to the clause, which states that</div>

<a name="060523115000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The International

Olympic Committee included a requirement in the bid process for the

2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games that tax in the host country

should not have a significant impact on the Games. As a result of the

tax exemptions, including: LOCOG would be exempt from corporation tax;

Withholding tax would not be levied on royalties, and other annual

payments made to

LOCOG.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to

games will be held not only in London but in other parts of the

We need to ensure that the games are embraced by all the people of the

United Kingdom, so these clauses must not be thought of as enabling the

Government to provide subsidies for the capital from those who live

outside London.</div> <a name="060523115000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will

my hon. Friend clarify that the tax relief that is rightly to be given

to those concerned with the Olympics, and which was part of the London

bid, will apply also to providers situated outside London, such as

sports venues in my area?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000464"></a>John

Healey:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)

makes some important points about the role of the Olympics and their

potential benefit not just for London but for the whole country. The

body is, of course, the London organising committee but, as she rightly

says, the games are for the whole UK and they must&#151;and I hope

will&#151;be embraced by the whole UK. I wish Brighton and Hove all

the best in its bid to host some of the teams that will be competing in

the Olympics and Paralympics. Rotherham in South Yorkshire is hoping to

do the same&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]&#151;</i>and

Bristol, too, the Paymaster General informs me. Clearly, there is a lot

of interest across the UK in the prospect of the Olympics. The

associated activities will reach well beyond the Greater London area,

and the organising committee is well aware of that.</div>

<a name="060523115000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the comments of the hon.

Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers), it is difficult to estimate

the tax cost in terms of potential revenue forgone. Secondly, the

potential yield has not been factored in to the forecasts because if we

had not won the bid for the games, there would be no potential tax

yield from Olympic-associated activities. Without the exemptions that

we are considering, the bid would not have been successful; they were a

requirement of the bid application. On the more general costs, the hon.

Lady is right. I can assure her that the Treasury will keep a close eye

both on the general costs that concern her and on the standards of

procurement throughout the run-up to 2012. I have no doubt that the

Opposition will help with the scrutiny of the costs and the standards

of procurement, as will the National Audit Office and Parliament as a

whole.</div> <a name="060523115000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two

points about provision for charities. First, LOCOG is not a charity, so

it does not benefit from the wide range of tax exemptions available to

charities. Secondly, we need to appreciate the unique nature of the

Olympic event. That is why we are putting in place unique tax

arrangements. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country such

as ours to host the games. To that extent, our provisions for the

Olympics cannot be generalised to other events, nor are they

appropriate for charities generally. I hope that on that basis, the

Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div>

supposition that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr.

Breed) makes. The current tax system for non-UK resident performers

includes income earned in the UK from a range of activities. In the

case of a sports star, for example, it may include the winnings in a

tournament and media earnings from associated appearances. The

provision is designed for the specific purpose of making a special

time-limited exemption on such earnings for individual competitors,

performers and support staff directly related to the delivery of the

Olympics. That is the basis of the proposal, and I stress its

time-limited nature.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000467"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000468"></a>John

Healey:</b> No, it will be a longer period than that. The IOC

suggested in the host-city contract that we consider a period of 120

days leading up to the opening ceremony, and an additional 60 days

after the closing ceremony. We will work through the detail. The clause

contains the power to make such requirements in regulation, which is

obviously more appropriate than making them in the Bill. Nevertheless,

that is the period we are considering: several weeks around the Olympic

games and the Paralympic games proper.</div>

Auckland (Helen Goodman) missed it, but when we started talking about

this group of clauses at the outset, I explained that as an innovation,

the IOC required of any bid city its preparedness to make tax

arrangements to ensure that the successful city&#146;s delivery of

the Olympics was not affected by tax. Therefore, clauses 65 to 67

include a range of organisations&#151;not only the London Organising

Committee but the International Olympic Committee&#151;and clause 68

covers the competitors and support staff.</div>

<a name="060523115000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The short

answer is that the IOC wanted and required the provision as part of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000473"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> We turn from the breathless excitement of the

Olympics to the somewhat more arid territory of anti-avoidance clauses.

<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am certain that they will not fail to engage

the attention of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. Judging

from the noises coming from the back, I think that his party hopes that

they will engage his attention more favourably than the clauses on the

Olympics.</div><a name="060523115000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 69

is a brief but important clause. It is essentially a mini general

anti-avoidance clause relating particularly to disclosure, and it takes

us deep into tax planning and what advisers should and should not

disclose to HMRC. It will establish an anti-avoidance rule disallowing

any capital losses to companies arising from arrangements whose main

purpose is a tax advantage. It is an extension of previous disclosure

rules introduced, as the Paymaster General will tell us in due course,

in the Finance Act 2004.</div>

<a name="060523115000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is one of balance

and fairness. Obviously, we deplore the exploitation of different tax

rates in order to abuse them. In the Government&#146;s favour, it is

perhaps worth knowing that Deloitte welcomes the revised

clauses:</div> <a name="060523115000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

amendments set out in the revised legislation and HMRC guidance notes

provide welcome clarification in certain areas and also amend some of

the unintended consequences of the proposed new

legislation.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;there

is always a &#147;however&#148;&#151;one of the difficulties is

that the Government have doubled the size of UK tax legislation in

eight years. By doing so, they have created more opportunities for

avoidance and more gaps that must be plugged, creating in turn yet more

opportunities for avoidance. It is worth testing with amendments the

complexity and uncertainty of the system, and whether the changes will

increase or reduce that complexity and

uncertainty.</div><a name="060523115000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 103 and 104 are essentially probing amendments, although amendment

No. 105, which relates to the imposition of a

possiblepre-clearance regime, is rather less probing. I shall

be interested to hear what the Paymaster General has to say about that.

We want to hear her response before deciding whether to press the

amendments to a

vote.</div><a name="060523115000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

103 would introduce two further additions to section 8(2) of the

Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which the clause will add to and

amend. The first part of the amendment seeks to remove capital loss

planning from the proposed disclosure rules. The argument runs that if

an allowable loss can be used only where obtaining a tax advantage is

not the main purpose for creating that tax loss, it is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>unreasonable for the Government to impose a disclosure regime to prevent

the utilisation of such losses, which by their nature must be real

economic losses and not paper losses. The amendment would remove

capital loss planning from the scope of the disclosure rules by

excluding it from the relevant definitions in the statute that

introduced those

rules.</div><a name="060523115000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second

part of the amendment deliberately echoes the wording of the statutory

instrument that, from 1 July 2006, will put into effect key changes to

the disclosure rules. HMRC&#146;s old regime required that a scheme

should be disclosed if it could warrant a premium fee, or if it were

confidential in the sense that the tax adviser would not want the idea

to be known to the wider tax community. The new regime goes wider: it

requires confidentiality in the sense that the adviser would not want

the scheme to be known to HMRC.</div>

<a name="060523115000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statutory instrument

requires the promoter&#151;the lawyer, accountant or bank&#151;to

disclose the scheme

if</div><a name="060523115000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(i)

it might reasonably be expected that a promoter would wish

the way in which an element of those arrangements secures a tax

advantage not to be disclosed to any other promoter; and</div>

<a name="060523115000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) the promoter

does not wish to disclose to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs

the way in which that element secures that

advantage&#148;.</div><a name="060523115000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

second part of the amendment is intended to bring about a debate on the

contents of the statutory instrument, and in particular on what is

meant by the word &#147;wish&#148;, and how that wish will be

perceived. We also want to consider the reason for not dealing with

amendments to the disclosure rules by way of primary legislation, and

the reason why Ministers are seeking to impose limits on discussions

that are themselves legal and which may have arisen because of

deficient drafting of tax legislation&#151;although I am sure that

that latter point was covered in the debate on the 2004

Bill.</div><a name="060523115000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

104 seeks to clarify the proposed disclosure rules and to enshrine in

law an important comment contained in the explanatory notes&#151;the

comment that clause 69 will not apply to economic losses. Thankfully,

amendment No. 105 is a bit less

dry&#151;</div><a name="060523115000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000474"></a>The

<a name="060523115000212"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000475"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I was moving on with the hon. Member for

Wycombe. As he rightly identified, the clauses deal with three specific

anti-avoidance measure. They have their origin in disclosures made

under the regime that was introduced in 2004. At the time,

Mr. Flight&#151;the then hon. Member for Arundel and South

Downs&#151;spoke about disclosures on behalf of the Opposition and

said:</div><a name="0605242000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the

heart of the issue, as far as we see it, is the fact that reporting of

the tax avoidance schemes being marketed is in essence a no-brainer.

People know when they are marketing them, and when such a scheme is

being marketed to

them.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">He

continued:</div><a name="060523115000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

objective is that the Revenue should at least be much more quickly

aware of what is being marketed. That is

sensible.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i>

22 June 2004; c.

701-704.]</div><a name="060523115000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

fits specifically with the wider point made by the hon. Member for

Wycombe about complexity and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 313</div>avoidance. Unfortunately, whatever Governments do&#151;much of the

legislation that is being exploited is legislation that was in place

under the previous Government&#151;the same old things are tried:

creating a loss or getting a capital allowance or a deduction or

converting one form of income into another to have it taxed under a

different regime. This goes to the heart of how our tax system works.

While I am happy to engage with the hon. Gentleman in that debate, it

is somewhat fruitless, at least on these

clauses.</div><a name="060523115000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

noon</div> <a name="060523115000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,

these measures result from information specifically provided under the

disclosure regime and are specifically targeted to deal with that.

Indeed, the comments made at the time of the announcement and the

observations on the draft clauses from a whole range of organisations

and accountancy firms, such as KPMG, Ernst and Young and Deloitte and

Touche to name but three, clearly acknowledged that this is precisely

how the clauses are operating.</div>

<a name="060523115000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 69 denies tax relief

for capital losses where their existence or amount has been contrived,

that is, where the losses that arise do not reflect commercial reality.

The clause prevents relief for capital losses where there is either no

underlying economic loss, or there has been no commercial disposal of

an asset by a company or its group and the main purpose, or one of the

main purposes, of the arrangements was to secure a tax

advantage.</div> <a name="060523115000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">These

measures were first published in draft in the pre-Budget report and

they are all effective from that date. In the pre-Budget report, HMRC

also published draft guidance on the new measures, with a statement

setting out why they are necessary and the principles that underpin

them. That approach, which clearly sets out what the measures are

seeking to achieve, has been well received by the accountancy and legal

professions and their clients.</div>

<a name="060523115000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two identifiable

classes of transaction that this legislation will affect. The first is

transactions structured so that the tax outcome does not reflect

economic reality. These are cases where a large capital loss is created

for tax purposes but where there is no, or only a very much smaller,

commercial loss. The second class of transaction targeted is one where

there is a contrived sale or other disposal of an asset and that sale

gives rise to a real commercial loss but there has been no effective,

or real commercial disposal of the asset. There is therefore no change

in the economic ownership of the asset because either the company, or

the group, still retains ownership. Since there has been no real

&#147;disposal&#148;, the clause will act to disallow the capital

loss.</div>

<a name="060523115000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 103 is aimed at excluding from the scope of the disclosure regime

any arrangements that obtain an allowable capital loss. That is a very

wide exclusion indeed, covering all arrangements that involve capital

losses. The main purpose of the disclosure regime is to ensure that

HMRC receives early information about potential tax avoidance schemes

so as to inform current and future anti-avoidance legislation policy.

The disclosure regime, as the then hon. Member for Arundel and South

Downs pointed out, provides the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 314</div>information to ensure that if steps are necessary, they are specific and

targeted to move away from what had been the practice of successive

Governments of a more blanket approach to some anti-avoidance

legislation, without having the clarity of the disclosure regime to

pinpoint specifically the transactions that are required to be in

order. The disclosure regime helps to identify schemes that may well

meet the letter of the law, but which use it in a way that was not

intended and, at times, in an abusive way. They do so by requiring

disclosure of schemes falling within certain descriptions contained in

the regulations. Those descriptions are carefully targeted at the

schemes that have a high risk of being avoidance.</div>

<a name="060523115000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems absurd therefore, as

the amendment proposes, to exclude from the scope of the disclosure

regime a scheme that complies with that particular tax rule, but which

could have other avoidance aspects that have nothing to do with capital

losses. It is precisely those schemes that meet the letter of the

law&#151;but in the way that was never intended&#151;that the

disclosure regime is designed to detect. That was the debate when we

approached the clauses in Committee in 2004. If the logic applying to

the amendment were to be applied across the board, the disclosure

regime would be rendered worthless. There would be no point in it and

the objective of the effective operation of disclosure regimes that the

Opposition agreed that the Government should seek would be undermined.

It is no surprise to the hon. Gentleman that I believe that amendment

No. 103 strikes at the purpose of what we are trying to achieve under

the regulations. I am not attracted to it. I do not know whether the

amendment is probing, but I shall take it as such at the

moment.</div><a name="060523115000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

104 would do two things. First, it would prevent the clause from being

applied when arrangements include certain claims or elections made

under other provisions of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. It

also undermines the purpose of the clause by allowing a capital loss

even though there has been no real commercial disposal of an asset. In

the majority of cases, the clause will have no impact on companies

making claims or elections under other sections of the Act, for

example, when a company claims a loss because an asset has become of

negligible value. I go back to the point made by the then hon. Member

for Arundel and South Downs in 2004, which is that people know when

they are marketing avoidance schemes and others know when such a scheme

is being marketed at them. HMRC&#146;s additional published guidance

specifically addresses the points of which companies need to be aware.

It states that the making of such an election will not in itself be

regarded as an arrangement to which the clause

applies.</div><a name="060523115000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

giving carte blanche to all arrangements that use particular claims or

elections, as the amendment would do, undermines the effectiveness of

the clause. It is possible that the claims or elections could be part

of larger arrangements that have been contrived to produce a loss. I

touched on that point when I covered amendment No. 103. The legislation

must be capable of deterring such behaviour because, again during our

discussions on the Finance Act 2004, it was clear from contributions

made by all members of the Committee that it was the presence of the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 315</div>disclosure regime to deter people, in the first place, from engaging in

those activities that was of particular

importance.</div><a name="060523115000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

second effect of amendment No. 104 would be worse, in that it would

completely undermine the principles that underpin the clause by giving

relief for losses on assets that have not actually changed economic

ownership. In extreme cases, it would mean that companies could create

large capital losses, even though an asset might only temporarily have

fallen in value and there had been no change in economic ownership of

the asset.</div> <a name="060523115000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">As if the

other bit of damage was not bad enough, the amendment would also have

wider implications for the corporate capital gains system.

Companies&#146; capital gains and losses are taxed or relieved on a

realisation basis. If we were to give relief for losses when there is

no real economic disposal, we would be allowing a mismatch in the

treatment of gains and losses, as losses would effectively be relieved

as they accrued whereas gains would continue to be taxed on

realisation.</div>

<a name="060523115000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taken as a

whole, amendment No. 104 seriously undermines clause 69 to the extent

that any additional revenue from preventing avoidance schemes currently

in use would, in all likelihood, be lost. The estimate is something

like &#163;260 million for the tax years 2006-07 to 2008-09 with a

continuing &#163;150 million a year thereafter.</div>

<a name="060523115000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 103 would

exclude several potential avoidance schemes from the disclosure regime

and amendment No. 104 would seriously undermine clause 69. I hope,

therefore, that the hon. Gentleman has probed the intention of the

Government enough and will want to reflect on what has been said before

he decides whether to pursue the matter

further.</div><a name="060523115000228"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000476"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> When tabling these amendments and those to

clauses 70 and 71, I thought that reference might be made to the former

hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, Mr. Howard Flight. Although I

have not gone back through the 2004 debates to read every remark he

made or to follow entirely the flow of his thought, I suspected that he

might have dealt with such clauses.</div>

<a name="060523115000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Paymaster General&#146;s reply was a little reliant on extreme cases

when she referred to amendment No. 104. She acknowledged that some

innocent arrangements might be caught by the provision. However, in the

light of the long consideration given to the proposals during the

consultation process that she referred to and my not wanting to explain

to her where we would plug a&#163;260 million gap in

finances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060523115000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000479"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> As the Paymaster General and I both anticipated,

we come to amendment No.105. It is more straightforward than the

previous amendments in that it would introduce a pre-clearance regime

to the proposed rules on disclosure. Given that HMRC already has a

relationship with companies by way of the disclosure arrangement, there

is a case for introducing a pre-clearance regime that sets the dialogue

on a more formal basis. Capital gains tax frequently arises on major

business transactions, a classic example of which would be the sale of

a property or business, so large amounts of money may be at stake.

Capital gains by their nature tend to relate to substantial decisions

by companies, hence the risk that an adverse tax change could deter

businesses from making commercial

decisions.</div><a name="060523115000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

pre-clearance regime would mean that HMRC would make policy clearances

publicly available in order to provide greater certainty to taxpayers.

Such regimes are widely used abroad, for example in Australia and New

Zealand. My recollection is that in countries where they are not

used&#151;for example, the Republic of Ireland&#151;the tax regime

is a good deal simpler. I suspect that the Paymaster General will argue

that it will be difficult to staff the regime, or that the arrangement

might be administratively inconvenient, but since in this and other

clauses the Government are seeking in effect to enter into further

discussions about tax affairs with businesses, there seems no obvious

reason why a tax clearance regime should not form part of those

discussions.</div><a name="060523115000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,

there is a genuine debate to be had about whether the Government

should, on the one hand, spend more time tinkering with the tax system

in the light of the greater complexity caused by the expansion of tax

legislation since 1997, or, on the other, simply opt for a

pre-clearance regime.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000480"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> I rise briefly to support amendment No. 105,

tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe. The difficulty is that

companies that have to make delicate commercial decisions about how to

manage their losses want clarity about what they are and are not

permitted to do while staying legitimately within the tax regime. For

example, they may have to decide whether to move losses from one

business period to another or make other arrangements that will benefit

them commercially. I hope that the Paymaster General will surprise my

hon. Friend and me and say that the amendment is a good idea, but I

fear she will not. In that case, I would ask her to think again,

because there is a huge advantage to be gained in companies being able

to contact HMRC for clarification of what they are permitted to do.

Certainly, that would be desirable.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 317</div><a name="060523115000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend said, although there may be some additional administrative

inconvenience for HMRC in providing clarification, there would be

greater benefits for the company concerned and for the economy

generally. I therefore ask the Minister to consider the amendment very

carefully. It is a good idea that will assist companies in knowing

exactly what they are permitted to do in an important area that is

growing increasingly complex and difficult to

manage.</div>

<a name="060523115000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000481"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> The added benefits for HMRC are time and money,

which are limited assets. Greater clarity upfront on these issues would

benefit the constituent involved and save HMRC time and money in

chasing up matters

later.</div><a name="060523115000239"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000482"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> My hon. Friend is right; prevention is better than

cure. The consequences of the amendment should be that HMRC will be

able, perhaps very simply, to tell a company whether an arrangement

would be legitimate for tax purposes. I go back to what the Paymaster

General said earlier about remarks that were made in the 2004 Finance

Bill debate: if it is clear what is and is not a permissible

arrangement, it will not take long for HMRC to answer questions. If, by

having their questions answered, companies can stay within the limits

of the tax regime, in the long run, as my hon. Friend says, we will

save ourselves and them a great deal of time and

money.</div>

<a name="060523115000240"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000483"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Before I comment on the amendments, let me

address the issue of statutory clearance. That concerns the additional

burdens on business and a great deal more that the hon. Gentlemen,

conveniently, did not touch on. The clauses deal with tax avoidance.

They have been disclosed as regimes under disclosure, and therefore

legislated for, and will apply only where one of the main purposes of a

transaction or arrangement is tax avoidance. They will not apply to the

vast majority of companies or to wholly commercial transactions. The

principle behind the measure is that companies should be able to claim

and use capital losses only where there is both a genuine economic loss

and a genuine commercial disposal. That is the absolute bedrock. The

hon. Gentlemen have spoken about complexity, but business is complex.

Assuming that they do not propose taking capital losses out of the tax

system completely, they are over-egging their comments about the tax

system and the way in which legislation is phrased.</div>

<a name="060523115000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the amendments affect

two separate clauses, clauses 69 and 71, they are grouped together

because they deal with the same principle. They seek to introduce a

statutory clearance procedure for both clauses, and I consider that to

be unnecessary. The majority of companies do not need to use the

clearance procedure, but could be forced to do so. Once that is in

place all sorts of other things come into consideration, such as

whether they have been properly advised, and indemnities for

accountants and lawyers. That does not apply to most companies because

the scheme is specifically about the misuse of losses, and in any case

they will know whether they are using it. To say that they will not is

to ignore commercial practice, as has been acknowledge in this

Committee on a number of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 318</div>occasions and in debates on different Finance Acts about the nature of

avoidance.</div>

<a name="060523115000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

disqualifying circumstances with which clause 69 is concerned are those

in which companies have entered into arrangements whose main purpose is

to enable them to secure a tax advantage. In short, that is tax

avoidance, and that is what the measures are aimed at. Companies will

know whether they are doing it. There is no question that they need

statutory clearance. The effect on all other companies will be the

reverse of what is being advocated. It will not give speedy resolution,

but will drive them to feel that they should seek statutory

clearance&#151;presumably before the transaction takes place and

therefore putting pressure on it&#151;whereas they will not need it

in the first place because they are not engaged in the activities

covered by the clause.</div>

<a name="060523115000243"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000484"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> Surely the Paymaster General cannot have it both

ways. If she is right&#151;I do not think that she is&#151;that

this is a straightforward area, it will always be obvious to companies

what is tax avoidance and what is not. Surely if there is a clearance

procedure, and they ask whether an arrangement is tax avoidance or not,

they will get a very simple, straightforward and quick answer from

HMRC, which will not cost much time or money. So what is the problem

with the

procedure?</div><a name="060523115000244"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000485"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> First, we are not talking about commercial

transactions. The clauses deal with very narrow and specific avoidance

mechanisms. That is all that we are talking about. We have put that

clearly in legislation and guidance notes. The idea that those who

design such schemes, knowing what they are designed to achieve, should

seek clearance before they start marketing them, is simply

unattractive&#151;to put it mildly.</div>

<a name="060523115000245"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000486"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Will the Paymaster General give

way?</div><a name="060523115000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000487"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> No, I will not. I am going to answer the

question, and then the hon. Gentleman can come back. It is a complex

area, and I am not able to get one set of answers on the record before

the next set comes forward. The hon. Gentleman can make his points

later.</div> <a name="060523115000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 69, as

I said, is aimed at those companies that specifically use that type of

scheme; those schemes are caught by the clause. They do not happen by

accident or incident; they are the result of highly contrived

circumstances when transactions are undertaken. It is very simple. If

there is no clearance, companies should not engage in such schemes. The

schemes are carried out in a particular way, primarily to achieve a

desired tax effect rather than general commercial purposes, and

companies will know that. For that reason,clause 69 does not

need a safety blanket of a statutory, pre-clearance procedure wrapped

around it. It is quite clear what it is aiming

at.</div><a name="060523115000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

schemes at which clause 71 is aimed are just as artificial as those

targeted by clause 69. They seek to turn an income stream into a

capital gain, or to contrive a linked income deduction, effectively

turning a capital loss into an income one. In each case, capital losses

are used to shelter tax liabilities on the contrived capital gain. The

relief for capital losses is given against income profits only in very

limited circumstances, when Parliament intends that to happen. Schemes

have been devised to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 319</div>circumvent that intention and to obtain relief at

will, and clause 71 stops that. However, clause 71 is targeted at more

complex schemes, so there may be more uncertainty about whether the

legislation applies. HMRC has instigated an informal clearance scheme

for the clause, which businesses may use if they wish. That has the

advantage of providing help to people who want it, without adding any

unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to those who do not. It provides the

practical certainty that businesses want. HMRC will be bound by its

decision, with regard to clause 71, provided that businesses disclose

all the relevant facts when the application is sought. Furthermore, the

rules that the clause introduces will apply to companies only if the

notice to that effect is issued by the board of HMRC. That will further

comfort compliant companies.</div>

<a name="060523115000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the amendments make

reference to a clearance procedure used for share exchanges, but they

would not adapt the legislation to make it relevant to the clauses, so

they would not actually work. They would also provide for statutory

clearances to be applied for before the transaction takes place. They

would be requested and, presumably, granted on the basis of planned or

hypothetical transactions. That cannot possibly make sense. The

amendments contain no requirement that an applicant is contemplating

carrying out the proposed transaction. There is a danger that the

clearance procedure will be used by tax professionals to tweak and

perfect schemes that they then implement and market to their clients. I

am sure that members of the Committee can understand why I am not

attracted to that

idea.</div><a name="060523115000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

pm</div><a name="060523115000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

companies are unsure about the application of clauses 69 and 71, they

need only look at the comprehensive guidance issued by HMRC in December

2005 and at the statement of principles that underpins the measures.

Furthermore, there is the option of making an application to HMRC under

the code of practice 10 procedure if a company is unsure of the

interpretation of the wording of the law. There is also the informal clearance

procedure in clause 71, as I have pointed out. The Government believe

that those measures will provide the clarity and certainty needed. The

capital loss package was the subject of consultation with business and

its advisers, and there was no suggestion that the application of

either clause was unclear.</div>

<a name="060523115000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there

were a formal clearance procedure, directors of compliant companies

might feel compelled to use it. Lawyers and accountants could find that

their professional indemnity insurance would be invalid if they failed

to use the statutory clearance procedure. They might then decide to

require applications for clearance in all cases in which they are

advising on transactions that might result in a capital loss, such as

the liquidation of a failed subsidiary or a capitalisation scheme such

as the sale or leaseback of property, even when there is clearly no tax

avoidance purpose and despite clear HMRC guidance. The only effect of

the amendments would be potentially thousands of pointless clearance

applications, costing businesses additional fees for their advisers,

and delays in commercial life due to the need for

applications.</div> <a name="060523115000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments would add none of the certainty that business seeks. The

clear targeting of clause 69 and the guidance, code and informal

clearance procedure in clause 71 provide that certainty without

creating an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 320</div>unwieldy statutory clearance system that would not

benefit anybody except the advisers who would be paid

fees.</div><a name="060523115000253"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000488"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> The Paymaster General dealt convincingly with the

previous group of amendments, but I am not convinced that she has dealt

quite so convincingly with this group. I take her point about the

additional burden that a pre-clearance regime might place on business.

However, although I hear what she said about Howard Flight&#146;s

contribution in 2004, I do not entirely accept that there is a stark,

clear line between anti-avoidance arrangements and other

arrangements.</div>

<a name="060523115000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, if someone is

framing an avoidance scheme they know that they are doing so.

However, the Paymaster General said that this is a complex area. She

then looked ahead at clause 71 and said, if I heard her correctly, that

there would be extra arrangements to help businesses drawing up schemes

to know whether they are in breach of the law. That sounds more complex

than what the Paymaster General set out.</div>

<a name="060523115000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot simply impose a

pre-clearance regime on the Treasury. However, passing the amendment

would be a rather stark course of action to take, although we will want

to return to the matter in due course. As we go through clauses 70 and

71, we might find that where businesses stand with Her Majesty&#146;s

Revenue and Customs and its tax arrangements is far less clear than the

Paymaster General made out. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060523115000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000489"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I have learned in the past year

to study not only the Bill itself, but the explanatory notes, which are

great at giving clarity. I shall read paragraph 2 of the summary of

clause 69 in the explanatory notes because it has a bearing on a point

that I shall make in a moment. As the Paymaster General said, it is

very

clear:</div><a name="060523115000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

clause is based upon the principle that relief for corporate capital

losses should only be available where a group or company has suffered a

genuine commercial loss and has made a real commercial disposal of an

asset. The rule will only apply where arrangements produce a loss that

is greater than the real underlying economic loss or where arrangements

entail the asset upon which a loss is claimed to have arisen remaining

within the economic ownership of the company or the

group.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a fair

point, which looks clear to me.</div>

<a name="060523115000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain concerned, however,

when august institutions such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation

write not only to me but, I believe, the Paymaster General. I am sure

that she has seen the institute&#146;s briefing. On clause 69, it

said:</div><a name="060523115000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In our

comments on the draft legislation we said that what is now clause 69

will result in the taxation of arithmetical differences that do not

correspond to actual gains. We gave the following example.</div>

<a name="060523115000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">Suppose that a company has an

asset with a base cost of 100, but with a market value of 40. It sells

the asset for 40 and subsequently re-acquires it for 40. Some time

later it sells the asset to an unconnected third party for 90. The loss

on the first sale is not allowable, but the original base cost is not

reinstated. Therefore a chargeable gain of 50 arises on the second

sale, even though a real loss of 10 has been

sustained.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 321</div><a name="060523115000261"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000490"></a>Rob

the first sale is not

allowable?</div><a name="060523115000262"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000491"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000492"></a>Rob

loss on the first sale is not

allowable&#148;.</div><a name="060523115000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am simply

asking the hon. Gentleman, who prays in aid of that example, to explain

to the Committee why the loss on the first sale is not

allowable.</div><a name="060523115000265"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000493"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I confess that I am not a tax

expert&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>&#151;but I certainly understand

the mathematics to which the institute referred. If the CIT&#151;a

far more august institution than many to which we might

belong&#151;has expressed a concern about the arithmetic behind the

expected impact of losses and gains in respect of this clause, I am

merely sharing that concern. I should like to ask the Paymaster

General, who has received the same document, why neither the Institute

nor I should be concerned about the issue.</div>

<a name="060523115000266"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000494"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I am afraid that I cannot throw any light on why

the loss in the first transaction will not count, but if the example

given by the CIT is incorrect because of the assumption that the hon.

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West mentioned, perhaps the Paymaster

General should confirm whether the assumption is

correct.</div>

<a name="060523115000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000495"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention,

which reflects the point that I made a couple of minutes ago. I want to

touch on the second concern raised by the CIT. It

says:</div><a name="060523115000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We also

mentioned that draft s184a disallows a loss arising on a degrouping

deemed disposal (eg where another person acquires more than 25 per

cent. of the chargeable company), but does not exempt any gain arising

on a similar deemed disposal. We cannot discern the rationale for this

and would appreciate an explanation. However, it seems to us to be

another case ofthe principles applying only where it suits

the Government. The above comments apply to the provisions as included

in the Finance Bill, which are the same as the draft

provisions.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally it

says:</div> <a name="060523115000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

disappointing that there has been no change in the draft

legislation.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure

that the Paymaster General has seen the document. I respect the CIT, so

I shall be interested to hear her comments on the two concerns that it

has raised in respect of clause 69.</div>

<a name="060523115000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000496"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> It will be more fruitful for me to write to the

CIT to explain why its concerns are not relevant than it will be for me

to answer the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), who has read out

what it says but is not sure how it works. I would pray in aid a number

of responses that we received as a result of publishing the draft

clauses in December, including one from Ernst and Young, which

says:</div><a name="060523115000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

whole or main purpose test has been used extensively in recent

legislation&#148;.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div><a name="060523115000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is to say that people are familiar

with it. The author continues:</div>

<a name="060523115000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I agree with the

guidance notes. Purely commercial transactions should not be caught by

this test.&#148;</div><a name="060523115000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the

case; they are not. The CIT put forward the example that we have heard.

Let me paraphrase my reply. First, this is an anti-avoidance provision.

It will catch only transactions undertaken with tax avoidance either as

their main purpose or as one of several purposes. That is a well used

concept in our tax system. The institute makes a general argument,

whereas we are talking about anti-avoidance, which already has a narrow

&#147;target&#148;. The principle behind the provision is that

losses will be allowed only when they are matched by a commercial

disposal. That has been made very clear, and has been acknowledged by

the accountancy press and professional bodies with regard to this

clause and the arrangements in it.</div>

<a name="060523115000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a group

still tries to avoid tax by crystallising a loss without matching it

with a commercial disposal, it will not be surprised if it loses access

to that loss. Should it go on to pay tax on the real commercial

disposal after attempting to avoid tax, it will have to accept that

consequence. That is the response to the CIT, however it is dressed up

as company A doing this, company B doing that and some money exiting en

route.</div> <a name="060523115000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 69 is

specifically targeted; it is anti-avoidance and its purpose and intent

are acknowledged to be clear. I am sure that the CIT will be grateful

to receive a slightly longer and more detailed response from me, but

those are the basic principles.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000499"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> The clause bundles together a series of

anti-avoidance proposals in order to amend the Taxation and Chargeable

Gains Act 1992. Before I go through 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div>the amendments in detail, I want to return to the point about the

clarity of the legislation. In the debate on the amendments to clause

69, I quoted Deloitte&#146;s general welcome for the provision.

However, it is worth noting that the firm Norton Rose recognises

greater ambiguity and difficulty for business in these arrangements

than the Paymaster General allows. It

said:</div><a name="060523115000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

guidance notes state that the provisions do not apply where there is a

genuine commercial transaction that gives rise to a real commercial

loss as a result of a real commercial disposal. However, debate is

likely to continue as to the meaning of these phrases. HMRC have

rejected calls for a clearance procedure and have also rejected

requests for mitigation of this rule in circumstances where companies

seek to recognise capital losses on assets before a real commercial

disposal takes

place."</div><a name="060523115000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

context of amendment No. 106 is that proposed new section 184A in

clause 70 will place restrictions on companies buying other companies

with losses. New section 184B will place restrictions on companies

buying other companies with gains. The crucial section, which relates

to the previous two, is new section 184D which defines "tax advantage"

in relation to the other sections.</div>

<a name="060523115000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 106 is a probing

amendment, which would insert a new section 184DA in order to place in

law a definition of the main purpose of a company when that main

purpose is to avoid paying tax. There is currently no interpretation of

main purpose within UK tax statute. The definition in the amendment is

a case-law definition given as obiter dicta. In case any members of the

Committee do not know what that is, I looked it up, although not

through the medium ofMrs. Gauke, and found that obiter dicta

are the remarks of a judge which are not necessary to reaching a

decision, but are made as comments, illustrations or thoughts. The hon.

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West knew that already, but other

Committee members did not necessarily know. Some of them might

have.</div><a name="060523115000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 107 deals with sections 176 and 177 of the 1992 Act, which disallow

capital losses where there is tax planning to generate an unreasonable

loss. Following the changes to section 8 of the 1992 Act approved in

clause 69, there is arguably no reason for section 177 to remain in

existence for corporate bodies. The amendment seeks to establish

whether the Treasury intends to duplicate a piece of legislation

unnecessarily.</div><a name="060523115000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 108 would remove the whole of clause 70(5)(a) and (b). The argument

supporting it relates again to the unnecessary duplication of

legislation and runs as follows. The measures relate to life assurance

businesses. Specific rules prevent life assurance companies from

deferring capital gains on their holdings of equities by holding them

via a captive collective investment vehicle such as a unit trust. The

rules work by deeming the assurance company to have sold all such unit

trusts at the end of each accounting period. The net amount of capital

gains or allowable losses arising from the total deemed disposals is

spread for tax purposes over seven accounting periods, including the

current one. Typically, a net loss can be carried back against spread

gains arising in the previous six

periods.</div><a name="060523115000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections

(8A) to (8I) of section 213 of the 1992 Act were introduced to deal

with an anomaly. Capital gains and losses are particular to the company

in which they arise. Therefore, if life assurance business was 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 324</div>transferred to a new company, provisions allowed net spread amounts not

yet taxed to transfer with the business. However, if the stock market

then plummeted, the transferee could not carry back the losses against

gains already taxed to the transferor, even though the gains and losses

arose to the same

policyholders.</div><a name="060523115000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections

(8A) to (8I) of section 213 were introduced to allow a two-year

carry-back by election where the transferor and transferee were in the

same group. Unfortunately, in the opinion of some, subsections (8H) and

(8I) were included so that the election could be reduced by the effect

of the pre-entry gain rules. It was argued that that was unnecessary,

as the rules required that the transferee did not carry on long-term

business before the transfer. Hence, gains and losses must relate to

the same policyholders.</div>

<a name="060523115000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 70

seeks to introduce a new restriction following the abolition of the

pre-entry gain rules. General anti-avoidance rules now apply to the

creation of capital losses, and specific anti-avoidance rules apply to

the purchase and sale of companies for their capital losses or gains.

Also, rules exist to prevent shareholders from using their losses

against policyholder gains and vice versa. It is argued that given

those measures, there is no need for subsections (8A) to (8I) to remain

in force.</div> <a name="060523115000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 109 and 110 propose to delete everything between line 25 of page

60 to the end of line 1 of page 61. It is argued that the measures that

would be deleted are retrospective, and that UK tax law should not

usually be retrospective. I look forward to the Paymaster

General&#146;s response on those

points.</div><a name="060523115000292"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060523115000500"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> As with the measures in clause 69 that we

discussed, this clause will apply only to companies that enter into

arrangements with one of the main purposes being to obtain a tax

advantage. It will provide protection against the practice of buying

and selling companies not for their inherent business worth or for

access to their assets but for access to their tax potential. It also

introduces new rules to tackle tax avoidance and repeals the original

gain buying

rules.</div><a name="060523115000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

has been increasing evidence in recent years of tax avoidance involving

capital losses and capital gain buying, as a number of groups of

companies have accumulated large amounts of capital losses&#151;more

than they need to set against their gains. Some of those groups have

been seeking ways to create a value for those losses. The clause will

prevent companies from benefiting from the losses of other companies or

groups when entering into an arrangement one of the main purposes of

which is to obtain a tax advantage. If the conditions set out are met,

the use of losses will be restricted so that the company or group is

stopped from setting off another group&#146;s losses against its own

gains.</div><a name="060523115000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

106 defines in fairly narrow terms what arrangements should be regarded

as having a &#147;main purpose&#148; of avoiding tax. There are

many examples of the main purpose test in UK tax avoidance legislation,

and by necessity the matter can be determined only on a case-by-case

basis with reference to the facts and circumstances of the taxpayer

concerned. The test is well used, and HMRC has issued detailed

guidance, which it continues to update, to provide as much certainty as

possible to business. The system is working. The main purpose test is

included 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 325</div>not only in clauses 69 to 71 but in a lot of other places. The phrase is

well understood by business and its advisers, and guidance and support

is given by HMRC.

</div><a name="060523115000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition in

the amendment is much narrower than the natural meaning of &#147;main

purpose&#148; or &#147;one of the main purposes&#148;. The

amendment would mean that no transaction with a commercial purpose

could form part of a tax avoidance arrangement, however minor or

irrelevant it was to that arrangement. Unless the tax advantage was the

only purpose of the transaction, the rules could therefore not take

effect. Planners would simply ensure that some connection was made,

however tiny. The amendment would severely weaken the clause and mean

that companies could easily undermine the application of the

rules.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 326</div><a name="060523115000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 107, I cannot

quite see the link between clause 70 and section 176 of the 1992 Act.

The latter deals with the calculation of capital gains and losses on

the sale of company shares when sales or transfers of assets under

value have reduced the value of the company: that is called a

depreciatory transaction. The hon. Gentleman wants to repeal section

176, which covers some common ground with, for example, clause 69. It

can be used to combat avoidance involving the artificial creation of

losses. Its remit, however, is wider than just

anti-avoidance.</div><a name="060523115000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
