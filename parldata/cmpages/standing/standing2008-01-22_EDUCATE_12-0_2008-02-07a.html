						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000494"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> What a
delight it is to see you in your place, Mr. Bercow, and to
be serving under your guidance this afternoon.</div>
					<a name="08020781000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7 defines the relevant
period, and says when it starts and finishes. We had a fascinating
discussion about that. In particular, we explored the scenario posed by
the hon. Member for Yeovil about what happens when a course collapses,
in his phrase, and whether that would lead to a decision from an
attendance panel and whether the collapse of a course would be a
reasonable excuse. I do not intend to detain the Committee, suffice it
to deal with that scenario. Hopefully, we will then decide on the
clause, which I obviously recommend to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08020781000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
person&#146;s part-time training collapsed while they were in
full-time work, the case would not of course go anywhere near an
attendance panel, because support would kick in at that
point&#151;enforcement would be inappropriate, assuming that no other
appropriate course was available. The relevant period stops when the
young person stops participating in full-time education or an
apprenticeship, or when the next academic year begins. It would not be
suspended if a course is withdrawn. If that happened, the learning
provider or Connexions would help to provide an alternative. While a
person is receiving help or waiting for the identified alternative
course to begin, they would not be subject to enforcement action,
because they would have a reasonable excuse and because the local
authority cannot take any such action unless a young person has been
given adequate opportunity to participate voluntarily. Clearly, the
absence of an alternative suitable course would mean that a person has
not been given adequate opportunity to participate voluntarily, so no
enforcement action would be taken. I hope that that satisfies the hon.
Gentleman and the rest of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08020781000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08020781000495"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I am grateful to the Minister,
and I welcome you back to the Chair for this afternoon&#146;s
sitting, Mr. Bercow.</div>
					<a name="08020781000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
helpfully clarified some of his comments, but I wish to press him a
little further. He said that if someone&#146;s course collapses,
which would mean that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>they were no longer compliant with the education and training
requirement, they would be helped to find an alternative by the
education provider. Does he accept that in a rural area, for example,
there might not be an alternative provider within a reasonable
distance? There is a real issue about what alternative provision might
be in such a situation. The expectations of a young person who is
interested in some specific course or support that was offered through
a college might be different from the alternatives.</div>
					<a name="08020781000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are examples in my
constituency where, on a number of occasions, courses have not got off
the ground or they have fallen through part way through the year. I
have received letters from people who are very upset at having lost
that provision and who clearly do not feel that a reasonable
alternative has been offered. I am not sure that I want those people to
be pushed back into an alternative that is specified by the college or
by a local authority as suitable, because that might not meet the needs
of the young
person.</div>
					<a name="08020781000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000496"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It will be incumbent on the local
authority&#151;clause 10 specifies the authorities&#146; duty to
promote fulfilment&#151;to ensure that an alternative is appropriate.
People should not be compelled to take up an inappropriate offer of
education or training made by their
advisers.</div>
					<a name="08020781000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000497"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s
point, but it does not necessarily reassure us that, in areas where the
breadth of provision might not be as wide as we would like, viable
alternatives will be available that young people want to take up. I am
still unsure whether enforcement action would be taken if a course fell
through in the mid-year period or even early in the conventional
academic year. What if no other course was on offer that matched the
original needs of the young people and there was not to be another
course until at least the new academic year when, say, a new teacher
might be in place? Would those young people be required against their
wishes to enter another course for a time instead of waiting until the
new course was established in the new academic
year?</div>
					<a name="08020781000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000498"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> If no other relevant training or education was
available that was appropriate to the young person, enforcement action
could not be taken. As soon as the matter reached the attendance panel,
it would throw it out as the young person having had reasonable excuse
for not fulfilling his
duty.</div>
					<a name="08020781000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000499"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I do not want to labour the issue, but the Minister
puts local authorities in a difficult position. He referred to relevant
education and training. Who is to say whether it would be relevant for
a young person with aspirations in a particular career sector, and who
was looking for particular education and training, suddenly to discover
that the course that they wanted, had been offered or were, perhaps,
on, folded and, instead of being offered a course relevant to their
needs, they were offered something that sounded to the education
provider and local authority to be something that they would expect the
young person to be involved in, but the young person did not wish to be
involved in it? I accept that we cannot resolve the problem now, but
will the hon. Gentleman reflect on it and consider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>whether that person will have the option to stay out of what he believes
to be inappropriate education or training until, for example, the right
type of new course becomes available in the new academic
year?</div>
					<a name="08020781000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000500"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Clause 4 sets out appropriate full-time education
and training. However, we are discussing part-time education and
training because the people are in full-time employment. It is not
appropriate for me to prescribe the detail in respect of individual
scenarios. That is why independent attendance panels are part of the
design of the whole system. As we have discussed, the local authority
may enforce; it does not have to enforce. Local authority officers
would have to assess whether or not to take up the option knowing that
their local attendance panel would judge matters on the basis of
whether there was an alternative appropriate form of
training.</div>
					<a name="08020781000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000501"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> That is precisely what I am worried about and
dislike. The Minister says that it will be up to local officials to
decide what they think is in the best interests of young people and to
withdraw that power from the young people themselves. On the say-so of
those individuals, young people could be forced back into a course
mid-year that is completely unsuitable and that they do not wish to
take up in order to meet the Government&#146;s targets and to
demonstrate that 100 per cent. of the cohorts are in education and
training, instead of their being allowed to stay out of the education
and training market until a suitable course is
available.</div>
					<a name="08020781000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08020781000502"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): It
seems that the hon. Gentleman has the Minister on the horns of a
dilemma. On the one hand, the Minister says that there will be
flexibility in that the local authorities will have discretion yet, on
the other hand, he is saying now, and was so during our hungry pursuit
of such matters just before lunch, that he will not amend the Bill to
broaden the definition of what training will be permitted, to include
all that is meaningful and appropriate. He said that it must be
relevant. That is a highly loaded term. The Minister wants the Bill to
be inflexible, but interpreted
flexibly.</div>
					<a name="08020781000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000503"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I agree entirely. The hon. Gentleman makes yet
another devastating point, which helps to hit at the very structure of
the Bill and the compulsion contained within
it.</div>
					<a name="08020781000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000504"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am not devastated by the
point, but by my apparent inability to persuade the hon. Gentleman that
things will not be down to the individual officer. In the end, an
attendance panel would have to be persuaded, so it is down to several
individuals. If it is clear that there is no alternative relevant
training or education, it would be a perfectly reasonable excuse for
the individual to carry on for some period with full-time employment,
waiting for an appropriate part-time course to become
available.</div>
					<a name="08020781000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000505"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> That may be of some use, but I fear that it is so
vague that what it means in practice could vary enormously throughout
the country. Let us take the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>example provided by the National Union of Teachers of a young person on
a car mechanics course who also wants to do an accountancy
qualification, not wanting to be in the car mechanics business for
ever. Let us say that the young person gets on a course at a college to
do some form of accountancy relevant to their aspirations. The
individual who runs the course becomes ill, moves away or is made
redundant, and the course collapses. No equivalent course is available
in the catchment area, and the local authority then considers what
other courses are available in the college setting. There may be a
business-related course, or a mathematics for business course. Are
those acceptable relevant alternatives that the Minister would want to
compel the young person to take up?</div>
					<a name="08020781000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,
if the young person considered that the courses might be relevant in
some way to their general interest, but were not the specific course
they wanted and they wanted the option to wait perhaps 18 months for
the next accountancy course to come along&#151;after the further
education college had, hopefully, recruited a new person&#151;how on
earth could local authorities know what the definition of
&#147;relevant&#148; is, to determine whether to force the young
person to take the alternative course? Will we end up with all sorts of
different circumstances around the country, depending on the generosity
of the local officers&#146; view, and their interpretation of the
Minister&#146;s comments which may also
vary?</div>
					<a name="08020781000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000506"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I would expect those advising the young person to
be mindful of where they wanted to end up, of whether there was an
alternative appropriate to the pathway of learning on which they were
set, and of whether taking up a course in the interim before the
alternative became available would preclude the funding of the
alternative that the young person really wanted. All those things would
have to be borne in mind so that the young person could achieve his
potential and go on the pathway he was after. In this case,
&#147;relevant&#148; is irrelevant, if that is not too confusing.
It does not mean that the course must be relevant to anything that the
young person is doing or wants to do, but simply that it is relevant
for the purposes of part-time education or training as a way of
fulfilling the
duty.</div>
					<a name="08020781000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000507"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> We understand that &#147;relevant&#148; may be
irrelevant, but we are still confused about how the duties will be
applied in practice, and we fear that there will be an enormous element
of judgment surrounding the matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000509"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister calls it flexibility.
I call it confusion, potentially, in the way in which the duty may be
implemented in the future. I shall not labour the point, Mr.
Bercow, not only because I may try your patience, but because there may
be other opportunities later in the Bill to clarify the point by way of
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08020781000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
prompt the Minister to consider the subsidiary issue that I raised of
circumstances in which the course has not collapsed, but the young
person&#146;s interest in or commitment to it has ended? We heard a
lot of evidence in the evidence sessions that the rate at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>which young people leave such courses early on is very high. Presumably,
many of those leave on a voluntary basis. Are the attendance panels and
local authorities likely to take a different attitude towards young
people who decide to terminate their involvement in a course compared
with those whose course terminates their involvement? Will there be
less
flexibility?</div>

Knight:
						</b> No, the same flexibility will
have to apply. I remind the Committee that we are talking about people
in full-time employment who are also in part-time training. One would
expect the personal Connexions adviser to bear in mind the needs of the
individual. If they have become disengaged from their part-time course,
another part-time course should be found that they have a reasonable
chance of completing and which will fulfil their needs. They must not
use the ability to nip from one thing to the other to flout their
duties under the
Bill.</div>

sessions, and I recommend her work to you and the Committee,
Mr. Bercow. She is an authority on training and particularly
on apprenticeships. She told the Committee that some apprenticeships
contain little or no guided or mentored workplace learning. That is a
shocking fact. Who would believe that an

be fair to the Minister and the Government, they have recently issued

suggests provision for a statutory definition of what constitutes an
apprenticeship. That is something that I have called for, as the
Minister with responsibility for skills acknowledged before the
publication of the review. It would be an important point of progress.

commitment. I do not blame the Minister that that provision is not in

does not really play any role in the actual training for a number of
apprenticeships. What is happening&#151;this links again to the
concept of the competence-based NVQ&#151;the training provider goes
into the employer&#146;s premises and assesses the young person
against the competences and the key skills, and perhaps even having the
apprenticeships for their off-the-job training in the training
provider&#146;s premises. I meet many employers whose role is
entirely that of employer, in the sense that the young person is there
to do a job of work.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,

					<a name="08020781000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
there is a gap between their role as an employer and their role as an
organisation assisting with the training of young people. The Bill goes
some way to bridging that gap by creating new duties, but we need to be
absolutely clear what guided learning hours mean in this
context.</div>

							<a name="08020781000516"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister.
That is helpful, but it does not entirely deal with the issue about
what constitutes guided learning hours. I am pleased that
apprenticeships themselves are not included, but Lorna Unwin&#146;s
work deals with training in a broader sense. I referred in particular
to apprenticeships, but her work deals with all kinds of training.
National vocational qualifications are part of that package. I suspect
that many of the young we are dealing with, who are some of the most
disadvantaged and challenging of young people, will first find
themselves in pre-apprenticeship training. That might include a range
of NVQ options because to get on to a full apprenticeship without that
training will simply not be possible because of their competences. I
take the Minister&#146;s point, but it is not an entire answer to the
argument advanced by Professor
Unwin.</div>
					<a name="08020781000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor Unwin
argues that many employers are providing perfectly acceptable work
placements, but are not necessarily engaged in substantive training. It

<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>will therefore be for the Minister to explain to the Committee how the
Government will judge what constitutes guided learning hours. The
phrase &#147;guided learning hours&#148; suggests training that is
directed and mentored, be it at apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeship or
sub-apprenticeship level. Surely all training should involve systematic
workplace training under a skilled mentor. The experience of the
trainee in the workplace should not simply be a work placement. We
cannot just put people into workplaces and assume that that includes,
implicitly, a level of training. I wish the Minister would enlighten
the Committee on how the Government will ensure that this aspect of the
Bill is effected in a way that benefits both employers and, more
especially in this context,
trainees.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): It is important that we
ensure that training for young people, even at entry level, trains them
for future career advancement. I would not like to see a sort of
tick-box mentality to training where young people leave school at 16,
work at a cash till for two years with no prospect of career
advancement, and a training certificate is produced at the end of it to
keep the authorities happy. Although they will have learned important
skills from having to go into work, such as arriving on time,
interacting with colleagues, getting up in the morning and being
punctual, it is not entirely clear that they will have a skill that
they can go on to leverage into future careers and future jobs. I hope
that the Minister can also respond to those brief
points.</div>

Knight:
						</b> The clause specifies the number of hours that a
young person must spend participating in guided learning, and defines
the latter. I point the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
to subsection (3), which states that a person is in &#147;actual
guided learning&#148; if they
are</div>
					<a name="08020781000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;being taught or
given instruction by a lecturer, tutor, supervisor or other appropriate
provider of training or education, or...otherwise participating in
education or training under the immediate guidance or supervision of
such a person, but does not include time spent on unsupervised
preparation or study, whether at home or
otherwise&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want such training to be accredited, because we want to ensure that it
is useful. Some would argue that we could accredit any old thing. We
must ensure that that is not the case and that accredited training
helps people to get on and to improve their skill levels, rather than
keep them where they are and give them certificates for the hell of
it.</div>
					<a name="08020781000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have debated the importance of accrediting training undertaken by young
people alongside employment. That training needs to be for a period
sufficient to lead to an accredited qualification to help young people
to make progress in their careers, adapt to changes in the labour
market and provide skills demanded by employers and the economy. We
regard 280 hours a year as the minimum time that a young person needs
to achieve a further qualification by the time that they are 19. That
equates to roughly a day a week over the course of a year, although the
Bill does not prescribe that it must be delivered in that way. As ever,
we want to be flexible. Participating for less than an average of a day
a week would reduce a young person&#146;s likelihood of achieving a
worthwhile accredited qualification.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>
					<a name="08020781000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without clause 8 there would be
no minimum participation requirement for those young people undertaking
part-time training alongside employment. It also provides the
definition of guided learning, which I read out, and which is also
needed for clause 5 to clarify the type of learning in which young
people must participate alongside employment to fulfil their duty under
clause 2. Without clause 8 we could not ensure that young people access
appropriate learning for the amount of time necessary to gain an
accredited
qualification.</div>
					<a name="08020781000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
provision will not normally apply to apprenticeships, because they are
normally full-time. To reassure the hon. Member for South Holland and
The Deepings, programme-led apprenticeships will not count towards the
target of expanding apprenticeships that we announced. A person will be
counted only after he or she has a contract of employment.
Programme-led apprenticeships will be a useful pre-entry route for some
young people. The 90,000 extra apprenticeships that we want to develop
as we bring in this duty must involve a contract of
employment.</div>

							<a name="08020781000519"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I do not want to digress into apprenticeships, for
you would not allow me to do so, Mr. Bercow. I used
apprenticeships as an example owing to the doubts supported by evidence
and expressed by a number of people that in those programmes&#151;not
only programme-led apprenticeships, but level 2 and 3
apprenticeships&#151;there was insufficient mentoring and guided
learning. If that applied to apprenticeships, would it not apply all
the more so to other training? I think that the Minister has made it
clear that the Bill sets out a series of parameters. However, to be
even more helpful, how will that vary according to the size of
companies and sectors? Clearly different sectors of the workplace have
different imperatives and that it will be a much greater imposition on
very small companies than on very large
ones.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000520"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> There would be some flexibility, but in the end
all would have to be accredited. Accreditation must ensure that all the
factors have been got right and allow for the flexibility to appreciate
the different sectors. We are expanding the number of occupation
sectors to which apprenticeships would apply, some of which will by
necessity provide much more practical training, as he said. That is for
the accreditation to
define.</div>

Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): On a point of clarification.
I may have misunderstood the clause, or not read it clearly enough, but
is it possible that a young person could fulfil their obligations in
respect of this legislation by undertaking 280 hours of guided
learning, which, if we use a 40-week school year, equates to one day a
week, without doing anything else? In the Minister&#146;s previous
comments, he made it clear that the young person should also be
undertaking another occupation. I may not have understood it clearly
enough, but I wonder whether the clause can be interpreted as meaning
that the young person had totally fulfilled their obligations by doing
280 hours and nothing else.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Will the
Minister explain to the Committee the purpose of the clause and why it
is that we need the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to assign a
number of guided hours to every qualification? Is it to fulfil the
functions in clause 8 so that we know whether a particular
qualification requires 280 hours of guided learning? Will it,
therefore, apply to all existing QCA accredited qualifications, or will
it apply just to new qualifications? The clause does not make that
clear. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08020781000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
accreditation of a qualification under paragraph (g) of subsection (2)
must assign to the qualification a number of notional
hours&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear
to me whether that phrase requires the QCA to go through all several
hundred qualifications, in which case could the Minister say how many
qualifications are to be assigned those hours and what the cost to the
QCA would be? If the exercise is being conducted solely because of
clause 8, it is a very large commitment for the QCA to undertake simply
to fulfil one part of a Bill. If it is just new qualifications that are
to be assigned hours as part of the accreditation process, that begs
the question of how clause 8 will be fulfilled. How can people use
existing qualifications that do not have notional hours assigned to
them? An explanation from the Minister will be very
helpful.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000524"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> It is important that guided
learning hours are assigned to all qualifications so that it is easy
and clear for young people in full-time employment and their employers
to tell whether they are doing enough training to fulfil the duty to
participate. The QCA already assigns guided learning hours as part of
its accreditation process, but it is not legally required to do so. The
clause ensures that guided learning hours will continue to be assigned
to qualifications in the future. In answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, the QCA already does it in relation to all
the qualifications that it accredits. Therefore, we know the number of
guided learning hours for existing qualifications. By law, the QCA will
have to do it for all new qualifications. I think, therefore, the
issues of consistency and of burden are addressed for him.</div>
					<a name="08020781000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition of sufficient
part-time training in clause 8 relies on guided learning hours being
assigned to qualifications. Therefore, it is important to put beyond
doubt that that will continue to happen. The clause must stand part of
the Bill and I, therefore, ask the Committee to agree
it.</div>

legislation that it should do so, it seems as well to legislate to
ensure that it happens by statute rather than by my encouragement.
However, I do that confident in the notion that the QCA has already
assigned notional hours as part of the accreditation process for
pre-existing qualifications, so there will be no problems with the
inheritance of that responsibility. The QCA does it now, and it will be

have reached a landmark. We have cleared chapter 1 and raced on to
chapter 2. So, all hon. Members can feel reinvigorated that we have
passed the first hurdle. The next chapter deals with the duties on
local education authorities and educational institutions. Clause 10 is
important, establishing the duty on local education authorities to
promote the participation of young people in education or training in
their area who are subject to the duty to participate. There have been
many comments on the clause, which have led to this group of
amendments, starting with amendment No.
165.</div>
					<a name="08020781000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a nutshell,
most of the people who have made representations to us on the matter
are concerned about the imbalance between the responsibilities on young
people to comply with the obligations of the Bill, and the rather
looser ones on local authorities to ensure an appropriate supply of
places in order to allow the education and training option and perhaps
other forms of support to be taken
up.</div>
					<a name="08020781000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
special educational consortium was one of the bodies that made
representations to the Committee early on, indicating its concern about
the balance of responsibilities between individuals and local education
authorities. In a briefing note to the Committee issued jointly with
the Royal National Institute for Blind People, on 14 January, it stated
that:</div>
					<a name="08020781000089"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The duty
is so general as to be
unenforceable&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08020781000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
contrasted it unfavourably with the duty on young people, including the
penalties and criminal sanctions contained in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020781000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to make the duty upon local authorities clearer and more general,
in not constraining it only to education and training. The original
clause provides a
responsibility</div>
					<a name="08020781000092"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
promote the effective participation in education or training of persons

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>
					<a name="08020781000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment ensures that a local education authority is obliged to secure
a sufficient and appropriate supply of provisions to those persons.
Therefore, it not only provides a stronger requirement on local
authorities, but opens up some of those fourth option solutions about
which we were talking earlier, to ensure that support services other
than education or training are being provided, which might ensure that
young people can engage in the future with education and training.
Other amendments, tabled by the Conservative party, deal in slightly
different ways with the same consideration, including amendments Nos.
14, 84 and 148, to some
extent.</div>
					<a name="08020781000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there
have been concerns that the Bill should go even further and the duty
should be clearer. Therefore, we have tabled the amendment, which was
suggested to us in a representation sent by the Special Educational
Consortium, that other members of the Committee may have seen. It
places an explicit duty on local authorities to ensure that there are
sufficient and appropriate opportunities for young people in their area
to participate in education and training. The consortium sets out some
of its concerns, in particular that the needs of young people with
disabilities are often not met adequately and they often end up leaving
the education system at 16. It
says:</div>
					<a name="08020781000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Disability Rights Commission found that non-disabled young people are
twice as likely as their disabled peers to transfer to the sixth form
or college at 16
plus&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It said that has a
significant impact on life chances, and
continued:</div>
					<a name="08020781000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
the age of 19, 9 per cent. of non-disabled young people are not in
education, employment or training, but 27 per cent. of disabled young
people are in the same
category.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a significant concern, particularly for that group of young people,
although the amendment would apply to all those who would be caught by
the duty. It would impose an obligation on the local authority to
ensure a wide range of provision for all those youngsters who need it.
We will talk about some of those groups in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="08020781000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Special
Educational Consortium
said:</div>
					<a name="08020781000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe there needs to be a stronger duty on local authorities to
secure appropriate opportunities for young people in their area. As the
Bill is currently drafted, responsibilities fall disproportionately on
individual pupils with criminal sanctions for those who are not in
appropriate full-time education or
training.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">It believes

Gentleman makes the Special Educational Consortium&#146;s case
persuasively. I have also heard its case, and I agree that we must put
much greater emphasis on local authorities&#146; obligation to
provide support. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that support outside the
school for children with special educational needs and disabilities is
as crucial as that within it? Does he welcome the investment and
initiatives that the Secretary of State and Lord Adonis in the other
place have brought forward in the past 12 months to provide support to
those
families?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000529"></a>Mr.

outside the school or educational setting is as important, and we
welcome many of the measures in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>that area. Our point, and that of many of the bodies that have made
representations to us, is that there is still a big gap in reality
between the level of support needed and what is
available.</div>
					<a name="08020781000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
final part of its representations, the Special Educational Consortium
says that it
recognises</div>
					<a name="08020781000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the
duties set out in this amendment could not be implemented until the
funding and the responsibility are transferred to local
authorities&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
obviously requires further legislation. The consortium wants a
commitment from the Minister that when the Government introduce
legislative proposals, they will include a duty on local authorities to
secure sufficient and appropriate
provision.</div>
					<a name="08020781000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
groups that gave evidence to the Committee have made many similar
points. TreeHouse, a charity for those with autism, said in its
representations that there was a need to strengthen the
responsibilities on local authorities.</div>
					<a name="08020781000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We received detailed
representation from Barnardo&#146;s, which gave oral evidence to the
Committee. Sadly, its detailed amendments came to me slightly too late
to be included, but they seek a similar effect to amendment No. 165.
Barnardo&#146;s approaches the matter from a slightly different
perspective from that of Conservative Members because it is more
sympathetic than we are to the compulsion and criminalisation elements.
However, it agrees strongly that the Bill will work only if there is
appropriate provision for those hard-to-reach young people, and that it
needs to go beyond education and
training.</div>
					<a name="08020781000463"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08020781000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The paper
from Barnardo&#146;s to the Committee details the four priority areas
for expansion of existing services. It refers to the need for more
work-based learning&#151; particularly transitional provision to
reconnect the most disaffected and disengaged young people and to help
them to address barriers. It suggests that at the moment, support
services are not adequate for young people, which includes teenage
parents, young carers, young people with learning difficulties and
disabilities, and those with mental health problems. It also wants to
see an expansion in provision, with suitable routes for progression,
for young people with learning difficulties, many of whom drop out at
16 or take repeated courses.</div>
					<a name="08020781000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
widespread concern&#151;among both those who do not support the
existing compulsion and criminalisation and those who do&#151;that
there must be a greater acceptance by local authorities of their duties
to provide. There must be adequate funding, not only from central
Government but also from local authorities, to provide those services
that can often be very expensive.</div>
					<a name="08020781000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In earlier sittings, the
Minister acknowledged his willingness to open up the possibility of a
fourth option that does not restrain us to something that looks like
education and training in its narrowest sense. The clause indicates
that the obsession with activities to do with what we regard as
education and training, is very much there in the Bill. We want to
ensure that that is widened out so that young people who need other
routes back into education and training can have those routes opened up
to them&#151; in exceptional cases, even for long periods of
time&#151;and to ensure that there is a realistic pathway back into
education and training.</div>

							<a name="08020781000530"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> You certainly know,
Mr. Bercow, and the Minister may know of my interest in
matters to do with special educational needs and disability. Therefore,
I will not waste this opportunity to say a word about those interests
in relation to the amendment which, I think, does the hon. Member for
Yeovil great justice. It is right that at this juncture we should
consider the particular challenges facing employers and young people
who have disabilities or special educational needs. The two challenges
above all others are the attitudes of employers and young people. Many
of the barriers associated with getting young people with special
educational needs and disabilities into employment are due to
people&#146;s belief in their own potential. That can be greatly
assisted by the right kind of advice, guidance and support.</div>
					<a name="08020781000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have seen
at first hand&#151;as I am sure the Minister and other members of the
Committee will have done&#151;how young people with the most profound
challenges can be supported in employment. My hon. Friend the Member
for Upminster is a doughty champion of young people in her constituency
with those challenges. She was kind enough to introduce me to the
realistic opportunities for supported employment project, which she
never misses an opportunity to champion in the House&#151;I hope that
I am not stealing her thunder. That project takes people with very
profound difficulties and, using appropriate levels of support, places
them in work and gives training opportunities which, until seen, one
would scarcely believe possible. That one is an exemplar, but there are
projects like that up and down the country that must and will form part
of making the Bill a success.</div>
					<a name="08020781000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Yeovil rightly pointed out that the number of young disabled
people who are not in education, employment or training is a shockingly
high 27 per cent. If we are to place new duties on individuals,
employers and local authorities, we must be clear about the support and
resources that will be necessary to change attitudes both of young
people, who need to be enlivened and have their personal aspirations
rejuvenated, and of employers who must know what is expected of them to
make those opportunities possible.</div>
					<a name="08020781000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman quoted a number of organisations, and he could have quoted
many more, which support the thrust of what he said. I have had
discussions with a number of organisations representing disabled people
that share his concern that the Bill should be specific about the
duties on local authorities. Knowing your personal commitment and
interest in these matters, Mr. Bercow, I know that you will
take a great interest, as I do, in this part of our
considerations.</div>
					<a name="08020781000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is a useful addition to our consideration and it may be something that
the Government want to reflect on further. Again, it concerns
sufficient appropriate provision. This word &#147;appropriate&#148;
is coming to punctuate our considerations. It seems that
&#147;meaningful&#148; and &#147;appropriate&#148; are
sometimes more useful ways of expressing this kind of opportunity than
&#147;relevant&#148; because, as I said earlier,
&#147;relevant&#148; is a rather loaded term.</div>
					<a name="08020781000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution and I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I hope that the Bill, for
all its faults&#151;we all have our doubts about it&#151;will, at
the very least, act as a catalyst for engagement with training and
employment on the part of young, challenged, disabled and disadvantaged
young people.</div>

						</b> I absolutely agree that the key
to the success of this policy will be ensuring that there is an
appropriate&#151;the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
will be delighted that I use that word&#151;worthwhile and engaging
learning place for every young person, including those with special
educational needs. The amendment would reduce the duty of the local
authority to solely that of securing appropriate provision. While that
is clearly an important part of ensuring that all young people
participate, the duty set out in clause 10 is currently much wider than
that, and is not confined to any one local authority function. It could
encompass economic development or regeneration activity, or the local
authority&#146;s responsibility for careers guidance for 16 to
19-year-olds, as provided for in the Employment and Training Act 1973,
and other activities that are not directly linked to the securing of
provision for education and training. Those broader functions are
essential for promoting the culture of participation and achievement
that Opposition Members are in favour of.</div>
					<a name="08020781000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
interesting points were raised in the debate, particularly about those
with special educational needs. The hon. Member for Yeovil said that
the legislation was very vague and insufficient in terms of the duties
on local authorities. I remind him of some of the other duties
contained in the Bill. From Royal Assent, whenever that may be, and
subject to the will of Parliament, there will be measures relating to
support functions, such as clause 54, on the duty to provide Connexions
services. There will be a duty to arrange assessments of the learning
difficulties of young people with statements who intend to leave school
and access post-16 education or training. From commencement in 2013
there will be functions relating to raising the participation age, such
as the duty to promote fulfilment of the duty to participate in clause
10. Clause 12 imposes the duty to make arrangements to identify young
people who are not participating. There are also duties in clauses 39
and 41 that relate to attendance notices and in clause 42 concerning
attendance panels, and so on. There will be a commissioning provision
from 2010-11, which will be transferred to local authorities from the
Learning and Skills Council.</div>
					<a name="08020781000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of clause 10, I am
sure that the Committee has noticed that clause 18
specifies:</div>
					<a name="08020781000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
exercising its functions under this Part, a local education authority
must have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of
State.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
guidance, which would obviously be statutory guidance that the local
authority would have to follow, would include such things as an
explanation of how these duties differ from those for children of
compulsory school age. It would also include links with the Connexions
service, the minimum requirements for the tracking service used by
Connexions and, crucially, an explanation of the requirements on young
people, parents, learning providers and employers and the local
authority&#146;s powers and responsibilities for ensuring that those
are met. It is there that we will set out the local authority&#146;s
duties with regard to young people with special educational
needs.</div>

Knight:
						</b> No. As I have set out, I object to the fact that
it defines the local authority&#146;s duty more narrowly than we
would want. It is vital that the local authority secures a sufficient
and appropriate provision of services for young people to ensure that
they can fulfil their duty, but I do not want to close it down solely
to that, as I have said in my comments. With regard to young people
with special educational needs, I argue that raising the participation
age will be particularly important in ensuring that they have the
opportunities to participate and do so. There is a good instance of us
using that as a catalyst&#151;I think that that was the phrase used
by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings&#151;to secure
better provision.</div>

attitude and the catalyst that he described. Does he agree with me that
it is particularly important that local authorities take up that
message as well and take advantage of the various initiatives that are
coming forward from the Government, and does he share the concern that
some of the support that was given in the past on a ring-fenced basis
will no longer be
available?</div>

important that local authorities continue to deliver for that section
of their population, particularly now that we are in common with the
local government White Paper on trusting local authorities to respond
more flexibly to the needs of their population by removing
ring-fencing. However, we will be introducing other things as well,
such as the foundation learning tier, which I have mentioned on a
number of occasions, and the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s
national strategy for improving opportunities for young people with
learning difficulties and disabilities. Obviously, the Learning and
Skills Council&#146;s responsibilities will to some extent be
transferred to local authorities.</div>

The Deepings referred to the realistic opportunities for supported
employment project, which is run from Havering college of further and
higher education. What has been so surprising about the success of that
course is not the success of the students, which we would all have
predicted, but the willingness and even enthusiasm of local employers
to become part of the scheme. What started as an outreach from the
college to persuade employers to give the students a chance has been
completely turned on its head, as the employers are now approaching the
college to ask if they have any student replacements. That project is
an example of good practice that could be disseminated up and down the
country.</div>

						</b> I repeat for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman
what I have already said. The amendment would reduce the duty on the
local authority to one of securing appropriate provision. Although that
is clearly important, there are other local authority functions that
can help to achieve the change to the culture of participation, such as
their economic development or careers guidance duties, which I
mentioned. Those would be precluded by the amendment. Clause 10
states:</div>
					<a name="08020781000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
local education authority in England must ensure that its functions
are...exercised so as to promote the effective participation in

					<a name="08020781000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording, &#147;its
functions&#148;, is as wide as that. That is why the measure has

						</b> Does that mean that all other local authority
functions must be seen in the light of promoting participation? Will we
not have refuse collected because that would not promote effective
participation? That is the essence of the Minister&#146;s argument
against the amendment. He says that it would narrow every other local
authority duty to the one duty, which is an absurd interpretation, just
as my tongue-in-cheek remark about clause 10 and refuse collection is
absurd.</div>

to this discussion, especially in the context of special educational

health problems. Clearly, not very many people with serious mental
health problems get work&#151;as few as 7 per cent. of people with
schizophrenia do so. Does the Minister have plans for that in the Bill?
We are talking about &#147;sufficient and appropriate&#148;
provision, so now might be a suitable time to comment on that point.
Has the Minister thought about how young people with mental health
needs can be helped into work?</div>

that the duty will create apply to every young person, regardless of
their circumstances and needs, including people with mental health
difficulties. We signalled in the children&#146;s plan that we are
concerned about how well child and adolescent mental health services
join up with other services. We will look this year at how we can
sharpen CAMHS up. Local authorities and their strategic partners in
their localities should ensure that such individuals get sufficient

by the Minister. I am usually moderately or mildly reassured, but on
this occasion I do not feel reassured at all. He has attempted to stamp
his ministerial boots on my amendment by suggesting that it would
weaken the duties in the Bill and that he is worried that local
authorities could not do all the things that they could under clause
10. However, I feel that he rather underlined the weakness of his
argument when he cited parts of clause 10 in his response. Let us
remind ourselves how vague is the wording that my amendment would
remove:</div>

					<a name="08020781000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is pretty
weak and vague. It talks about the generality of local

appropriate supply of
provision&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08020781000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is what
amendment No. 165 would require. The Minister said that he had no

						</b> In fairness to the hon.
Gentleman, I probably should have made it clear that the Learning and
Skills Council has such a duty now. We signalled that we will
legislate&#151;perhaps during the next Session&#151;on transfers
from the LSC to local authorities, but under section 2 of the Learning
and Skills Act 2000, the council has a duty to ensure learning
provision for 16 to 19-year-olds. In particular, section 2(1) states
that the</div>

therefore sets out many of things that he is seeking. In correspondence
with us, the Special Education Consortium sought reassurance that those
duties incumbent on the LSC will be transferred to local
authorities.</div>

moment.</div>
					<a name="08020781000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
finish my earlier points, I think that the Minister was saying that he
does not want to displace the existing wording with the new, much
clearer and firmer, wording because of the various other duties on
local authorities. He cited economic development departments and so on,
although it is not entirely clear how effective and powerful the clause
will be in relation to those other duties. Then he cited various other
clauses under which duties are placed on local authorities, such as
clause 54. He also mentioned Connexions and statementing. However, our
amendment would not remove any of those requirements under later
clauses. It would be an addition and provide a stronger and firmer
commitment to</div>
					<a name="08020781000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;secure a
sufficient and appropriate supply of
provision&#148;,</div>

that that is not restrained to education and training
only.</div>
					<a name="08020781000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am inclined to
press my amendment to a Division, unless the Minister can reassure us
that he is prepared to return and place that duty in the
Bill&#151;after all, he said today that he does not disagree with the
wording&#151;or provide the reassurance, in clear and unambiguous
terms, sought by the Special Education Consortium. I shall make it
clear what that would require. In its representation, from which I
quoted earlier, the consortium said that it</div>
					<a name="08020781000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recognised that these duties
would require the transfer of responsibilities from the Learning and
Skills Council to local authorities requiring further
legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It said that it would
welcome a commitment from the Minister that when the Government
introduces legislative proposals they will include a duty on local
authorities, which is the first point, to secure sufficient and
appropriate provision that those words are important, which is the
second point. The third point is that sufficient and appropriate
provision must relate to not only education and training, but to
provision in its widest sense. If the Minister feels that he is in a
position to indicate that the legislation would include a duty,
it should be in the form of those words: &#147;sufficient and
appropriate...provision&#148;. Such a measure should not simply
be constrained to education and training. It would be helpful if the
Minister could address that, as it would not then be necessary to press
the amendment to a

							<a name="08020781000569"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in
clause 10, page 5, line 36, at
end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) In exercising
its functions in subsection (1), a local authority must ensure that it
promotes the effective participation of persons belonging to its area
to whom this Part applies and who have special educational
needs.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment also deals with issues about provision in respect of young
people with special educational needs. What is the reason for the
amendment? There is currently a lack of clarity about who is
responsible for ensuring transition to post-16 education and training
for SEN students. The Green Paper &#147;Raising Expectations: Staying
in Education and Training Post-16&#148;,
states:</div>
					<a name="08020781000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
must ensure that there is appropriate provision and support in place to
enable those with Special Educational Needs (SEN) to continue in
learning. This can be a particular issue at the point of transition.
The system of support that has been in place stops when the young
person leaves school and sometimes there can be a gap before new
arrangements are made in the post-16 provider they transfer
to.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Green Paper says
that the Learning and Skills Council will consult on this issue, but it
has no direct responsibility for school-college transition&#151;a
point to which the Minister may wish to respond. That responsibility
lies with Connexions, as the hon. Gentleman implied in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>a previous debate when he was trying to persuade us that appropriate and
sufficient provision was somehow narrower and weaker than effective
participation&#151;curious argument that I did not entirely follow
and clearly did not
support.</div>
					<a name="08020781000465"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08020781000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Connexions service begins with the section 140 assessment and, where
appropriate, a special educational needs transition review. Under the
Bill, responsibility for Connexions transfers to local authorities and
the amendment provides for local authorities to have a specific
obligation to ensure effective participation on the part of SEN
students. Essentially, it would further strengthen the circumstances
surrounding those young people with special educational needs against a
background in which we know that they often do not get the chances that
they warrant. I hope that on that basis the Minister will accept the
amendment, and we can deal with these matters very
briefly.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000570"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I will struggle to add anything to the previous
debate, as we are setting out to ensure that all young people have the
opportunity to participate and be engaged in education or training.
Clause 10 puts the duty on local authorities to promote participation
for all 16 and 17-year-olds, including those with special educational
needs. It will transfer commissioning responsibilities from the
Learning and Skills Council to local authorities, which will have a
responsibility all the way through to 19. It is precisely to capture
the needs of vulnerable young people, especially in respect of the
transition, that we want to bring those responsibilities up to the age
of 19 into the remit of local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08020781000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
little more I can say to satisfy the hon. Member for South Holland and
The
Deepings.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000571"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Perhaps I can help the Minister. He can say a great
deal more, specifically about transition arrangements. He should be
able to speak about that for hours.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000572"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> As I said, we have the transfer of responsibility
to local authorities from the Learning and Skills Council. Section 140
of the 2000 Act becomes, in effect, clause 65 of this Bill, which gives
responsibility for section 140 assessments to local authorities. That
will help transition because local authorities that currently have
responsibility pre-16 will now also have responsibility post-16. We are
consulting on the responsibility for provision and the transfer to
local authorities so that transition, for the important reasons given
by the hon. Gentleman, can be smoothed as part of the local
authority&#146;s duty under clause 10 to promote participation for
all 16 and 17-year-olds.</div>
					<a name="08020781000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I have not spoken at
great length in response to the interesting points that the hon.
Gentleman made, I hope that what I said is sufficient for him to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000573"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am not entirely satisfied. I do not want to
over-egg this pudding. The hon. Member for Yeovil was unpersuaded by
the Minister&#146;s argument.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000574"></a>Angela
Watkinson:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that participation
rates among this group of students are likely to be high? They are
certainly not difficult to reach. So many of them would otherwise be
condemned to a life of inactivity and boredom that they, more than
perhaps any other section of the 10 per cent. that we are trying to
reach, will welcome these opportunities. Having said that, there will
be huge cost implications in making provision for
them.</div>
					<a name="08020781000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000575"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Yes. My hon. Friend is right. I described two
challenges earlier: the challenge of persuading young people that they
had the opportunity to fulfil their potential and the challenge to
employers in persuading them to engage with young people. My hon.
Friend is right to point out also that once that process has begun, it
accelerates rapidly. Once employers know what can be done, they want to
do more. The ROSE project makes that case very powerfully. Once young
people have opportunities presented to them, I think that they will
accept them with enthusiasm, for the sort of reasons that she gave.
That does not make it any less challenging. That is why the amendment
strengthens the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020781000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am surprised
that the Minister finds the proposal alarming. The historical record of
helping people with disabilities and special educational needs is not
an altogether glowing one. I do not speak of this Government; I speak
Governments per se. It is not as if we could say with confidence that
all young people with disabilities and special educational needs are
getting what they are due. The reason for some indignation in my tone
is that I could not sanction&#151;I do not suggest that the Minister
is guilty of this&#151;any complacency in this regard. As a nation we
have a patchy record in special educational needs provision and the
treatment of disabled people in employment and learning opportunities.
That is not a partisan matter, but it is a matter of real concern to
members of the Committee and the
House.</div>
					<a name="08020781000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000576"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am sorry if I gave any impression of
complacency. We know there is a strong correlation between not being in
education or training and other risk factors such as 16 to 19-year-olds
with learning difficulties and disabilities. That is why we are
currently investing &#163;19 million in a transition support
programme for young people with special educational needs. That is why
the Learning and Skills Council has been consulting on changes to SEN
provision in FE and workplace-based learning, post 16, following the
recommendation of the Little review that it should develop a national
strategy for the collaborative delivery of provision for this group of
learners. My only criticism of the amendment is that it is superfluous.
The duty defined in the clause already allows for exactly what the
amendment identifies, which I agree is necessary. I hope, on that
basis, that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment
rather than press it to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="08020781000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000577"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The amendment builds into the Bill a specific
obligation. The Minister has repeated what he said in the debate on the
last amendment: that the duty to ensure effective participation is
sufficient. My judgment is that we need to, to use a word that he is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>fond of using, galvanise the system. When he says galvanise I think he
really means catalyse. To galvanise means to copper-bottom something
and introducing a catalyst is to give it a boost. However, for the sake
of argument, let us use galvanise. We need to galvanise this aspect of
the Bill&#146;s provisions because of our doubts, which are born of
our understanding and experience of the historical treatment of
disabled people and particularly those with special educational
needs.</div>
					<a name="08020781000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Yeovil argued in respect of the previous amendment, I think,
that the more insistent that we can be and the Bill can be on these
matters, the better. We must not be found wanting in any way, shape or
form when it comes to people who are the most challenged. The mark of a
civilised society is how it deals with those who are least fortunate. I
will not stint from making the case on behalf of those people, in this
Committee or elsewhere. If I sound uncharacteristically intemperate, it
is only because of my enthusiasm and my fierceness in defence of the
gentle.</div>
					<a name="08020781000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000578"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> We share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s enthusiasm
for specifying provision in respect of people with learning
difficulties. That is why we have a whole clause&#151;clause
65&#151;dealing with assessment for people with learning
difficulties. That is why Connexions and local authorities will
continue to offer support to young people with learning difficulties
until their 25th birthday. However, I would argue that the amendment is
superfluous. On the basis of the commitment that I have offered the
hon. Gentleman with regard to these young people, I hope that he will
not press the amendment to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="08020781000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000579"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I do not doubt the Minister&#146;s integrity on
this matter. I would not want to suggest that there are doubts about
it. I think that this matter can unite the Committee, as it unites the
House. As I said, I do not think that this is a partisan
matter.</div>
					<a name="08020781000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put it
bluntly, However, I think that the more demanding we can be in respect
of the interests of young people with special educational needs, the
better. Having been involved with and interested in these matters for
more than 20 years, as a county councillor and as an MP, I will take a
lot of persuading that any but the most demanding provisions are likely
to yield consistently high-quality provision for people with special
educational needs.</div>
					<a name="08020781000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
that end, I am minded to press the amendment. It might not be perfectly
worded because we are imperfect creatures who have fallen from a state
of grace. Therefore, it may be that the Minister, if and when we do
press it, reflects on it over time to see whether the Government can
come back at a later stage of our considerations with a renewed
enthusiasm for strengthening the Bill in the way that the hon. Member
for Yeovil and I have articulated. I would therefore
love&#151;perhaps love is too strong. I would like to press the
amendment to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="08020781000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000580"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> I would like to add a word of
support for my hon. Friend. For those with mental health problems,
there is a quality of provision that could be available that is not
available at present. The Minister might find it of interest if I
explain the sort of thing that I have in mind.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>
					<a name="08020781000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Southend,
Rethink Severe Mental Illness has an employment agency on the top floor
of a building. Below it is a pet supplies shop and at the back of the
building is a warehouse. The organisation trains people with mental
health problems upstairs in the employment agency and then starts them
on retail in the pet supplies shop. If that goes well, so be it; if it
does not, they are given an opportunity in the warehouse. Once they
have the frame of mind and the discipline needed for work, they are
given placements at businesses in the community, using the same sort of
approach that my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster talked about in
relation to other
groups.</div>
					<a name="08020781000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specialist
provision such as that, provided by charities or voluntary bodies, is
incredibly helpful for some of the most vulnerable people in our
society. Is there provision in the Bill to put a duty on local
authorities to co-operate and consult with charities and voluntary
bodies of that sort, to ensure that the sort of provision that is made
is not just a college place, which might not be suitable, or a rather
feeble work placement, but something solid and sufficient for this sort
of group? I support the amendment not because I think that the wording
is right, but because I hope that it will galvanise the system not just
for the able-bodied and those who are fortunate, but for some of the
most vulnerable people in our society&#151;not just those who cannot
read, write and add up, but those who have mental health
problems.</div>

refer to comments by my hon. Friends the Members for Upminster and for
South Holland and The Deepings about the ROSE project. I responded to
the invitation from my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster to visit
that project, which is run by Havering College of further and higher
education. I saw a young woman with severe learning difficulties who
was engaged in the project at a branch of Sainsbury&#146;s in the
Brewery retail park at Romford. It was inspiring to see her at work,
because the challenge of filling shelves was developing her intellect.
She was developing in other areas as well, and in time, she would be
able to take a bus from home to work by herself. That was absolutely
inspiring, but what was particularly impressive was the enthusiasm of

employers, too, including a franchisee who ran several

					<a name="08020781000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
10 is the key clause in the Bill. It imposes a duty on local
authorities to promote participation in education and training. In
theory, that should mean that local authorities have a duty to ensure
that there is sufficient educational provision to help young people to
fulfil their duty to participate. That was the essence of the debate on
the previous two amendments. Although there are other duty provisions
about support services in the Bill, and other duties elsewhere in
legislation generally about the provision of education, there is no
specific duty linking the provision of educational facilities with the
duty of all young people to
participate.</div>
					<a name="08020781000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a danger, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The
Deepings said in relation to the previous amendment, pf complacency. A
local authority might take the view that its education and training
provision is just fine, and it will focus on exercising its duty under
clause 10 by monitoring 16 and 17-year-olds and pursuing penalties: it
will concentrate on the second part of the sentence in clause 10,
rather than the first part. I remember the director of education in the
local education authority in my constituency telling me that there were
no weak schools in his area only a month before two comprehensive
schools were put into special measures. Either he did not know what was
going on in his area, or he has very low standards regarding adequate
provision in that
area.</div>

the people whom this duty is most likely to affect&#151;the 16 and

education or a job with training&#151;are likely to have a wider
range of needs than the rest of the population of that age. It seems
right therefore to impose a duty on local authorities, as part of the
requirement to promote participation under clause 10, to look at
themselves annually to ensure that the young people on whom this
legislation is most likely to impact are catered for by the education
and training provision in the local authority area. Amendment No. 84

and not be distracted by new mnemonics for NEETs such as NETWAs and
NOTWETs&#151;there are all manner of things we could discuss if we
were so minded. The Learning and Skills Council has a duty to ensure
16-to-19 provision. That role includes auditing the provision available
in an area, assessing demand from young people, and planning provision
to meet that demand. It is clear that the LSC takes its duties very
seriously in that regard, and so do local authorities regarding the
pre-16 age group. In June last year, we announced that in future the
funding and responsibility 16-to-19 provision would be transferred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>from the LSC to local authorities. In one of our evidence-taking

need to look very coldly and calmly at the provision being made,

that what we have matches what is

we agree with both the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton

does not make sense to put the duty on local authorities before we have
legislated and make them responsible for commissioning the
provision&#151;that would put them in a difficult position and we
have not even consulted on the best ways of making that transfer. We
have always said that we could not require all young people to
participate until we believe that there is a suitable route available
for everyone in every area of the country. That is why we are not
raising the participation age until 2013, when the national entitlement
to the new diplomas and the apprenticeship guarantee will be in place,
and the foundation learning tier for provision at entry and level 1
will be established. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that we
must go through an important sequencing to deliver by 2013. The

me well throughout my life, including 13 years as an accountant with
KPMG&#151;which comes to 15,000 extra students. The

4.43</div>
					<a name="08020781000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We estimate that if we
introduce compulsory participation to age 17 in 2013 there will be
around 5,000 more 16 and 17 year olds in schools that year than there
will be next year (the 07/08 academic year), and in 2015, when the age
would be raised to 18, there will be around 15,000 more in schools than
in 07/08. All of this growth is accounted for by the already planned
growth in Academies, most of which will have sixth
forms.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">That makes 20,000

					<a name="08020781000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;And in relation to FE
we estimate that if we were to introduce compulsory participation to 17
in 2013, 13,000 additional places would be needed compared to next
academic year (07/08), and then on raising the age to 18 in 2015,
another 31,000 more would be needed on top of that.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is 13,000 plus 31,000, which means

regard to new full-time education, the Government predict 20,000 more
places in schools and 44,000 more college places. That is 64,000 places
in total, of which just under a third would be in schools. When the
Government imply that the majority of the new provision will be in FE
colleges, they are technically correct, but I think that most people
implicitly understand that few of those places would be in schools,
because the Government keep emphasising that the Bill is not about
raising the school leaving age to 18.</div>
					<a name="08020781000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final part of the jigsaw is
the number of 16 and 17-year-olds in work-based learning. According to
figure 4.3 on page 31 of the Green Paper, there was an increase in that
total from 97,000 in 2007-08 to 141,000 in 2015-16, which is an
increase of 44,000. If one adds together the 20,000 school places, the
54,000 college places and the 44,000 work-based learning places, one
reaches 128,000, which is just over 10 per cent. of the 16 and
17-year-old cohort and therefore about right. My concern is that 64,000
new college places means 426 places per local authority and 133 school
places per local authority, which makes 559 student places per local
authority, rather than the 100 referred to by the Minister. I am sure
that I have misunderstood either some of those numbers or the
Minister&#146;s answer to his hon. Friend&#146;s question, so it
would be helpful if he clarified the position.</div>

overnight or between now and 2015. I have just said that, in FE in
2013, we estimate that 13,000 additional places will be needed compared
with this year, and in 2015 another 31,000 places will be needed. In my
reckoning, that does not bring to mind that number of colleges. We have
not averaged it out throughout local authorities by dividing by 150
because colleges do not tend to relate in the same way to local
authorities. Nevertheless, the current capacity of colleges in FE
spread throughout the country can cope with the numbers. Obviously,
some capital commitments in FE will go towards increasing the
capacity.</div>

						</b> We expect about 15,000 more 16 and 17-year-olds in
school in 2015, so the provision of post-16 sixth forms will require a
modest expansion. However, as I set out in evidence, that will be an
average per local authority of 50 per cohort. That is extremely modest,
and I do not anticipate swathes of new sixth forms or sixth form
colleges cropping up throughout the country which we would have to
fund.</div>
					<a name="08020781000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
slightly complicated issue of the proportion of additional participants
who might be doing A-levels, we have calculated the figures on some of
our assumptions of economic benefit by looking at the level of
qualification that non-participants achieved at the point at which they
stopped participating and what individuals with a similar level of
qualification are going on to study. On that basis, about one fifth of
16-year-olds and one quarter of 17-year-olds have reached level 2 at
the point of leaving school, when they do not participate. The vast
majority&#151;83 per cent.&#151;of those 16 and 17-year-olds who
reach level 2 opt to do A-levels, but they are not the only ones who do
so. Among 16 and 17-year-olds leaving school with no qualifications, 11
per cent. go on to do A-levels, probably with extra support to reach
that level. Similarly, among the 16 and 17-year-olds leaving school
with below level 2 qualifications, 23 per cent. make the leap to
A-levels. On the basis of that level of prior attainment for
non-participants, we have been able to assume that 31 per cent. would
go on to do
A-levels.</div>

						</b> Presumably, the one fifth of 16-year-olds and one
quarter of 17-year-olds who go on to do A-levels after they leave
school, do that without being compelled to by legislation. Therefore,
they are likely to be more motivated, and perhaps more able, than the
10 per cent. of the cohort that we are trying to address in the
legislation. Why does the Minister assume that the same proportions of
this 10 per cent. will pursue these qualifications as a result of the
legislation? That is a cumbersome and long way of asking a simple
question. Are those people leaving school at 16 and 17 to go on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>to sixth form college, and do they therefore count as leaving school? Or

provided that, and it is evidence-based. I would certainly argue that
this 10 per cent. cohort would be less able. If we know that one fifth
of 16-year-olds and one quarter of 17-year-olds who are not
participating have achieved level 2, we know that they are of the same
ability as other people who have achieved level 2 who are
participating. They are certainly capable of going on to do
A-levels.</div>
					<a name="08020781000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
A-levels are deemed to be a strong choice for people who stay on. If we
can motivate them by whatever means to carry on in education or
training, we think that it is fair to make some assumptions on the
basis of the prior attainment of people who are
participating.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000607"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> That is a curious argument, because it presumes
that all those who leave at 16 would, if compelled to stay on, welcome
that compulsion. Some people who leave school at 16 want to do so. A
measure of their attainment at 16 is not the same thing as a measure of
their desire to continue learning, is
it?</div>

							<a name="08020781000608"></a>Jim

again?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000609"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I shall explain more simply. Some of the people who
currently leave at 16, who will be compelled under the Bill to stay on,
leave because they face all kinds of challenges and difficulties. For
all sorts of peer group and perhaps family reasons they do not stay on,
but would rather like to, given a reasonable amount of
encouragement.</div>
					<a name="08020781000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
people who leave at 16 do so because they want to get out and do
something else. Differentiating between those groups is critical to the
modelling described by the Minister, because the assumption that
underpins it is that prior attainment is more significant than
desire.</div>
					<a name="08020781000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000610"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I accept that the modelling is predicated more on
ability than motivation, if that is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
But we do not have any better data on which to model. Anything else
would be, to use Alison Wolf&#146;s phrase, &#147;a
hunch&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality is, before we get too preoccupied by the matter, that the
change in the assumption makes very little difference to the overall
economic benefit. We have looked at various other ways that are more
hunch-like and we did not see massive differences to the economic
benefit. Certainly, they would pass the Treasury prescription on
legislation, even if we assume that all leavers went on to do
vocational qualifications or GCSEs. I hope that that answer satisfies
hon.
Members.</div>
				
					<a name="08020781000468"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="08020781000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
straight answer to the question put by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton is, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>obviously, that we do not know how many people will go on to do
A-levels. They will have a whole new set of qualification choices by
then, but to satisfy the perfectly legitimate requirements of
Parliament for us to conduct an impact assessment, we have made some
assumptions based on what we know. There are many known unknowns and
unknown unknowns that we have to grapple with as we gaze into the
crystal ball.</div>
					<a name="08020781000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
determining the resources required by schools and colleges, we expect
that local authorities will have regard to their duty to promote
participation, as they will have regard to all of their duties. The
amendment makes assumptions about how the funding system will operate
when the transfer of resources from the Learning and Skills Council to
local authorities is implemented from 2010-11. That is premature, given
that the details of the new funding system will be subject to
consultation in the spring. These changes should be implemented from
the academic year 2010-11, well before plans to raise the participation
age, and they will fundamentally change the funding system. Those
changes will require primary legislation, which we will bring before
the House in due course, including amendments to the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998. It would be premature to make detailed
alterations of primary legislation now, before that comes into place.
Yet again, for the sake of proper sequencing, I ask the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw his amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000611"></a>Mr.

						</b> On the last point, I take on board the
Minister&#146;s argument, as I did on the previous amendment, and I
will withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08020781000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the substance of the debate, the Minister overestimates the benefits.
If the economic benefits have been calculated on the assumption that 27
per cent. of 16-year-olds and 34 per cent.&#151;a third&#151;of
17-year-olds will take A-levels, and if Alison Wolf believes that that
assumption would exaggerate the benefits quite substantially, it would
be interesting, as the hon. Member for Yeovil said, to call back
Professor Wolf to address those points, given the new information and
arguments that have been put to us. She says in her
pamphlet:</div>
					<a name="08020781000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
know from a variety of...sources that those who are realistically
able to take A-levels almost universally do so
already.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also underestimates the costs. During the evidence-taking
sessions the hon. Member for Sedgefield
asked:</div>
					<a name="08020781000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;do you think you
will have enough suitable people by 2013 and 2015 for all the young

					<a name="08020781000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer was based on
100 per cohort&#151;I accept that that related to schools
only&#151;but we are actually talking about 133 school places per
authority and 426 college places per local authority. Those are
substantial numbers, and I wonder whether the Government have
underestimated the implications for those institutions. I have made
that point during the debate, so the Minister need not respond again
now, but having tested the arguments and brought these issues to the
attention of the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000613"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I understand your concern to not go back over other
ground, Mr. Bercow. I want to raise a fresh issue that is
relevant to the clause and to ask whether it would be reasonable to ask
the Minister to respond
briefly.</div>
					<a name="08020781000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
deals with local authority responsibilities in relation to helping
young people to be in education, training, and employment with
education and training. I want to ask whether any duties will be placed
on local authorities in relation to financial support for young people,
which is something that we have not considered so far. I cannot see
another point in the Bill on which there will be an opportunity to
discuss this issue
directly.</div>
					<a name="08020781000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some outside
organisations have raised concerns about the lack of any specific
detail in the Bill on the future of the educational maintenance
allowance and the provision of support for fees. We assume that all the
courses that we are talking about will be exempt. Later in the Bill,
there is provision to deal with the cost of books, equipment and
materials for 19-year-olds and above. That could be relevant for people
whose parents are not willing to support them financially beyond the
age of 16. Issues have been raised about whether local authorities will
have hardship grants to deal with such issues. Presumably, some young
people will stay in settings beyond the age of 16 where uniforms are
required. There are concerns about financial provision in that area.
There are issues about the loss of earnings that might result for some
young people from sticking to the duties in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08020781000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have indicated that they will have to look in detail at what
responsibilities will fall to them and to local government in relation
to the educational maintenance allowance. Its original purpose was to
support young people and to galvanise them into staying in education
post-16. As a consequence of the compulsion in the Bill, they will have
to stay on, but the Government have not indicated how they intend to
frame the future of the EMA to allow for the change from volunteerism
to compulsion. There has been some hint of significant changes, but no
further detail from the Government of which I am
aware.</div>
					<a name="08020781000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
to know not only what thinking there is on these issues, but, in
relation to the clause, whether local authorities will have
responsibilities to fund any of that support, and whether any duties
will be imposed on
them.</div>
					<a name="08020781000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000614"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The EMA is, of course, important. It is
referred to in paragraphs 5.39 and 5.40 of the impact assessment, which
gives a helpful description of EMAs
as</div>
					<a name="08020781000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means tested weekly
payments currently made directly to 16-19 year olds in education or
unwaged training.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>
					<a name="08020781000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is described as a &#147;something for something&#148; incentive.
Clearly, there will need to be changes because the EMA was introduced
to encourage people to stay in full-time education or training. We are
changing the law in that area, so we will have to change the way in
which EMAs work to respond to
that.</div>
					<a name="08020781000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">EMAs have been
successful in raising participation for 16-year-olds. Between 2003-04
and 2004-05, they increased participation by 3.7 per cent., which is
highly significant. EMAs are one of the only things to have worked in
addressing the problem NEETs. Given their success, we want them to
continue in some form. We will need to look at the structure of
financial support to ensure that it continues to be as effective as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08020781000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
we have raised the participation age, it will be essential to ensure
that financial circumstances are not a barrier to participation. The
hon. Member for Yeovil is right about some of the issues, such as
learning materials and transport. The EMAs are quite important to some
families in securing transport, for
example.</div>
					<a name="08020781000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000615"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> In dealing with how EMAs could change under the new
proposals, does the Minister envisage there being the same level of
financial support per young person? Who will administer the
EMAs?</div>
					<a name="08020781000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000616"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> At this point&#151;several years off and in
another spending period&#151;it is impossible for me to make
commitments on what the level will be. Naturally, we will be mindful of
the success of EMAs at the current level. I would not envisage that we
would be looking to reduce the financial support to the sorts of people
who have been receiving EMAs as they are. Indeed, we have been
extending EMAs to people on the entry to employment programme. If
anything, we are looking to deepen the benefits of EMAs, rather than
dilute them.</div>
					<a name="08020781000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
ensure that the financial constraints are not a barrier. As for who
will administer the EMAs, they are currently administered on our behalf
by the Learning and Skills Council. When we publish consultations on
how we will implement the transfer of commissioning from the LSC to
local authorities, we will need to give some indication of how they
will be administered. At this stage, I am not in a position to be able
to give the hon. Gentleman the sort of answer that would even mildly
satisfy him on the Laws scale of
satisfaction.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000617"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> Would the clause be justiciable? If I was a person
with a special need of some sort or some desire for a particular kind
of education, would I be able to sue the council on the basis that it
had not exercised its functions to promote my effective participation
in education or
training?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000620"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> On the justiciability of the clause, I would liken
it more to the current duties on a local authority to provide
schooling. It would be treated in law in a similar way as the
justiciability of local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>authorities in respect of the provision of schooling. That is a good
example of the general duties elsewhere in law that are similar to
those in the clause. I would expect the courts to deal with them in a
similar
way.</div>

							<a name="08020781000621"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Bercow, for
your patience and to the Minister for his comments. This short debate
highlights the fact that there is little bit of a hole in the Bill in
relation to the detail of future financial support for young people.
There seems to be uncertainty about how the EMA will survive. In the
section of the impact assessment to which the Minister referred, there
is a comment about the Government looking at how they can strengthen
the link of these payments to behaviour and attainment. I am not sure
what that means. I did not pick up any response from the Minister about
issues of hardship grants and how young people might be helped with
costs that previously would fall quite often to their parents, but that
their parents might be less willing to engage with post
16.</div>
					<a name="08020781000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000622"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Learner hardship grants are available separately
from EMAs, as I recall. They are slightly more flexible than EMAs,
which have a particular point of assessment, and I certainly foresee
those continuing. Obviously we could have waited a considerable time
and changed the sequence in which we legislated to do this. However, we
thought that it was important to put the basic legislation in place to
raise the participation age now so that the cohort currently in year 6
goes into secondary school with the expectation that they will
carry on learning. Undoubtedly, there are unanswered questions and we
have to be upfront about those. One of those is around financial
support, but we are committed to ensuring not only that there is an
engaging choice of worthwhile learning options, but that there will be
financial support where it is needed to enable those learners to
participate.</div>

2.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the notes and the
detail of the Bill itself confirm, that duty applies simply to
community, foundation or voluntary schools, and special
schools&#151;as well as to pupil referral units and further education
institutions. The LSC has asked for the same duty to be placed on
private providers.</div>
					<a name="08020781000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 163 is also
inspired by the NUT; they are inspiring a lot of amendments among the
Opposition parties at this moment. The amendment seeks to explore why a
series of other educational institutions have been left out of this
particular duty to promote good attendance. The amendment includes
within that duty academies, city technology colleges, city technology
colleges of the arts and special schools that are not community or
foundation schools but are&#151;for the time being&#151;approved by
the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="08020781000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
problem with those educational institutions; indeed, I strongly support
academies and some of the other educational institutions detailed here.
I shall be working very hard to support Lord Adonis and others within
the Government who want to defend some of those institutions against
the attempt by the Prime Minister and perhaps even the Secretary of
State to throttle them gradually. However, I believe that it is
sensible for the freedoms that some of these institutions have to be
enjoyed by as many schools as possible.</div>
					<a name="08020781000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also sensible for the
strategic oversight of all these educational organisations to operate
in the same way. Even within the space of this week, we have seen how
the Government seem to be implementing a strategic oversight of
educational institutions which differentiate some of the maintained
schools, which are already covered by clause 11, and schools in some
other categories, such as the ones listed in amendment No. 163, which
are institutions which traditionally have a greater degree of
freedom.</div>
					<a name="08020781000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday, I
received a parliamentary answer regarding the duties that the
Government will place on educational institutions in relation to
compulsory cookery lessons. It was announced just a few weeks ago that
all maintained schools will have to have compulsory cookery lessons,
although we know that something like 85 per cent. of them already have
these lessons. However, in the answer from the Minister, dated 5
February, we see that these cookery lessons will not be compulsory for
academies. That seems to be a good example of the slightly bizarre
approach that the Government are taking in allowing freedoms to be
available to some educational institutions which are not available to
others. This is causing a different strategic oversight of some
educational institutions in comparison to others, for no good
reason.</div>
					<a name="08020781000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
has been stimulated and, to be candid, written by the NUT, and we are
pleased to lend our names to it. It lists a series of other educational
institutions, which are taken from section 5 of the Education Act 2005.
It includes all those educational institutions that are subject to
Ofsted inspection. The logic of the amendment is that the duty to
promote attendance should be consistent with the susceptibility to
inspection.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>
					<a name="08020781000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I encourage
the Minister to explain the logic of leaving those institutions outside
the duty in clause 11. In what other ways will the duty will be catered
for? Presumably, the Government do not intend that those educational
establishments will not be obliged to pursue the duty to attend. Will
they be doing so through funding agreements? Why should funding
agreements be used for that purpose, rather than including them in the
Bill? How will the existing academies with their own existing funding
agreements be covered by the duty? Will there be any attempt to amend
the funding agreements to ensure that the duties in the Bill are part
of the duties of academies in the
future?</div>

							<a name="08020781000625"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> We currently have 83 academies, 78 are or will be
direct providers of post-16 education. From September there will be two
city technology colleges and one city college for the technology of the
arts. They are in general regulated through their funding agreements
rather than through legislation. That is why they are not expressly
listed in clause 11. I assure the Committee that academies are required
through their funding agreements to have regard to the same guidance as
maintained schools on improving behaviour and attendance.</div>
					<a name="08020781000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation is different for
the two CTCs and the one CCTA. They are not required by law to have
regard to the same guidance, as they were established as independent
institutions with particular freedoms, but they are successful schools
with high levels of post-16 participation from committed pupils whose
attendance and behaviour are good. I do not think we will have too many
problems with those institutions or with academies, where attendance
has risen at a much faster rate than nationally.</div>
					<a name="08020781000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
category that would be added by the amendment is that of non-maintained
special schools. The hon. Gentleman has cause for some celebration
because, having reflected on his amendment, I would say we do need to
look further at the case for including that group of schools in clause
11. I will consider whether we might put forward a Government amendment
to that effect on Report. I hope in the light of that extraordinary

						</b> This is the first triumph of this Committee&#146;s
proceedings. It is the first time the Government have had to do a
massive U-turn. As ever, they prefer to table their own amendment
rather than allow this magnificent Laws-NUT amendment to be included in
the Bill. I hope that I do not get angry letters from 74 institutions
that will now be included in this duty.</div>
					<a name="08020781000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to hear we have
made some ground. I am still a little baffled why it makes sense for
such a duty to be administered through an individual funding agreement.
It clearly is a strategic duty, so why not have strategic duties
operating at a strategic level, rather than have them dealt with
individually in the funding agreements?</div>
					<a name="08020781000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought it
was rather odd to say that in a number of the institutions listed in
the amendments, there would not be too many problems, because their
participation or attendance rates are very high. One could say that a
number of maintained schools that will be covered by the clause should
be exempt on that basis. I also heard no reassurance about what will
happen to the established academies which will not have the duty in
their funding agreements. Is it intended to rewrite the funding
agreements? Will they be changed retrospectively, or will those
academies be exempt from the duty?</div>

that academies are required through their funding agreements to have

have to have regard to clause 11 because that is implied directly in
their funding agreements, so there will be no need to amend

							<a name="08020781000635"></a>Mr.
Marsden:
						</b> I rise on clause stand part
merely to make a brief comment and to put a question to my hon. Friend
the Minister. In relation to the exercise of the governing
bodies&#146; functions, the clause is neutral on the range of courses
to which the students in the category described should have access.
However, the Edge foundation, with which I have worked closely via the
all-party skills 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>group and the Skills Commission, and one or two other organisations have
raised their concern that some governing bodies, which should already
be ensuring that students have access to a range of courses adapted to
their interests and needs, favour an academic style of learning over
more a more practical or vocational approach. As a result, some young
people may be offered a limited choice of options both before and after
the age of 16. The organisations make the point, which I thoroughly
agree with, that some young people become disaffected because they do
not enjoy school and find classes boring or irrelevant. They also make
the point about the importance of learning by doing, or practical
learning.</div>
					<a name="08020781000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in mind, if my hon.
Friend the Minister does not feel that that is an appropriate subject
for an amendment to the Bill&#151;I would understand why&#151;is he
able to say what the Government might be able to do, whether through
guidance or some other initiative, to ensure that governing bodies,
which are required to promote participation, have due regard to the
broadest range of courses available?</div>

Knight:
						</b> Certainly, they should have regard to that duty.
The clause clearly is just about promoting attendance, but clause 66,
to which I refer my hon. Friend, deals with impartial advice of the
sort for which Edge is calling. That clause specifically requires
schools to give impartial advice. It has been slightly misinterpreted
by some sections of the press, the Committee will be amazed to hear,
but it is certainly the case that we want to ensure, as Edge has
argued, that advice is in the best interests of the learner rather than
in the best interests of the organisation giving that advice. I hope
that, on that basis, the Committee is happy to agree clause
11.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000637"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Clause 12 is a rather frightening clause. I know
that local authorities need to know which children are resident in
their area so that they can enforce compulsory education, and I realise
that they need data that they can use to promote participation post-16.
I also realise that much of those data are already collected by
Connexions so it can fulfil its function, However, the wording of the
Green Paper is rather alarming in paragraph 7.3, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08020781000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
every area of the country, considerable effort is being put into
identifying where young people currently are and what they are
doing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty imposed
by clause 12, similarly, requires local authorities to</div>
					<a name="08020781000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make arrangements to enable it to
establish...the identities of persons belonging to its area
... who are failing to fulfil the duty imposed by section
2.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>
					<a name="08020781000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those sorts of powers and duties are
always introduced with good intent, but it would be helpful if the
Minister, for the record, spelt out the extent to which the duty in the
clause is new, why it is necessary and why the clause is
needed?</div>
					<a name="08020781000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000638"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The duty on local authorities is, as I think the
hon. Member understands, fundamental. As he says, it is clear that for
the local authority to fulfil its duty of promoting participation, and
to ensure that everyone benefits from staying on, it will need to know
who is not participating and what is being done to re-engage them. That
information is necessary so that personal advisers from Connexions can
contact the young person and offer them support in finding or accessing
provision.</div>
					<a name="08020781000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Connexions service already uses a tracking system, so as far as I am
aware, the clause simply restates the existing arrangements, taking
into account the transfer of Connexions to local authorities. When
Connexions makes the transfer, if the database is not maintained, it
will be impossible to track young people and, therefore, to intervene
effectively and provide support that is timely and appropriate to their
needs. The clause simply strengthens the legal basis for the tracking
system, and in so doing, it sets a legal imperative to ensure that, by
2013, local authorities are fully equipped to carry out those functions
and to ensure that those young people who are in most need are
identified promptly and provided with timely
support.</div>
					<a name="08020781000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Technically
the duty is a new one, but the clause is very similar to section 436A
of the Education Act 1996, which deals with pre-16s, so we are only
reinforcing an existing system and extending the legal duty from pre-16
to post-16 in line with the Bill. I hope that that is clear enough to
enable the Committee to approve the
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08020781000639"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I shall not detain the Committee long, but we tabled
an amendment to delete the clause, so I need at least to register my
concerns, which are broadly in line with those expressed by the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The Minister said, quite
rightly, that there is a similar duty now covering pre-16s, as one
would expect. However, the clause sets out a new duty, which presumably
will have large costs associated with it and is completely tied in to
the duties regarding compulsion in the Bill. That is why we tabled our
amendment to delete the clause, which is one of the parts of the Bill
that we

simply identifying people to whom the Bill applies and putting their

						</b> I am sure, Mr. Bercow, that you wish me
to address clause 13 rather than go back to debate clause 12, but
clearly I disagree with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of
clause
12.</div>
					<a name="08020781000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of clause 13 is to ensure that learning providers tell
Connexions when a young person drops out of learning. We want that to
be straightforward and a light burden on the learning provider. For
instance, a large specialist college is likely to take young people
from a number of local authorities and that is why we only require them
to notify their local Connexions office. In his evidence, the principal
of Bedford college said, I think, that he worked with as many as 100
local authorities. Once a young person drops out, the Connexions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div>office where the young person lives is responsible for intervening to
provide support. Therefore amendment No. 138 makes it clear that the
Connexions service that is notified that a young person has dropped out
must ensure that the information is passed on to the Connexions service
where the young person lives. Without the amendment it would be
possible for a 16 or 17-year-old to drop out of learning and not
receive support&#151;at the time when they needed it the
most&#151;even though a Connexions office would be aware that they
had dropped out. The amendment formalises existing procedures for the
operation of the Connexions database and
service.</div>
					<a name="08020781000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
remaining amendments are technical ones, necessary for the provision to
have the desired effect. Amendment No. 138 makes clear the wording that
describes whether the local authority provides the Connexions service
itself or through arrangements with another
body.</div>
					<a name="08020781000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 139 and 140 make the reference in clause 13 to clause 54 more
specific. They refer to particular subsections of clause 54: subsection
(1), which is where the local authorities&#146; duty to provide the
Connexions service is set out, and subsection (3)(b), which provides
for local authorities to make Connexions services available by
providing them themselves or by making arrangements with other
parties.</div>
					<a name="08020781000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

							<a name="08020781000661"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> The clause imposes a duty on
educational institutions&#151;schools and colleges&#151;to provide
information about their students to a local authority if they are
requested to do so by that authority. The data sharing provisions raise
significant human rights implications, and I focus on those issues in
later amendments, particularly amendment No. 42. I alert the Committee
to the fact that the issues are of interest to the Joint Committee on
Human Rights. I say no more than that at this stage.</div>
					<a name="08020781000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) wrote to the Minister
setting out his concerns, and the Minister responded in his letter of
10 January 2008. The hon. Member for Hendon raised a number of
questions, which I will address when we talk about the data sharing
provisions in clause 57 and amendment No. 42. As far as the series of
amendments is concerned, I want to focus first on the rather innocuous
information that clause 14 seeks to obtain: the name, address and date
of birth of the student and the student&#146;s parents. Also included
in clause 14(3)(c), however,
is</div>
					<a name="08020781000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information in the
institution&#146;s possession about the pupil or
student.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
information could relate to the student&#146;s grades, test scores,
study problems raised by the student with his or her tutor, personal
problems raised by the student or financial issues that the student
has. It could relate to the student&#146;s health, behaviour or any
other information that the school or college has. Clause 14(4) does of
course give the student the right to instruct the school or college not
to provide such information, but that amounts to an opt-out approach,
rather than an opt-in. In response to a question from the hon. Member
for Hove, the Minister said that he had rung Connexions that very
morning, and he said about young people&#146;s consent:</div>
					<a name="08020781000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the point at which
they go on to the database at 13, it is done on the basis of presumed
parental consent, so parents can not give consent for it to happen, but
that is just the very basic data. From then on in, the young person has
to give active consent for the data to be shared with other agencies.
That is what happens at the moment and when it transfers we do not
foresee that changing.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,
Education and Skills Public Bill Committee, </i>29 January 2008; c.
214,
Q494.]</div>
					<a name="08020781000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
odd, given that clause 14(4) requires the student to instruct the
institution not to supply the information. Thus, if no instruction is
received, the college can presumably go ahead and supply the
information, notwithstanding the fact that no consent was actively
given.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>
					<a name="08020781000471"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08020781000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would help
if the Minister clarified his remarks. By &#147;active
consent&#148;, did he mean the opt-out approach set out in clause
14(4), which I would not call active consent, or did he mean that the
data on the Connexions customer information system database can be
divulged to others only with proper active consent from the young
people, but that data from educational institutions going on to the
Connexions caseload information systems database can be made available
by the college on the basis of non-active consent, as set out in clause
14(4)? If the latter, why is the nature of the consent required
different?</div>
					<a name="08020781000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 would require written consent from the student before any
information about him or her could be supplied. The college or local
authority would actively have to approach the student, inform him or
her that information was being requested by the local authority and
request from the student written consent for that information to be
supplied. The danger of the opt-out approach is that the student will
not necessarily know what information has been requested or that he has
the right to object to that information being supplied. I suspect that,
if not amended, the clause will result in a large amount of personal
educational information being supplied to local authorities without
students realising it. Given that that information will be used for a
totally different purpose from that for which it was made available in
the first place, it is important that the safeguard in the amendment be
put in place.</div>
					<a name="08020781000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s approach is in conflict with the principles of the Data
Protection Act 1998. For example, one of the key principles of the Act
is:</div>
					<a name="08020781000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Personal
data should be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful
purposes and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible
with that purpose or those
purposes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we do not put in place the safeguard that the amendment would provide,
we could find that students are reluctant to raise academic and
personal problems with tutors lest the information end up in the hands
of authorities or other people and their privacy
evaporates.</div>
					<a name="08020781000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 16 would give a student the right to examine any information held
on him by a school or college and requested by the local authority, so
that he could correct any inaccuracies. Amendment No. 19 would give a
student the right to have that information corrected, subject to the
agreement of the school or college. If agreement could not be reached
on whether the information was accurate, the matter could be referred
to the Information Commissioner for
adjudication.</div>
					<a name="08020781000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
to be careful about personal data on us that is held by state-run
organisations. People need to be able to check its accuracy, and we
need to be sure that the information is secure. The Government&#146;s
record on securing our personal data is not good: the Criminal Records
Bureau mistakenly labelled 2,700 innocent people as having criminal
records; the sex offenders register lost track of 300 hundred
offenders; 27,000 criminals, many of them serious, were left off the
police national computer; 100,000 innocent children are
on  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>the DNA database; 26,000 police-collected samples were mistakenly left
off the police national computer; and 500,000 entries were misrecorded.
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs lost 25 million personal
records, including information about children and people&#146;s bank
accounts, and last year there were 2,110 other security breaches by
HMRC; the Department for Transport lost 3 million driving licence
applications; and the Ministry of Defence left a laptop, containing the
details of thousands of people who had expressed an interest in joining
the Army, in the back of a car, from where it was stolen.</div>
					<a name="08020781000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, the Data Protection Act
gives people the right to access their personal data, which is
important, and the right to correct or destroy inaccurate data. It is
important therefore that the Bill is consistent, and in accordance
with, the principles of that Act.</div>
					<a name="08020781000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">Privacy is a concern to the
Children&#146;s Rights Alliance, which said that</div>
					<a name="08020781000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;extensive measures in the Bill
for information sharing, in order to facilitate enforcement of the
duty, are a further serious threat to Children's
privacy.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
conducted a series of focus groups with young people, discussing the
issue of information sharing. Its report says:</div>
					<a name="08020781000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There was concern that
if children thought adults were going to share information with other
people, they would stop confiding in adults altogether. They believed
that adults ought to be able to sort out difficulties with children and
young people without having to breach their
confidence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report
includes a quotation from a 17-year-old young woman at the focus group,
who said:</div>
					<a name="08020781000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think the people who are passing information need to consider the
consequences of what will happen if they disrespect the child&#146;s
wishes...like the child&#146;s not going to confide in them anymore
or trust them. Obviously that's going to be bad if they&#146;re in a
situation where they&#146;re in danger or they&#146;re self
harming...and then they&#146;ve got no one to turn to because they
don&#146;t trust
anyone&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
issue of whether information could be shared with other organisations
without the permission of the young person, the report says:</div>
					<a name="08020781000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There was general
agreement that it was essential to try to get permission before sharing
information, and only break refusal of permission in the most
exceptional circumstances. One young man felt that he would be really
angry if he found out information had been shared without his
permission, even if the adult thought it necessary to share
information&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government must also use the right database and computer system. The
Association of Colleges says:</div>
					<a name="08020781000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The intention is that
local authorities will maintain and improve existing Connexions
Caseload Information Systems
database&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08020781000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
CCIS. The association continues:</div>
					<a name="08020781000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;AoC is not satisfied
that this database is fit for purpose and believes it will need
significant improvement in advance of
2015.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08020781000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Local
Government Association, in its briefing, also talks about improving the
&#147;accuracy&#148; of the Connexions
database.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>
					<a name="08020781000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also support amendment No.
170, tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil, which would refine the
information that can be supplied to that</div>
					<a name="08020781000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which is relevant to assessing
their educational and support
needs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08020781000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">That must be
right. The Bill requires colleges and schools to provide any
information in the institution&#146;s possession about the student or
pupil, which is far too wide a provision.</div>
					<a name="08020781000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are important, because they would provide legislative
protection for the privacy and rights 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>of 16 and 17-year-olds&#151;on which the Bill seriously impinges. Such
