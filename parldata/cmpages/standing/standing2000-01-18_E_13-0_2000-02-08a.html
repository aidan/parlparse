Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 314, in page 32, line 18, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) The rights accorded to the Crown by the special share under this section shall not be subject to any limitation that may be imposed through the European Communities Act 1972 as amended.".<P>

<P>
No. 370, in Clause 54, page 35, line 41, leave out from second 'share' to end of line 43 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'of a class which by virtue of the rights attaching to it under the articles of association of the company concerned can be held only by the Crown (within the meaning given it in this Chapter), of which there may be only one share in issue from time to time and which gives the holder of that share--
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I was giving a general overview of the strategic partnership agreement and I will, with your approval, Mr. Gale, complete those remarks before specifically addressing the amendments.
<P>
The special share is the subject of particular concern to Opposition Members, who want it to be capable of being converted into ordinary shares in the National Air Traffic Services on condition that those ordinary shares are offered to the public and admitted to the official list of the London stock exchange. I assume that hon. Members do not mean what they say, as that would allow the possibility of the special share falling away at precisely the time when it is most needed, in other words on flotation. Whether or not that is what the Opposition intend, their suggested amendment can not be accepted, as it could lead to the surrender of the special share. That is not something that many of us would consider to be desirable.
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 314, the purpose of which is to prevent any successful challenge to the special share under European law. As hon. Members will understand, it is not an amendment that can be accepted, given that the United Kingdom has signed and agreed to be bound by the treaty of Rome. Furthermore, the Commission has a legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with the fundamental community, freedoms of movement of capital and establishment.
<P>
The initial legal advice we have is that the NATS special share scheme we have put together is not incompatible with those freedoms--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are half a dozen conversations going on in the Room and I am trying to hear the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The apparent intention behind the amendment is to entrench the special share rights as a state measure, rather than to reinforce provisions of private company law; that might be extremely unwise in this context, as it could reinforce any anxieties that might be felt about the provision. Given the strength of the Govemment's position, if the Commission were to take proceedings against the UK in respect of NATS, the Government would be prepared to defend vigorously our position on the special share.
<P>
I turn now to the specific points made by the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) in moving the amendment. He argued that the articles could be amended by a resolution of the company. He is quite right, but as he will know from our earlier debate that, that is precisely why we tabled an amendment to ensure that the Government must continue to hold at least 25 per cent. of the shares and thereby have the ability to block any such resolution. He mentioned the Belfast port case. I am delighted to see that his research has gone as far as The Daily Telegraph in that respect, but he must not believe all that he reads in that newspaper. The Belfast case is still under consideration, but all cases need to be judged on their merits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Why is there any doubt about the golden share in the Belfast case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I said, the Belfast case is a different case, and all cases must be judged on their merits. No decision has been taken on the special share for Belfast port, nor has the Treasury said that a special share in Belfast port would be unacceptable. The hon. Gentleman is jumping the gun a little in his assumptions about what might be happening in the Belfast port case.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also expressed concern about the relationship between article 73(b) and article 55. Notwithstanding those articles, which have been renumbered--unfortunately, I do not have the new version to hand--the special share scheme for NATS does not break either freedom and is not a factor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Has the Minister read the opinion issued by the Commission which I quoted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was about to say that the opinion, with which I am familiar, was expressed by the Commission. It is simply an opinion and has no force beyond that; it is not a judgment or court decision unless it is tested in the court. As I have said clearly and emphatically, if our decision on the special share were to be challenged, we would defend that case vigorously. Indeed, we would have every reason to expect a successful outcome.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Sirdar case and the definition of national security. That judgment referred to public security, rather than national security. The concept of public security was defined as covering a member state's internal and external security; in other words, public security, which embraces both considerations, covers national security. Indeed, several cases demonstrate that public security refers to a member state's own security: a good example is the Campus Oil case, case 72/83, in which the European Court of Justice upheld Ireland's right to impose purchasing restrictions on petroleum oil to ensure a minimum supply of petroleum products at all time. The hon. Gentleman should not undermine the Government by casting doubt on our ability to defend our position. We are defending the country's interests vigorously and are ensuring that the special share is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is perfectly capable of coming up with an alternative legal interpretation, as the British Government and other Governments have done on many occasions. However, there is a general drift of Ministers pleading legal advice in good faith and then losing judgments in the European Court of Justice, when the Commission leads the way. I am saying not that the Minister will necessarily lose his case, but that national security matters and golden shares are justiciable. The Minister is not in a position to give cast-iron guarantees to his hon. Friends because he cannot necessarily deliver them. What will he do if he loses his case in the European Court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants to have it both ways. He is arguing that there is a one-way process in which all cases are moving relentlessly towards ever greater European control. That is the stance of Opposition Members, who regard the European Union as an ogre constantly seeking to extend its powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thought that I would provoke such a response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Can the Minister cite one European Court judgment in which it has said categorically that it does not have the power to do something or does not ever envisage reserving power? When reserving power to a member state, the court often delegates that power, reserving the right to return to the matter at a later date, which it frequently does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Earlier, I referred to the Campus Oil case and gave an illustration proving that the hon. Gentleman is not necessarily correct in arguing that the European Court would never accept that a country's national interests justify its seeking to place restrictions on what otherwise might apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not familiar with that case, but I can imagine the Court being persuaded to accept that it is in the interest of every member state to reserve a certain amount of oil stocks, because that is in the public interest across the European Union. What the EU will never accept, however, is that a member state's national interest can override the interest of another member state. That is why the phrase "national interest" does not pass its lips. I did not mention the Sirdar case itself; I referred to the Commission's opinion, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Under these circumstances, the Commission could not accept that the 'national interest' concept as a criterion could, in itself, could be used as a legal cover"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 for measures such as a golden share.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I accept that entirely and apologise for implying that the hon. Gentleman referred to the Sirdar case. He raised the question of the definition of national security and I referred him to the Sirdar case, in which that issue was specifically covered. The definition that was adopted makes it clear that national security interests are embraced by the wider concept of public security, which covers both internal and external security matters. The hon. Gentleman's interpretation is partial, because it is based on a profoundly Euro-sceptical view of the intentions of the European Union and on his perception that everything is going inexorably in the same direction. That is not our experience. I fully accept that these issues are justiciable, but the outcome will depend on the merits of individual cases.
<P>
I do not intend to go into great detail, for obvious reasons--the last thing one does when a matter is likely to come before the courts is to give away one's entire case in advance. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we have given careful consideration to this matter and we are clear that we have a very strong case in respect of NATS. The Government's retention of certain control rights alongside a significant equity interest is entirely consistent with normal commercial behaviour and is not a restriction on free movement. I remind the hon. Gentleman of what I said about the difficulty of justifying it if it were seen as a state provision rather than a normal commercial safeguard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That underlines the fact that the Minister is trying to dress up these provisions as a commercial protection, rather than a protection of national interest. The Court will see through that flummery, because it is capable of seeing when national protection measures are dressed up as something else. That is what the free movement of capital provisions are all about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong on both counts. First, despite my earlier remarks, he appears to be trying to undermine the Government's case; I very much regret that he used the word "flummery". We have strong reasons to believe that we have a good case on commercial grounds and on grounds of public policy and public security, and we will defend our position on both those grounds. The Govemment's retention of certain control rights alongside a significant equity interest is consistent with normal commercial behaviour; that is one strong strand in our case.
<P>
Secondly, issues of public policy and public security are, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) emphasised this morning, very much to be borne in mind in the legal analysis. We suggest that there is likely to be a general public interest in the safe operation of air traffic services that goes beyond a purely economic interest. There is an equal justification, for reasons of public security, for reserving to the Government certain powers of control in relation to an industry over which we would need to exercise control in, for example, an emergency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does my hon. Friend agree that the suggestion of the hon. Member for North Essex that the public interest is outrageous in sentiment and wrong in fact? The public interest is already encompassed by commercial law, as was confirmed by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), who has gone on to better things. Indeed, the public interest, as opposed to the national interest, gives a much wider scope for the Government to act, be it in terms of safety, security or economic interest. Limiting ourselves to national interest considerations would be quite wrong.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. I hope that in my earlier remarks I made it clear that we do not accept the extremely partial and not terribly well researched interpretation of the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
We are approaching the matter with a clear commitment to the retention of the special share on a basis that is entirely justified on economic and public interest grounds. We have taken advice and are satisfied that the Bill is entirely consistent with our treaty commitments and obligations, and we shall vigorously defend the provision in the event of its being challenged. The hon. Gentleman does not do his party or the country any good by taking a consistently pessimistic and negative view and undermining the defence of Britain's interests, which the Government are steadfast in maintaining. I hope that he will withdraw his misguided and inappropriate amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We always know that we are getting somewhere when the Minister starts hurling across the Committee epithets to the effect that I, from my meagre  little position as Opposition spokesman on transport, pose a massive threat to the national interest.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) said that I had described the public interest as "a fiction". He may have misunderstood me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Check Hansard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall certainly check Hansard, and I apologise if I used the term "public interest", as opposed to "public security". The Sirdar case involved public security, rather than national security. The hon. Gentleman misses the point if he does not realise that the Commission's objective is to disperse the idea of national security. One nation's security is opposed to another nation's security in the European Union, but the objective of the treaty is an ever-closer union of peoples. That is not a shadow on the back of my brain. The Minister has probably been to Brussels often enough to be aware of the atmosphere that pervades everything that happens there. Those involved are determined to obscure the distinctions between nation states' interests. The fiction to which I refer is that a common European interest exists and overrides the national interest, which I do not believe. I apologise if I used the wrong word.
<P>
The most illuminating aspect of the debate is the Minister's irritation about the matters that I am exposing to people who might read the proceedings, which might include judges of the European Court. Such people will realise that I am criticising the arrangements on the basis that they are a ruse to make the golden share arrangements comply with the Commission's opinion. The most important extract from the Commission's opinion is that such non-discriminatory--overtly commercial, as opposed to purposefully national --measures would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"permitted in so far as they are based on a set of objective and stable criteria which have been made public and can be justified on imperative requirements in the general interest."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister's objective is to disguise the golden share as that, if not to turn it into that. His obvious contempt for my raising matters of national concern is based on his determination to comply with the set of criteria, which is why a new Government amendment earlier today specified holdings of 49 per cent. and 25 per cent. Those objective criteria are stable and will be made public, which is why they are being incorporated into the Bill.
<P>
The Minister can make the matter perfectly clear now by explaining the circumstances in which he imagines that the Government would exercise the rights under the golden share. We have been dealing in theoretical terms, so let us have another hypothesis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that provisions in the articles of association detail circumstances in which the special share may be applied. I shall make a point that I tried to make in an earlier intervention. He accused us this morning of having introduced amendments to clause 49 at the behest of the Treasury. He said that the whole thing was a Treasury plot, and now he says that it is a clever ploy on our part to get one over Brussels. He must be consistent. Which is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I can be perfectly consistent. I think that the Minister wanted to put in the 49 per cent. to reassure his hon. Friends and to provide the objective and stable public criteria by which the golden share arrangements will be applied. I suggest that the Treasury then decided that it would be prudent to allow a dilution to 25 per cent, in case it was called on in a recapitalisation of the company. Both theories fit together. I think that the Minister grudgingly accepts that that was quite an ingenious fitting together of the puzzle's pieces.
<P>
The Minister deftly told me that the articles of association detail the circumstances in which the golden share applies. What sort of company does he plan to block from taking a bigger shareholding than he would like: any company, whether foreign or British? He plans to exercise the restrictions against a company or organisation that seeks to acquire shares. What arguments will he use if that organisation goes to court and claims that that is an unreasonable restriction on the freedom of movement of capital? What does he imagine would be wrong with that company? Why are we to have restrictions in legislation unless he can explain the consequences of such terrible eventualities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Let me respond to that simply. As I made clear, although perhaps not clear enough, one of the purposes of the articles is to ensure that no company acquiring an interest, other than the initial strategic partner, can acquire more than 15 per cent. That is to avoid a position in which the framework for the control of NATS can slip into the hands of an individual organisation rather than a carefully devised to ensure a balanced public-private partnership. The provision applies across the board in a way that does not discriminate against any individual company, foreign or otherwise. We have said that it is possible to envisage a foreign company having a shareholding. There is a safeguard for good public policy reason. If there is a breach of the provision, the special share will ensure that power is available to the Crown shareholder to require the divestment of shares by the organisation that has acquired more than it should have done.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are getting somewhere, so I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I press him a little further. In what circumstances would the Government think it improper that shareholders other than the Crown wanted their shares transferred to another company and the management of NATS was happy for the shares to be concentrated in that way? On what basis would the Government decide to exercise their power under the golden share to stop that happening? Why would it be undesirable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> For the very reason that I have explained: the structure has been framed to create a PPP; if there were a concentration of shareholdings and too great a power in an individual's hand after flotation--such circumstances will not arise under the initial strategic partnership agreement--the PPP's viability could be put at risk. We are creating a PPP for very good policy reasons, and it is perfectly right and proper to want to maintain that PPP and to safeguard the interests for which it was created.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is now floundering. The courts may ask whose interests are safeguarded by safeguarding the PPP, apart from the Crown's dominant position in the management and control of the company. At that point, the golden share arrangements would fall foul of European Community law, because they would be regarded as measures whereby a Government protected their own interests against the otherwise free movement of shares and capital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have repeatedly made the point that the Government will not have the controlling interest. The strategic partner will have the controlling interest and the majority of directors on the board, but the partnership involves a clear public interest which the Crown shareholder represents, so it is right and proper that the provision should exist to ensure that that interest is secure. I have given an example of one of the variety of ways in which the provision may be used, but the hon. Gentleman is not satisfied with that. Any structure designed to safeguard the partnership and the public interest would need such a provision, and I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is trying to undermine its validity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not trying to undermine its validity; I am merely saying that others will probably succeed in doing so. Perhaps a better way to put it is that they will realise that the Government are maintaining the dominance of their minority interest. The Government would lose their position as dominant shareholder if another shareholder were allowed to consolidate a larger shareholding than theirs. That has always been the reason why the Government hold golden shares: such shares are, by definition, inalienably national in character because they are held by the Government.
<P>
We have had an extensive debate on the subject, but as we shall probably return to the viability of golden shares perhaps on Report, I shall not press amendment No. 314. However, to show our strength of feeling, I shall press amendment No. 313 to a Division.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 32, line 16, leave out from 'shareholder' to end of line 18.
<P>
Regrettably, we lost the previous amendment, but my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex is right about the clause, which could set us into headlong collision with European Union authorities. We could be in breach of EU legislation on the free movement of capital.
<P>
The amendment would take away the Secretary of State's ability to relinquish the golden share and obviate such a constitutional clash. In addition, the golden share is vital for the Government to retain the support of their Back Benchers. It has been trumpeted as the weapon that will keep the Government's hold on the future of air traffic control. Under clause 89, a simple statutory instrument is enough to overthrow the golden share. Clause 89(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The power to make an order under section 49 is exercisable by statutory instrument".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides another example of an amazing U-turn on a policy that was dear to the heart of Government Members. On the issue of the threshold at which postal objects can be transferred around the country under the universal rate, the Government made a complete U-turn, even though the subject merited a lengthy debate. Hon. Members on both sides wanted to speak on the matter, but the statutory instrument was turned around in an evening debate of around three-quarters of an hour.
<P>
The main justification for supporting the amendment is that it would prevent the Secretary of State from undoing the detailed work of this Committee. It is not good enough to have the risk of a flip-flop late in a Committee considering a statutory instrument to which hon. Members are not paying close attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman bases his case on a misapprehension of the effect of clauses 49 and 89, which are inextricably linked. Clause 49(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State must not consent to any alteration of the designated company's articles of association which requires his consent...unless a statement of the intended consent has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides a real safeguard against alteration. The hon. Gentleman argues that that could be put aside by statutory instrument. However, I remind him that subsection (7), which he used to justify his case, is subject to clause 89(4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The power to make an order under section 49 is exercisable by statutory instrument; but no such order is to be made unless a draft has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A positive resolution of both Houses is necessary before such an order can be made. That provides real safeguards, but I shall not labour the point, which has been debated on many previous occasions. The amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am not entirely convinced, but it may be better to leave further debate until we reach clause 89. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 322, in page 32, line 19, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
It is a pleasure to propose amendment No. 322, which is intended to probe the Government's intent. Will the Minister fully explain subsection (6) in order that we can understand it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am pleased to provide the hon. Gentleman the explanation that he seeks. When he has heard it, I am sure that he will recognise that the amendment is undesirable.
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be to deprive third parties of the protection that would be afforded to them by subsection (6) if they acquired shares in NATS in circumstances where there was a contravention of either of the subsections relating to the level of the Crown shareholding in NATS, or of subsection (3), which requires the Crown to retain the special share. The Committee will recall that a Government amendment was made that inserted two new subsections--(2A) and (2B)--imposing restrictions on the Crown's ability to dispose of shares in NATS. Subsection (6) provides that if a person enters into a transaction relating to shares in NATS, he need not inquire as to whether the transaction would result in a contravention of any of subsections (2A), (2B) or (3), and that his rights in relation to the relevant shares will not be questioned because of any such contravention.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, third parties dealing in shares in NATS would be forced into accepting some sort of joint responsibility with the Secretary of State for ensuring compliance with subsections (2A), (2B) and (3). A third party could be obliged to give up shares in NATS acquired by him for full value and in all good faith. That would be unfair, as the duties in subsections (2A), (2B) and (3) are duties that fall squarely on the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, not third parties, should be accountable as a result of a breach of any of those subsections.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, it would leave the way open for a potential infringement of third party rights and would shift the focus away from the person--the Secretary of State--who is properly subject to the relevant duties. Accordingly, I invite the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The subsection is an interesting one. Usually, any commercial person buying a share in a company will examine that company in some detail before proceeding. We are not talking here about a stock exchange-quoted company with regular articles of association. Even if the company were so quoted with regular articles, the existence of the golden share is public knowledge, so someone buying shares--especially a big block--in, for example, the British Airports Authority would take advice as to restrictions on holdings. Will the Minister confirm similar provisions to subsection (6) apply to golden share arrangements in other privatisation Acts? Otherwise, it could be read as another genuflection toward the Commission's opinion--[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) chuckles, but the provision could be seen as a discrimination against the free movement of capital, the ability to invest, to acquire shares and so forth. It could be viewed as placing a legal restriction on a third party who might want to acquire shares. Will the Minister, who is about to receive a briefing on this matter, provide illumination?

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am pleased to tell the hon. Gentleman that the provision has many precedents in previous legislation. However, it is typical of the present Conservative party to oppose a measure that is intended to protect innocent third parties who acquire shares. If the effect of a purchase would bring the Government shareholding down from 49 per cent. to 48.5 per cent., there could be a technical infringement which it is the Secretary of State's responsibility to avoid. If the hon. Gentleman had his way, that absolutely innocent individual would be denied the protection currently offered by the Bill. I cannot believe that it is in the interests of the public and the shareholders to be put in that position, and I am astonished that the provision appears to be motivated by the hon. Gentleman's fear that there is some Brussels-dominated conspiracy and that the Government are trying to avoid the European Union stepping in. He is far removed from reality. We are talking about simple provisions to prevent innocent parties who acquire shares from unintentionally contravening statute and thereby committing an offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was a clear, albeit not totally polite, explanation. It would have been useful if the Minister had told us about the precedents earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I was marvelling at the ingenuity of the hon. Member for North Essex at being able to bring another reference to Brussels which, from my humble position, I had failed to see. We have also established another tradition in the Committee. Argument A is repeated to us based on Bills and Acts that have contained a similar provision; argument B, which we increasingly hear from the hon. Member for Poole, is that the amendment is tabled so that the Minister may offer an explanation.
<P>
In his first contribution, the Minister explained reasonably clearly what was at stake: the measure is designed to protect people from committing an offence. The argument that he used, however, was that they might acquire shares at fair value and be forced to get rid of them at a less attractive price. Are we to infer that the purpose of the provision is to enable the Government to compensate them for the difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not believe that any such inference should be drawn. The subsection simply ensures that people cannot be found guilty of an offence as a result of acquiring shares. It would clearly be for the Secretary of State to rectify the failure if that occurred. That could be done in a number of different ways not specified here. The purpose of the provision is to indemnify the innocent third party from an infringement that might occur in such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This has been an interesting and informative debate. We are much wiser as a result, and the precedent is useful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 364, in page 32, line 22, after 'subsection' insert '(2A), (2B) or'.--[Mr. Raynsford.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 32, line 24, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
I never let a Henry VIII clause pass without debate. They are becoming more numerous and are an excuse for lazy government; they create an ugly form of reverse accountability. I recommend to the Committee an excellent brief, albeit on the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, issued on 28 January 1994 by the House of Commons Library, which describes Henry VIII clauses and their use.
<P>
The amendment would remove subsection (7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may by order amend or repeal this section."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is something deeply unsatisfactory about ministers taking a short-cut procedure to enable them to institute brief proceedings for secondary legislation to amend primary legislation. It is turning parliamentary accountability on its head. The hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) makes a grimace. I give way to him, although I know what he is about to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): The reason I was grimacing is that I am curious to know whether the hon. Gentleman can say how many Henry VIII clauses appeared in the legislation during 18 years of Conservative government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I stand to be corrected, but I believe that it is two. There may have been more--I am not certain. Of the two that I know, the more controversial was in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, although that was Ministers taking powers to use secondary legislation to delete elements of primary legislation. It was controversial, and I fully accept that the questions that I raise about this use of power apply, perhaps not in equal measure but in terms, to the present Bill. The other instance was the Education Reform Act 1988. Until the abomination of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, I believe that that was the most amended Bill ever to pass through both Houses of Parliament and it contained a Henry VIII clause.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The important point about that Henry VIII clause and previous ones is that they at least genuflected towards the origin of Henry VIII clauses. The name dates from the reign of Henry VIII, when the king took the power to create law by proclamation. Secretaries of State issuing orders to create legislation is the nearest one gets to legislating by proclamation, albeit that in this case a cursory genuflection towards Parliament is required in the form of affirmative resolutions.
<P>
The best example of how a Henry VIII clause should be used is in the Local Government Act 1894. If legislation is complicated to introduce, it makes sense for Ministers to take powers to amend other statutes in order to facilitate the introduction of that legislation. So long as the power is circumscribed in that way, it is not of unlimited benefit to Ministers. The example in the Bill--which I accept is similar to one in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, which is why that was a controversial use of the clause--envisages the powers being available to Ministers for all time to introduce amendments or an order to repeal the section altogether. I ask Labour Members to reflect on that.
<P>
The Minister sets great store by the whole clause, and we have spent a considerable amount of time discussing its importance. With the golden share arrangements, the articles of association and the strategic partnership agreement, the clause safeguards all the things that hon. Members consider important--the minority dominance of the Government's influence in the partnership, matters of national security, the importance of NATS as a safety industry, properly regulated and connected to Government, not merely a free-standing company doing its own thing. Yet Ministers have taken the power to throw all that away; that is a considerable power to take.
<P>
I have received legal advice that the reason why Ministers might require to amend or repeal the section is to be able to comply with provisions of European Community law. I shall not run through all the arguments again because that would be too tedious. However, if that is the purpose for which the clause has been included, it is redundant because European Community law now overrides parliamentary statute. If our law does not conform to European Community law, it is redundant, although it may be tidy to be able to change it or put it right.
<P>
It is incumbent upon the Minister to tell us in what circumstances he envisages exercising that power. Does he accept that the power to amend primary legislation through secondary legislation should be used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances? If so, will he describe those exceptional circumstances and explain why Minis should not pay the House the courtesy of rectifying mistakes through primary legislation, instead of covering them up by sticking an order through late at night--when as my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, not many people are paying attention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex probably does not realise it, but he has given my morale a huge fillip by referring not to Brussels, which does not do much for my morale, but to one of the most distinguished former residents of my constituency: I represent Greenwich, where King Henry VIII lived for many years in his early days, in the Palace of Placentia. Any hon. Member who pauses to look at the fine paintings in the passage between Central Lobby and Lower Waiting will see a picture of the young Henry VIII, opposite the one of Erasmus and Thomas More. If I thought that I would ever exercise the degree of power that Henry VIII enjoyed, I would be happy; alas, the role given to junior Ministers is merely that of labouring away in the corridors. The powers to which the hon. Member refers were never given to me, so I have not experienced the kind of pleasure that I am sure Henry VIII did in ruling by proclamation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is betraying the fact that his new Labour credentials are much stronger than we thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall not allow the hon. Gentleman to tempt me to pursue the analogy further, other than to say that his amendment seeks to remove the Secretary of State's power to amend or repeal clause 49 by order. The power can be exercised only by laying a draft of such an order before both Houses of Parliament, using the affirmative resolution procedure. The power is equivalent to one found in the Commonwealth Development Corporation Act 1999, which likewise requires use of the affirmative resolution procedure. We are not breaking new ground. If the amendment were accepted, it would be necessary to introduce primary legislation to make any changes to the provisions of the clause. That would not be appropriate.
<P>
Let us take the example of an air traffic administration order. If it resulted in the transfer of the regulated business to a new licensee, the Government would be left with a shareholding and a special share in a company that was probably no longer providing air traffic services in the UK, and in which there was no continuing public interest. Prior to the transfer, the Government of the day may use the special administration regime in clauses 26 to 33 and schedule 2 to ensure that the new licensee had an appropriate share structure, including any equity holding by Government, and articles of association including a special share.
<P>
The power in subsection (7) is to amend that provision. It would allow, for example, the Government to seek the Houses' approval for the substitution of the interest in the new company in return for divestment of the old, and thereby provide for the entrenchment of that new interest.
<P>
That is a clear example of circumstances in which there might be a need to act, and to do so quickly. When we considered the circumstances in which an air traffic order would be considered necessary, all members of the Committee agreed that there was a need to move quickly to guarantee the maintenance of air traffic control services. To amend primary legislation to effect such a change would be a slow and cumbersome procedure, whereas using an affirmative resolution through both Houses would be reasonably expeditious. The provision provides the safeguard of the affirmative resolution being required.

<P>

<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): My hon. Friend said that, when the new strategic partner is put in place, there will be no problem with the special share and the Government's shareholding in the new company. Is he saying that the purpose of the provision is to take the special share out of the old company, which is no longer involved in air traffic control? If he is, so what? What great harm will have been done if a golden share is left in the old company, provided that the Government have a special share in the new company and a 49 per cent. stake?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Mr right hon. Friend makes a fair point, but subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State must ensure that the Crown continues to hold any special share provided for under the designated company's articles of association."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There could be good reasons why the Government wanted to divest themselves of all shares in a company that they no longer felt was an appropriate body to be involved in running air traffic services. To be prevented from divesting themselves in such circumstances might be embarrassing. It must be right to have the flexibility to make such a change.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> Is my hon. Friend saying that, as things stand, the Government would not only be prevented from divesting themselves of the special share in the old company, but would be prevented from divesting themselves of the 49 per cent. stake?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No, we have already discussed the procedures under which the Government can dispose of their shareholding and require those shares to be purchased by the other party. Subsection (3) relates to the special share. It is phrased, for reasons my right hon. Friend fully understands, to give the security of knowing that the Government are prevented from getting rid of that special share. It might become an embarrassment if the special share was in a company that had been removed from the position of being a licensee. In such situations, there must be flexibility to get rid of that special share, of which the Government could not otherwise divest themselves of because of subsection (3).
<P>
That is one of the classic circumstances in which the flexibility of an order allows a quick change of the provision under subsection (3) to allow divestment of the special share, which no longer has any purpose, but which could be a potential embarrassment and liability. I hope that my right hon. Friend accepts that the provision makes sense. It concerns something that could happen; we do not expect it to happen, but it is right that a safeguard is in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his clear explanation of the circumstances in which he envisages the powers under subsection (7) being exercised. However, that could have been provided for under primary legislation. One clause could have stated that the Secretary of State may, by order, rescind the special share in the designated company in the event that the company ceases to be a licence holder. The absence of such a provision shows what I mean by lazy government and lazy Ministers, who could not be bothered to draft into the Bill provisions to cover such circumstances.
<P>
I do not want to labour the point, because we need to press on, but the Bill gives the Secretary of State the ability to lay orders before Parliament to undertake unknown actions of huge magnitude and to repeal the clause. All that it should refer to is the Crown shareholding, but instead it gives the power to the Secretary of State, by order, subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament, to do anything with the Crown shareholding. It is unreasonable for the Secretary of State to have such a power. We shall return to the matter on Report. It is a serious problem and I know that others are applying their minds to it. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

The amendment lists items that should be included in the Bill and provides an opportunity for Committee members to debate the strategic shareholder agreement. In the course of our deliberations, we have covered many of the issues discussed in that 75-page document. We do not need to go into details, although we might have done so had we dealt with the matter earlier. We have received responses to many matters that we have raised. Indeed, I was pleased that the Minister cantered through many such items when he introduced the clause. I do not wish to raise anything specific, although I am tempted to turn to page 12 of the draft document and discuss the European Commission and competition policy. However, I shall resist that temptation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we debate the amendment, let me say that I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for recognising that there has been considerable discussion on the strategic partnership agreement. I hope that all Committee members will view the amendment in that light.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Poole pointed out, amendment no. 394 lists certain matters and would require the strategic partnership agreement to contain provisions relating to them, However, that list is identical to the contents lists of the draft strategic partnership agreement, so it would appear that the amendment's purpose is to provide the Committee with an opportunity to discuss that agreement.
<P>
As you rightly pointed out, Mr. Gale, we have had a thorough discussion of most matters in that agreement. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman's purpose in tabling the amendment has been met. I see no benefit in listing the contents of the strategic partnership agreement twice--in the Bill and in the agreement itself--so I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. Opposition Members are especially pleased that all deliberations on the shareholder agreement must be conducted in English. Given the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 (Debate on Clause or Schedule standing part), and Standing Order No. 89 (Procedure in Standing Committees), That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:--

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 359, in page 32, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(4A) The Secretary of State must exercise his powers under this section, so as to ensure that the aggregate of the amounts outstanding in respect of the principal of loans made under this section does not at any time exceed 1,000 million.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 360 and 362.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Before I deal with the amendments in detail, with your indulgence, Mr. Gale, I shall give an extremely brief explanation of clause 50's purposes to assist the Committee.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to make loans to transferee companies wholly owned by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Crown or their subsidiaries. Therefore, it is an interim provision and, if necessary, will only be used prior to the establishment of the PPP. Potential recipients of such loans will therefore be NATS, any of its holding companies, and any of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Treasury approval is required for making loans, the terms of repayment and interest rates.
<P>
Any loans made under the clause will be paid out of the national loans fund. The Secretary of State is required to prepare an annual account of loans made and to send it to the Comptroller and Auditor General. NATS' current source of funding is loans made to it by the CAA, which are in turn provided by the national loans fund. During the period when NATS is wholly owned by the Crown, it will no longer have access to that source of funding, so we want the Government to be able to make loans to it during that time. This power will not be required once the PPP has been established. I hope that that helps the Committee to understand clause 50.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Do I understand that once the PPP is in action, the clause falls by the wayside, because there is no power to finance the partnership company on that basis?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is correct. The clause applies to the pre-PPP stage.
<P>
The amendments relate to clauses 51 and 55 as well as clause 50. Amendment No. 359 to clause 50 prescribes an upper limit of 1,000 million which may not be exceeded by the Government in respect of the aggregate principal owed on outstanding loans. It is Government accounting policy to prescribe such limits. The amounts have been agreed with the Treasury and are expected to be sufficient for NATS's requirements. In other words, they represent the maximum sums that may be required in the event of a delay in the PPP.
<P>
Amendment No. 360 to clause 51 imposes an upper limit that may not be exceeded in respect of financial assistance given by either the Treasury or the Secretary of State. The maximum aggregate amounts of principal that can be guaranteed under the clause by either the Treasury or the Secretary of State must not at any time exceed 500 million. Again, it is Government policy to prescribe the total sum that may be covered by guarantees at any one time and the amendment is designed to fulfil that objective. The arrangements are, of course, in respect of new loans.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 362 to clause 55 reflects Government policy on the extinguishment of debts, which does not provide for the liability to pay interest to be foregone. This provision is to protect the national loans fund. Subsection (6) is amended so that a direction under the clause to extinguish liabilities will relate to only the principal sum of the loan, not the principal plus interest.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(11) If a payment is not made as required by arrangements under subsection (8), as soon as practicable after the default occurs the Treasury or the Secretary of State (depending on who made the arrangements) must lay a statement of the default before each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 As the procedure whereby the Minister offers a brief explanation of the clause seemed helpful to the Committee in respect of clause 50 and earlier clauses, I shall do the same now.
<P>
Clause 51 enables the Secretary of State or the Treasury to guarantee the financial obligations of certain companies which are transferred under a transfer scheme while they are wholly owned by either the CAA or the Crown. The potential beneficiaries of such guarantees will be NATS itself, any holding company of NATS and any wholly owned subsidiary of NATS. A guarantee provided under the clause will continue to have effect once the company whose obligations are guaranteed passes into the private sector, but the Secretary of State or the Treasury would be unable to issue any new guarantees once that had happened. After giving a guarantee under the clause or issuing a sum in fulfilment of that guarantee, the Treasury or the Secretary of State must lay an appropriate statement before each House of Parliament.
<P>
The provision is designed to enable the Secretary of State to give a guarantee if NATS or its holding company cannot obtain a guarantee elsewhere or can only obtain a guarantee at commercial rates, which is unacceptable. For example, it is standard Treasury practice to guarantee the overdrafts of public sector companies, which ensures that they benefit from improved interest rates. Any newly incorporated subsidiaries of NATS will not be able to give guarantees themselves, as they will have no track record and might not have enough assets to set against outstanding liabilities.
<P>
Amendment No. 361 would ensure that the Parliament is properly informed of any failure on the part of the transferee to make a payment by virtue of subsection (8) and is in the spirit of the Government's accounting policy. The Treasury or the Secretary of State, depending on who made the arrangements, is required to lay before each House a statement detailing any default by a transferee on a payment that is required to be made in respect of sums issued in fulfilment of a guarantee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 51, as amended ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Grants</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 33, line 40, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
It is clear that most of the arrangements we are debating relate to the company before it becomes involved with a private sector shareholder. By seeking to delete subsection (2), I am trying to ascertain whether the administrative costs of 35 million that are given in the explanatory notes to the Bill would be included. At an earlier stage we were given to understand that some reorganisation costs would occur as a result of what the Government are doing under the licence agreement. Apart from the normal sums of money that the company may need simply to continue trading, will any of the 35 million costs for reorganisation and change within the business fall under the clause or any other clause? I hope that the Minister can enlighten me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, administrative costs would be included in those grants. For the convenience of the Committee, I shall say a few words more about the purposes of the clause and the Government's response to the amendment.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to make grants to transferee companies while they are wholly owned either by the CAA or the Crown. The potential recipients of such grants will be NATS itself, a holding company of NATS and any wholly owned subsidiary of NATS. The Secretary of State cannot make a grant unless he has received the approval of the Treasury. Payment of a grant can be made the subject of conditions, which the Treasury must approve.
<P>
Those of us who have read to the end of the Bill will know that clause 229 provides that any grants made will be paid out of money provided by Parliament. The Secretary of State needs the ability to give the transferee companies a range of financial assistance while they remain in public ownership, and grant aid is one such measure.
<P>
The amendment in the name of the hon. Member for North Essex would prevent the Secretary of State from making grants to NATS or a wholly owned subsidiary of NATS. It would also render provisions in the remaining subsections of the clause redundant, as no grant can be paid without the prescribed power in subsection (2). I should make it clear that the power to award grants would be exercised only while NATS remained in public ownership. There is no question of grants after the PPP has been established. The power is also intended to be a reserve power that would be used only if grant aid were considered to be the most effective form of financial assistance in any given circumstance.
<P>
Clause 50 provides for the making of loans, which is another alternative which would be considered if NATS were in need of finance while remaining in public ownership. Our intention has been to provide for a degree of flexibility in the range of assistance that can be offered. These provisions are precedented in legislation relating to past sales of Government assets. Accordingly, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that full explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 368 in page 34, line 25, leave out 'the transferee is wholly owned by the Crown.' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'shares in the transferee are held by the Crown (whether or not a special share within the meaning of section 49 above, and whether or not such special share has converted to ordinary shares),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister explained how the clause is expected to work in relation to trustees' investment. The amendment is intended to prevent the Crown from having a controlling share over the transferee, but requires that the Crown has some shares in the transferee. Perhaps the Minister could explain why that is the case and give us his considered opinion of our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment would extend the benefit of clause 53 to a situation where the shares in NATS are admitted to listing on the London stock exchange in circumstances where NATS was not wholly owned by the Crown immediately prior to admission. If the amendment were accepted, clause 53 would apply to a flotation of NATS after the PPP had been established, as well as to a flotation implemented in substitution for the proposed PPP.
<P>
Before I address the amendment specifically, it may be helpful if I provide a brief explanation of clause 53. Its purpose is to provide relief from the investment restrictions in the Trustee Investments Act 1961. That Act includes a provision which has the effect of restricting the ability of trustees to invest in certain securities, unless the company issuing those securities has paid a dividend in each of the five years immediately preceding the year in which the trustee proposes to make the investment. NATS has not paid any dividends since its inception in 1996. The clause has the effect of deeming the payment of dividends by NATS during the period in question, and so removes the restriction on trustee investments in the company in the event of a flotation. Clause 53 is intended to apply only where NATS is wholly owned by the Crown immediately prior to any flotation.
<P>
I should stress that that does not imply an intention on our part to float NATS. I have said on many occasions that that is not our plan. However, in the event of a selection of a strategic partner not proceeding as intended, the Government might be required to consider a flotation. If that happened, the Government would want to ensure that no technical restrictions prevented investment by the public, and especially by the large institutions that would probably be major investors in NATS. That is the reason for the provisions of clause 53.
<P>
In case the hon. Gentleman is sceptical, were the provision not to apply, the absence of any such safeguard that would make it far more difficult to proceed with a flotation because so many institutions would be debarred from considering it could have a dampening effect on the overall price that the Government could negotiate with the strategic partner; the strategic partner would know that the alternative option was not available. Therefore, the provision is significant in terms of the price that the Government hope to achieve from the agreement with the strategic partner. It is not simply a provision to be used in the event of negotiations being unsuccessful.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 368, moved by the hon. Member for North Essex. The restrictions of the 1961 Act apply only for the five years immediately preceding the relevant investment by trustees. Although we would wish such a restriction to be disapplied for the period that NATS was in public ownership--during which time it would be unlikely to pay dividends--we would not expect the same treatment to apply once the PPP was established, as it would not be unreasonable to expect the company to commence the payment of dividends from that time. The amendment is not needed, as it would apply only when the body was no longer wholly publicly owned.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will know from our earlier discussions that we have already prescribed a limitation on flotation following the establishment of a public-private partnership, a limitation that is linked to the completion of the new Scottish centre. We do not envisage the centre being completed until at least 2006, which is more than five years away. The five-year period before a flotation might arise is already covered. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with that explanation--it was complicated, because the provisions are complex--and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am satisfied with the Minister's explanation, but he has told us something even more stunning than we heard earlier, which is that the Bill provides for the flotation of the company if it is not possible to find a satisfactory strategic partner. That will come as a surprise to some Labour Members and certainly to those hon. Members whom the Government were seeking to placate on Second Reading.
<P>
If the Minister had announced when winding up on Second Reading that the Bill provided for a flotation in the event of the Government's not being able to find a strategic partner, I wonder what would have been the reaction of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh. It is extraordinary. I do not know whether the Government always intended that the Bill should make such a provision. Was the right hon. Gentleman aware, when he was Minister for Transport, that arrangements were being made to float the company if the Government could not pursue this rather bogus public-private partnership?
<P>
The Minister has given the Committee some stunning news. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Shadow directors</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 410, in page 35, line 14, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'neither the Secretary of State nor Treasury'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'none of the persons listed in subsection (6A)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 411 and 412.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall begin by speaking briefly about the reasons for clause 54. The main purpose of the clause is to ensure that the Secretary of State and the Treasury are not regarded as shadow directors of a transferee company, or an associated company, for the purposes of the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 that are listed in clause 54(4). Similar provisions are to be found in the Commonwealth Development Corporation Act 1999--a piece of new Labour legislation--and other legislation that deals with the sale of Government assets. In other words, the purpose of the clause is to immunise the Secretary of State from being treated as a shadow director, and it relieves him of many of the obligations of a shadow director.
<P>
Shadow directors are persons who have not been appointed to the office of director of a company but who are considered to be de facto directors, operating behind the scenes. The provisions of the Companies Act referred to in subsection (4) fall into two categories--those intended to reveal to the public the persons who are directing the company from behind the scenes, and those designed to protect shareholders by preventing directors, including shadow directors, from taking financial advantage of the company.
<P>
As the Secretary of State's interest in the company will be public knowledge, the purpose of the provisions is not necessary in the context of the PPP. It would also be cumbersome and expensive to comply with certain of the technical provisions set out in the Companies Act, and the consequences of non-compliance caused by oversight could be serious.
<P>
The clause will apply prior to the establishment of the PPP to NATS itself, to any holding company and to any wholly owned subsidiaries of NATS. It will also apply after the establishment of the PPP for as long as the Crown continues to hold a special share.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): If the Secretary of State is not to be a shadow director, who will be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> There will be no shadow directors. However, we want the Secretary of State's role in relation to NATS to be absolutely transparent. He is the Crown shareholder; his role is public, and we want there to be no dubiety about it. To ensure that the Secretary of State's role is crystal clear, we are introducing the provisions to disapply certain aspects of the Companies Act. However, we do not wish the proposed provision to affect the position in relation to section 309 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires directors to have regard to the interests of the employees.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 410 to 412 seek to ensure that the provisions of the clause extend beyond the Treasury and the Secretary of State. They aim to prevent anyone acting on behalf of the Crown--that is any Minister, any nominee of a Minister, and any Northern Ireland Department--from being regarded as a shadow director for the purposes of the provisions listed in subsections (4) and (6). Without that clarification, there is a risk that other Ministers, or their nominees, or Northern Ireland Departments might be caught by the shadow director provisions in the Companies Act if they are not specifically disapplied. The amendments seek to prevent that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I beg to move amendment No. 369, in page 35, line 17, after 'satisfied', insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
In his preamble to the previous group of amendments, the Under-Secretary dealt with the subject covered by this probing amendment. We thought that the amendment was necessary because we believed that the Secretary of State and the Treasury were getting far too much protection under clause 54(3). We wanted that protection to extend only to matters and rights attaching to the special share. I doubt that the Under-Secretary has anything further to add, as he has already covered the subject extensively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am reluctant to speak, because the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) indicated that he was satisfied with my explanation. In the circumstances, I shall be gracious and resume my seat. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 414.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendments seek to ensure that an associated company of the transferee is a company wholly owned by the Crown, or a subsidiary of the transferee under a transfer scheme. By virtue of clause 63(6), the definition of "subsidiary" in section 736 of the Companies Act 1985 will apply. That has the effect of restricting the term "associated" to a company in which the PPP vehicle owns at least 50.1 per cent. of the shares or has control over the composition of the board of directors.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
6 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This clause has been looming over me for weeks, because it involves an aspect of the proposals that I still do not fully understand and the waters have been muddied by various communications from the Government on proceeds of sale and the liabilities to be extinguished or transferred. The clause deals with the extinguishment of liabilities. Will the Minister explain exactly how a liability is extinguished? I understand that the loans outstanding to National Air Traffic Services amount to approximately 500 million. I am unsure which Minister will respond.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> The buck is being passed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The buck is being passed along the Front Bench.
<P>
My understanding is that the debt is held by NATS, and we obviously want that money back as part of the sale proceeds, but, if I am right, that money must be netted off the sale proceeds. As the Under-Secretary can tell, I am a little bit confused. I should be extremely grateful to him if he would explain the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am in awe of the hon. Gentleman's confidence in me, but I shall do my best to allay his concerns, which have caused him so much distress over such a long period.
<P>
Clauses 55 and 56 will enable the Government to optimise the value of the assets in the sale. Clause 55 will give the Secretary of State the power, with the Treasury's consent, to direct the Civil Aviation Authority to release NATS from any debt that it owes the CAA and, in turn, to extinguish any corresponding liability of the CAA to the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman might find it helpful to know that those debts amount to approximately 300 million.
<P>
At present, The CAA is the sole source of borrowing for NATS. The CAA has the power to borrow sums from the Secretary of State, who, in turn, borrows from the national loans fund, and it lends to NATS such of those sums as NATS needs to perform air navigation services functions on behalf of the CAA.
<P>
Clause 55 will provide the Secretary of State with the power to direct the CAA to release NATS from any debt that it owes the CAA. At the time of giving the direction, NATS must be a company wholly owned by the CAA. When those debts have been extinguished, the Secretary of State may, by order, extinguish the CAA's corresponding liability to him. Clause 229 will provide that the assets of the national loans fund will be reduced by an amount equivalent to that specified in such an order.
<P>
Although that process may seem rather complicated, it is the only way in which to ensure that the CAA is not left with unserviceable debts following the transfer of shares in NATS to the Secretary of State. However, the intention is not to write off NATS' existing indebtedness for all time. It is likely that replacement indebtedness of the same amount will be substituted under clause 56, which will ultimately be paid off by the private sector. Therefore, the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that the Under-Secretary has finally clarified the matter. The debts owed to the Government, the CAA and the Secretary of State may be extinguished, but they will be replaced with other debts, so no debts will be written off. Therefore, if the company were sold and the Government received 500 million net of costs, a considerable sum would be put into the Exchequer's pocket. I hope that I have understood that correctly.
<P>
Confusion has arisen because it was suggested in the notes on clauses, which were issued when the Bill was published, that that debt would be written off. The Under-Secretary now says that if any debt is written off, it will be replaced by new debt--that there will be no net writing off of debt. I should hate to think that the private sector would be given a freebie. The proposal is a thoroughly commercial arrangement. There is no reason why the Treasury should not net a substantial sum for the Chancellor's other spending programmes, and especially transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman has expressed the position admirably, accurately and succinctly. The Committee is indebted to him for that contribution. We have discussed the matter for a long time; it has now been clarified, and I am glad that we have reached a consensus.

<P>
The amendment will provide clarification. Subsection (1) lists the various land rights to which the clause applies, and included in that list at paragraph (a) is a right of reverter, or the corresponding right in Scotland. The amendment will specify in more detail the Scottish equivalent of a right of reverter in England and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What is a fiar?
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> During a previous debate, which is pertinent to this amendment, the hon. Member for North Essex said that it is difficult to get an order through the House of Lords and, by implication, that it is easy to get an order through the lower Chamber. I reassure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that our subservience is vigilant, and I hope that my intervention has assisted him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> That was most helpful. I understand that "fiar" is a Scottish property expression. I hope that I shall not be pressed too hard on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am no wiser about what a fiar is, and I am utterly in the dark about what the right of a fiar might be on the termination of a liferent. It is incumbent on the Under-Secretary to explain what the amendment means, and he has not done so. What is a fiar?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am told that it is equivalent to the right of reverter, with which the hon. Gentleman is no doubt familiar. In case he is not, it is a right whereby a property reverts to a former owner in certain circumstances, such as the current occupier no longer requiring the property for the use for which it was originally acquired.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister explain the purpose of the schedule?

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I may be able to. It is lifted from the Railways Act 1993.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> That is a Conservative Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) has not been with us long. When I do not know much about something, I always find that it is best to keep quiet until I know a bit more. If he had been with us for the earlier part of our deliberations, he would have heard many references to the precedents that underlie the Bill, and the 1993 Act is certainly one of them. It features in almost every clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall add to the reassurances that the Minister has given to my hon. Friend. The precedents for the Bill are all extremely encouraging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I should hope that the drafting style is different, but essentially, the provisions are the same. Clause 61 mentions schedule 6, which contains a detailed range of matters relating to transfers of property, rights and liabilities that may be affected under a scheme.
<P>
Paragraphs 1 to 3 deal with the allocation of property, rights and liabilities. They make provision for the division and holding of property, rights and liabilities where a part of that property is comprised in the part of the transferor's undertaking that is transferred to the transferee, and the remainder is comprised in the part that is not so transferred. If the nature of the property permits, an appropriate apportionment is made between the transferor and transferee. In case that is not possible, the paragraphs contain rules on how the allocation should be made.
<P>
Paragraphs 4 to 7 deal with the identification of the transferred property. The parties are under a duty to conclude a written agreement to identify what is to be transferred and what is to be retained. If that agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of State will have the power to determine how the property, rights or liabilities are to be divided.
<P>
Paragraphs 8 to 10 cover the discharge of functions. The parties involved have a duty to conclude such written agreements as may be necessary to give each other the rights and safeguards necessary for the operation of their respective undertakings, and to modify the division of the transferor's undertaking in order to help the parties involved exercise their functions. If agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of State will have the power to resolve a dispute.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraph 11 deals with transfers by agreement. At any time within a 12-month period, the transferor and any relevant transferee may, with the Secretary of State's approval, agree in writing a variation of the transfer scheme. In addition, correcting transfers between transferees in the event of assets having been transferred to the wrong party may also be effected, again with the Secretary of State's approval.
<P>
Paragraph 12 provides that, if a transferor of land or other property under a transfer scheme is entitled to retain possession of a title deed or similar document, the transferor is deemed to have given the transferee a written acknowledgement of the transferee's right to production of that title document and delivery of copies. Paragraph 13 deals with transfers of foreign property, rights and liabilities. The parties involved have a duty to ensure that the vesting of the property in the transferee is effective under foreign law. Paragraph 14 provides that certificates of ownership are conclusive evidence of the contents of transfers made by transfer scheme.
<P>
Paragraph 15 is designed to prevent the transferor or the transferee dealing with land in such a way as to disadvantage the other party. If the Secretary of State is satisfied that that has happened, he has the power to order that such action be taken as is be necessary to protect the aggrieved party.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I cannot get used to the speed at which we move these days.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 330 to 354 make several technical changes, which fall into four broad categories. The meaning of various expressions is clarified, mainly to ensure consistency of interpretation with other tax legislation. Changes to the drafting of several provisions are designed to ensure that they achieve their purpose. Further drafting amendments are purely consequential on the other amendments. Two new provisions will be added, and some will be extended, in order to enhance the main object of the schedule, which is to achieve a tax-neutral result by preventing parties to transactions made under chapter 2 of part I from being placed in a more beneficial tax position than that of other companies in the private sector, or from being exposed to inappropriate tax liabilities in future.
<P>
An example of an amendment in the fourth category is No. 334. The purpose of paragraph 3 is to ensure that a person to whom securities are issued by virtue of a direction from the Secretary of State does not incur an exaggerated liability to capital gains tax on disposal of securities as a result of having acquired them in that way. Paragraph 3 relates only to securities issued under clause 47. The same tax treatment should apply to securities issued under clause 56. The amendment will add a new provision to extend the tax regime under paragraph 3 to a person who acquires securities under clause 56.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The amendments are all technical, having to do with corporation tax and securities. As I, like the Minister, have run out of notes, I shall not say more now. I see the Minister has caught up with his notes; I am glad because I am sure he would like to give the Committee a full explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The three amendments deal with certain aspects of employee share participation and share scheme arrangements. Amendment No. 371 concerns Inland Revenue-approved share option and profit- sharing schemes established under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and qualifying employee share ownership trusts established under the Finance Act 1989.
<P>
Share schemes can offer certain tax benefits to companies providing them or to employees participating in them. Qualifying share ownership trusts, which are known as QUESTs, provide for corporation relief for contributions made by companies to them, and for capital gains tax reliefs for shares transferred to them. For both QUESTs and tax-relieved employee share schemes, several conditions have to be satisfied, a number of which relate to the shares in the company establishing the scheme. The amendment would ensure that the shares in any company which is a transferee under a transfer scheme or is an "associated company" of the transferee--the expression "associated company" not being defined by the amendment--are to be treated as satisfying all those conditions for share schemes and certain of those conditions for QUESTs, whether or not they otherwise would do.
<P>
Amendment No. 372 relates to a company, other than a Government-owned company, which has established its own Inland Revenue approved share option or profit-sharing scheme or employee share ownership trust and which acquires shares in a company which is the transferee under a transfer scheme. That would apply, for example, to the strategic partner's acquisition of a shareholding in NATS. The amendment would ensure that the employees of that transferee company or of any "associated company"--again undefined--of that transferee company will be eligible to participate in the acquiring company's scheme or trust, whether or not that would otherwise be permissible under relevant taxation provisions or under the rules of the scheme or trust itself. In addition, if that participation would otherwise infringe any other legal requirement, it is to be deemed not to do so.
<P>
Amendment No. 373 seeks to grant exemption from certain income tax liabilities to any individual who acquires shares or other securities in a company which is the transferee under a transfer scheme. Income tax liabilities can be incurred by a person who acquires shares in a company through a right or opportunity available to him by reason of that person's office or employment with that or any other company.
<P>
Amendment No. 371 would make it possible for NATS, or a subsidiary of NATS, to use shares that have any form of restriction attached to them in various types of tax-favoured employee share schemes. That would provide a facility for NATS which is not available to other companies that want to set up these share schemes. That is because other companies have to fulfil a number of conditions concerning their shares, including ensuring that the shares are not subject to any restrictions except in certain specified circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 372 could make it easier for employees of NATS to participate in certain existing tax-advantaged share schemes than for employees of any other company with a similar ownership structure to that of NATS after the PPP has been implemented. Amendment No. 373 would provide more advantageous tax treatment for employees holding shares in NATS than for employees acquiring shares in another company by reason of their employment.
<P>
That is contrary to the basic philosophy of schedule 7, the main purpose of which is to achieve tax neutrality for persons participating in transfer schemes and in certain related transactions, such as the acquisition of shares issued by a company that is the transferee under a transfer scheme. That principle applies to employees and other individuals as much as it does to companies.
<P>
I see no reason why several of the conditions that have to be met before a company can set up a tax-favoured employee share scheme should not apply to NATS, nor why it should be made easier for employees of NATS to participate in an employee share scheme established by the strategic partner than it would be for employees of any other company in which the strategic partner acquired a similar proportionate shareholding, Furthermore, why should the employee shareholding in NATS be subject to a more lenient tax regime than that which would normally apply?
<P>
In addition, the new paragraph 17C, to be inserted by amendment No. 372, would go beyond the ambit of schedule 7. Clause 62 makes it clear that the sole purpose of the schedule is to contain provisions about tax. Making changes to other areas of the law is therefore not a matter connected with schedule 7; still less is the schedule connected with changing how a private sector company's own share scheme or other contractual arrangements should be interpreted. Accordingly, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am tempted to ask the Under-Secretary to repeat his answer, but at this time of the day I shall accept what he says. We are trying to give some advantages to those employees of NATS who might wish to buy shares. But, having listened to the hon. Gentleman's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 407 to 409.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendments would make several technical changes to certain definitions under clause 63. Amendment No. 406 would restrict the definitions to chapter 11 of part I of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 407 and 408 would include in the clause a definition of the term "company", as defined in the Companies Act 1985. Amendment No. 409 would include a new subsection that would displace any of the specific definitions under clause 63 if a contrary intention appears. For example, paragraph 15 of schedule 7 provides for the expressions used in that paragraph and in chapter II of part IV of the Finance Act 1986 to have the same meaning. Therefore, the word "company" will have the wider meaning that is given under section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and will include the CAA, which is a corporation, but not a company under the 1985 Act.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This part of the Bill is important as it deals with air navigation and airspace policy. One of the recurring themes during the processes of the PPP and the consultations was that of airspace policy and, in particular, how the separation of the MOD from the CAA would operate.
<P>
The Director of Airspace Policy would set the general policy requirements. The amendment seeks answers and reassurances about the separation of civil and military aircraft, which has arisen before in the debate. We also seek reassurance about capacity and the question of turning circles over Heathrow being reduced from three miles to two and a half miles. There was some press comment last week to the effect that capacity was being increased over Europe by Eurocontrol in order to deal with capacity constraints, and an article in The Economist this week set out general problems in capacity throughout Europe.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The capacity question is important. As was stated earlier, there is no safety issue because those dealing with air traffic control will leave aircraft on the ground before they will endanger life. Nevertheless there is an issue of efficiency and, with the growing number of airlines, of delays. Everything diminishes efficiency in the provision of airspace services. We have included "any other relevant matters" so that the Minister could cover any other legitimate areas of debate on airspace policy. It is a critical matter on which people have expressed concern, in particular in respect of the separation of military from civil aircraft and general capacity questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend, who has made some important points. I want to raise some more general points on clause stand part but it might assist the Committee if, in dealing the amendment we were not just to deal with--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we progress any further I should point out that there is one selected group of amendments to the clause. I am perfectly happy to have a broad debate if it helps the hon. Gentleman. If he wishes to raise certain matters on clause stand part, he may, but if he would like to raise those issues now I am happy for him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. It may be convenient for the Committee if I do so. It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us the provenance of the clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, it is critical because it gives the Secretary of State the power to give directions to the CAA to determine its powers and everything it is required to do in connection with air navigation.
<P>
I can only assume that the clause has come from some other form of legislation and that it is being re-enacted here. It establishes the relationship between the Secretary of State and the CAA, which will not be part of the public-private partnership. Will it be the empowering clause for the issuing of air navigation orders, or will such orders be issued under the Civil Aviation Act 1982? Clause 64(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may nominate a member of the CAA for the purposes of this section, and a person so nominated must perform on the CAA's behalf such of its air navigation functions as the Secretary of State may specify."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If there is a difference of opinion between the nominee of the Secretary of State and the CAA, under subsection 6(a)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the CAA must refer the matter to the Secretary of State".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We appear to be going round in circles. If someone who has been appointed to the CAA by the Secretary of State has general concerns on any matter or raises a specific concern about national security, he is to report it to the CAA, which must then consult the Secretary of State. Will the Minister clarify the clause's precise intention and provenance? What is the purpose of the nominee being appointed and then having that relationship with the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> The point is that the provision gives the Secretary of State a final say over the way in which a commercial strategic partner will operate. Allowing the CAA to look at matters on the grounds that they have implications for its air navigation function means that it can consider virtually everything that NATS is going to do. It appears to allow the Secretary of  State--or rather the nominee with the Secretary of State's help--to run riot through the commercial interests of NATS' strategic partner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Although the clause contains no mention of NATS or its successor companies--it refers only to the CAA--my hon. Friend has raised an important question. Will the Secretary of State's nominee on the CAA be able to lay down the law to NATS or its successor company? We have shown that the clause will confer very wide powers and it would help if the Minister would be kind enough to elucidate on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope to be able to deal with all the issues raised by the hon. Members for Aldershot and for Hexham. Although I want to give a detailed response to the amendment which was tabled by the hon. Member for Poole, in general it is not for the Bill to deal in detail with arrangements for the separation of capacity; rather, it should deal with the structures by which the policy is enunciated and the arrangements made. I shall return to that towards the end of my remarks.
<P>
As we are embarking on a whole new chapter of the Bill, it is appropriate for me to talk briefly about its general purposes. I make no apology for referring to my remarks as a "tour d'horizon"-- chapter III covers airspace policy, so what could be more appropriate? It provides for planning and managing the efficient use of UK airspace. I am sure that hon. Members will be reassured to know that although the arrangements that will be put in place under chapter III change the organisation structure through which air space policy is carried out, they change neither its content nor its aims.
<P>
Perhaps I can explain why chapter III refers to air navigation rather than airspace policy. Air navigation is a term that is defined in existing aviation legislation--section 105 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, to be precise. In broad terms, it covers air traffic services--for example, air traffic control--and airspace policy. Section 72 of the 1982 Act places the CAA under a duty to join the Secretary of State in providing air navigation services in a manner to be specified by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State's directions to the Civil Aviation Authority are contained in the Civil Aviation Authority (Air Navigation Services) directions 1996, which I shall refer to as the 1996 directions.
<P>
One of the main concerns of the hon. Member for Poole was about transparency and ensuring that matters are brought into the public domain. The CAA 1996 directions are already public knowledge and are conveyed to the public by gazettes and by the CAA annual report. There is already a good deal of transparency and publicity about directions on airspace.
<P>
The 1996 directions require the CAA to provide all air navigation services other than those relating to airspace policy through NATS--in other words, operational air traffic control services and related functions. The directions require the CAA to collaborate with the Secretary of State for Defence to ensure that airspace policy functions are provided on its behalf by a Director of Airspace Policy. In other words, airspace policy functions are delegated to the DAP.
<P>
The Director of Airspace policy is appointed by the Secretary of State for Defence--with the approval of the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions--and heads up the Directorate of Airspace Policy, which is jointly resourced by the CAA and the Ministry of Defence. He is a serving Royal Air Force officer, reporting through the chairman of the Joint Air Navigation Services Council to the CAA board and the MOD. That creates a number of interfaces and, as will be seen, we are proposing to streamline the arrangement in the future by effectively absorbing the DAP into the CAA.
<P>
The DAP develops, promulgates, monitors and enforces a policy for the use of UK airspace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> The Under-Secretary makes an interesting point.
<P>
At present, responsibility lies with the Royal Air Force officer as Director of Airspace Policy. Will that continue to apply? What arrangements will be in place to ensure that the military-civil interface on airspace policy continues? We must remember the critical importance of military airspace in the equation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a critical question, which I shall answer in the course of my remarks. Let me first continue with the general functions of the Director of Airspace Policy.
<P>
In developing, promulgating and enforcing policy for the use of UK airspace, the director must ensure first that UK airspace is used in the most effective way practicable that is consistent with securing the safe operation and most expeditious flow of air traffic. Secondly, as far as is practicable, the needs of all classes of airspace user--civil commercial, civil leisure and military--can be met, without according preferential treatment to either civil or military users as such. Thirdly, the interests of aerodrome operators and other air traffic services providers are to be taken into account.
<P>
What is proposed for the future? As the Committee knows, the Bill will remove NATS from the CAA, so that the CAA will no longer be able to provide air traffic services. However, the Government recognise that airspace policy is a regulatory activity, with both safety and economic implications, and therefore firmly believe and intend that airspace policy should remain in the public sector. As a consequential amendment, the Bill will repeal section 72 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 which, as I said, is the provision that imposes the CAA's duty to provide air navigation services--both the air traffic services, which will continue to be provided by NATS, and airspace policy. It clearly makes no sense for the CAA to continue to be under a duty to provide air traffic services when it no longer has the resources to do so. The 1996 directions will also be repealed. Clause 64 will provide for the Secretary of State to impose duties and functions on the CAA with regard to airspace policy through new directions.
<P>
We intend to change the organisational structure by which the CAA's airspace policy functions are carried out. The matter is quite simple: clause 64 provides for the Director of Airspace Policy to become a member of the CAA board as a nominee of the Secretary of State with specific responsibility for airspace policy. The Director of Airspace Policy will continue what he does now, but within the CAA. The reorganisation will have no discernible effect on how airspace policy is implemented or on airspace users and their interests.
<P>
6.45 pm
<P>
The Director of Airspace Policy has a unique responsibility to reconcile civil and military interests and his decisions and actions may have implications for national security. It is clearly important that that should continue to be recognised under future arrangements. The Bill will therefore put in place a safeguard so that the Director of Airspace Policy has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State for Defence in the extremely unlikely event of his feeling that a proposed decision of the CAA board could prejudice national security. That helps to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Aldershot.

Does the reference to Secretary of State in clause 64 mean the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, or both?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I need to consult my copy of the Bill, as I was getting carried away with an extremely interesting aspect of it. As I peruse the clause, I can say that the answer is both in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If the nominee is anxious about the implications for the CAA's air navigations functions or national security, do I take it that references to the CAA referring such a matter to the Secretary of State apply to both Secretaries of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I apologise for not clarifying the matter sufficiently. I trust that further explanation will be helpful.
<P>
The Director of Airspace Policy consults the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on directions. However, he consults the Secretary of State for Defence on any appeal that he may wish to make. I said that before, but the matter is complicated and benefits from reiteration. I repeat that the Director of Airspace will, in future, be appointed jointly by the Secretaries of State for Defence and for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It goes without saying that they will appoint the best person for the job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> This is a serious matter and we must be clear about where responsibility for it lies in the clause. I am not certain that the Bill is explicit about where the buck stops. Does it stop with the Secretary of State for Defence, as the Under-Secretary implies, especially in relation to the Director of Airspace Policy, or does it stop with the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions? What happens if there is a difference between the two Departments?
<P>
Before the Bill reports, it is incumbent on us to make absolutely clear where responsibility lies for the extremely important issue of airspace policy and for flagging up concerns about the interface between the civil airspace community and the military.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives me the opportunity to clarify the matter further. We deem potential conflict extremely unlikely, but the nature of legislation is to account for all eventualities, including extremely improbable worst case scenarios, so that a body of law is already in place with clear guidance for those who fall under its ambit.
<P>
When there might be conflict between the DAP and the CAA board, the right of appeal would apply only after all the normal processes of internal consultation and overall board discussion had taken place and had not fully resolved the issue. In those circumstances, the CAA would be obliged to refer the matter to the Secretary of State, who would issue such directions to the CAA in relation to the matter as he thought fit in the light of national security. I should emphasise that we foresee the appeal mechanism being used rarely, if ever. The Government have great confidence in the CAA and its ability to reach the right decisions and to balance all interests and relevant factors. History bears that out.
<P>
I would like to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 64 because he asked whether it detailed the arrangements, which I have sought to explain. Subsection (5) seems to spell out the procedures that will be adopted and the reasons for them, should there be a difference of opinion between the nominee and the CAA. On the question of directions, I reiterate that the appeal will be to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, If there is a continuing disagreement, the appeal will be to the Secretary of State for Defence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I confess to being not very bright, but I have listened to the Minister and am still not clear about this extremely important subject. I suspect that the sudden acceleration in business this afternoon has left Ministers slightly behind their briefs, or the briefs slightly behind their Ministers.
<P>
As I understand it, an RAF officer called the Director of Airspace Policy is in charge of the military side and liaises with the CAA, which currently has duties relating to air navigation issues. If an airline wanted extra slots or some rearrangement of the schedules, that matter would go straight to the CAA. It would be agreed or disagreed with, and NATS would be given the relevant order. That is straightforward.
<P>
What seems to be happening is that the DAP's role--the role of the RAF officer--will be subsumed by a member of the CAA. One of the members of the CAA will be appointed the official nominee. I take it that it could even be the former director of aerospace policy--[Hon. Members: "Airspace policy."] I am sorry. Now I am even more confused, and I have lost my train of thought.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot talked about conflict, but I am more concerned about the chain of command. At present, there is the CAA, NATS and the airlines. The link is between the CAA and the airlines, and NATS is the servant. In future, the airlines will interface with NATS, which will interface with the CAA. If airline operators disagree on how things have been managed, the only appeal procedure open to them is to the nominee, which is a member of the CAA. That is highly unsatisfactory.
<P>
If there were a disagreement between the nominee and, say, the commercial interests of the airline, the appeal would go to the Secretary of State. The procedure is extremely unclear. I may have misunderstood it; will the Under-Secretary clarify exactly where the individual responsibility lies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I shall be even more swift than my hon. Friend. I am also in a muddle. I shall cite a practical example. The National Tri-Service Helicopter School is based at RAF Shawbury in my constituency at which all RAF and naval helicopter pilots are trained. There is a substantial number of low-level aircraft movements in the area. The northern half of Shropshire and the eastern part of north Wales are blocked off against fixed-wing flights but, occasionally, the odd renegade from RAF Valley flies low in a fixed-wing aircraft.
<P>
Flying at a higher level is a heavy volume of traffic from Manchester and Liverpool airports. Can the Minister explain the method by which, first, the two military interests would make representations for airspace and, secondly, how those two main airports would make approaches to the CAA to bid for airspace or discuss matters related directly to the allocation of airspace? If they are not happy with the result, to whom do they appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The answer to the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) is that there will be no change in the current arrangements. Subsuming the DAP into the CAA is simply a formalisation of the current practice. The way in which the use of airspace by civil and military aircraft is currently resolved will be the way in which such matters are resolved in the future. The DAP currently carries out the CAA's airspace policy functions on its behalf. There will be no change to the current arrangements.
<P>
I am willing to go into detail about the roles and functions of the DAP, but I must say to the hon. Member for Hexham that the direct interface between the airline operator and the DAP is not one of them. We are talking about structures, rather than specific arrangements. It is the responsibility of the DAP to establish the broad structures within which specific operations occur.
<P>
The Opposition seem to be troubled about who does what, who appoints whom and to whom the appeal is made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall deal first with what was apparently a matter of some confusion to the hon. Member for Aldershot. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will appoint the DAP on advice from the Secretary of State for Defence. The DAP will act on the directions of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, with the agreement of the Secretary of State for Defence. However, the DAP may cause an appeal to be made to the Secretary of State for Defence on issues of national security. Where there is disagreement on the CAA board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for that answer, which helps to clarify matters--although the arrangement that he has just described is not set out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B>(Coventry, North-East): It is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it is. It is not. The legislation allows a nominee to make representations to the CAA; the CAA must then refer the matter to the Secretary of State. It does not set out the arrangements for the relationship between the DAP and the Secretary of State for Defence.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the Minister respond to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire and confirm that I am right about the designation of controlled airspace, military airspace, low-flying routes and so on, as matters of policy to be decided by the CAA? It will then be for NATS or its successor company to accept that airspace policy as laid down by the CAA and to make representations to the CAA on such matters as altering air ways and arrangements for specific areas of controlled airspace. Ultimately, responsibility will lie with the CAA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The DAP will continue to determine the structure and classification of airspace, in consultation with airspace users, as well as air traffic service providers. The Government will ensure that the CAA has adequate powers to enforce its decisions. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I shall deal with the amendments--tabled a long time ago by the hon. Member for Poole. I hope that my introductory remarks made clear that the DAP already has responsibility for air navigation services. All we are doing under this Bill is to ensure formal separation of that function from NATS. I repeat that the Bill will keep responsibility for airspace policy within the CAA and within the public sector. The functions and obligations of the DAP are currently laid down in the 1996 ministerial directions to the CAA. The directions specifically require the DAP to balance the needs of civil and military users and to ensure that the airspace arrangements should not be an undue restriction on service providers to meet capacity demands.
<P>
I have explained the ways in which airspace policy is projected into the public domain, but amendments Nos. 374 and 375 appear to suggest that airspace policy should be set out in a published report from the Secretary of State.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order I have reached an understanding that we will complete our proceedings. I have noticed some hon. Members looked worriedly at the clock. I remind the Committee that we are dealing with legislation that will affect people's lives--literally. It is serious and must be discussed thoroughly. If hon. Members can contain their impatience, I am sure that the Minister will be able to complete his remarks and the Opposition can reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Thank you for that advice, Mr. Gale. How adequately I complete my remarks is for others to judge. However, I intend to be brief.
<P>
The Government do not agree that it is necessary for the Secretary of State to publish a report, but we are keen to ensure that relevant information is made available to the public. I therefore undertake carefully to consider the requirement expressed in the amendments with the CAA, to see how best it can be done. However, primary legislation is not required to achieve that end. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his full explanation. This short debate has brought home the fact that aerospace policy is a serious matter, and that interaction is important. I thank him for undertaking to consider the matter further. He said that various trade newspapers had published CAA policy. However, given the strain in general capacity over Europe and the competing demands of and general worries about military-civil interaction, it is important that the CAA and the DAP should give serious thought to whether a document should be published setting out the policy agenda that the DAP is working to.
<P>
I am glad to have received those assurances from the Under-Secretary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 64 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
