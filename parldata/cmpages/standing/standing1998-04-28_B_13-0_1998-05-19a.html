No. 242, in page 41, leave out lines 44 to 46.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I gather that a frisson of excitement passed through the Committee before the adjournment for lunch. That frisson concerned the prospect of debating defendants' consent to television links. I hope that Committee members have been able to contain their excitement during the short adjournment, for we have now arrived at the anticipated discussion.
<P>
Amendment No. 194 would make the use of television links subject to the consent of the accused. It is very similar to amendment No. 422, tabled by the Liberal Democrats. However, their amendment is slightly different, because it would give defendants the absolute right to prevent television links from taking place. We do not go quite as far as that. Our amendment would require defendants to have a good reason for withholding consent and is as sensible as the rest of our amendments. In view of the security considerations that we have already touched on, we think that it is important for defendants to have a good reason to stop television links taking place. Defendants who are security risks cannot facilitate their removal from prison to court for a hearing by witholding their consent, unless they have a good reson for doing so.
<P>
As we adverted to earlier, defendants have escaped while in transit and have gone on to commit serious offences. However, that must be weighed against fairness. Provided defendants have a good reason for withholding their consent, they should be able to do so. We wish to explore that issue now. Defendants may be able to show that they would not get a fair hearing through a television link. That brings us back to the issue of access to legal advice. We note that Liberty, from whom we have had a representation, opposes the use of television links unless defendants give their consent and unless court buildings have television link facilities for defendants to have private consultations with their lawyers.
<P>
We discussed access to legal advice before lunch, and we have heard about the Government's plans for pilot schemes. I refer to Liberty to show that the two matters are part and parcel of the question of the fairness of proceedings.
<P>
I turn the amendments Nos. 195 and 196, which concern another aspect of these of television links. Our amendments require the bench chairmanship committee to give its consent to the arrangements for television links. We think that magistrates should be satisfied with such arrangements before links are deployed.
<P>
The Bill does not make provision for magistrates to be consulted about the use of television links. We imagine that the Government intend to have such consultations, and we hope that magistrates' views are taken into account fully. We look forward to the Minister's reassurance on this point.
<P>
I deal now with amendment No. 242. Clause 54(3) requires magistrates to give reasons for not using television links when such links are possible. That might put rather too much pressure on magistrates. They share everyone's wish to see justice administered efficiently, but they may have reasons for being unhappy with television links in particular cases or in particular courts and may not be willing to disclose those reasons in public.
<P>
We wonder whether subsection (3) takes an element of discretion away from magistrates. This morning the Minister told us how much he values the discretion of magistrates, so we hope that he will retain a little of that consideration this afternoon. In any event, magistrates will be only too willing to take full advantage of the technological opportunities that television links bring, subject to their usual considerations of fairness and the proper administration of justice.
<P>
<H5>4.34 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>4.50 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I shared the excitement of the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) at the prospect of the amendments being debated. That excitement has been heightened by the brief interlude caused by a Division in the House.
<P>
Two positions have been outlined by hon. Members on the Opposition Benches. They contrast with the Government's position in the Bill. The Liberal Democrat amendment has outlined the absolute position. When the liberty of an individual is at stake at a hearing to decide whether to grant him bail, our amendment would give that person the right to choose whether to be represented in person. It is an important departure from the existing criminal justice system to remove that right and say that an alternative form of representation can be imposed on the defendant.
<P>
The Conservative position is between our absolute position and the Government's approach. I want the Government to explain their reasons for rejecting the absolute position and for not accepting the Conservative amendment, which would enable the defence not to accept a television link if it has reasonable grounds for doing so.
<P>
We do not want to render the courts less efficient. We support the general proposition that television links should be available to save many of the costs of transporting people to and from court and to cope with the security problems that have been thrown up most famously by some of the organisations that carry out transport work. We want television links to be introduced, and our amendment would not wreck that prospect. It is merely designed to explore the reasoning behind the Government's departure from the fundamental principle that a defendant should be represented in person when his liberty is at stake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): We had a useful debate before lunch about the general principle of television links. I think that all members of the Committee reached the conclusion that such links have some merit.
<P>
We referred to the difficulties that are encountered in courts when people are late. Prisoners may not arrive on time because Securicor may have a shortage of vehicles and one vehicle may have to serve three or four courts. If that happens, proceedings cannot get under way which results in expense and delay. The Government must take such factors into account.
<P>
I support my hon. Friend the Member of Hertsmere and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), who both referred to the need for the accused's consent. Clause 54(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a court may, after hearing representations from the parties, direct that the accused shall be treated as being present in the court for any particular hearing before the start of the trial''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key words are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after hearing representations from the parties''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They mean that counsel for the Crown and counsel for the defence may make certain representations, but that the decision is a matter for the court. That troubles me. It is vital that the television link is used only when the defendant or his counsel gives explicit consent to it.
<P>
This morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) referred to the chipping away of the rights of the defendant. That was a telling phrase. Why do I say that it is important for the defendant to give his consent to the use of a television link? What are the advantages for the defendant of being present in court? A defendant might want to appear in court for a variety of reasons, each of which need to be addressed by the Government.
<P>
The first reason is that it is the defendant's right to be present in the court to hear and see what is going on. That is rather nebulous and it might not be enshrined in statute, but it is a long-standing practice.
<P>
Secondly, it is often an occasion for some social contact between the defendant and his family, who might have come to the public gallery to watch the proceedings. In bail cases, which are pre-trial issues, it is important that the defendant is present so that he can discuss matters not only with his counsel, but with members of his family or with his friends, who might stand surety for him. The Government will recognise that those reasons are important.
<P>
The force of my argument is that the defendant should be absent if he wishes. However, if he fails to gives his consent to be absent, he should be allowed to be present for the reasons that I have given.
<P>
The presence of the defendant can also help to develop, or strengthen, the important relationship between solicitor or counsel and client. It is unfortunate if that relationship takes place entirely at a distance, without any personal contact in the court surroundings. From the court's point of view, the presence of the defendant adds a personal touch that can sometimes help the court in its deliberations.
<P>
There are pre-trial occasions when a defendant should be present to examine documents. He is able to discuss exhibits or bundles of documents in the advocates' room with his solicitor. Equally, he is able to talk privately with his lawyers to give instructions.
<P>
There is some talk about the establishment of private television links between the prisoner and his counsel, but is there any assurance that such a link will not be taped or recorded? That is an important issue. Such private exchanges between a lawyer and his client involve a huge duty of confidentiality. Is it technically possible that those exchanges could be recorded? It is no good for Ministers to say that they never will be--tell that to the prisoner. He or she might want to talk in utter confidence, and that means face-to-face conversation. I am sure that hon. Members would think twice about being utterly frank if they were having such a private conversation over a television link. There would always be a question at the back of one's mind about how private that conversation could be. [Hon. Members: ``hear, hear.''] Those are proper concerns and I think that, to a certain extent, the Government would support what I have said.
<P>
The Minister is likely to say, ``Yes, those are important points. Prisoners must have the opportunity to deal with their counsel, their relations and so on.'' If the Government support me, is it incumbent on them to accept the spirit of the amendments and to ensure that no defendant will be dealt with via a television link without his consent. If the defendant gives his consent, that is not a problem. What happens if he refuses? I believe that the defendant, not the court, should have the final say because the court may be restricted by other factors, such as time and administrative constraints, which can often go against the interests of justice.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To conclude my remarks on the amendments, I apologise to the Minister because I do not know the definition of ``the start of the trial''. We are discussing what can happen ``before the start of the trial'' and, therefore, it is important for us all to know what that means. I jump to the Crown court for that purpose because I assume that the long-term aim is to have a pilot scheme in a Crown court, perhaps even in several Crown courts.
<P>
People in the Crown court sometimes get a little uncertain about the meaning of the phrase ``the start of the trial''. There are certain procedural steps in the Crown court. One of the key steps occurs when the arraignment of the prisoner has taken place. Another key step has caused questions to arise in the minds of those in the judiciary and at the Bar; it is that of empanelling or swearing in the jury, which is the moment when the defendant is put in the hands of the jury. Until that moment, the defendant is not in the hands of the jury.
<P>
As the Minster will know, the current arrangement is that plea and directions hearings take place at the Crown court. Often, 20 or 30 cases are listed for a particular morning. Defendants are probably arraigned by then, so what I ask next may be irrelevant. However, I feel slightly uneasy if there is a prospect, albeit slight, of defendants not attending their plea and directions hearings. They are normally bailed from the magistrates court to the first plea and directions hearing at the Crown court. The key issue is that, being present at the plea and directions hearing is sometimes the first available opportunity to get in one's guilty plea. It is enshrined in statute that there is credit to be given for an early plea. Counsels say, ``My client's pleading guilty'' at the first available opportunity at the plea and directions hearing. Judges are duty bound to take that into account.
<P>
I can see a difficulty if such a scenario arises. I do not fancy the idea of a guilty plea being entertained on the television link. I query with the Government whether such an outcome is possible on a plea and directions hearing. Has the arraignment taken place? Can an arraignment actually take place? Can the defendant be arraigned in his absence? They are key questions, and those issues will need to be studied
<P>
If a trial means the empanelling of the jury, we move onto another difficult area. It is not infrequently the case in the Crown court that there are preliminary trials before the trial takes place, which are not held in the presence of the jury. I refer to that regular system described as a voir dire. A voir dire is normally a trial within a trial and, quite often, evidence is called. It usually relates to the admissibility of evidence. If evidence is ruled inadmissible, it does not go in at trial. If it is ruled admissible, it does.
<P>
For example, there may be a dispute about whether an indentification parade fell within the correct guidelines or whether an interview should have been allowed as evidence. Let me explain what often happens in the case of these voir dire. The defendant is in court; he has been arraigned, and no jury is empanelled. I stand to be corrected but in my experience, if a jury is not empanelled there will be argument--leading to a trial within a trial at the Crown court on the voir dire. Some of my colleagues may have experience of them taking three, four, five, or six days. If that takes place before the start of a trial, it is even more important for the defendant to be present. Normally voir dires cannot take place with the defendant being present.
<P>
I have outlined some concerns. I return to my first words which were that the principle is quite attractive. There can be no doubt about how useful and sensible television links will be at certain times. We all agree about that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I have been following my hon. Friend's argument and I accept his concerns both about whether people can be properly arraigned in their absence even if those in the court can see the defendant on a television link and about voir dire.
<P>
I had thought that there was a recent reference to the use of television cameras, which is why I was looking at the current week's edition of The Lawyer. Unfortunately, I could find no reference to it, only to the Minister attacking solicitors on a different matter. There is a rather flattering picture of the Minister in this edition--I do not know whether he has seen it. Does my hon. Friend for Woking agree that the courts will want to consider the issues of voir dire and arraignment--regardless of the deliberations of our proceedings--and decide whether they can properly be advanced even if the Government's proposals get through?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There is bound to be concern among those who run the courts. We are not talking only about the judiciary--judges, stipendiaries and the lay magistracy--but about clerks and other administrators.
<P>
In summary, there is some sense in the proposals but some of us on both sides of the Committee are worried, like my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, about the chipping away of the defendant's rights. We should never move too far from personal justice. Moving too far down the road of televised links, computers and electronic wizardry can undermine personal justice. One of the great merits of the British system over the years has been the personal aspect of our court system--the cast who play out their parts.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): The opening speakers for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats said how much they were looking forward in excited anticipation to the debate. They are easily excitable.
<P>
I welcome the broad support--at least for the concept of television links and their attendant benefits--of hon. Members who have spoken. Many legitimate issues have been raised and I hope to deal with some, if not all, of them. I shall deal first with the amendments before I come on to the points made by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins).
<P>
Amendments Nos. 194 and 422 would remove from the court its full discretion to decide whether, after hearing from the parties, a live television link should be used in a particular case. Amendment No. 194 would prevent preliminary hearings taking place via the link unless parties to the proceedings gave their consent, although that consent could not be unreasonably witheld. Under amendment No. 422, the decision whether to use a live television link could not be taken unless the accused gave express consent.
<P>
The clause allows for both defence and prosecution to make representations, but leaves the decision whether to grant a hearing using a live television link to the full discretion of the court after it has heard from the parties. The current provisions in the Bill give the court the discretion to require the production of a defendant, and both the prosecution and defence may make representations to the court of they feel that they have appropriate reasons. The court will then take a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): What would be the appropriate reasons?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall come to the type of reasons that may be provided.
<P>
The Government believe that our approach strikes the correct balance and that the court is best placed to make the decision. We do not believe that defendants will be prejudiced by use of this technology or, therefore, that a defendant should be able to veto a decison made by the court.
<P>
Amendment No. 196 would require those setting up the televison link to seek the prior approval of each bench chairmanship committee to the arrangements and to the use of the technology in its area and formally to consult the local Law Society. It is our intention that all court users, including magistrates and local solicitors, will be involved in consultations before the introduction of live television links in any court area. The court will decide whether, in any particular case, the link will be used, but we do not accept that any one group should have a veto over whether the facility will be available. I am sure that members of the Committee do not want to create such a veto.
<P>
The practical arrangements associated with introducing television links into magistrates courts will be tested in the pilots that we propose to undertake. They will be tailored to other courts if the evaluation of the pilots leads to national roll-out.
<P>
Subsection (5) spells out the standards that must be met so that the accused is able to communicate properly with the court. We believe that those standards will ensure that a fair hearing can be conducted.
<P>
The clause introduces the principle of television links for pre-trial hearings, but the court retains discretion over whether to use the link in a particular case once the approved facilities exist.
<P>
Amendment No. 195 which refers to line 43 not line 35, is consequential. It will be unnecessary without the addition of new requirements under subsection (2).
<P>
Amendment No. 242 would remove the requirement for magistrates to give their reasons for not using a television link in cases where they have the power to do so. The practice of courts giving reasons for decisions is growing and those who have practised in the courts, hon. Members and the public will think it is good for courts to explain their actions. In addition, we want to ensure that, where the technology is available, courts are encouraged to use it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked me what circumstances might justify a defendant saying that he did not want to use a television link. Let me consider some possible reasons--some justifiable and others not--that may lead a defendant to take that view.
<P>
Let us first consider possible good reasons. The defendant might be nervous, have a psychiatric history and some concern or fear about the use of technology. That could, we hope, be overcome through managing the video suite in the prison in a way that was not too confrontational. The pilot scheme might allow that approach to be explored.
<P>
It might well be possible and appropriate for a person with a particular background and nervous disposition--perhaps with evidence of that background--to suggest to the court that it would not be suitable to use the television link. It would then be a matter for the court to decide whether the requirements were fulfilled in that case.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have already discussed access to legal advice. Where genuine obstacles arose--such as, perhaps, the non-availability of a secure telephone line--it might be better for the defendant to be produced. Also the need for an interpreter in court might be a good reason for the court to exericse its discretion not to use the television link, unless, perhaps, the interpreter could be with the defendant in prison, and the relevant facilities would permit the interpretation to be done in a way that satisfied the interests of justice.
<P>
If any issues such as I have mentioned caused concern, representations could be made to the court. I return to the issue that the hon. Member for Hertsmere and I discussed about the need, to some extent, to trust the good judgment of the court. I am sure that his experience, like mine, is that courts do not try to put a defendant in a position where his interests will be damaged, through inadequate communication with lawyers or anyone else.
<P>
I am sure that hon. Members who have practised in the courts have often come across some of the reasons that we should not find sufficient or acceptable to justify refusal to use a television link. I am sure they will know of defendants who wanted to be produced because it would be a day out from prison. Those defendants would therefore opt to be produced in court each week at great public expense, for no more than a day out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> They are not criminals.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that they are not criminals, but they are lawfully detained. I do not think that he or I would advocate that they should be in a position to cause the taxpayer--who is already heavily burdened after the past 18 years--to pay for a day out for someone on remand.
<P>
Another reason that defendants often give for wanting to be produced is that they want to see their families, members of the public or their girlfriends in the public gallery. They just want a few seconds when they can see them. In my view they should see them on visits to prison, rather than getting the taxpayer to fund a trip to the court merely for that purpose.
<P>
A day away from the routine of prison is not a justifiable reason for refusing a television link. Nor--I am not being flippant--is looking for an opportunity to abscond. All too often, as I have pointed out in previous debates, people manage to abscond from custody. Transporting people and holding them in cells provides opportunities for that. I have known people escape from magistrates' court cells. It is not our business to provide such opportunites.
<P>
We want to ensure that, when it is necessary and appropriate, defendants will be in court. However, the court is the best judge of that need.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> On the point of absconding, is the Minister saying that the Crown, making representations, will argue, ``We are a bit worried about this defendant, your Worships''.--a wink at this point--``Our suggestion is that he is a bit of a rough character. You had better have him locked up in prison and we will not have him in court.'' Will that be the sort of factor that the bench will take into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon Gentleman read amendment No. 422, tabled by Liberal Democrat Members. That amendment proposes that no reason should be given by the defendant for his refusal to give consent. The circumstances that he has described might arise under the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
High security cases are not excluded by the clause and it is right that in such cases we should give the courts full discretion to say ``no'. There might be many appropriate reasons why people in high security cases might decide that they wish to withdraw consent. They might even be able to come up with all sorts of explanations that appear not to be unreasonable.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine):</B> On the matter of escapes, the Government still seem to be arguing that there is a point at which a prisoner has a right to be in court. I would have thought that it was incumbent on the Government to provide courts that can contain prisoners. Although a prisoner might choose to escape pre-trial, when the trial is under way and it seems to be going the wrong way, the incentive to escape is even greater. At that point, the Minister seems to accept that the defendant should be present.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I well remember a case at the Horseferry Road magistrates court in which a defendant went through a couple of doors and managed to jump from a second-floor window. It was pure luck that that defendant was promptly arrested and brought back to the court by officers who happened to be walking by. I remember the incident well, especially as it was my client. People can disappear from magistrates courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> He probably heard your mitigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Under-Secretary will remember that in my opening remarks I tries to strike a balance between fairness to the defendent and security. I am disappointed by his comments. Is the Committee to understand that what he has said is the final word? Will the Government consider drafting an amendment that takes into account both security and the reasons why a defendant might insist upon the right to appear before the court in person? Will the Under-Secretary try to find a better balance even than that which is provided by the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The government are clear on the matter. We do not propose to draft further amendments. The appropriate way to deal with the matter is to leave it to the discretion of the courts.
<P>
I shoud add that in the case that I cited earlier of the gentleman who has escaped, I asked him why he has made a run for it. He replied, ``I gave my brother's name and I didn't realise that he had already been given a suspended sentence.''
<P>
Let me turn to some of the other issues raised. The hon. Member for Hertsmere was worried that the provisions of subsection (3) would constrain magistrates. Magistrates will not be constrained by the requirement to give good reason for their decisions. I am sure that hon. Members agree that magistrates should give such reasons.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking raised the issue of voir dire. It is expected that a defendant will be produced for a voir dire case. He also asked when the trials would start. Trials will start at the swearing in of the jury, or the entering of a plea of guilty, if that is earlier; or at the beginning of the prosecution evidence in a summary trial, in a magistrates court, or a plea of guilty if that is earlier.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking also asked about situations in which the defendant might wish to talk to people who would offer potential securities sureties. If a defendant was in the cells, he or she would be unlikely to be able to do that in any event. In those circumstances, the lawyer would normally act as the intermediary and would continue to be able to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking said that the presence of a defendant at a preliminary hearing might add a personal touch. I am not sure exactly what he means and what it would secure: I hear what he says but I am not persuaded by it. He also said that it might be useful to consider documents, which may well be the case. I have not had enough experience to know whether that would normally be necessary at preliminary hearings but if it were necessary, either a television link or a fax machine could be used. These days we have the technology. All sorts of facilities are available, and I can tell the hon. Member for Woking that if it is necessary to produce the defendant, the court will have the discretion to do so.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then moved on to the issue of telephone recordings. I am reluctant to follow that route for fear of paranoia taking hold. The cells and even the retiring room could be recorded. We are trying to provide facilities for lawyers and defendants which meet the interests of justice. I do not envisage having to make all those sorts of recordings--it is nonsense. I am sure that the lawyer representing a defendant would be able to provide the necessary assurances. How many defendants speak to their lawyers in custody or in prison rooms? I do not know of any serious allegations. We should be wary of spinning tales that might lead people to believe that we are taking actions that we simply are not taking.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister mentioned the telephone link between the lawyer and the client. Is it intended that video pictures pass between the lawyer and the client or is the confidential connection between them the spoken word with no visual aspects?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We shall examine that in the pilot schemes. At present we anticipate that the connection will be by way of an ordinary secure telephone. In most circumstances, the pilots will not involve televised links between the defendant and the lawyer in the court. However, I have had some experience of visual conferencing between people based in different parts of the country and it is not beyond possibility--I make no promise for the initial pilots--that in due course we could consider direct telecommunications links. If the clause were accepted by the Committee, we would have the facility to use visual links but it is not our current intention to utilise it on any scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response. I came to the subject of television links with a genuinely open mind, supportive in principle of what the Government were trying to achieve, concerned to enhance security and to prevent delay. I was satisfied with the Minister's response to the first group of amendments. However, at the back of my mind, I was worried that the measures were being streamrollered through and that we were producing a legal sausage machine in which the rights and feelings of the accused were not given proper consideration. I have to say that that feeling has grown during the course of the Minister's reply and that I am now rather unhappy with the Government's proposals.
<P>
I would have been happier if the Minister had been prepared to reflect on the viewd expressed throughout the Committee. We heard no views in support of the steamroller approach emanating from Labour Members behind the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have heard the hon. Gentleman in several debates suggest that the Bill is being steamrollered through. I have also noted that, in many of the debates in which he has used that phrase, Opposition Members have ended up supporting the Government or, at least, not voting against us. The hon. Gentleman needs to exercise caution in some of the words that he uses.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr Clappison:</B> The Minister is tempting me to have a vote just for the sake of it; I was coming round to that view anyway. Those who study the records of the proceedings in Hansard will notice that the expression ``steamroller'' has been used in recent sittings only. We came to the Committee with an open mind, yet, apart from one exception, the Government are not listening to our comments and are not studying them further. That is alien to my past experience of Committees.
<P>
We are in the early days of television links and I should have thought that the Minister would be prepared to listen to and think about constructive comments. If the Minister agreed to improve the amendment, particularly in reference to security--for example, making security considerations an overriding consideration in such issues--I would be happy. Security should be an overriding consideration.
<P>
The Minister seems to take no account of the feelings and concerns of the defendant. Having listened to the Minister's response, I am worried. Let us be clear about what the Minister is saying and what the clause establishes. The Minister talked about giving discretion to the court. However, all that the court has to do is to listen to representations from the parties. Then, under subsection (3), the court gets a big nudge in favour of not allowing the defendant to attend in person.
<P>
In a case where the court has the power to order television links and gives the direction for not doing so, it must give its reasons in open court. That is the legislative way of giving magistrates courts a big nudge. We should not let the Minister pretend that he is giving full discretion to magistrates courts.
<P>
In rejecting our amendment, which enables the defendant to refuse consent to a television link with reasonable cause, the Minister is saying that even when a defendant has reasonable grounds for refusing consent and for wanting to appear in court in person, the defendant's wishes can be overridden, with no account given. That is unacceptable. I am prepared to be open minded but, at the moment, I am disappointed with the Minister's response and I am minded to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I share the disappointment of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. The Government have responded positively to many of our debates, which has indicated to us that they are moving in our direction. With guidance, they seem to respond to our suggestions. However, after hearing the Minister's comments on this issue, it is clear that the Government are going in the opposite direction. The Minister made it clear that the assumption would be that a television link would be used in all circumstances, unless one could demonstrate something unusual about the case, such as technophobia, that prevented an individual from using the link.
<P>
The Government's assumption and attitude is in favour of television links in nearly all circumstances. That is particularly disappointing in view of the fact that the Government said that it would be a pilot scheme. I certainly hope that either the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat amendment will be pressed to a vote. Through the pilot phase, we should take great care adjusting the balance between the defendants and those in the criminal justice system who seek to try them. As has been said earlier, individuals on remand are still innocent in the eyes of the court at that stage, until such time as they have been through the full court process. That important distinction should be maintained. Defendants' rights are built on the premise of innocence. To require defendants to do something that might be against their interests is an important and significant step, which should not be taken lightly.
<P>
We are disappointed that the Minister's response was not more postitive. He indicated that there was a wide range of reasonable grounds, but seemed narrowly focused on the fact that the burden would be on the defendant to prove why he should not use the television link, rather than the courts judging the balance of interests of the defendant against those of the court. For that reason, we hope that there will be a Division on this issue.

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The problem with both Ministers is that because they are such decent and nice men, it is difficult for me to show the anger I feel. Whenever they respond to a debate, they do so with charm and it takes the wind out of my sails. The fact is that I should not be at all happy, and I do not think I am. I was going to say that I am angry, but I tone it down. I urge the Minister to think carefully about the issue.
<P>
There are a couple of points with which the Minister did not deal fully. He said that, in the Crown courts, the trial begins with the swearing in of the jury.
<P>
<H5>5.35 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.50 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> As I was saying before we broke off, I am disappointed with the Minister's answers. I hope that he will consider the matter further. In general, the courts are coming under increasing financial and other pressures from the Executive. Any weakening of a defendant's rights is a poor state of affairs. Those rights would be reinforced by the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
The Minister has not contradicted satisfactorily my contention that there are many good reasons for defendants to be present in court. It is vital that they may only be absented, so to speak, with their consent.
<P>
The Minister did not deal at all with one of my questions, and only unsatisfactorily with another. My first question had to do with Crown court trials. The Minister said that a trial begins with the empanelling of the jury. From that it follows, as night follows day, that a plea and directions hearing is held before a trial. As courts may be encouraged to have television links because of the administrative difficulties involved in getting defendants to court, it follows also that a defendant may be absent from such a hearing.
<P>
What happens if a defendant wants to be present to enter a plea? Can the defendant be overruled by the Court? Can a plea be entered at a plea and directions hearing over the television link? That is a vital question. If the answer is no, the defendant may lose the opportunity to plead guilty at the first opportunity. Furthermore, the judge would not want to pass sentence without the defendant being present in court. Sometimes defendants want to be present on the day, so that they can take the first chance to plead guilty and get sentenced.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's experience, but I thought that I heard the Minister say that a trial also started if a defendant pleaded guilty. That seems to be a chicken and egg problem, so perhaps defendants should be allowed to say whether they want to plead guilty during the pre-trial process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Yes, that point needs to be covered, as does the Minister's remark that the voir dire is part of that pre-trial process. I think that I quote him correctly in noting that he expected the defendant to be present.
<P>
We must go further than that and say that a defendant must be present for a voir dire. I cannot conceive of a defendant being absent from such a hearing. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell me of any instance in which a defendant's presence would not be needed.
<P>
So much of what happens between defendants and those in court--family, friends, potential sureties or advocates--can best be done face to face. Sometimes, what has to happen cannot be accomplished properly in any other way. No talk from the Minister can alter that, so it might be right that the pilot schemes for television links include the protection of defendants that they shall not be absented other than with their consent. Anything else would be contrary to natural justice.
<P>
If Labour Members were to take an interest in this argument--many of them are not doing so--they would see its force. It has to be right. All that I can say to the Ministers is good luck with the project scheme and good luck with the television links--but they cannot say that they will take anything away from the force of the Opposition's arguments.
<P>
My hon. Friends will correct me if I am wrong, but I am not sure whether any of our amendments have been accepted by the Government. It cannot be that all of our amendments are of poor quality; there must be some good ones, even in the Government's eyes. This amendment is a good one, and I ask the Minister to take it away, to give it thought and to recognise the rights of the defendant. If he would be reasonable, it would not be necessary to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
I commented on the Minister's charm and good-natured replies. It is difficult for me to express anger because of the nature of both Ministers. I feel that I have expressed it with my disappointment. I hope that that sensitive appeal has found favour. The Ministers know that a hectoring appeal would not be in my style.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not know whether you, Mr. O'Hara, have read the book ``1984'', by George Orwell. If the hero of the book, Winston, does anything wrong, he is accosted by a huge video screen in his quarters telling him so. I would not accuse the two delightful, charming Ministers of being anything like Big Brother in ``1984'', but the debate reminded me of that book.
<P>
Defendants have a right to be present at any hearing at which their liberty is ultimately at stake. That is a fundamental tenet of natural justice. Let us get real about the debate. It is not about dangerous criminals absconding or all the rest of it; it is about saving money. I should be interested to know the percentage of criminals who abscond while in transit to court or in court. I suspect that it is small. The debate is about saving money and about lowering the bills of Group 4, which has to bring such tiresome people to court.
<P>
The Minister's tone in describing such people was extraordinary. As far as he was concerned, they already appeared to be in many ways a burden to society. They are innocent; they have not yet been found guilty. It is the taxpayers who are paying for them to be locked up.
<P>
It was argued that the matter can safely be left to the court's discretion. In the overwhelming majority of cases, bail is granted in any event. Nowadays, it is denied only in a tiny proportion of cases. The Bill will add to the enormous pressure to grant bail that exists in virtually every case. Defendants who are not on bail and who are held in custody are either charged with very serious offences or have a history of committing offences while on bail. It will be virtually impossible for defendants to give a good reason to a court as to why they should be treated differently and allowed to turn up at their own pre-trial review; it will not happen. Within a few year the defendant will not be allowed to be present at pre-trial reviews in virtually every case. That will apply to all matters prior to the Crown court trial. The defendant will not be there and will not be allowed to be there. The Government will thereby save a considerable amount, but that will not be in the interests of natural justice or of good justice. Nothing that the Minister has said today would convince any serious objective observer of that.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As with so many proposals that sweep away traditional ways of doing things, the clause will not save money in the long term, for the reasons that I gave at the end of this morning's sitting. When somebody's liberty is at stake, there are constant to-ings and fro-ings between the lawyer and his client. The court's time will presumably now be wasted in an argument about why the defendant is present. Neither lawyers nor clients like the idea of being separated in pre-trial reviews; they want to be able to consult regularly.
<P>
The Minister dismissed such concerns and said, ``Some defendants are just irritating scabs on the side of society who want a day out. Why should we listen to them? They want a day out in court and a way to see their girl friend in the gallery.'' They might well want a day out, but that is no reason to deny them the right to consult their lawyers as the pre-trial reviews proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> This has just occurred to me, but does my hon. Friend think that the events described in the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a court may, after hearing representations from the parties, direct that the accused shall be treated as being present''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
can happen at one moment? How are the representations made? Is the advocate present in court making representations while the defendant is in prison? What happens if the advocate's representations are successful? What will that mean in terms of delay and time wasting? Will the prisoner be brought to court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend must address those questions to the Minister. All that I shall say is that a statute that states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the accused shall be treated as being present in the court''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
even though he is not, should worry anybody who is concerned about natural justice and traditional civil liberties.
<P>
The Minister has not managed to reply to any of our points. One of the examples that he gave concerned standing sureties. He said, ``The prisoner who is sitting in the cell does not arrange his sureties. It is much easier for him to be kept in prison, while the lawyer does it.'' In my experience, things move quickly and the bench can suddenly be minded not to grant bail. Nowadays, it is a question of picking up a mobile phone and talking to acquaintances to rustle up a surety so that the defendant can be let out. That will not be easy if he is sitting 100 or 50 miles away at the end of a telephone line.
<P>
Earlier, I jokingly referred to Big Brother, but we are not talking about sophisticated video screens or the kind of video conferencing that the Minister no doubt enjoys in his palatial quarters in Queen Anne's gate. His kowtowing officials will take him to some fantastic room where every bit of technology is available to him. The technology that we are talking about will not be like that. We are talking about an incredibly basic system--if it were not, it would be hugely expensive.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): Has my hon. Friend ever met people in the flesh who he had previously seen only on television? If so, has he sometimes been surprised by what they were really like? Is not it likely that a court would not be able to get a proper impression of the accused from television or video? People are quite different in person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a very serious point. I was going to say facetiously, when I first arrived in Committee, that I hoped to get to know some of the Labour Members in the flesh. As they have said so little, however, that is proving extremely difficult. I am still waiting to hear something from the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg). I expected great speeches and learned interventions from the great victor of Enfield, Southgate--the man who toppled Michael Portillo. I am still waiting expectantly for the great man to appear.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) has made a vital point. It has always been a fundamental tenet of natural justice that the accused has the right to face his or her accusers. Those who are to deal with an accused person--to continue to deny them their liberty or to make judgments that may have a fundamental bearing on the future course of his or her life--should likewise be able to sum up the accused in person.
<P>
Even the sophisticated video links that the Minister enjoys in Queen Anne's gate provide only a jerky picture. How could one possibly sum up from that? In any case, that will not be the type of system that will be used; it will be some intercom system relayed down to a cell in the Scrubs. The chap will be sitting there listening and trying to work out what is happening. He will not be able to work out where the sound is coming from or who is speaking. This measure is all about saving money, and I doubt whether Labour Members are really happy about that; in any event, they should not be. To dismiss as claptrap the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking about the security of video links is to misunderstand the depth of people's concern about the issue. People want to be able to talk quietly and seriously to their legal representatives with no chance of being overhead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman share my sense of disappointment at the Minister's response? He talked about security, but not about the bigger issue--that of the confidence that an individual feels about whether a conversation is going to be intercepted. We should ask ourselves, as ordinary human beings, if we should feel confident in that situation. I think that the answer has to be no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No, I do not think that one would feel confident.
<P>
It is extraordinary that when I asked the Minister about the reasons that a defendant could give as to why he should be present in court, all that the Minister could come up with was that he might be of a nervous, technophobic disposition. It is a ridiculous idea that a lawyer would stand up and claim that Jack Higgins, who faces 15 charges of burglary, is of a nervous disposition. That would be laughed out of court. I thought that the Minister might give some serious reasons, such as the complexity or seriousness of the trial, or the likelihood that at the final hearing the defendant might receive a long custodial sentence, and that it was therefore vital that he should be heard in his pre-trial reviews.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Woking knows, because he sits in the Crown court, the previous Government and this Government have loaded increasing quantities of work onto pre-trial reviews. When I first started at the Bar, there was virtually no preparation before a trial. Sometimes, if the solicitor was not very efficient, one walked in with a brief with nothing inside it. Since then, the Government have piled pressure on the legal profession to get its tackle in order. The Minister of State is saying, ``Hear, hear.'' I agree with him--that pre-trial procedure is intended to save time and to ensure that people cannot drag out trials.
<P>
Everything that happens before the trial is of the utmost importance. Nowadays, it is very difficult for lawyers to change their defence once the trial has begun; it must all be settled beforehand. Under the Bill, the defendant may not be present after that has happened. That is deserving of serious re-examination. The defendant should have the right to attend the court to face his accusers, and the onus should be on the court to deny him that right. In certain cases--for example, those involving IRA suspects--there may be an overriding security reason as to why the suspect should not be brought to court. However, those cases are so few in number that it is clear that that is not the real reason for the clause's inclusion in the Bill. It has resulted from pressure from the Treasury, and surely it cannot be right that the Treasury should have its way in the administration of criminal justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I earlier chided the hon. Member for Woking about paranoia, but he has now been surpassed by the hon. Member for Gainsborough who talks about 1984 and Big Brother. His defence of the rights of the defendant makes me wonder whether he is really the hon. Member for Gainsborough: surely he should represent the Howard League, not the Michael Howard league. Soft as an old blancmange--that is the impression that he wants to create in this Committee. That seems to be his approach to crime and it worries me greatly. It is not what we expect from the hon. Gentleman. Where is the hardliner, the Tory right winger, whom we had all grown to know? If we did not love him, at least we respected him. Now he gives us stories such as we have just heard.
<P>
Far more convincing was the hon. Member for Woking, who said that I was nice. How can I resist that? Compliments will get the hon. Gentleman anywhere, and I shall certainly consider the matters that he raised. He normally is reasonable: I feared this morning, when the debate ventured into European territory, that he might be becoming more tabloid than broadsheet, but he seems to be back on broadsheet form.
<P>
I think that we have got the balance right in the Bill in terms of the full discretion to be given to the courts. Although I shall consider what the hon. Member for Woking said, I give no absolutely no undertaking. We have always regarded Britain's courts as the safeguards of our liberties and rights. Like other hon. Members, I have some years' experience of criminal court practice, and I believe that, in the circumstance that we have been discussing, it is correct to leave the courts to make the decision. That will not lead to the great damage or to the big brother, 1984 atmosphere feared by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. Similarly, I fear that the problems so nicely described by the hon. Member for Woking will not come to pass.
<P>
I shall deal with some of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Woking. He asked me to clarify whether I expected defendants to be present for a full voir dire, where evidence is being taken and so on. The answer is yes, I would expect defendants to be present, as the court usually would have some notice of such a proceeding and witnesses would be called.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked also whether defendants could make a plea via video link. Again, the answer is yes they could, if they chose to. However, defendants may choose not to make a plea in that way, in which case the court would have to hear representations on the matter.
<P>
The Bill creates circumstances in which we can deal with the normal cases that increasingly will use television links. Also, in response to the Learmont report, we can begin to deal with high-security issues and other matters, in which there is real anxiety that people have sought to come before the court for reasons that are not very good. We hope that the Bill will enable the court to supervise the reasonableness of defendants' demands to be produced.
<P>
I think that the Bill gets the balance right. I shall consider what has been said, but I give no undertakings to bring forward any propsals. However, the Government are always willing to listen to reasonable points made by Opposition Members. It is the party political badinage that is a waste of time and not worth worrying about. I accept that the hon. Member for Woking has made some good points on occasions, and we have listened to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In that spirit, will the Minister agree to write to members of the Committee when he has had time to reflect on the debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am giving no undertakings. I always reflect on the points raised in Committee. That is what the public expect of me, and I always do my duty to them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked, in an unusually charming way, about statistics on escapes. During 1997 there were 78 escapes by escorted prisoners while in transit between courts and prisons or from court buildings.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the number of escapes of prisoners in transit has dropped substantially since private-sector companies became involved?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that the privatisation of the Prison Service is relevant to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I hesitate to raise this on a point of order, but I intervened because the Minister this morning made what I regarded as a wholly gratuitous reference to the fact that Securicor had delivered some prisoners to the wrong court.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chair was in Paris this morning. I can judge only what I am hearing in Committee now. What matters is the statistics and the reasons for them, good or otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Surrey Heath alleges that I made that claim, but I was not present in the Committee then, either. I did not say that. I do not know where he got it from--perhaps some other hon. Gentleman made such a comment.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The question is relevant to the clause. What percentage of the 78 escapees were in transit for pre-trial hearings as opposed to going to the courts for full-time trials, which would not be affected by the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman finds me unsighted on the detail of these statistics. I shall see whether it is possible--providing that it is not at disproportionate public expense--to obtain the information that he requires.
<P>
The key issue is that there have been a considerable number of escapes. As I said earlier, of the 11 escapes from court or escort by young offenders in the year to March 1998, nine were from the magistrates court. Even if only a limited percentage of those escapes were by remand prisoners, surely we should try to reduce the overall number.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's comments. At one point I began to draw a little reassurance from what he was saying, but then he snatched it away by saying that he was not even prepared to write to the hon. Members. I cannot draw the reassurance that would be necessary to prevent us pressing the amendment to a vote from a token promise that the Minister will think about these matters without his being prepared to write to us.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) whether by means of a live television link or otherwise, he is able to see and hear the court and to be seen and heard by it.'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but an accused is not able to communicate with a court by means of a live television link if he is not able to communicate in private with his legal representative by the same means at or about the time of the particular hearing.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) asked whether the term ``live television link'' in clause 54 also covered internet links. We agreed to investigate that, and it transpires that it does not. We have concluded that an amendment to clarify the scope of the clause is necessary, and I should like to thank my right hon. Friend for highlighting the issue.
<P>
Visual internet links are already possible, and other technologies might also be developed, which would not be sufficiently clearly covered by the term ``live television links''. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that future technological developments of live audio and visual links are within the scope of the clause. The crucial test for the use of any such new technology will be that the defendant can see and hear the court and be seen and heard by it.
<P>
On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Do hon. Members have to move amendment No. 243 before I can speak to it or can I do so now?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> One amendment is called and the others are debated with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The effect of amendment No. 243 would be to require additionally that the defendant was able to communicate in private with his legal representative by a live television link during the hearing.
<P>
We recognise that issues might arise during the hearing that require confidential discussion, and that advocates might also wish to use preliminary hearings for further discussions with their clients. We have already said, during the passage of the Bill through the House of Lords and, indeed, in Committee, that the pilot projects will examine ways to allow such discussions to take place. One possible solution would be to provide a confidential telephone line. For open questions, during the hearing itself, the advocate will, of course, be able to use the television link along with any other parties to the proceedings. That will obviously be less confidential, and we might have to consider ways in which the defendant and his advocate could have confidential conversations or pass information during the proceedings if the court decided that that was in the interests of justice.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now move on to the important subject of extended sentences--sentences that are extended for licence purposes. We have two concerns about the clause and the important issue of the supervision of sex offenders. The amendments are designed to reflect those concerns.
<P>
Anyone who has been listening to our proceedings will be in no doubt as to the importance of the supervision of sex offenders. The amendments reflect section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, which provided for longer periods of supervision for sex offenders than for other offenders. That provision has not been implemented. It would have been possible for the Government to implement it and sex offenders would have received longer periods of supervision as a result. However, for their own reasons, the Government chose not to do that.
<P>
We have been concerned about the issue for some time. We asked the Government in October last year why they had not implemented section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. The main reason given was that the Government thought that section 20 was too complicated. I received a written parliamentary answer to that effect on 28 October.
<P>
Against the background of the contention that section 20 was too complicated, the simplicity of clause 55 is not invincibly self-evident. The Committee will have noticed that clause 55(2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court may pass on the offender an extended sentence, that is to say, a custodial sentence the term of which is equal to the aggregate of--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the term of the custodial sentence that the court would have imposed if it had passed a custodial sentence otherwise than under this section (`the custodial term'); and
<P>
(b) a further period (`the extension period') for which the offender is to be subject to a licence and which is of such length as the court considers necessary for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1) above.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Government think that the provisions are invincibly and self-evidently simple.
<P>
The amendments deal with the question of who is to be made subject to those provisions. We submit that in the case of sex offenders the criteria in clause 55 are significantly weaker than the corresponding criteria in section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, which is reflected in the amendments.
<P>
Clause 55 deals with sex offenders and violent offenders on the same footing. According to subsection (1), a sentence can be extended where the period for which the offender would be subject to licence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would not be adequate for the purpose of preventing the commission by him of further offences and securing his rehabilitation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 246, by contrast, requires an extended sentence to be imposed on a sex offender unless there are exceptional circumstances that would justify not imposing such a sentence. Those are much tighter and stonger criteria than those in the Bill. They reflect our belief that the need for supervision of sex offenders is much stronger than in the case of other offenders, including violent offenders for whom the need for supervision is strong enough.
<P>
I remind the Committee that the strategy document issued by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Officers of Probation identified five key features of sex offending. Those features mark sex offending out as being particularly apt for supervision.
<P>
First, sex offending may begin at an early age. In contrast to other forms of adolescent offending, it is a form of behaviour that adolescents tend to grow into than rather out of. Secondly, sex offences are rarely one-off incidents. Thirdly, sex offending tends to become entrenched over time and patterns of escalating seriousness are not unusual. Fourthly, significant numbers of sex offenders may have suffered abuse themselves. Finally, the strategy document states that sex offenders are often heavily defensive and in denial. Justification of their behaviour and avoidance of responsibility are common features that contribute to a high risk of offending. We think that those distinctive features of sexual offending point to a need for greater supervision of sex offenders and for a longer period than may otherwise be the case. We believe that such a need justifies amendment No. 336, which requires a court to state its reasons for not imposing an extended sentence in open court.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Against such a background we shall be interested to discover the Government's reasons for introducing the weak criteria in clause 55, when they could have adopted the stronger criteria in section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. Better still, they could have implemented the Act itself.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> It will generally be accepted that we have argued strongly for extended supervision for sex offenders and that we are putting our beliefs into practice.
<P>
The background to the clause is the implementation of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. We take that Act very seriously and work closely with the police and probation service to ensure that its provisions are used to protect children and vulnerable adults. We do not want the Act to be information sitting on the file--a change in culture has dealt with that.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for sex offender orders, which will deal with another set of individuals who pose a threat to the public. We need to examine the clause and the amendments to it against that background.
<P>
Section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act must be read in conjunction with other sections of that Act, and it is not appreciably simpler than clause 55. It was not implemented because of legislation on honesty in sentencing. It would have added to prison numbers, and would have made it harder to bring those under supervision back into custody.
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 246 would be that the courts would be required to impose an extended sentence in every case in which a custodial sentence was proposed for sex offenders, unless there were exceptional reasons for not doing that. Extended sentences would therefore become the rule for sex offenders rather than the exception.
<P>
The amendment would make the Bill defective because it would remove the courts' justification for imposing extended sentences. A court cannot be required to extend a sentence when it has no reason to do so. If the court has no indication that a person whom it is convicting for a sexual offence needs a longer period of supervision than normal, it would have no justification for imposing an extended sentence and would have nothing by which to assess how long the extension period should be.
<P>
The Government intend that courts should have the power to impose extended sentences only in those cases in which the period of supervision that the offender would normally receive is not considered long enough to prevent him committing further offences and from securing his rehabilitation. The court will decide how long the period of extended supervision should be, based on its assessment of what is necessary for those specified purposes. However, if the court were to be required to pass an extended sentence for no reason other than the fact that the offender is a sex offender, it could not possibly decide how long the extension period should be.
<P>
A benchmark is needed to determine the length of an extended sentence. That benchmark is the period that is necessary to prevent re-offending and to secure rehabilitation. Amendment No. 246 would remove that benchmark in the case of sex offenders, leaving the courts with no criteria with which to determine what period of extended supervision would be appropriate.
<P>
The length of a custodial sentence is usually determined by what is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. That is an important principle and courts are required by section 2(2)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to abide by it. However, it is recognised that in the case of sexual and violent offenders it may be appropriate for the sentence to be longer than is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, if the court considers that necessary for the protection of the public. Section 2(2)(b) of the 1991 Act covers that point. The criterion is the risk or danger to the public. The point of the clause is to do what is necessary to prevent that risk becoming a dreadful reality. 
<P>
Amendment No. 246 proposes that a sentence should be passed on sex offenders that would be longer than was commensurate with the seriousness of the offence but where there was no identifiable reason for the sentence to be extended. That would contradict fundamental sentencing principles and would, therefore, be unacceptable.
<P>
Notwithstanding those fundamental objections, we should, in any case, avoid a provision that would result in offenders being supervised for long periods where it was unnecessary. If offenders are given extended sentences simply because the courts have no compelling reason not to impose them, some will undoubtedly end up being supervised for long periods to no useful purpose. One could think of examples concerning offences committed in specific circumstances that would be unlikely to be repeated. If there is a need for extended supervision, the courts will have the power to impose it. If not, they should not be compelled to do so.
<P>
The provisions will not restrict the courts' use of extended supervision. An extended sentence may be imposed on any sex offender given a custodial sentence where the court considers that the normal supervision period is not enough. There is no limit to the extent to which the courts can apply the provision. Every sex offender who requires extended supervision may be given it.
<P>
Amendment No. 336 would provide that if a sex offender was convicted for an offence to which the registration requirements in the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applied and the sentencing court decided not to impose an extended sentence, it would have to give reasons for not doing so in open court. There is no reason why those should be spelt out in open court, regardless of whether the provisions of the 1997 Act applied to the offender concerned. The fact that an offender is required to register his name and address with the police does not automatically mean that it would be appropriate to consider imposing an extended sentence. Only a small proportion of those required to register would merit extended supervision.
<P>
The term ``sex offender'' covers a multitude of offences of varying seriousness. Some are very serious and others are not serious. The risk for the future that they imply is much lower in some cases than others. The hon. Member for Hertsmere would be wise to refer to the Sex Offenders Act 1997. Our debates on that covered a wide range of cases. It was intended that the authorities would be able to take account of the seriousness of a case. The prevention of risk to children and vulnerable adults is a high priority. The range of offences covered was drawn widely so that discretion and judgment about risk could be exercised.
<P>
Registration is mandatory for all those who have been convicted of or cautioned for a relevant offence. It covers the range of sentencing, from a small fine to a life sentence. The courts have no discretion over whether registration is necessary, except that a conditional or absolute discharge does not require registration, by virtue of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973.
<P>
Amendment No. 336 would appear to force judges to state in open court why they considered that an extended sentence was not appropriate, even in cases where a non-custodial sentence was imposed. As it would be ludicrous to expect a court to consider imposing an extended sentence for a very minor offence warranting a non-custodial sentence, it should not be necessary to expect the judge to say so in court.
<P>
Where there is a requirement in legislation for a court to give reasons in open court for not imposing a particular sentence--for example in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997--it relates to sentences that are normally mandatory for the offence in question but where the court has exceptionally waived that requirement. It is a topic that was much debated during the passage of the Bill that became the 1997 Act. In those cases it will be the exception rather than the rule.
<P>
In the majority of cases, it will not be appropriate for the court to pass an extended sentence since, as I said, they will be the exception rather than the rule. I hope that that will persuade the hon. Gentleman that the clause satisfactorily meets the needs of justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. I know that the Minister seeks to treat all matters seriously but sadly we are seeing yet another example of the Government watering down the tough restrictions advocated by Conservative Members. The Minister will not find himself in a comfortable position when he seeks to defend--perhaps outside the House--the Government's less than stringent stance towards sex offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am tempted to accuse the hon. Gentleman of being flippant. If he looked again at the record he would find that it was Labour in opposition which pressed the previous Conservative Government to deal with these issues; and we are dealing with them very seriously in government. What the hon. Gentleman said is quite unsustainable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I hear what the Minister says but that is not my recollection of debates on what became the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. I recall having similar debates to those that we are now having in this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I invite the hon. Gentleman to look back at the record. If he did, he would find that on one or two occasions the Government accepted amendments that we moved on precisely this issue. They recognised the strength of our argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I have no doubt that there were one or two occasions--I remember them--when we were in government and felt that the Labour Opposition had some constructive suggestions that would tighten up the law still further. Yes, we were prepared to accept them. The difference now is that the Labour Government have to answer for their rejection of our amendments and for their decision to water down the tough laws on sex offenders that Conservative Members want to see.
<P>
The Minister has to answer for what he is doing now, which I believe is wrong. People who are concerned about the threat from sex offenders will not accept the Government's stance. I should like to make judges given reasons in open court when they decline to impose extended sentences on every occasion--even for what the Minister refers to as minor offences. The public have a right to know. Extended sentences should be the rule rather than the exception, and we are right to put forward our suggestions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would tell us whether he has read the Bill, which is no weaker in respect of extended sentences than the 1997 Act. The criteria are the same and the enforcement procedure is simpler. Why is the hon. Gentleman making these points, or is he merely playing to some gallery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not have a gallery to play to. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere does not agree with the Minister and neither do I. I am referring specifically to the Minister's earlier response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. He said, as Hansard will show, that judges should not have to state reasons in open court for failing to apply an extended sentence in every case. That is what he said and I believe that he is wrong. People who are worried about sex offenders want judges to have the responsibility for setting out in open court their reasons for avoiding extended sentences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is important to our debate to boil down carefully the difference between clause 55 and section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. Clause 55 is designed to enable but not require courts to impose sentences, including extended periods of post-release supervision on defendants convicted of sexual or violent offences. However, section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act was intended to require the sentencing court to impose on the offender a period of supervision on release from prison of longer than 50 per cent. of the term of imprisonment, save in exceptional circumstances. In cases under section 20 other than those involving exceptional circumstances, the court was required to impose a supervision period equal to 50 per cent. of an offender's term of imprisonment. I have listened carefully to the Minister and I do not want to ruin my new-found reputation as the piece of blancmange that I was accused of being. However, it is important to realise that we are dealing with supervision, which is not a punishment but is designed to help the offender.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Members are not suggesting that, because sex offences are so serious, they should be subject to longer periods of imprisonment. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will correct me if I am wrong, but we are suggesting that, because of the common nature of sex offenders, a longer period of supervision is in their interests as well as in the interests of society. My hon. Friend made good points about the nature of sex offenders, how often they are in denial and how relatively minor behaviour can lead to more serious offences.
<P>
The Minister asked what was the point of having supervision when there is no obvious need for it. Surely, it can be left to the good judgment of the probation officer dealing with the case to relax the supervision. Probation officers have considerable discretion, so will the Minister tell us what they will be able to do?
<P>
The Minister said that there are obvious examples of sex offences that are unlikely to be repeated. Those obvious examples were not immediately apparent to me--I may have been unsighted--so will the Minister tell me what they were?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps, I can help the hon. Gentleman. There is a wide range of sex offences, which is one of the difficulties of dealing with the subject. One example might be an offence that was committed as part of a relationship that has since ended. The offender would be full of remorse and the other person involved would have left the country. If the offender's background did not reveal any previous offences, the prognosis given to the court may provide it with sufficient information to regard it as a one-off event.
<P>
I mention the criteria involved to show just how certain a court would have to be to treat a case in that way. That does not affect the seriousness of the offence, but it would affect the requirement for supervision to protect the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I understand those circumstances. However, under section 20, the court could say that, because of the exceptional circumstances that made it clear that it was a one-off crime that did not involve a paedophile or someone with a pattern of behaviour, it is not necessary to impose an extended sentence.
<P>
The previous Government framed section 20 in the way that they did for good reason. They were concerned for the protection of society. It is unfortunate the Government are backtracking and that the important statement made by section 20 is being weakened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to this important debate, and I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) for their constructive speeches. They hit the nail on the head when they said that the clause waters down both the criteria and the length of supervision that can be imposed.
<P>
The amendments reflect the criteria under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. Section 20(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where a court sentences an offender to imprisonment for a term in respect of a sexual offence . . . it shall give a direction under this subsection unless it is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances which justify its not doing so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where the court does not give a direction . . . it shall state in open court that it is of that opinion and what the exceptional circumstances are.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are much tougher criteria than those contained in clause 55. That cannot be gainsaid.
<P>
What are the Government's reasons for not using the criteria from the 1997 Act? They cannot say that they are unable to implement section 20 because it is part of a too-complicated whole. They could have taken the criteria from section 20 and used them in clause 55, as the amendment seeks to do.
<P>
The Minister referred to the seriousness of the sentence and said that it was not possible to impose a term of supervision that would be longer than would be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. However, that is precisely what the Government are enabling the courts to do. They merely use different criteria, in which the period of licence that the offender would otherwise receive
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would not be adequate for the purpose of preventing the commission by him of further offences and securing his rehabilitation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not relate to the seriousness of the offence; it relates to the need to prevent the commission of further offences and to secure the rehabilitation of the offender.
<P>
When the Minister referred to sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, he introduced a red herring. I have not yet had the chance to study those sections in detail, but they seem to contain different criteria again.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then made the important point that it was not necessary to introduce the provisions across the range of sexual offences, and quoted the Sex Offenders Act 1997. However, that is precisely what the Act does. There is no discretion for the courts under the Act. It applies to anyone convicted of the wide range of offences that are listed in the Act. There is no discretion for the courts about whether someone should be put on a register. The Opposition think that that is right. The Government agree, and we are pleased about that.
<P>
However, the Government do not go so far as to say that the same approach would be right for supervision under the clause. The Opposition think that it would be. There are particular features relating to sexual offences, including the risk of repetition and the nature of the offenders, which make it more important that there should be supervision. That is why I have quoted the Home Office's strategy document on that matter. The examples cited by the Minister show how dangerous it is to make generalisations about sex offenders.
<P>
The Minister said that if a sexual offence occurred within a relationship, it might not happen again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not like the way in which the issue is being treated. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to misinterpret what I said.
<P>
I gave a set of criteria as an example. Anyone with any common sense would say--as the hon. Member for Gainsborough had the courtesy to do--that in those circumstances it would not be necessary to impose an extended sentence. I ask the hon. Member to impose an extended sentence. I ask the hon. Member for Hertsmere not to play games over this issue; it is too serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister should keep his temper. I am making a serious point.
<P>
The Minister tried to give the Committee an example of a case in which it would not be necessary to impose supervision. He referred to someone who was in a relationship and said that in those circumstances supervision would not be necessary. If he wants to correct or embroider that example. I am happy for him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not want to correct or embroider it. I ask the hon. Gentleman to read Hansard and to study the collection of circumstances that I mentioned. I referred to an offence that had occurred within a relationship which had ended permanently, with the other person in the relationship which had left the country and it was clear, from an analysis of the risk, from the treatment that the offender had received and from a variety of other pieces of evidence, that there was no likelihood of a repetition of the offence. Such events happen. I was careful in the example that I gave and I ask the hon. Gentleman not to trivialise it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not trivialising the example. I think that the Minister should keep his temper because my example refers exactly to the points that he made. In any event, his points could be interpreted as describing exceptional circumstances. In the circumstances that the Minister described--the relationship ending and the person going abroad--the experience of sexual offences shows that, whether the victim is the wife, partner or child, there is a high propensity for sexual offenders to form another relationship and to be abusive again to the wife, partner or child. If the Minister could listen to me without losing his temper, he would accept that the examples show that that happens time and time again. The court needs to be satisfied that there is no risk of that happening, before it can say that supervision is unnecessary.
<P>
The purpose of supervision is to monitor the offender over the long term, to see whether he is forming another relationship in which there is a risk of abuse or where abuse might be taking place. That happens time and again. We are not trying to provoke the Minister or the Government, but we are telling them that they have not got it right. Their criteria are flawed and are not as strong as the criteria in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. The nature of sex offences and the risks that they carry with them make it important that we should have stronger criteria. We shall be pressing the amendment to a vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am very disappointed by the response of Opposition Members, and I think that it is grossly irresponsible to play politics with an issue of such seriousness. The hon. Member for Hertsmere tried to trivialise the example that I gave and, on three occasions, chose to ignore elements in that example. I regard that as being irresponsible on his part.
<P>
I must make a couple of points about the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 that the hon. Gentleman seems to overlook. The sentence imposed would be only two thirds of that currently imposed. The breach of extended supervision could not return an offender to prison without his being prosecuted and then convicted of the offence of breach of supervision. That would all take time.
<P>
By contrast, an offender subject to extended sentence under clause 55 could be recalled to prison immediately by the parole board or, in emergency cases, by the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman needs to study the whole picture and judge whether we are doing a job that needs to be done to protect the public, instead of playing semantic games, which, I regret to say, is what he is doing with the seriousness or alternative merits of the two ways of dealing with the issue.
<P>
I also remind the hon. Gentleman that I started by pointing out that there are other issues that change the environment and demonstrate the seriousness with which the Government have dealt with the issues. I refer to the Sex Offenders Act 1997. Registration is compulsory so that an assessment of risk can be made by those who use the information that is required to be registered under the Act. The Act goes further than the original idea of a paedophiles register in that it registers a range of sex offences and enables the public to be protected against danger in those circumstances.
<P>
As I have done on previous occasions, I pay tribute to the way in which the police and the probation service have worked with us to bring the register into being and to use it as an opportunity to protect children and vulnerable adults. Until very recently, people finished their time in prison, walked free and nobody took any notice of them. They disappeared into the community to pose whatever threat they posed to members of the public anonymously.
<P>
We have also introduced the sex offender order in the Bill. Any individuals sentenced under the relevant part of the Bill comes within the definition of a sex offender. If, during their period of supervision, they continue to behave in a way that causes concern, they can be made subject to a sex offender order, which will continue beyond the period of their sentence and supervision. For the hon. Member for Hertsmere to suggest that we should amend the Bill, by reverting to the provisions of the previous Government's legislation because that legislation is tougher than the measures that this Government are providing, is totally ludicrous.
<P>
I invite the hon. Gentleman to stop playing games and to support the Government in dealing with the issue seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister ought really to keep hold of his temper for a while and focus on the issue that is at stake--

On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now return to the amendments that we were discussing earlier.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's response, and he made some fair and important points. Those points did not have much to do with my amendments, but I nevertheless agree with what he said about licence and length of supervision. I also listened with interest to what the Minister said about the sex offender order. We have already welcomed that, while pointing out the significant flaws in its provisions. I do not want to go over ground that has been covered in previous debates. However, If the Minister looks at the conditions that must be fulfilled before a sex offender order can be made, he will see that some of the restrictions will mean that magistrates will find themselves hamstrung.
<P>
Conservative Members are concerned in this debate not with the distinction betweeen licence and supervison or with the seriousness of offences, but with the criteria that have to be fulfilled before a sex offender order can be made. The criteria in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 were much tougher than the criteria in the Bill. We think that there should be tough criteria in cases relating to sex offenders, and surely we cannot be gainsaid on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman back to the Committee--he is in a better mood than he was before. He courteously acknowledged that several points were made that he found helpful. It is important to be clear about the comparison between clause 55 and section 20 of the 1997 Act, because that is at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's case. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Many small conversations make much noise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.

Let us compare the case of a sex offender subject to clause 55 and that of the same individual subject to section 20. If a person is convicted of a sexual offence, the average sentence is three years. Under the Bill, that person will serve nine months on licence, if there is no need for extended supervision according to the criteria in clause 55. Under the 1997 Act, he would receive a sentence of two years and, on release, would be subject to one year's supervision if the same criteria as clause 55 did not apply. If those criteria were to apply, under the Bill the prisoner would serve up to 10 years on top of the nine months' supervision. Under the 1997 Act, the total period of supervision cannot exceed 10 years. The hon. Member for Hertsmere should appreciate that difference.
<P>
There is no extended supervision up to 10 years under the 1997 Act, unless the same criteria that are in clause 55 apply. Under the Bill, the total extended supervision is added to the basic period, whereas under the 1997 Act it cannot exceed 10 years. Under the Bill, if the licensee gives cause for concern he can be immediately recalled to prison. Under the 1997 Act, he must first be prosecuted, then convicted and then sentenced--and only if he is proved beyond reasonable doubt to have breached a specific condition in his licence.
<P>
That is why the Bill's provisions are stronger than those of the 1997 Act. They are also much more focused on the prevention of potential danger to the public. That is crucial. We are trying to ensure that individuals are punished for their offences. At the same time, we are trying to use the requirements of supervision, and the action that can be taken if people do not respond, to make sure that children, vulnerable adults and the public in general are protected from those who might pose a danger to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We shall come to what the Minister says about the length of supervision when we debate amendment No. 249, but I hope that I made it clear that I was talking about the criteria according to which the court will decide to make an order for an extended sentence. Thoses criteria are tighter in the relevant subsections of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, to which I respectively refer the Minister, than they are in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I dealt with the question of critieria, and those in the Bill are not weaker. The hon. Gentleman and I have expressed our respective views on this important matter but, given that he is not persuaded by my words, I shall simply repeat the assertion that the criteria are not weaker.
<P>
I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to amplify the point rather than delay the Committee, but I am certain that I am right. Not only does the Bill contain comparable criteria, but their consequences in terms of providing protection to the public are much stronger and more effective. I am sure that is what the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve.
<P>
The criteria in clause 55 for the 10-year extended supervision period are the same, word for word, as those contained in section 20(6)(b) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman and I compare the relevant documents when I write to him to amplify the point. However, I can honestly say that he is mistaken about the criteria. They are not weaker in the Bill than in the 1997 Act, and they will be considerably stronger in the effect that thay have on protecting the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments are about the criteria that have to be fulfilled before an order can be made. To assist the Committee. I shall simply read out the terms of the amendments. After the word ``where'' in line 12 of page 42, amemdment No. 246 insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) a court proposes to impose a custodial sentence for a sexual offence unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify not extending the period (if any) for which the offender would, apart from this section, be subject to a licence; and
<P>
(b) a court which proposes to impose a custodial sentence for a.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That compares with the Bill, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This section applies where a court which proposes to impose a custodial sentence for a sexual or violent offence considers that the period (if any) for which the offender would, apart from this section, be subject to a licence would not be adequate for the purpose of preventing the commission by him of further offences and securing his rehabilitation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's courteous offer to write to me. I hope that he considers the matter carefully, as any reasonable interpretation of meaning and English will show that the criteria for making an order in the 1997 Act are manifestly tougher than those in the Bill. The Minister must accept that to say that an order must be made unless there are exceptional circumstances is tougher than to say that the court can make an order where it thinks that it would be desirable to do so for the purposes set out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman uses the word ``tougher'' in a way that I do not understand. Certainly, the way in which the court is to make the judgment is slightly different, in that there is a reversal in the balance of the wording. However, that does not mean that different criteria are being used. The hon. Gentleman uses the word ``tougher'' in a rather peculiar way.
<P>
I explained earlier that a wide range of offences is covered by the provision. That is why it is important that the court should make the judgment in those cases where the potential requirement is in the public interest. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to section 20(6)(b) which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the court considers a longer period necessary for the purpose of preventing the commission by the offender of further offences and of securing his rehabilitation'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the period shall be a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``longer period, not exceeding ten years, as it may determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Act is clear that the criteria are danger and the risk of further offending. It is clearly based on protecting the public.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister should read section 20(3), which sets out the criteria or gateway for making an order for additional supervision. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where a court sentences an offender to imprisonment for a term in respect of a sexual offence committed after the commencement of this Chapter, it shall give a direction under this subsection unless it is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances which justify its not doing so.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Minister referred to section 20(6)(b). Section 20(6)(a) deals with the usual period, while subsection (6)(b) deals with the longer period on top of the usual period that a court can order if it thinks appropriate. The criteria for imposing an extended sentence under section 20(3) are tougher. It must be tougher to say that an order will be made unless there are exceptional circumstances for not making one than simply to say that a court can make an order if it thinks that it is desirable to do so in the interests of preventing the commission of offences by the offender, and of securing his rehabilitation.
<P>
We shall come to the length of the supervision order in a minute. The Minister cannot, however, suggest that the criteria for making an order in clause 55 are, on any ordinary interpretation of English, tougher than those in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I can. I am beginning to understand where the hon. Gentleman has gone wrong. Without section 20(3), there would be no spervision at all. Section 20(6) deals with the criteria against which a decision has to be made about the need for extended supervision. The hon. Gentleman needs to re-examine the matter with care--he is misdirecting himself. He misunderstands the potential application of the 1997 Act.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has heard my explanations about the extent to which the clause provides greater reassurance and protection for the public and introduces stronger terms. I invite him to withdraw the amendment because he has misunderstood the position entirely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister should look at the heading of section 20 of the Crime Sentence Act--it is a special provision for sexual offenders and provides for extra-long supervision for them. Subsection (6)(a) states that the period will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``equal to 50 per cent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the term of imprisonment unless, as subsection (6)(b) adds,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court considers a longer period necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The criteria in the amendment have been lifted from the 1997 Act. I am happy to rest my case that the criteria in the Act are tougher. The criteria in amendment No. 246 for imposing an extended sentence for the purposes of clause 55 are, however, tougher than the provisions in the Bill. The amendment would toughen the Bill and I shall press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think that I am pushing at a closed, locked and bolted door. I am starting to believe that the hon. Gentleman has made up his mind to have a vote and cannot be swayed by argument. I am disappointed because I have tried to respond sensibly and to persuade him of the way in which the Government are dealing with the issue. If he is determined not to be persuaded, however, there is little more that I can do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not determined to have a vote. If the Minister said that he would go away and consider the criteria in the amendment to see whether they would toughen the Bill's criteria and that he would write to me with his conclusions, I would be delighted and would not hesitate for a minute to withdraw the amendment. Unless he is prepared to do that, I shall stick to my interpretation and press the amendment to a vote because I beleive that it will make the Bill tougher.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> In the interests of promoting understanding in the Committee rather than of simply bandying words, I am happy to consider what the hon. Gentleman has said and to write to him. I believe that what I said was correct. I hope that I shall succeed in persuading the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am as good as my word, Mr. O'Hara. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 42, line 31, leave out `shall not' and insert `may'.
<P>
The Minister agreed to consider the previous amendment, and I hope that he will react similarly to this one. I am as convinced as I was with regard to the previous one that it would improve the Bill. It relates to a very important matter that the Committee may have anticipated, as it deals with how long supervision will be for a defendant who is subject to extended sentence under the clause. The Opposition are concerned on that score, especially with regard to paedophiles. We are concerned that the length of supervision that the courts may order under the clause will simply not be long enough. I hope that we have made it clear that a long period of supervision is desirable in such cases.
<P>
The key question is for how long will sex offenders be supervised under the clause? How much extra supervision will the clause allow the courts to pass, over and beyond what is currently available? How does the supervision under the clause compare with the length of supervision that would have been available if the Government had implemented section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997?
<P>
I shall start with the length of supervision and extra supervision under clause 55. The problem with the clause is that under subsection (5), the term of an extended sentence and therefore of the period of supervision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``passed in respect of an offence shall not exceed the maximum permitted for that offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would allow courts to pass sentences longer than the maximum for the offence. The Opposition believe that unless the amendment is made, subsection (5) will seriously limit the courts' ability to pass appropriate extended sentences--in the case of determinate sentences--for many sex offenders and especially for paedophiles.
<P>
It is reasonable to assert, although I do not have statistics to back up my proposition, that paedophiles are commonly convicted of offences with determinate sentences--sentences of a fixed length. Such offences include indecent assault and indecency with children, which are common offences among paedophiles who are very often charged with and convicted of them. Indecent assault and indecency with children carry maximum sentences of 10 years' imprisonment. As I said, I cannot say that those offences are the most common among paedophiles, but I should not be surprised to learn that they are. While they are obviously not as serious as offences that involve the taking of a child's life, which carry indeterminate sentences, they are common and can be very serious and cause long-lasting damage to victims.
<P>
Perhaps the best way to illustrate my points about the limitations that subsection (5) will place on the length of supervision ordered under the clause is to refer to a specific sentence. I shall highlight how much difference the clause could make compared with what would otherwise be the case and what currently happens in practice. I am grateful to the Library for its assistance in this regard. I shall invite the Minister to comment, and I appreciate the fact that he is listening courteously and attentively.
<P>
I want to take the example of a paedophile sentenced to eight years' imprisonment as a result of an offence of indecent assault. Such an offender could be released after serving half of his sentence--that is, after four years--if he were successful in obtaining discretionary conditional release through the parole board. It is perhaps more likely that he would be unsuccessful in that, and that he would be released after serving two thirds of his sentence--after five years and four months--which is the time at which such offenders are automatically released from the custodial part of their sentences.
<P>
In either case, under the current arrangements he would be released on licence and subject to supervision until he had served three quarters of his sentence, which would be six years. In fact, that would happen with all offenders, irrespective of the type of offence.
<P>
As this man was a sex offender, it would have been open to the court to impose a longer period of supervision under section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. It could have imposed supervision up to the full eight-year term of his sentence from the point of release at four years or five years and four months. I emphasise that that is the current position under the Criminal Justice Act 1991. What difference will clause 55 make to that picture?
<P>
If the court had not exercised its powers under section 44 of the 1991 Act, the application of clause 55 would have produced an additional four years of supervision--that is, the maximum period of supervision. If, as would be likely in the case of a dangerous paedophile, an order had been made under the clause, it would have produced an extra two years of supervision at most. We do not think that an additional two years of supervision is very much. That two years would have been the difference between the eight years of his maximum sentence and the maximum sentence for the offence, which is the cap under clause 55(5). In comparison with the period of supervision that could have been imposed under section 20 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, two years is not very long at all.
<P>
I asked the Library what would have happened under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 in the case of an offender sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Its answer states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Under the arrangements set out in the 1997 Act a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of 8 years for indecent assault who was not released early on compassionate grounds would therefore have had to serve at least 6 years and 8 months before being released. [Time spent in custody on remand would have counted as time served as part of the sentence, unless the case came within a number of exceptions provided for by section 9(4) of the 1997 Act.] On his or her release such a person would have been subject to supervision for at least four years and possibly up to 10 years''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what would have happened under section 20(6)(a) and (b) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, to which the Minister referred in the previous debate. Time spent in custody on remand would count in any event, whatever the sentence was imposed for.
<P>
In conclusion, under the 1997 Act, an offender would spend six years and eight months in custody and could be subject to up to 10 years' supervision. The combined effect of clause 55 and existing law would be that such an offender would spend a maximum of five years and four months in custody and could receive an additional four years and eight months' supervision. The maximum sentence for indecent assault--10 years--would constitute the cap on that period under clause 55. The difference that we are considering is between six years and eight months in custody with an additional 10 years' supervision and what would result under the Bill--five years and four months in custody with an additional four years and eight months' supervision. On the basis of that comparison we feel emboldened to say that the period of supervision that could be imposed under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 would have been longer than the maximum under the Bill.
<P>
The example that I took of a sentence of eight years' imprisonment for indecent assault would have to be a fairly serious one, given that the maximum sentence is 10 years. However, it is important to consider serious cases in this context.
<P>
I believe that in the case of any determinate sentence for a sexual offence, the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 would allow for a longer maximum supervision period than the Bill would. I do not venture that opinion as firmly as I did the proposition about sentences for indecent assault, but I have a strong suspicion that it is true. I also suspect that, as with the example that I just gave, the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 would produce a longer period in custody in these cases. However, I am concerned at the moment with supervision. My reading of the 1997 Act--with which I think the Minister agreed in the previous debate--was that it could allow for supervision, in appropriate cases, for a maximum of 10 years.
<P>
The matters that I am discussing, with the calculations that they entail, are complicated but they are of great public interest. I wonder whether sufficient attention has been paid to the detail of clause 55. Subsection (5) sets out what we take to be the cap on sentences and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The term of an extended sentence passed in respect of an offence shall not exceed the maximum term permitted for that offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our understanding is that ``extended sentence'' refers to the period of supervision and ``maximum term'' refers to the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed for an offence, as set out in statute. It appears that the cap in subsection (5) would produce ludicrous results. In practice, the shorter the sentence, the longer the period of supervision to which an offender could be made subject.
<P>
Let us take the example of a less serious case of indecent assault than the one I gave earlier, for which the offender received a sentence of two years' imprisonment. Given that the maximum sentence for indecent assault is 10 years, that would mean that someone sentenced to two years' imprisonment for a less serious offence of indecent assault could be given an additional period of supervision of between eight years and eight years and six months, over and above what would now be possible. Supervision in the region of four years would be available for the person convicted of the more serious offence, that carried a sentence of eight years' imprisonment.
<P>
It is common sense that the more serious the offence, the longer the period of supervision should be. We hope that our understanding of the problems is wrong, and that the Government can show that. However, our understanding, which is confirmed by the House of Commons Library, is that clause 55 would produce results such as I have described, which would be perverse.
<P>
I am sorry if I have taken some time over my remarks, but these are important and detailed subjects that require attention. The courts should be able to pass appropriate periods of supervision on these serious offenders. We regard sexual offences as serious, as I am sure that the Government do. They want to get the period of supervision right, but at the moment it is not right.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hertsmere for his introduction to serious matters. He is right to say that calculation in such matters is, of its nature, somewhat opaque.
<P>
It is important to put it on record that the purpose of the exercise is to protect the public from dangers posed by individuals. We must take care to ensure that a proper assessment of risk takes place and that supervision and other requirements are targeted properly at individuals who pose such a risk.
<P>
We must regard the measure as one instrument among many. There is no single magic wand that will suddenly deal with sex offenders, especially those who pose a continuing danger. They are devious by nature and can cause considerable problems to the authorities that deal with them. So one must see the measure in the wider context of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, the sex offender orders provided for in the Bill and other measures that have been implemented. We need a number of instruments that add up to a comprehensive approach to dealing with sex offenders.
<P>
The Government are examining certain issues closely. The hon. Gentleman will remember earlier debates in which the protection of individuals and civil liberties were discussed. We are scrutinising options on indeterminate sentencing and other ways of dealing with individuals who pose a threat. We are doing that on the basis of the threat posed, as distinct from the question of the commensurate punishment for an offence and other options that are available under the Mental Health Act 1983. We will continue to do what we have done in Opposition and in our first year of Government to identify gaps in the system and to ensure that we have the right mechanisms for dealing with those gaps.
<P>
I return to clause 55. If the extended supervision goes beyond the maximum sentence length, that is not part of the sentence. Therefore, the offender cannot be recalled automatically under the authority of the sentence. I cannot quarrel with the hon. Gentleman's statistics, but, under the 1997 Act the offender cannot be recalled immediately at any point in the supervision period. That is a consequence of not making the supervision part of the sentence. The strength of the measure in taking executive and quick action when a threat is posed to the public is far from insignificant. Indeed, it is the very essence of the proposal.
<P>
With regard to the two-thirds point, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to section 26(2) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 which states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to sections 3(2) and 4(2) above, the court by which a person is so sentenced at any time shall impose a term which is equal to two-thirds of the term which, at that time, it would have considered to be appropriate if the offence had been so committed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the 1997 Act, one could not get eight years for indecent assault. An offender getting eight years now would get two-thirds of eight years under the Act, that is five years and four months and early release. To get eight years under the 1997 Act, the maximum sentence for indecent assault would have to be 12 years, not 10 years.
<P>
The purpose of clause 55(5) is to make it clear that an extended sentence cannot exceed the maximum term that is permitted by statute for the offence in question. The amendment would turn that on its head by changing subsection (5) to provide that an extended sentence may exceed the statutory maximum penalty for the offence.
<P>
The maximum penalties that are available to the courts for the offences have been decided by Parliament. For example, part I of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 refers to sexual and violent offences. The penalties have been laid down in the legislation. It is not for these provisions to give the courts the power to ignore those maximums and impose whatever length of sentence they wish. If it was thought necessary to allow for sentences for all the sex offences covered in the 1991 Act definition to be longer than currently permitted by legislation, it would require amendments to each of the provisions in the legislation where maximum penalties are specified. That cannot be done by an amendment to the extended sentence provisions.
<P>
It is important to bear it in mind that an extended sentence is a custodial sentence like any other. Although an offender would spend the majority of the sentence on licence in the community, he remains liable to be recalled to prison at any time until the end of the extension period. That is the power of the mechanism in the clause. If the offender is recalled and is not released on licence on the discretion of the parole board, he may spend the remainder of the extension period in prison. In addition, during the at-risk period following the licence period, the offender is liable to be returned to prison if he commits further offences.
<P>
If an extended sentence were to exceed the maximum permitted, there would be real doubt about whether the offender could be liable to the sanctions of return and recall if he misbehaved in the period in excess of the statutory maximum. Our view is that he could not. In that case, there would be little benefit in having an extended supervision period that goes beyond the statutory maximum if the sanctions for failure to comply are likely to be unenforceable.
<P>
At the end of the period under supervision--or, indeed, before that--a sex offender order is available. That makes provision for the sort of case where the sentence has been served and there is still a cause for concern. That is why we designed the mechanism. In fact, there may be no gap. One can go to court for the sex offender order before the period of extended supervision is completed. Nothing prevents there being an overlap between the two provisions and the requirements of both being applied. In addition, anyone sentenced in the criminal justice system since last September may be subject to the reporting requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly said that he had to go into some complexity when making his points. I have inevitably had to do the same in responding to them. The hon. Gentleman raised serious issues, and I hope that I have persuaded him that the mechanism that we have provided will be tough and effective in protecting the public. That is our intention.
<P>
We will not rest now. More needs to be done in other aspects of the overall provisions for sex offenders who fall through the net. For example, they include those who may have severe personality disorders. If they have not committed a fresh offence, they cannot be caught under the criminal justice provisions and they are not treatable under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983. We are wrestling with those important issues, so I promise the Committee that the debate on the amendments does not represent the end of our endeavours to put a comprehensive set of mechanisms in place.
<P>
I invite the hon. Member for Hertsmere to consider the points that I have made and withdraw the amendment. I promise him that it will not have the effect that he intends, which is to improve protection for children and vulnerable adults. There is no division between us on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courteous and full response. There is no division about the objective; it is a matter of how we go about it.
<P>
I agree with much of what the Minister said. He is right to draw attention to the distinction between licence and supervision. With licence, someone can be recalled to prison immediately, but different sanctions follow supervision. However, that does not undermine the case for long periods of supervision. One of my main concerns about the clause is that it sets up a trade off between supervision and licence. I want the public to have the best possible protection, which means both supervision and licence.
<P>
Long periods of supervision are important for sexual offenders. My fear is that the clause will not allow long enough for sexual offenders to receive supervision. As I have said before, it leads to the surprising result that the less serious the offence, the longer the period of supervision; the more serious the offence, the shorter the period of supervision. That results from the cap in subsection (5). The problem stems from the Government's approach of using a licence mechanism rather than concentrating on supervision alone--the approach of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.
<P>
I focused on indecent assault because it is one of the most common offences carried out by paedophiles. The restriction is likely to crop up every time there is a problem with indecent assault. The maximum sentence of imprisonment for indecent assault was increased fairly recently--I believe before the 1997 Act, though I cannot provide the exact date. In any case, the Bill will not produce long enough supervisions to deal effectively with the type of offences for which paedophiles are convicted.
<P>
One solution to the problem--I say it tongue in cheek because I know that the Minister will find another reason for not accepting it in due course--would be to vote for our new clause, which proposes life sentences for indecent assault. That would ensure that offendeers received both supervision and licences.
<P>
If the Government will not accept that, let my try to tempt the Minister in another way. If I accept the fairness of what he said about licence, will he accept that I want to see long supervision--and I mean long supervision--for sex offenders? Everyone who has studied the problem believes that sex offenders require longer periods of supervision than do other offenders. If the Minister will re-examine the clause and guarantee to improve it by producing longer periods of supervision than are currently available--I say, frankly, that they are inadequate--I will not press for a Divison.
<P>
As I said at the outset of my remarks, I want longer supervision for sex offenders and I will not be satisfied until I get it. If the Minister tells me that he intends to achieve that, I shall listen most carefully to him, but he must start from the premise that the supervision in clause 55 is inadequate. He should take it away and find a way of securing longer supervision.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I have been on the case for longer supervision of sex offenders for several years so I accept and indeed have argued in favour of the point made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. By virtue of the offender and the need to protect the public I agree that longer supervision is needed for sex offenders than for many other serious offenders. I am certainly prepared to have another look at the clause in the light of what the hon. Gentleman says.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman accepts my point about the strength of the licence provisions, which provide a degree of control over the behaviour and response of the offender. I invite the hon. Gentleman to consider my point about the effect in combination of extending licence and the requirements of sex offenders orders. Together with other proposals that may be adopted in due course, we are moving towards a comprehensive set of measures. 
<P>
I can undertake to look again at the clause for the hon. Gentleman but I obviously cannot give him a promise to go any further than that. The debate has certainly raised some important issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to be unreasonable and put the Minister on the spot here and now. Nobody could fairly ask a Minister to do that. I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to look at the clause again in the light of my comments. I hope that he will accept that it does not produce long enough supervision orders for sex offenders. On the basis of the Minister's generous acceptance of my arguments, I shall not press for a Division. However, we may have to return to the issue again later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I wish to say a few words in the clause stand part debate because we have heard a great deal about the length of supervision orders, but not so much about the quality of supervision, which is vital. I have undertaken some research, using Nigel Walker's ``Sentencing: Theory, Law and Practice'', a volume published by Butterworth. I encountered some interesting issues which lead me to question the Minister on the quality of supervision and give him a chance to reassure the Committee and the public about it. I read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Not all supervisors . . . are adequately briefed. A survey of 56 English probation services by Shaw (1991) found that 37 had no specific policies as regards the definition or handling of dangerous `clients'. Many dossiers had no detailed account of the circumstances of the original offence, and were of little help to a new supervisor. There have been improvements; but this supports the conclusion of Coker and Martin's (1985) study of released lifers: `the notion of, or belief in, ``strict'' supervision is nonsense'. On the other hand, supervisors are meant to be supportive as well as watchful. Probation services find lodgings or hostels for those who cannot rejoin their families, and if possible jobs. They give advice as well as warnings, advice which sometimes averts another offence or recall.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am quoting this because I asked the Minister earlier about his view of supervision. It was in our earlier debate on this clause when my hon. Friends and I were urging him to accept longer supervision orders. In trying to convince the Minister of the merits of our amendments, I asked him whether he thought that supervision was a punishment or primarily a means of helping defendants when they come out of prison.
<P>
Another interesting supervision issue relates to confidentiality. It is important for the supervisor to know as much as possible about the defendant to help him look out for warning signs. However, I quote from my research:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Yet there is an understandable reluctance to burden the ex-inmate with the awareness that he or she is stigmatised in the eyes of those with whom he has daily contact.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another interesting health service document states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all information relating to patients is confidential. Such information should be disclosed within the NHS only to those who are involved in the care and treatment of the patient and then only on a strict need-to-know basis. Disclosure outside the NHS (for example to social workers, the police or the probation service) should occur only if a patient has expressed or implied consent, or where disclosure can be justified as being in the public interest . . . Obtaining consent is essential in most cases.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is obviously difficult for the supervisor to do his job properly without full disclosure, and we should remember that we are talking about sexual offences. A full case history from the NHS will not be made available to supervisors. Will the Minister enlighten the Committee about how to deal with that problem?
<P>
The learned article to which I referred earlier states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Clearly a member of the NHS needs courage to decide that it would be in the public interest to disclose vital information about an ex-patient. Where ex-prisoners are concerned information is less sacrosanct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is stated that probation officers are given only ``fairly full'' histories. An appalling case is mentioned. It is said to be advisable for supervisors to tell potential employers the relevant facts about ex-inmates:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Graham Young, the compulsive poisoner, was entrusted with tea making for his fellow employees, when he was found his first job, with fatal results.''--[Interruption.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One should not laugh, I know, but it is an interesting anecdote. It shows how vital it is to have adequate, properly informed and high quality supervision. I agree with the Minister that there is no point in recommending ever-longer periods of supervision for complex cases, without adequate resources.
<P>
Hon. Members will be aware that we are increasingly seeing a bifurcation of English law, as an article by Professor Clarkson of the University of Leicester pointed out. We are dealing with different types of offender in completely different ways and trying to predict their level of danger to society. Defendants, such as sex offenders, whom we consider a danger to society, apparently receive ever-longer sentences compared to others. That raises the question of how we predict dangerousness.
<P>
An article by Nigel Walker, published by the Blackstone press, makes it clear that public opinion tends to treat sex offenders much more seriously than any other offenders. I am raising these issues because I hope that the Minister will reassure me that he has understood the Opposition's anxieties about the high degree of interest shown by the public when sex offenders are released. The public seeks protection. Are probation officers adequately briefed to give the level of support that is required by such ex-inmates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Member for Gainsborough has raised a number of issues, on which we could spend a considerable amount of time. I shall try to reassure him generally, and would be happy to respond to him in more detail on specific matters.
<P>
I shall deal first with the exchange of information. That has been a live issue for many organisations, in terms of data protection. Recently, there have been some cases about disclosure of information in the courts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough might be aware of a case in North Wales in which the police were challenged over the release of information about two paedophiles, who moved to a caravan park. After consideration on appeal, the court decided that the police had acted properly in disclosing the information because they had done so in a measured and reasonable way that was closely related to the protection of the public.
<P>
The police had indicated their intention to disclose the information unless the individuals moved from a caravan park to which children might have had access in the immediate future. That intention was challenged through the courts. It was decided that the gratuitous exchange of information was not acceptable, but that the proper and orderly provision of information to those who needed to know--including the public, where appropriate--was within the powers of the police.
<P>
Recently, there have been some questions about data protection. Some of the problems have arisen through misunderstandings. People do not understand that the disclosure of information in the pursuit of preventing crime is allowed for in the data protection system. Sometimes, bad advice obstructs the exchange of information that should be shared. The Government have tried to cover that matter in clause 102, which was added during the Bill's passage through the Lords, as a result of our consultations.
<P>
The clause sets out powers for the disclosure of information under the Police Act 1997, including crime prevention and, clearly, the prevention of sex offences. It refers to specific bodies, such as health authorities. That answers part of the question put by the hon. Member for Gainsborough.
<P>
Regarding the probation service, there has been considerable development of its work with offenders, especially the more specialised work with those who have committed violent or sex offences. Probation officers ensure that offenders address such matters as anger management and the understanding of the nature of their offences. Some hon. Members have referred to the fact that sex offenders are often in denial about their offending. These matters are covered so that being subject to the supervision of a probation officer does not just mean that the offender turns up once a month to show that he is still alive and in the vicinity. It involves intensive courses of activity that challenge the behaviour of individuals.
<P>
The matter has been considered by the probation inspectorate. I commend a thematic report of Her Majesty's chief inspector of probation, which was published about a fortnight ago, and which received international attention. The report is especially useful and constructive. It recognises the difficulty of the probation service's role, and it is very challenging in respect of the high-quality nature of supervision and of behaviour-challenging activities that must be developed.
<P>
I have also recently witnessed the extent to which the probation service is developing very sophisticated approaches to risk assessment and risk management. For example, not long ago I visited the Gloucestershire probation service. The chief probation officer there, Gill Mackenzie, is the lead officer for the Association of Chief Officers of Probation with regard to dealing with sex offenders. I was especially impressed by the way in which she and her team described their development of risk-management approaches.
<P>
That is one example of such development, and I know that it is occurring in the probation service generally. It is right that that is happening. The Government want to concentrate on outputs and on the extent to which offending is reduced and the public are protected.
<P>
Increasingly, agencies are working together because they see the necessity of the type of risk-management approach that I mentioned. They will also be required to do so by law. The Government are pushing on an open door with professions that have realised that methods need to be developed, and that the requirements of the public and of Parliament are a lot more stringent than they were some years ago.
<P>
Although I responded in fairly general terms, I pointed the hon. Gentleman to one or two sources of information. Further work is being done by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary on the way in which the police deal with relevant matters. There are no grounds for complacency with regard to these issues, which concern people who are sometimes extremely devious. A small number of such offenders are also extremely dangerous. That is why effort should be concentrated on such offenders, and why the assessment of risk and the concentration of effort in respect of them is an essential element in the protection of public.
<P>
I hope that my remarks have statisfied the hon. Gentleman, although in responding I have inevitably strayed a little wide of the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 400, in page 43, line 30, leave out from `above' to end of line 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following: Government new clause 16--Re-release of prisoners serving extended sentences.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 407 and 416.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall try to be brief, as the amendment's purpose is straightforward. It will ensure that short-term and long-term extended-sentence prisoners are eligible for the same consideration for re-release on licence if recalled to prison.
<P>
The amendment works in conjunction with new clause 16, which will insert a new section 44A in the Criminal Justice Act 1991, dealing specifically with the re-release of prisoners who have been recalled while serving an extended sentence. As the Bill stands, an offender who receives an extended sentence of less than four years would, if recalled to prison, be treated as a short-term offender. That means that he would remain in custody until the end of the extension period without any opportunity to be considered for re-release on licence.
<P>
In most cases that would not be a problem, because the period for which they would be recalled would normally be relatively short. By that time that they have completed the original period in custody, been released and then recalled, it is unlikely that there would be any more than a year of the licence period left for them to remain back in prison. In that case, the question of their being eligible to have their cases reviewed annually would not arise, since they would have to be released at the end of the extension period anyway. But there may be some cases, where the custodial term is very short and the extension period comparatively long, and where the offender is recalled shortly following release, in which the overall extended sentence could still be under four years but where the recall period could be, say, three years or so.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In fairness, such prisoners should be eligible to have their cases reviewed annually, with the possibility of being released again on licence if that is considered appropriate by the parole board. New clause 16 makes specific provision for extended-sentence prisoners who have been recalled to prison under section 39 of the 1991 Act. Under the provisions as they stand, short-term extended-sentence prisoners who are recalled would be able to make written representations to the parole board initially following recall but, if unsuccessful, they would remain in custody until the end of the extension period without further opportunity to apply for re-release.
<P>
The new clause ensures that the short-term extended-sentence prisoners who are recalled may apply for re-release and that offenders who are recalled during the period of extended supervision will have their continued detention reviewed by a court-like body. The Government believe that that will meet requirements that the Committee will support.
<P>
The fact that the new clause provides for the parole board to ``direct'' a prisoner's release rather than ``recommend'' it, as under existing provisions, is important. It means that the consideration of extended-sentence recall cases will be undertaken by the parole board, which will take into account all such evidence as may be adduced before it and act in its judicial capacity as a tribunal. In other words, the proceedings will be oral, before which the offender would have the opportunity to present his case and, if appropriate, call witnesses to give evidence.
<P>
Amendment No. 407 is consequential on new clause 16.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 56, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Would this be a convenient moment for me to withdraw new clause 13, which is in my name?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The appropriate time for that will be when I call amendment No. 252, with which new clause 13 is grouped.
<H4><center>Clause 57</center></H4>
<H4><center>Drug Treatment and Testing Orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 43, line 40, leave out `16' and insert `12'.
<P>
We now come to the subject of drug treatment and testing orders. The amendment explores the question of the age at which such an order can be made. The Bill puts the age at 16, but the amendment would reduce that to 12. In due course, we may decide not to press the amendment too hard, but we want briefly to raise the question of drug abuse among teenagers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> There is some merit in the amendment. I do not want to get into difficulties over my new clause but I shall speak briefly to this amendment. The Bill mentions the age of 16, and the amendment would reduce that to 12.
<P>
The background to the amendment is that this country's reputation for youngsters' involvement in drug taking is very bad. Various newspaper reports over the past few months have confirmed that we are among the leaders, if not actually in the lead, when it comes to drug use among young people. An article in The Guardian earlier this year was entitled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``British children top drug-taking league in Europe''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Children in the UK are taking more drugs than their contemporaries on the Continent and in the United States, according to stark figures from one of Europe's leading addiction research centres.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It went on to report that with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``8 per cent. of 15-year-olds using ecstasy, the UK shares second place with the Netherlands''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the European table.
<P>
The Independent for 3 November 1997 again referred to the European report. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The drug-using habits of British schoolchildren give even more cause for concern. The EU found that 12 per cent. of British 15 and 16-year-olds had tried LSD, compared with 4.5 per cent. in Spain, the next closest; 37 per cent. of British teenagers have tried cannabis.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister must realise that the drug problem can affect children much younger than 16. It is common knowledge that in this country 15, 14, 13 and 12-year-olds have dabbled. Given that 15-year-olds are already subject to custodial sentences, there is some argument for bringing the age limit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendment is neither necessary nor appropriate. I want to make it clear that under-16s can be required to undertake drug treatment as part of an action plan order or as part of the supervision of a youth offending team. The drug treatment and testing order is intended for a specific group of offenders.
<P>
Most young offenders with drug problems will continue to be encouraged by their supervising officer to undertake treatment in the community on a voluntary basis, funded by local authorities and under the community care arrangements. A young offender with a drug problem can be required by an action plan order under clause 65(5) or a supervision order under section 12(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to undergo drug treatment. The maximum duration of an action plan order is three months, while the maximum duration of a supervision order is 90 days. The intention in both cases is to ensure intensive intervention.
<P>
The age limits of drug treatment and testing orders are intended to be the same as those relating to probation orders. Both are available for 16-year-olds who may be regarded as near adults--they may have left school and/or home as children.
<P>
I understand that the hon. Member for Hertsmere was called away on parliamentary business. I said that under-16s can be required to undertake drug treatment as part of an action plan order. The Bill therefore deals with under-16s. I hope that I have dealt with the points that were raised, and that the hon. Gentleman will be disposed to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I indicated that I would not press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 252, in page 44, line 28, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(8) The Secretary of State shall within two years of this section coming into effect and every two years thereafter make a report to Parliament on--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the operation of drug treatment and testing orders, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) until such time as they are available as sentences for courts throughout England and Wales, the areas in which drug treatment and testing orders are available as sentences''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 252 would require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament every two years on the operation of drug treatment and testing orders and, until they become generally available, on the areas in which they are available. It is important to keep a record of how successful the orders are.
<P>
I understand from a written answer that they will not be generally available until the financial year 2000-01, which is nearly two years away. I was also told that until that time, only a few hundred orders will be made in three pilot areas. I believe that the total cost of those pilot projects is expected to be about &#163;1 million. The time scale over which the orders are to become available needs to be explored.
<P>
The Committee will already be aware of Conservative Members' concerns about the link between drugs and crime and the worrying growth of heroin and opiates usage. The financial memorandum states that the total cost of drug treatment and testing order will be &#163;40 million. We should like to know how many drug treatment and testing orders that sum represents, and whether the cost is to be borne by the probation service alone or whether it includes treatment costs. The availability of treatment for the younger end of the age range, for whom there is currently little provision, is particularly important.
<P>
The orders will work more effectively if they are combined with community supervision. Drug misusers who persistently offend often have a range of problems that require active, supervised intervention that helps them to comply with treatment. Will the orders be funded so as to cater for such a supervision element, or for an enforcement element only? Failure to provide supervision in addition to drug treatment and testing could miss out an important part of the picture and may restrict the efficacy of the orders.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Liberal Democrat Members welcome the clause's general approach to drug treatment and testing orders, but we share many of the concerns that have been expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. The funding issue introduces a major question mark, particularly if &#163;40 million is to be the total sum that is made available.
<P>
However, beyond the simple matter of the amount of money that is put in, there are important issues relating to the overall infrastructure. Hon. Members with constituents who are currently seeking drug treatment are no doubt aware that waiting times tend to run into years rather than weeks or months. I assume that courts will want a rapid resolution in these cases, and the establishment of an infrastructure is therefore a key issue. The setting up of a few pilot projects as shining examples will not be sufficient--there should be consistent provision of treatment programmes across the whole country. That is certainly not the case at the moment.
<P>
The culture of existing drug treatment programmes is also important. Many of them are health oriented, and may find it difficult to adapt to the requirements that will be imposed on them by courts. It will take a lot of imagination to develop new treatment programmes and new approaches to treatment. We share the concerns of the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the multiplicity of criminogenic factors--to use the jargon--that often lie behind offending. Drugs are a major factor, but probation officers have reported that in most cases they are to be found in association with other factors. Supervision will be an important component of the project as a whole.
<P>
We hope that the Government will not stop with the drug treatment and testing order, but will go further to look at the model of drug courts, which appear to have worked well in the United States. The idea of drug courts was raised some time ago, when it was backed by the then Liberal Democrat spokesman Alex Carlile, the former hon. and learned Member for Montgomeryshire. Drug courts are not directly comparable with the drug treatment and testing orders--they take the process much further by having specific expertise within a dedicated court environment, rather than relying on the general courts to get up to speed on all the issues. Lay magistrates, who often sit only infrequently on sentencing panels, can find it particularly difficult to respond to the intricacies of drug treatment. However, I am sure that they will, as always, do their best.
<P>
I hope that the Government will assure us that they have made plans to establish the infrastructure and to make sure that there is an immediate response to a court sentence. Will they go further, and indicate that they are positively looking at models from other countries, such as the drug courts that are used in the United States?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I should like to put a question to the Minister. The Government's notes on clauses state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court may order an offender to undergo a drug test'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to which he must consent. Clause 57(6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court may by order require him to provide samples of such description as it may specify.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The notes on clauses on subsection (6) say that the court
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may order the offender... to provide samples for that test. It also requires that the offender should consent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Am I confused? On the one hand, it seems that his consent is required before the samples are taken; on the other, it seems that it is not.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The new drug treatment and testing order provides a new community order for the courts. That meets our manifesto commitment to take action to break the link between drugs and crime. It will replace and improve on the current provision under schedule 1(a) to the powers of the Criminal Courts Act 1973, which allows courts to make it an additional requirement of a probation order that an offender undergo drug treatment. That provision has been little used and, outside certain isolated examples of good practice, it has manifestly failed to tackle the link between drugs and crime.
<P>
The drug treatment and testing order will be a community order. It will sentence the offender to treatment for his drug dependency. The new order will apply to offenders aged 16 or over and will be available to the courts in cases where the offence is neither fixed by law, such as murder, nor carries a mandatory or minimum custodial sentence under the Crime Sentences Act 1997. A community order will, furthermore, take its place in the sentencing framework that was laid down by the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and will, therefore, be combined with other community sentences.
<P>
Clause 57 provides that the duration of a drug treatment and testing order may be between six months and three years, which mirrors the length of a probation order and gives scope for a variety of different stages to the order, including relapse prevention counselling.
<P>
We envisage that the supervision that the hon. Member for Hertsmere requires could be put in place by means of a probation order that would run alongside the drug treatment testing order. It would be for the courts to satisfy themselves in each case that the offender was dependent on or had a propensity to use drugs, and that treatment would be beneficial and potentially effective. There is no necessity to establish that there is a link between drug misuse and the commission of the offence, which is an important point. That has been one of the major disincentives to using the current provision, to which I referred earlier.
<P>
Clause 57 nevertheless provides that the court may order the offender to undergo a drugs test to establish whether he is dependent on or misuses drugs. He can be ordered to undergo the test and, if he is to be the subject of the drug treatment testing order, he is required to give his consent. He may choose not to do so, in which case the court can proceed to deal with him by way of another sentence. If he gives his consent, however, he is likely to be dealt with under the order. To get to that stage, the court might have to order a test.
<P>
I welcome amendment No. 252, but I will not accept it. I gives me the opportunity to explain that I and my ministerial colleagues look forward to passing on news of the success of the new order to Opposition Members. We shall be delighted to keep Parliament informed of our plans to roll out the drug treatment and testing order on a broader scale, when evaluation of its effectiveness in the pilot stage is complete.
<P>
We cannot accept amendment No. 252, even in principle, because there is no need for it to be laid down in primary legislation in the present form. We shall make available the results of the evaluation of the pilot projects, that we are arranging. Any Member of the House is free to ask a parliamentary question of Ministers at the appropriate time, in response to which we shall be delighted to report the Government's progress in tackling drug-related crime. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary because we intend to make available for information on the pilots.
<P>
A couple of issues were raised in the debate. First, the figures that the hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Sheffield, Hallam quoted were right. The pilot will take place over two years, and &#163;1 million is intended for the pilot period. The on-going costs of the project are estimated at &#163;40 million. I do not have the breakdown of all the figures that the hon. Member for Hertsmere requested, but I hope that I will be able to write to him in due course with those figures. Indeed, I shall write to all those hon. Members who are interested, setting out how we calculated the &#163;40 million. Obviously, the figures will be estimates, as much will depend on how the pilot programme operates.
<P>
I think that I have dealt with most of the points raised in the debate, and I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response and I shall take him at his word, although I shall continue to ask many questions about drugs.
<P>
The Minister told the Committee about probation orders and the conditions of treatment. The figures given to me by one of his colleagues show that quite a few such orders have been made, although the answer was given in a form that made it impossible for me to ascertain exactly how many there were.
<P>
I was not entirely convinced by the Minister's line of reasoning for not having an annual report on drug treatment and testing orders, but I was reassured by the spirit of his reply that the Government would make the relevant information forthcoming.
<P>
In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
