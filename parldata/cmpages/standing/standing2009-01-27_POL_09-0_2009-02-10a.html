(5 February) again proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09021064000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000328"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Bayley. Have you received a communication from the
Government or any other representations about new clauses to be added
to the Bill? Last Thursday, the Home Secretary announced that she would
introduce new provisions about gang injunctions. That would be a
significant addition to the Bill and, as we are halfway through our
proceedings in Committee and have limited time left to discuss new
clauses and existing clauses, we are obviously worried about whether we
will have enough time to debate what seems to be a significant, new
addition to the Bill that requires detailed scrutiny and examination. I
am therefore interested to know whether you have received
representations or any news about the
matter.</div><a name="09021064000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000329"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have not received any representations, but I
would not expect to do so. The rule is that the Committee can consider
amendments or that I can call them only if they are tabled three
sitting days before our proceedings. Does the Minister wish to
comment?</div><a name="09021064000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000330"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):</b> I shall take on board the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point of order and consider whether we can take
the appropriate
action.</div><a name="09021064000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000331"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That will help the
Committee.</div><a name="09021064000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000332"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): On a point
of order, Mr. Bayley. I wish to ask two things. First, will
it be possible for the Committee to be told first, or at least at the
same time as others, when we will be debating the measure, as that is
only polite. Secondly, I raised with the Deputy Leader of the House the
matter of whether there would be adequate time for scrutiny of Bills
such as the one under discussion both in Committee and on Report. He
said that the Government would do their utmost to ensure that the only
new clauses tabled on Report would be responses to the Committee and
not extra chunks to be added to the Bill. Sometimes the Government have
to do what they have to do, but I hope that the message is understood
that we need adequate time on Report to discuss such matters,
especially when new clauses are tabled late in
Committee.</div>
<a name="09021064000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000333"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That point of order was clearly a message for
the Minister, not the Chair.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div><a name="09021064000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000334"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b><b class="B"> </b>The new provision to which the hon. Member
for Hornchurch referred related to gangs, and the Government intend to
table such a new clause for discussion in Committee, not on Report. It
is the Government&#146;s intention&#151;it is certainly
mine&#151;to ensure that, as far as possible, we adhere to the
commitment that the Home Secretary and I gave on the Floor of the House
and here in Committee that we will have adequate time to discuss the
various measures in the Bill and that we will have sufficient time to
prepare for them.</div>
<a name="09021064000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000335"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That was useful. I am grateful to the hon.
Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon and for Hornchurch for raising
those points of order, and to the Minister for informing us of his
intentions.</div><a name="09021064000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000336"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I decided
on Thursday to contribute to discussions on the clause. I listened
carefully and necessarily patiently to the detailed argument made by
the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, but I thought that we
were in danger of omitting from the debate&#151;except for a passing
reference to it when we reached clause stand part&#151;the policy
objective behind the
clause.</div><a name="09021064000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge that much of the discussion on Thursday afternoon was
helpful in identifying ways in which the Bill can be improved, but I
consider that those who were arguing for greater evidence to back up
the basic approach of the Bill seemed to be quite happy to assert that
the Bill was completely wrong, that it would be counter-productive and
that there was no point in reducing demand for trafficked women who are
prostitutes, without giving any evidence themselves to back up their
assertions. I therefore want to spend a minute or two looking at the
policy
focus.</div><a name="09021064000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
admit that when I first discovered the Government&#146;s approach I
too was a little sceptical, but once I read the Home Office
publication, &#147;Tackling the Demand for Prostitution: A
Review&#148;, in November 2008&#151;a very useful document that
contains much of the evidence that the Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon thought was missing&#151;it helps our understanding of the
Government&#146;s position. It is very clear from information already
in the public domain that almost every approach to reduce prostitution
has weaknesses. However, on the evidence available it is reasonable to
attempt to reduce demand for prostitution by operating a strict
liability rule that will hopefully dampen demand, and in
particular&#151;I will say more about this in a minute&#151;make
men think very seriously about the nature of the prostitution services
that they are buying.</div>
<a name="09021064000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000337"></a><b class="B">Nadine
Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): Will the hon. Lady
explain how the information will be imparted to men who pay for sexual
services? Will there be a national advertising campaign to let men know
that they are subject to strict liability when they use the services of
a prostitute? If there is to be a campaign, that funding would be
better channelled elsewhere. Men do not know what the law is now when
they pay for sexual services, and I do not believe that they will know
should the Bill be
enacted.</div><a name="09021064000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000338"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> If the hon. Lady had been here for the
extensive debate that we had on the clause on Thursday, she would have
known that that matter was dealt with by the
Minister.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="09021064000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000339"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Lady would accept that I was here last
Thursday. She talks about the evidence in the Home Office review, but
the academic evidence&#151;if something is published and
peer-reviewed it is evidence, otherwise it is opinion, which is
valuable but different from evidence&#151;is not in the Home Office
review. In so far as it exists, there is a review of that academic
evidence that has not even been published yet, let alone at the time
the review was published, so would the hon. Lady accept that in strict
terms the evidence is not there on either side in the Home Office
review?</div><a name="09021064000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000340"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I thought the hon. Gentleman might make
that point. A great deal of the academic evidence is referred to in the
report. My point is that it explains to some extent the logic behind
the Government&#146;s thinking on why they opted for reducing the
demand for the prostitution services of a woman who had been
trafficked.</div>
<a name="09021064000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
serious about reducing demand, it is essential to make the purchasers
of prostitution services responsible for their actions. The critical
point is vigilance and circumspection about the women who are involved.
The best way for purchasers of ensuring that they do not fall foul of
the legislation is to either not use the services of prostitutes, or to
significantly reduce that risk by being very careful, and perhaps using
prostitutes who are in a collective or another setting where women are
clearly not being controlled for gain, and where some aspects of
women&#146;s safety can be
guaranteed.</div><a name="09021064000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
deals very effectively with the criticism from the English Collective
of Prostitutes. Useful criticisms were raised on its behalf by the GMB,
but the union and the English collective have taken their eye off the
policy direction in the clause, which is to try to reduce the number of
women who are either trafficked into this country for prostitution or
are forced into prostitution and controlled for
gain.</div><a name="09021064000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will not further criminalise prostitutes, but it will criminalise
the men who buy services from prostitutes who are controlled for
gain&#151;we took our eye off that particular policy focus on
Thursday. It therefore is essential that we keep the strict liability
clause, because if we start to alter it, we give men a number of
possible defences&#151;I am not suggesting for a minute that people
should not be able to defend their actions, but we do not want to make
it too complicated, have too many possible defences, or be too
mealy-mouthed about it, because otherwise, the policy objective will
simply be lost. The clause and the direction of the Bill can work only
if we keep our eye on strict liability, because it is by making men
very careful, responsible and circumspect about who they are buying
services from that we will achieve reduction in demand for the services
of women who are controlled for
gain.</div><a name="09021064000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000341"></a>Nadine
Dorries:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bayley. We
have been a well-mannered and polite Committee up until this point, but
I am afraid that I feel obliged to put on the record the reasons for my
absence on Thursday, as they were pointed out in such an ill-mannered
way by the hon. Member for City of
Durham.</div><a name="09021064000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000342"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is not a point for debate. The hon. Lady
can contribute to the debate, but she cannot make that a point of
order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="09021064000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000343"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): As we have heard, both in the
debate on Tuesday and this morning, there are major concerns about the
general intent of the clause. Many people believe that the introduction
of a strict liability offence, together with the issue of controlling
someone for gain, threatens to make the situation for sex workers in
this country much worse, rather than better, even though the intention
of the Bill is to improve the situation. Most people who are connected
with the issue out on the street feel that, whatever the intention of
the Bill, it will make matters worse.</div>
<a name="09021064000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to go
into some detail on that. To put it on the record, I know that the
language used in the Bill is gender neutral, and that the intention is
not to talk purely about women as sex workers who are used by men as
punters or customers. None the less, throughout the entire debate on
Second Reading, and so far in Committee, the only terms that have been
used throughout concern women being exploited by men&#151;women as
sex workers, men as
customers.</div><a name="09021064000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000344"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell)</b> <i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div>
<a name="09021064000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000345"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The Minister is nodding. I know that it is the
intention of the Bill, but I still want to put on record the fact that
the Bill is designed to talk about all sex workers, whether or not they
are exploited by any customer. Although the largest category is women
being used by men, there is a fairly large category of men who sell
their services to other men, and also a much smaller, but none the less
existing category of men who sell services to women. I want to put on
the record the fact that the Bill is intended to apply to all sex
workers and customers, not exclusively to women who are used by
men.</div><a name="09021064000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the points on strict liability, which has already been rehearsed, is
that it may simply be unenforceable. In that case, it would be another
example of a headline, grandstanding pursuit, rather than an effort to
introduce measures that work in practice. We discussed a little on
Second Reading&#151;and during the evidence sessions&#151;the fact
that the policy is based on the experience in Finland, the only country
in the world that has gone down the route of introducing a strict
liability crime for the customers of sex workers. As far as we
understand it, the example in Finland, after two to three years, is
that either nobody has been prosecuted at all, or that a few
prosecutions have taken place in very recent months, but we do not know
with what degree of success. Considering the research done by the
Government, including visits to a number of countries with different
approaches, that does not seem a good argument for adopting a the
strict liability approach that has caused so much concern to so many of
the people
involved.</div><a name="09021064000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000346"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> In a sense I am answering the intervention of the
hon. Member for City of Durham, who asked about what the evidence is on
either side. The Government are introducing a strict liability test,
which might make matters worse and criminalise thousands of people. Is
the onus not on the Government to provide the evidence of
effectiveness, rather on than on the Opposition to prove that it does
not work, given that such a test has hardly been tried
anywhere?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="09021064000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09021064000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000347"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Absolutely. The same issue, which has been
discussed a little in Committee and on Second Reading, arises with
respect to the evidence for how bad the problem of sex trafficking is,
for example. Likewise, the issue arises with regard to how many women
are involved in prostitution&#151;I apologise, I meant sex workers in
general, including men&#151;purely to pay for a drug habit, rather
than for other reasons. The evidence in both cases, it has been argued,
is quite flimsy. Certainly the figures put forward for the percentage
of sex workers who are trafficked have been demolished by lots of the
evidence submitted to the Committee, suggesting that the figures are
grossly
exaggerated.</div><a name="09021064000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not underestimate the problem. About seven years ago, a year after I
was first elected, I went on a visit with UNICEF to Thailand and Laos
to look at the issue of trafficked sex workers and, indeed, that of
industrial slaves in some Thai factories. Children mainly came from
Laos to Thailand to become sex workers, but some of them travelled on
to the UK. For example, in Operation Pentameter, the biggest single
category of people who were discovered as trafficked sex
workers&#151;certainly in the top six categories&#151;came from
Thailand. Some other Members of Parliament and I looked at that seven
years ago with UNICEF, so I certainly understand the problem, but a lot
of evidence has been submitted to the Committee to suggest that there
is considerable exaggeration about the percentage of sex workers who
are trafficked
women.</div><a name="09021064000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have heard the arguments. While it may be true in London that there is
a higher proportion of foreign sex workers&#151;that does not
necessarily mean that they are trafficked forcibly, or controlled
against their will&#151;that may not be the case elsewhere. I went
with the BBC to do a programme on a project in Derby that works with
sex workers on the street, offering support. That organisation said it
had never once come across a trafficked sex worker in Derby, for
example. We have heard other evidence for that case from other parts of
the
country.</div><a name="09021064000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000348"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> Where is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument going? Is he trying to suggest that there are not that many
women or male sex workers controlled for gain and that perhaps we do
not need to have legislation or, indeed, do anything to try and reduce
demand for people who fall into that
category?</div><a name="09021064000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000349"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I am responding to the hon. Lady&#146;s comment
that we need evidence on both sides. It is all very well saying that
people who are worried about the negative impact of the Bill have not
presented evidence, but they have done so, and I have given examples.
The onus is on the Government, who have introduced the legislation.
Almost uniformly, the people who work in this field&#151;for example,
the United Kingdom Network of Sex Work Projects, which works with 63
projects around the country&#151;most of whom are funded by the
Government, say that the measures in the Bill will have a negative,
rather than a positive,
impact.</div><a name="09021064000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are looking for evidence-based policy making, especially if we are
going down a route that may, with the best of intentions, make things
worse, not better, we ought to be looking seriously at the evidence. We
have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>rehearsed the argument in previous sittings that most of the evidence to
which the Government refer has not even been published. How can we look
at it? How can we evaluate it? How can we say that this evidence leads
to that conclusion? What I was saying about Finland was that the
Government went to look at New Zealand, the Netherlands, Finland and
Sweden, but came up with the example of Finland, which alone in the
world has adopted that approach, apparently without success so far.
Where is the evidence of evidence-based policy
making?</div><a name="09021064000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000350"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman will be aware that my constituency is just up the road from
Derby. I have heard that women from Thailand were trafficked into my
constituency, ostensibly to work in massage parlours, but actually to
work in brothels. That was well documented in <i class="I">The Mail on
Sunday</i>, among other newspapers. I have met women who have been
trafficked into the UK for one purpose and who can then slip easily
into prostitution.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000351"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I do not disagree with that&#151;the hon. Lady
has given one piece of evidence from somewhere near Derby. I gave
another piece of evidence from a sex workers project based in the
centre of Derby, which said that it had never once come across a sex
worker who had been trafficked into this country. There is differing
evidence, and we should be looking far more closely at where that
evidence leads us. It should be published for proper, rigorous
analysis, rather than being based on headline figures which are often
grossly exaggerated.</div>
<a name="09021064000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scale of
evidence on trafficked women uncovered by Operation Pentameter, parts 1
and 2&#151;two operations designed specifically to try to find
trafficked women in the sex industry&#151;does not lead to the
conclusion, as one hon. Member suggested on Second Reading, that 80 per
cent. of all prostitutes are trafficked women. There have been some
wild claims and we need to look at the serious evidence, rather than
introduce possibly harmful legislation on the basis of partial
headlines.</div>
<a name="09021064000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000352"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman also accept that it is
wrong to suggest&#151;and I am not implying that the hon. Member for
City of Durham intended to suggest this&#151;that people are not
serious about tackling trafficking unless they support the offence?
There are existing offences on trafficking, and on controlling
prostitution under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and on kidnap and
rape, all of which the Liberal Democrats support. It would be better to
show whether they could be used more often, rather than taking the risk
of going down this new path, which may make things
worse.</div>
<a name="09021064000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000353"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Exactly. Those are points that I shall not make at
length, because I made them in a Westminster Hall debate on the issue
last year. I pointed out that the experience of Operation Pentameter 1
and 2 and of the police operation in Ipswich after the series of five
murders was that, if the police and the authorities put serious effort
into tackling issues of coerced sex workers and trafficked sex workers,
they can tackle the problem. I am not suggesting that there is not a
problem, but that we should deal with it effectively.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div><a name="09021064000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the
overwhelming evidence from people who work in the sex industry or who
work to support those in the sex industry, I do not believe that the
Bill is going to improve the situation&#151;it is going to make it
worse. That is based on the evidence that I have looked at over the
past seven years and on my experience of visiting Thailand, Laos, sex
projects in Derby, taking evidence and going to meetings with the
English Collective of Prostitutes and various other groups. The
evidence shows overwhelmingly that the Bill, even though it has the
best of intentions, is going to take us in the wrong direction, as it
is based on fairly flimsy evidence.</div>
<a name="09021064000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer is
to put serious police resources into tackling the issue. That was the
evidence from Sweden. Some people cited Sweden as the example for
criminalising all street prostitution or the purchase of sex on the
street. However, it was rarely pointed out that in Sweden, as well as
changing the law, the Government gave significant extra money to the
police specifically to expand their policing of the problem. If the law
says that something should not happen, but the police see it as a low
priority among competing budgets, it will not be enforced properly.
Simply enacting the Bill does not mean that any of its provisions will
be enforced any better than the existing provisions that say that sex
trafficking is totally illegal.</div>
<a name="09021064000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000354"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I asked where the argument was going. The
hon. Gentleman has not covered the fact that the &#147;controlled for
gain&#148; category is not only about trafficked women. Does he
accept that this is a different policy approach and instrument from
anything we have had in the past. It is about trying to reduce demand
and trying to take the focus off women and criminalisation and putting
it on people who purchase prostitution services and who are cavalier at
best about the situation that has led women to offer those services in
the first place. Finally, it has not been a universal condemnation from
those organisations representing prostitutes; the criticism has mostly
come from one aspect of prostitution services. If the hon. Gentleman is
going to cite evidence, he should quote the whole evidence.</div>
<a name="09021064000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000355"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b><b class="B"> </b>The overwhelming weight of evidence
received by the Committee, both in our evidence sessions and in written
submissions, is about the negative impact of the Bill. We took evidence
from the POPPY project and another organisation that said that they
totally support of the Bill. However, the UKNSP comprises 63 projects
across the UK, all of which said that the Bill will have the reverse
effect of what was intended. That is an overwhelming ratio of 63:2. I
do not dispute that that is a radical statement of intent, but I do
dispute whether it will achieve what it wants or whether it will make
things much
worse.</div><a name="09021064000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000356"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): The overwhelming evidence that
we have heard supports what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but a lot of
evidence did not come forward at the time. I am sure that we have all
received the same briefing from CARE&#151;Christian Action Research
and Education&#151;and Beyond the Streets, a collaborative network
that covers 50 grassroots organisations and outreach projects. What it
says is the complete opposite of the evidence to which the hon.
Gentleman is referring. Yes, we have received a lot of evidence, but it
was all one way and was deficient in some
areas.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div><a name="09021064000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000357"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> That comment illustrates one of my earlier points
and one made by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon. If a systematic review of the evidence has led the Government
down the path to a radical statement of intention, which might, or
might not, work, and may make the situation worse, that evidence should
have been published so that we could look at it properly. Instead, we
receive assertions from the Government that they have looked at the
evidence and that it leads them in such a direction. However, they have
not published the systematic evidence on which they say the provision
is based. That is no way in which to proceed with a major change in the
law that introduces a strict liability
offence.</div><a name="09021064000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall outline the problems. Much of the argument has come from people
who submitted evidence saying that the strict liability offence will be
unenforceable. On 9 December 2008, Commander Gibson from the
Metropolitan police said that it is going to be</div>
<a name="09021064000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very difficult
to
enforce&#148;.</div><a name="09021064000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is from the horse&#146;s mouth: the new law&#151;the radical
statement of intent&#151;will be difficult to enforce. The evidence
in respect of pursuing sex work and prostitution is that the law could
be difficult to enforce, but it could be done if the police have the
incentive and resources to do it&#151;as with Pentameter 1 and 2 and
the Ipswich project, which involved a lot of work by the local
authorities and social
services.</div><a name="09021064000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
lesson overall has always been that, simply telling sex workers that
they should not do it or that it is really a shame that they do it and
why do they not do something else will not work unless resources are
put in from social services, housing, drug rehab and policing to help
them move away from that lifestyle. The majority of them do not want
that lifestyle, but they see no alternative, and the police are saying
that the new strict liability law will be difficult to
enforce.</div><a name="09021064000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000358"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman quote what the police
officer said? Did the officer say that it was not enforceable because
of the element of status or for some other reason? What were his actual
words? I want to know exactly what he said.</div>
<a name="09021064000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000359"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Commander Gibson&#146;s actual words were that
it was going to be</div>
<a name="09021064000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very difficult
to
enforce&#148;.</div><a name="09021064000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
on the other side of the fence such as lawyers, the Bar Council,
Justice and other groups have said that, while the police fear that the
law will be difficult to enforce on the streets, they consider that it
will be difficult to enforce and get convictions in court. Magistrates
have said that it will be difficult to get convictions in court because
it is a case of strict liability. Let us suppose that the customer,
male or female, has asked the sex worker, male or female, whether they
have been trafficked or controlled against their will. The sex worker
reassures them and says, &#147;No.&#148; However, if that is not
true, the customer is still liable. It will be hard to get a
magistrate&#151;or a jury, if the matter went to a higher
court&#151;to convict on such a flimsy basis. A commander in the
Metropolitan police, the Bar Council and others are saying that such a
law will be difficult to enforce. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>The experience in Finland of two and a half years also implies that it
is pretty hard to obtain a prosecution, let alone make it
stick.</div>
<a name="09021064000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000360"></a><b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): I am listening to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument carefully, as the issue is difficult.
To be absolutely clear, is he saying that even though an offence has
been committed magistrates will not want to convict because they do not
believe it is fair? Is that the import of what he is
saying?</div>
<a name="09021064000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09021064000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000361"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Yes, that is the implication of what magistrates I
have talked to are saying. They are the first line of
defence&#151;often, a &#163;1,000 fine for such an offence will not
reach a higher court, where a jury would be involved. Juries would
certainly take that line, as they do with many crimes, applying common
sense and justice. Magistrates to whom I have spoken to say that they
would need quite a bit of convincing to destroy someone&#146;s
reputation and so on, but also to fine them &#163;1,000 and give them
a criminal conviction for a strict liability offence. If someone says,
&#147;I took every possible step to ascertain that this person was
not trafficked and not controlled against their will. They assured me
of that. I could not see any issue there at all. There was no evidence
that they were frightened, coerced or locked up&#148;, but it later
turns out that that person was trafficked, the strict liability test
comes in and the magistrate will have to find them guilty on that
basis. Naturally, magistrates will be reluctant to do
so.</div><a name="09021064000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
said that &#147;the offence&#148; under clause
13</div><a name="09021064000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
drafted extremely broadly and applies regardless of whether the accused
knew that any of the prostitute&#146;s activities were intentionally
controlled for gain...What &#145;controlled for gain&#146;
means is also very broad, encompassing any activity
controlled...in the expectation of gain for anyone. Presumably
this would cover the owner of a
brothel.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have heard the argument that the whole thing is drafted so broadly that
it might make things much worse&#151;the clause is unclear about who
is involved and who is not. Some Government Members immediately pull a
face at any mention of the English Collective of Prostitutes but, at
the meetings that I have been to, the organisation and the sex workers
with them seem to be rational and intelligent, putting forward rational
arguments. The ECP has argued that there is already an effect, using
the example of a raid on 18 December, just a few weeks ago, in Soho.
Three police officers from Charing Cross clubs and vice unit visited a
flat on Romilly street and issued a written notice against a Miss
Tracey Ramsey, who works as a receptionist there. They intended to
charge her with &#147;controlling prostitution for gain&#148;. The
ECP says that Soho is one of the safest places in the UK for women in
the sex industry to
work:</div><a name="09021064000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
a receptionist, Ms Ramsey is women&#146;s first line of defence
against violent attacks and
exploitation.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the police are already, under existing law or in preparation for the
new law, charging a receptionist with control for gain and threatening
to close down a flat or small brothel where women are operating safely
off the streets, what will happen if the Government introduce their
rather misguided legislation? Far from helping sex workers, it will
have quite the reverse effect, making it much more difficult for them
to operate safely.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="09021064000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
supported by support groups. The United Kingdom Network of Sex Work
Projects
says:</div><a name="09021064000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no commonly-understood definition of &#145;controlled for
gain&#146; and it is unclear how &#145;controlled for gain&#146;
would be interpreted by magistrates. It is unreasonable to expect
clients to discern a condition that is unclear, sometimes even to sex
workers themselves, and which may be deliberately concealed. A strict
liability offence is therefore
unjust.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we look at a parallel example, Scotland introduced legislation against
kerb crawling. The Scottish Prostitutes Education
Project&#151;another outreach group working on the streets with sex
workers&#151;said at a meeting on 13 January, just a few
weeks ago, that the effect of the legislation had been the absolute
reverse of what the Scottish Government had expected and intended when
they introduced it. Far from helping sex workers, it was making things
much worse. SCOT-PEP said:</div>
<a name="09021064000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Women
are working in isolation, which is more dangerous for them...There
aren&#146;t as many clients around but the ones who are around are
the dangerous ones...The number of women on the streets has not
decreased
significantly&#148;.</div><a name="09021064000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
number of clients had decreased, but the clients who are on the streets
now are the more dangerous ones</div>
<a name="09021064000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
don&#146;t care if they get a conviction. They&#146;re the men
prepared to rape and beat...There&#146;s far more violence now,
and far more regular violence...The women are in more
danger...Women do this to earn money, whether it be for drugs or
to support their families and they&#146;ll keep doing
it...Outsiders think prostitution is horrible and you
couldn&#146;t do anything to make it
worse&#148;.</div><a name="09021064000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
SCOT-PEP said, the legislation &#147;has made things worse&#148;.
That was not the intention, but it has made things worse&#151;more
dangerous, more difficult, and impossible to get help and advice to the
women working out on the street. The danger highlighted by that
parallel example is that we will get exactly the same from the
legislation proposed by the
Government.</div><a name="09021064000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
the Swedish example, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr.
Coaker) said in discussions on a previous
Bill:</div><a name="09021064000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am also concerned that criminalising all sex buyers could force some of
those involved in selling sex to continue to do so but to adopt more
covert practices.&#148;</div>
<a name="09021064000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what we are
seeing in Scotland with the kerb-crawling legislation. The hon.
Gentleman went on to
say:</div><a name="09021064000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
would drive it underground and create a more hidden sex market, making
it increasingly difficult for support services and enforcement agencies
to identify and make contact with those individuals. That could expose
them to heightened violence, exploitation and unsafe sexual
practice.&#148;<i class="I"> </i><i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

the hon. Gentleman thought that that was a danger of the Swedish
example, and if SCOT-PEP says that that is the result of the Scottish
example, will Ministers explain why they are confident that that will
not be an indirect, unforeseen consequence of the Bill which, as we
have heard, is a radical shift in British law and a radical leap into
the dark, based on the experience of one country, Finland, where so far
it clearly has not
worked?</div><a name="09021064000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000362"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful to hon. Members, particularly my
hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, for reminding us of the
importance of looking at the policy objectives of this particular
measure. Described rightly by the hon. Member for Chesterfield as a
radical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>approach, the clause amends the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and introduces
a new offence of paying for the sexual services of a prostitute who is
controlled for another person&#146;s
gain.</div><a name="09021064000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing
in mind that we had an extensive debate on Thursday on the amendments
to the clause, I shall give a brief background to explain how we have
arrived at the current position. Some of the views that were expressed
imply that the policy had somehow arrived on the back of an envelope
with neither the support nor the evidence necessary to back it up. On
the contrary: the Government published a co-ordinated prostitution
strategy in January 2006, which made it clear that their policy was to
address demand for prostitution by targeting those who pay for sex, and
focusing on those areas where abuse and exploitation are commonplace.
We built on that in January 2008 with the demand review, which explored
the legislative and non-legislative options available as well as
learning from the experiences of other countries, such as&#151;as had
been mentioned&#151;Sweden and the
Netherlands.</div><a name="09021064000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
review involved key stakeholders and practitioners, including the
police, the Crown Prosecution Service and organisations supporting
individuals involved in prostitution, and a range of views were
expressed. It also included an assessment of relevant academic
research, which was fully referenced, an audit of enforcement and
prosecution practice in England and Wales to identify best practice, an
independent evaluation of approaches to tackling demand in nine other
countries and ministerial visits to Sweden and the Netherlands to learn
more.</div><a name="09021064000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000363"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Do either of the two stages that the Minister
mentioned&#151; the 2006 publication of the policy strategy and the
launch in January 2008 of the review&#151;involve a specific
consultation on the strict liability offence that we are discussing? He
went on to say that the evidence in the review was fully referenced.
Does that mean that when the review is finally published, we will be
able to look at the references section of the article? Does
&#147;fully referenced&#148; mean that the mere mortals among us
who have not seen the review will be allowed to see it at some point
before the Bill becomes
law?</div><a name="09021064000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000364"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The review has been published, and it references
the contributions that were taken into consideration. I think what the
hon. Gentleman is talking about is the additional&#151;for want of a
better term&#151;consultation. We are currently looking at that short
consultation. He will agree that we do not want to release into the
public domain information that has not been properly looked at or dealt
with according to the rules that should apply in such circumstances. In
addition, we did not say to the contributors to that particular part of
the consultation that we would make their views public. However, we
will announce a date in the near
future.</div>
<a name="09021064000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000365"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> There is some confusion. I accept that the review
says with a few footnotes what came from where. But the review talks
about another review by the university of Huddersfield of the evidence,
and I assume that that is not merely opinion and submissions, but a
proper review of the academic evidence and published literature. Has
that been published? I am not talking about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>consultation responses, but I would be grateful if he will clarify what
consultation there has been to date on that
offence.</div>
<a name="09021064000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000366"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> So that we can make progress, I will furnish the
hon. Gentleman with the information that he seeks on the academic basis
for the work that we are doing.</div>
<a name="09021064000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government made it clear at an early stage that we were looking at the
demand side as opposed to the supply side of prostitution, and it
became clear that we were looking at strict liability. We have not
hidden our intention to make progress on that, and I can explain how we
have arrived at strict liability rather than something else.</div>
<a name="09021064000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Mid-Bedfordshire made a very good point about the way in
which the Committee has been conducted, and I fully endorse what she
has said. I fear, however, that that consensus of approach, if not of
opinion, was in danger of breaking down with the comments of the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and his colleague the hon. Member
for
Chesterfield.</div><a name="09021064000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon talked about existing
offences on trafficking being able to deal with the problem. The
reality is that we have done a great deal on trafficking. To some
extent, we are world leaders on that matter. But let me give the hon.
Gentleman an example of where that approach could lead if we are not
careful. Imagine a raid, like Pentameter, on a brothel where women have
been trafficked for sex and the traffickers are in the brothel. The
women are in the brothel and so are the punters who are visiting to buy
sex. We know what would happen to the traffickers. If they were caught,
prosecuted and convicted, they would face lengthy prison sentences. We
know what would happen to the women, because we have signed up to the
convention that means we now have a national referral mechanism and
they would be treated as victims. But unless we have a measure such as
the one that we are proposing today, the men would walk away from that
brothel and not be held to
account.</div><a name="09021064000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
the hon. Gentleman rises to say, &#147;But surely the women have been
exploited to the point of rape,&#148; of course it would be
appropriate if the men could be prosecuted and convicted for that. In
reality the evidence is not always available, so we are left with a
situation where all the people in the three parts of the story can be
dealt with by existing law, except the men who go into that brothel,
who disregard in many cases whether the women have been trafficked or
are being controlled for gain, but nevertheless purchase sex from them.
The measure that we are proposing intends to fill that
gap.</div>
<a name="09021064000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000367"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I accept that there is a strong argument that that
gap should be filled. I just urge the Minister to remember that in our
previous debate it was suggested by those on both Opposition Front
Benches that a non-strict liability offence with objective recklessness
would actually allow him to punish the people who are guilty of
something equivalent to rape with more than a &#163;1,000 fine. That
has enormous merits, deals with all the concerns that we have just
heard around strict liability, and provides a penalty to match the
crime. That is what we urge him to
consider.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div><a name="09021064000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000368"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I have agreed to look at some of the points that
were raised on the amendments to the clause in the previous debate. We
are confident that strict liability is necessary because, as I have
explained, there is a gap that needs to be filled. The hon. Gentleman
says that he agrees with us in that regard. But there is also a very
strong deterrent message that we need to send. If someone has purchased
and used the services of a prostitute who has been controlled for gain
or, heaven forbid, has been trafficked, and that someone says that they
did not know, that is no excuse in those circumstances. We should not
have to furnish the evidence that the hon. Gentleman is looking for to
prove all the points that he raised in our previous discussions. We
need to send out a strong message to men that such behaviour is not
acceptable.</div><a name="09021064000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000369"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The principle of English law for centuries has
supposedly been that one is innocent until proven guilty. The Minister
wants to say that it is too difficult to prove people guilty, so we
will find people guilty without any evidence. Why not go the whole hog,
which is what the Government were partly considering with the Swedish
law? But even that is a halfway house. Why not just say that the
purchase of sex and the sale of sex are illegal? The Government seem to
be getting to that by a roundabout route, by saying, &#147;That is a
legal activity, but we will find you guilty even though there is no
evidence to show that the sex worker you were with was trafficked or

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000370"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> These are part of the remarks that I want to go
on to, but I shall say something about the principles of English law
that the hon. Gentleman is talking about. I want to refer to his
comments where we part company, to a large extent. I cannot understand
a system of criminal law that does not do everything that it can to
tackle the exploitation of women, or men, who are put into these
circumstances.</div>
<a name="09021064000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman got into a debate with himself, and others, around the number
of trafficked women who are brought to this country for sexual
exploitation. On the evidence that we have, most of the women who are
trafficked into the country are brought here for sexual exploitation.
He wanted to talk about numbers, but he said that his
understanding&#151;from his experiences and conversations with
organised groups, which I do not discount&#151;is that the number of
sex workers who have been trafficked are exaggerated. He referred to
the situation in Derby. It was pointed out in the evidence sessions
that many of the people we are talking about are probably working on
the streets of London, rather than in his, or my,
constituency.</div>
<a name="09021064000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
point was also made that just because a person is a foreign prostitute
does not mean that they are trafficked, and the hon. Gentleman repeated
that. This is not just about trafficked women&#151;and possibly
men&#151;it is about people who are controlled for gain. However, it
is wrong to traffic women into this country for sexual exploitation
whether the figure is 4,000 or 40,000. It is still wrong and it is
still this Parliament&#146;s obligation to do everything that it can
to protect those women. It is not the only thing that we will be doing
to tackle prostitution, but our view is that this strict liability is
appropriate and proportionate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000371"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> We fear, along with most of the organisations
working in the field and many legal organisations, that what is
proposed will end up making things worse for sex workers. The fact that
we disagree on the mechanism does not alter the fact that we agree just
as much as the Minister that anyone involved in exploiting sex workers
in this way should be punished by the full weight of the law. However,
one has to find people guilty first.</div>
<a name="09021064000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000372"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> This is a discussion that my later comments will
address. I want to make some progress on this point and I will come
back to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks if I do not answer them
directly. Part of the preparation for this measure was to visit other
countries and look at their approaches. My hon. Friend the Minister for
Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing visited the
Netherlands, where prostitution is regulated through a system of
licensed brothels. He found that that regulation had not ended violence
against prostitutes, it had not reduced trafficking and it had not
reduced the involvement of organised crime in prostitution.</div>
<a name="09021064000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review
therefore concluded that criminal justice measures were the most
effective way of protecting those involved in prostitution, who are
vulnerable to exploitation. We also considered the option of
criminalising payment for sex in all circumstances. We concluded that
that was not the right approach. Instead, we concluded that measures
should be targeted at reducing areas of the sex market involving the
most vulnerable&#151;namely those who have been trafficked, are being
exploited, or are involved in street prostitution, who are mainly
women</div><a name="09021064000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the hon. Member for Chesterfield&#146;s point about
Finland, we looked at the Finnish example. He said that he was not sure
whether there had been any prosecutions there, but I can tell him that
there have been. He then went on to make the point about the difficulty
of prosecution and quoted, several times, the police view that it would
be difficult. I accept that it will be difficult; we have never said
that it would not be difficult. I even accept that it will be very
difficult&#151;we have never said anything else. However, it does not
mean that we should not try, through this measure, to do everything
that we can just because it is difficult.</div>
<a name="09021064000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000373"></a>Nadine
Dorries:</b> Does the Minister accept that the objective of
licensing brothels in the Netherlands was not to reduce trafficking,
which is seen as an entirely separate problem? The purpose of licensing
brothels in the Netherlands was to keep a control of health care,
illness, needle use and exchange, and to get outreach programmes to the
brothels and for the Government to keep a better hold on what was
happening. It was never intended to reduce trafficking and the Minister
cannot use that as a justification for what he is
saying.</div><a name="09021064000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000374"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I did not say that that was the purpose of the
measures introduced by the Dutch. I said that their scheme has not had
an effect on those areas about which we are most concerned in this
particular measure. A strict liability provision should not preclude
our doing everything that we can to keep women safe in other regards
and to attend to their health needs. We should do everything that we
can not only to have exit strategies but to ensure that there are
resources to pay for them. I do not necessarily disagree with the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>Lady; the point that I was making is that the route that the Netherlands
has taken has not addressed the issues to which we have
given particular importance in our demand review and the measures that
we are introducing.</div>
<a name="09021064000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000375"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div>
<a name="09021064000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000376"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Let me move on, if I may. I will allow the hon.
Gentleman to intervene in a second. I want to go back to the
timeline.</div>
<a name="09021064000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">In November
2008, the review was published, with a key recommendation that a new
offence be introduced to target those who pay for sex with controlled
prostitutes. There are already offences for trafficking and controlling
prostitution for gain, but the review concluded that in
order to tackle exploitation and abuse, legislation should
go further and address the source of the problem:
the sex buyer who creates the demand for
prostitution.</div><a name="09021064000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to put it on the record for those concerned about the extent and
extant of the measure that we understand that some people freely choose
to sell sex. However, we also know that many involved in
prostitution&#151;both women and men&#151;have little choice over
their involvement and would leave prostitution if they could. Our
priority must be to protect those people, the victims of exploitation
and
abuse.</div><a name="09021064000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an issue about exit strategies. We accept that resource issues are
involved. Of course it is about having services on the ground in the
locality and working with local providers to commission services, but
we accept that there may be resource implications. I give the
commitment that we are considering them.</div>
<a name="09021064000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 13
will make it a criminal offence to make or promise payment for the
sexual services of a prostitute if any of that prostitute&#146;s
activities relating to the provision of those services are
intentionally controlled for gain by a third person. The offence will
be committed even if the sexual services are provided abroad, but the
payment or promise of payment must be made in this
country.</div><a name="09021064000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
who pay for sex choose to do so. In doing so, whether they know it or
not, they help contribute to the exploitation linked to prostitution.
It should not&#151;I repeat, it should not&#151;be an excuse to say
&#147;I didn&#146;t know the prostitute was being
controlled.&#148; Proposed new subsection (2)(b) therefore provides
that the new offence will be one of strict liability, which will mean
that a person is guilty regardless of whether they knew that a
prostitute was controlled for
gain.</div><a name="09021064000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000377"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Can I take the Minister back to the point at which
I sought to intervene? On the Dutch position, would it not be a
sensible option to have licensed brothels that are essentially legal?
That way, all the health protection work that he wants could be done,
and it could be ensured that no one was exploited or controlled for
gain under his definition. Then a strict liability offence could be
created for anyone who actively chose not to use the legalised service.
That would be another option. Has he considered it, and if so, why did
he reject it? Also&#151;I think that this is the third time that I
have asked&#151;has he consulted, formally or informally, on the new
offence?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div><a name="09021064000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000378"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We considered all the options. As part of that
consideration, we included the legalisation of prostitution and,
indeed, of brothels. However, the hon. Gentleman must accept that in
coming to a decision, we knew that people would look at our approach to
prostitution for the message that it sends out. We would be sending
mixed messages if we went down the route of legalising prostitution or
brothels.</div>
<a name="09021064000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman seems to be holding up the Dutch example as a model for us to
follow. Let me tell him that the Dutch are reviewing their legislation
in that regard. They are not content that it is doing what they want it
to do. Therefore, I would caution him against that. They are also, I
understand, looking at closing down some brothels, probably for the
reasons that I cited earlier. I intend to come back to his earlier
point.</div><a name="09021064000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me make a point about men who visit brothels, and believe or have
evidence that the prostitute is trafficked or controlled for gain, and
go on to inform the authorities. Much has been made of that, almost as
an alternative to the measure that we are bringing forward. We asked
officials in the Home Office to find some evidence, other than
anecdotal. I have talked to prostitutes who have told me that that
happens&#151;they work for an agency and the agency is told by a
client that a prostitute that they have visited did not look well, or
looked stressed out, and is asked whether there is something going on.
I do not dispute that there may be some examples of that, but it cannot
be the sole method of tackling the problem. We are talking about
relatively few in number, while we may well be talking about a
significantly higher number of people who are controlled for gain or
who might have been trafficked into this country. Those who visit
brothels can already give such information anonymously through
Crimestoppers, but actual evidence of men who have done that is
difficult to find, so it can hardly be an alternative that could tackle
the scale of the problem that we believe needs to be tackled. Although
we welcome steps to facilitate such action, it is not a real
alternative to the strict liability
clause.</div><a name="09021064000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
offence recognises that exploitation connected to prostitution goes
wider than just trafficking. &#147;Controlled&#148;, as used in
proposed new subsection (3) in clause 13, is based on the existing
offence of controlling prostitution for gain under section 53 of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003. The term will cover those who have been
forced, compelled or directed to provide sexual services for
another&#146;s gain, whether such control was exerted by people
traffickers or by others such as violent or coercive pimps. Proposed
new subsection (4) provides that the maximum penalty for this offence
is a level 3 fine, which is currently
&#163;1,000.</div><a name="09021064000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
I shall say something about enforcement, because I understand the
concerns raised. We recognise the need for the police to prioritise,
and we want them to continue disrupting the activities of those
involved in trafficking or coercing people into prostitution. In
passing, on two occasions the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
suggested that I had claimed that that would and should be a low
priority for the police. It is not my job as a Minister to tell chief
constables what their priority should be in an area. How they deploy
their resources is a matter for them. Apart from it not being up to me
to tell them, I have no recollection of giving that impression at
all.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div><a name="09021064000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021064000379"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): The Minister is on
to an important point about the discretion that chief constables should
have. For clarity, are there are any Home Office targets, statutory or
non-statutory, that are set for detection of sexual offences, including
the new offence in the
Bill?</div><a name="09021064000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000380"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows that we are moving away
from a targeted approach, apart from with the confidence that people
have in their local police. If he is asking how that refers to the
targets that we would have now, and what would be intended, may I come
back to him? He raised an important point, but the general point
concerns the ability of chief police officers to decide on the
priorities in their areas. Nevertheless, if that is the law, it is the
law.</div><a name="09021064000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that it is right that the offence is used to punish those who
paid for sex with someone controlled for gain and that it will send a
deterrent message to others that may potentially do so. We shall work
with the Association of Chief Police Officers to ensure that the
offence is enforced and implemented as effectively as possible, and
that it is used in a way that most effectively targets those who take
advantage of the most vulnerable persons involved in
prostitution.</div><a name="09021064000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
I want to mention another point of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon from our deliberations on Thursday, about making matters worse
and the potential for blackmail. He raised a serious point, but people
who use prostitutes currently risk blackmail in some instances. Using
prostitutes is not something that a significant section of the
population would regard as acceptable or appropriate. I take into
account his point about a new offence, but I do not think that it would
dramatically increase the opportunity for blackmailers to become
involved. However, there is always potential for that when punters use
prostitutes.</div>
<a name="09021064000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09021064000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire about education is
an important one: whether the offence would be drawn to the attention
of punters, and the need for education and awareness campaigns. The
campaign to raise awareness among potential sex buyers of the extent
and nature of trafficking is a specific recommendation in the tackling
the demand for prostitution review, which will support the coming into
force of the new offence in the Bill, so I can assure her that we will
be doing everything that we can&#151;although there may be some who
would plough on regardless, and would not be deterred even if we
furnish them with the
evidence.</div><a name="09021064000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady, together with a number of other people, also raised the
question of whether the clause will make matters worse by driving
prostitution further underground. Our priority is to protect the most
vulnerable people involved in prostitution, who are already the victims
of offences such as being controlled for gain or trafficked. Those
responsible for controlling the people will already be taking steps to
ensure that they will be beyond the reach of the law. That makes it
difficult to prosecute, but as I have said, being difficult does not
mean that we should not do it. We are talking about some of the most
vulnerable people, exploited in some of the most horrible ways in some
of the darkest places. I cannot see how the strict liability clause
will make that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>situation worse; in fact, I can see ways in which the clause will
improve it. So driving prostitution further underground is not an
intention, and we do not believe that that will be an effect.</div>
<a name="09021064000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
earlier deliberations, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
raised concerns about women&#146;s safety. Improving the safety of
those involved in prostitution&#151;voluntarily or
otherwise&#151;is fundamental to what we are trying to do. By
reducing the demand for prostitutes who are controlled for gain, we are
aiming to improve the safety of all prostitutes. But in the present
context, it is important to reiterate that the development of the
measures tackling demand is part of a broader strategy, which sets a
comprehensive approach to  dealing with the problems associated
with prostitution,  including measures to improve the safety of
those involved  in
that.</div><a name="09021064000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prosecutions
are already brought against those controlling prostitutes for gain, and
in such cases, the police would be able to bring charges against those
who have been found to have paid for sex with prostitutes who, at the
time, were being controlled. It is right that the law should be
extended to ensure that those who play their part in sexual
exploitation&#151;by contributing to the demand&#151;face criminal
sanctions.</div><a name="09021064000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
one would expect, I have discussed at length the Bill and the whole
process that has been undertaken to get us to this point with the
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, and we
are of one mind on the matter. I pay tribute to him for the way that,
having started the process, he has pursued the matter and brought it to
the present stage; nobody has done more than him in that
regard.</div><a name="09021064000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure is important, and people will look back on it as a major
stepping stone in social reform. From my previous experience as a Whip,
I know that sometimes it is difficult to get Members to serve on
Committees because they have to spend time on other things.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am delighted to hear the hon.
Member for West Chelmsford, the Opposition Whip, say that he had no
trouble in doing that. I am not talking about this particular Bill, but
about others, and Bills in general, that are less interesting and
important than the one that we are dealing
with.</div><a name="09021064000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have served on a number of Public Bill Committees, and sometimes it is
a case of getting through a Bill and seeing what effect it will have
out there, but in one&#146;s own mind, some Bills may seem more
important than others. I cannot remember working on a Bill that is more
important than this one. People who are serving on this Committee will
look back on the measure in the future, when strict liability is
working, when we would have reduced the demand for prostitution, helped
women out of prostitution and helped to tackle some of the worst
examples of exploitation and trafficking, and be proud of the work that
they have done on the
Bill.</div><a name="09021064000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will not always agree&#151;we do not agree on clause 13, in some
cases&#151;but I think that time will show that the measure is
extraordinarily important. The exploitation linked to prostitution,
which it is designed to end, destroys lives and should not be
tolerated. The clause is meant to protect the victims of prostitution,
but it will do something else. It is meant to send out a clear message
to those who would pay for sex with someone controlled for gain that
they will be held accountable for their actions. That is what it is
about: holding people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>accountable for their actions who play a part in the vile exploitation
of some of the most vulnerable women. That is why I hope that hon.
Members will support clause 13. I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

themselves.</div><a name="09021064000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have given some thought to this matter in the past and
indicated a willingness to look at it. I hope that shall I preserve the
opportunity for the House as a whole to debate this important issue if
I limit my remarks and provide the Government with an opportunity to
explain why they feel that this is not the right time to discuss it in
Committee.</div><a name="09021064000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000395"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
short introduction. I understand his motives, and I hope that my
remarks will satisfy him on why we are pursuing this
route.</div><a name="09021064000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 would amend the offence of loitering or soliciting for the purposes
of prostitution to exclude those under the age of 18. I find more
consensus with the hon. Gentleman on this matter than I did when we
discussed the previous clause, and I assure him that we share his
concerns about the issue, although I suspect not his route through
it.</div><a name="09021064000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that children who become involved in prostitution are victims
of a sexual offence and should be offered appropriate support. We do
not want children in those circumstances being subject to punitive
criminal sanctions. That view is reflected in the &#147;Safeguarding
Children in Prostitution&#148; guidance issued in 2000. Since the
publication of that guidance, the number of people under 18 who have
been arrested and prosecuted for that offence has been very low. In
practice, the offence is rarely used in relation to those under 18,
which we believe is right. For the Committee&#146;s information, that
guidance will be updated specifically on this issue and published in
spring.</div>
<a name="09021064000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">This issue
has been debated previously by Parliament, most recently during the
passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. During those
considerations, we outlined our concerns about the potential impact of
a change to remove under-18s from the scope of the offence. Those
concerns remain. By decriminalising under-18s, we risk sending out a
message that although we do not think it acceptable for adults to be
involved in street prostitution, we somehow accept that children can
be. We recognise that in the overwhelming majority of cases children
involved in prostitution should be treated solely as victims. Guidance
from agencies makes that clear, and that is consistent with the policy
of the Association of Chief Police Officers, which supports the
retention of this power.</div>
<a name="09021064000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;this
is the nub of our argument&#151;there might be exceptional cases
where criminal justice intervention is necessary to prevent a harmful
situation and allow a child to access support. That is why we want to
retain the ability for criminal justice agencies to intervene as a very
last resort. Where other agencies fail to engage with young people who,
for whatever reason, spurn offers of support and protection, the
criminal justice system enables us to remove those young people from
the street and any immediate danger. That intervention might make a
difference. I acknowledge the concerns of the hon. Gentleman and
others, but I assure all hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>Members that our overwhelming priority is supporting rather than
prosecuting children who are involved in
prostitution.</div><a name="09021064000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates
the reasons for that and will withdraw it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000396"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I
would be interested to know under what circumstances the Government
could not ensure that the victims of this essentially non-consenting
offence and exploitation of children were helped other than by being
arrested or engaged by the criminal justice system, as he put
it.</div><a name="09021064000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister give me a scenario where the support for
children&#151;whether that involves social services or exit
strategies&#151;is so inadequate that we have to rely on the
criminalisation of those victims? Will he write to me and set that out
so that I can consider the position further? If he cannot do that, he
has not addressed the main concern and the obverse effect by which
children may be deterred from coming forward for fear of prosecution
under this or other prostitution offences, thanks to the message sent
out by this law.</div>
<a name="09021064000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
reflect on what the Minister has said, because it might be appropriate
to table a similar amendment so that the House can take a view on it. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000398"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 246, in clause 15, page 14,
line 31, leave out &#145;two&#146; and insert
&#145;three&#146;.</div><a name="09021064000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000399"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Amendments 19, 20 and 22 were tabled to tease out
the Minister&#146;s thinking on the offence of persistently loitering
for the purposes of prostitution. The clause will amend existing law so
that the offence is committed only if there is loitering twice or more
in a three-month period. On what evidential basis was the provision
&#147;twice or more&#148; in a three-month period arrived
at?</div><a name="09021064000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000400"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the
proposals tabled by me and by my hon. Friend the Member for
Chesterfield. I shall cover the whole principle of criminalising the
selling of sex and loitering in the clause stand part debate. Why do
the Government consider that such a change would make persistence a
higher threshold? The clause says that the conduct will be persistent
if it takes place
on</div><a name="09021064000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;two
or more occasions in any period of three months&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div><a name="09021064000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
if the policing is such that people are arrested for the offence rather
than cautioned or warned in respect of an offence that is more frequent
and more persistent than that, the Government are making the threshold
less persistent whereas the intention is to make it more
persistent.</div><a name="09021064000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments are probing. Given current police practice, on what basis do
the Government think, if they do, that this will raise the threshold to
ensure that those who are loitering are not arrested, sent through the
criminal justice system and fined&#151;thus, forcing them to work
again to pay the fine&#151;and not brought before the courts more
frequently or at a lower
threshold?</div><a name="09021064000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000401"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Amendments 19 to 22 would remove the elements of
the clause that amend the offence of loitering or soliciting for the
purposes of prostitution contrary to section 1 of the Street Offences
Act 1959 to require a person to act persistently before an offence has
been committed. Members of the Committee will be aware that clause 15
also removes the stigmatising term &#147;common prostitute&#148;
from legislation, and I have noted the wide consensus for that
approach.</div>
<a name="09021064000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that, by removing that term, the Bill does not have the
intended effect of allowing police to arrest those involved in street
prostitution without having to establish an element of persistence that
is implied by the term &#147;common&#148;. I shall refer to current
police practice, because it is the answer to the question asked by the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. The current practice of all police
forces in England and Wales is to issue non-statutory
prostitutes&#146; cautions to people caught loitering on two
occasions before charging them with an offence. That cautioning process
is used to establish that a person is a common prostitute. Once the
term is removed from the legislation, the need to prove persistency is
required to ensure that that current practice
continues.</div><a name="09021064000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that criminal justice interventions are sometimes necessary
for those involved in prostitution, but I reiterate that they should be
a last resort. The requirement for a person to act persistently before
an offence is committed provides a vital number of opportunities for
engagement with services that can offer support and help them to find a
route
out.</div><a name="09021064000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
246 and 247, tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon,
recognise the need for a requirement of persistence, but would define
&#147;persistently&#148; as three or more occasions in one year,
rather than as two or more occasions in three months. The definition of
two or more occasions in three months is much more in line with current
police
practice.</div><a name="09021064000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s definition appears to be to ensure
that the offence of loitering or soliciting is used against people
involved in street prostitution on a relatively long-term basis by
providing that persons would have to be apprehended by police on more
occasions but over a longer period. However, it would not necessarily
cover what we regard as persistent behaviour, or what the police
currently consider persistent in practice. The suggested definition
would not prevent the offence of loitering or soliciting from being
used against people found to be involved in street prostitution on a
daily basis, for example. In that, it is similar in effect to the
definition in clause 15.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div><a name="09021064000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike the
current definition, however, that proposed by amendments 246 and 247
would allow the offence to be used against those who became involved in
prostitution intermittently over a period. The hon. Gentleman asked for
scenarios earlier, so here is a scenario involving an offence being
used against a person found loitering or soliciting on single occasions
in February, June and December in one year. His definition would
capture such practice; ours would
not.</div><a name="09021064000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments could be used more
easily against those who sought to leave prostitution but were forced
back into it intermittently as a result of circumstances. It could
undermine the primarily rehabilitative aim that underpins the current
police approach, and that advocated by the co-ordinated prostitution
strategy, of using this offence as a last resort. That is reflected in
the relatively low number of
prosecutions.</div><a name="09021064000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring
the prostitute to be found loitering or soliciting on three occasions
would also prevent earlier intervention where appropriate. We
recognise, however, that people will have different views on what
counts as persistence, although we believe that our line is clear,
defensible and in line with current practice. The term
&#147;persistently&#148;, as currently defined, is vital to
ensuring that the offence is aimed at those who are genuinely
persistent, and we do not, therefore, wish to remove it by accepting
amendment 19, or to alter the definition by accepting amendments 246
and
247.</div><a name="09021064000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the same reasons, we do not wish to accept amendments 20 and 22, which
would remove provisions that set out how &#147;persistently&#148;
is defined and thereby help to ensure a consistent approach to policing
the offence. With those comments, I ask for the amendment to be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09021064000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000402"></a>James

Brokenshire</b><b class="B">:</b> I beg to move amendment 21, in
clause 15, page 14, line 37, leave
out subsection
(4).</div><a name="09021064000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment. Subsection (4) omits section 2 of the Street
Offences Act 1959, which provides a mechanism whereby someone in
receipt of a caution for loitering or soliciting can apply to the court
to have it overturned. By tabling the amendment, which would delete the
subsection, we seek to understand the reasons for its inclusion in the
Bill, because the provision provides for the caution to be overturned
by application to the magistrates court. The subsection may be a
tidying-up exercise, involving a throwback to the arrangements whereby
cautions were not necessarily considered to have been spent under the
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Substantively, therefore, the
subsection may simply be technical, but it is still somewhat unclear to
us what the Government propose. Therefore, amendment 21 was
tabled to understand more clearly their intentions and whether the
subsection&#146;s retention is
appropriate.</div><a name="09021064000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000404"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The short answer is that it is a tidying-up
exercise. Amendment 21 would have the effect of maintaining section 2
of the 1959 Act, which allows a person cautioned for loitering or
soliciting to apply to  a magistrates court to have the caution
removed from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>the police record. The reality is that that section has fallen into
disuse and in our view no longer serves a useful purpose. A formal
caution can be imposed only if the offender admits their guilt. If not,
they can go to court where the prosecution has to prove the offence
beyond reasonable doubt. We therefore conclude that there are
sufficient safeguards in the process to ensure that formal cautions
will not be wrongly given, and therefore there is no need to retain
section 2, which is not used in practice in any event. I understand the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern about removing it, but I hope that he
understands the reason why and can withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09021064000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000405"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On the basis of the Minister&#146;s
assurances, I seek leave to withdraw the

<a name="09021064000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div>
<a name="09021064000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000406"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The stand-part debate gives us an opportunity to
discuss the way the clause deals with the criminalisation of women who
are loitering on the street for the purposes of prostitution, and how
it essentially criminalises street prostitution and the women involved
in it. We have an opportunity to examine to what extent the Government
considered other approaches when thinking about reforming prostitution
laws.</div><a name="09021064000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think we established, although I did not get an answer to my question
on the three occasions that I asked it, that there has been no formal
consultation on any of the proposals, certainly not the clause 13
offence. I do not recall the Government in a formal consultation asking
for opinions on whether prostitution should continue to be criminalised
in this way. I invite the Committee to consider the argument that more
public policy aims can be achieved by not criminalising the women who
are engaged in prostitution. One can control it better, protect women
better, and ensure that their health and safety is improved. All that
can be done without increasing the demand for prostitution, and without
increasing demand for the prostitution that involves women who are
trafficked and controlled for gain, which is at the abusive and
unacceptable end of the spectrum, as we discussed
previously.</div><a name="09021064000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with the clause is the absence of proper efforts to give women
on the street ways out of prostitution, and the inadequate resources. I
think the Minister accepted that when he said that there are
&#147;resource issues&#148;, which is a phrase that we all use.
Criminalising women drives them more into prostitution and further away
from other options, even though the intention may be to protect
them.</div><a name="09021064000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is widespread support for ensuring that it is pimps and traffickers who
are criminalised and not the women, whether the women are freely
consenting to participate in the sex industry or are not consenting and
are themselves exploited. The clause essentially maintains the status
quo by criminalising women. One could argue that it would be
appropriate if there were a properly funded and effective way of
helping women to get out of prostitution and to treat their drug
problems, and establishing why they are in prostitution in the first
place. However, that does not exist in this country and there has been
no co-ordinated effort by the Government properly to fund charities and
other bodies to go about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>this work. There are the occasional sex projects, but a massive
expansion is needed if there is to be any balanced policy here. It is
not balanced at the moment, so what clause 15 seeks to maintain will
have side
effects.</div><a name="09021064000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09021064000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a letter that I believe we all
received, as it was addressed to our co-Chairman, Sir Nicholas, and
copied to the Committee. It is from Tim Barnett, the Member of
Parliament responsible for decriminalisation in New Zealand, and it
says, essentially, that we should not pass measures such as clause 15,
and section 1 of the 1959 Act that it amends and maintains. He gives
several arguments why the approach that New Zealand took, which was to
use legislation like clause 15 to decriminalise, rather than
criminalise the women, is effective. His argument, which I have not
heard argued against effectively, is that</div>
<a name="09021064000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prostitution is
inevitable and that no country has succeeded in legislating or policing
it out of
existence.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
accepts that some argue its removal was achieved in China under the Red
Guard and Afghanistan under the Taliban, but he argues, as do I, that
neither of those are particularly helpful precedents, even with the
most right-wing Home Secretaries of either Conservative party that we
are inflicted with. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am
joking&#151;I do not want to antagonise the Committee. The Government
cannot properly say that clause 15 and the other measures will get rid
of prostitution. The question is, therefore, what is the best way of
tackling the problems associated with prostitution and protecting
women?</div><a name="09021064000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tim
Barnett goes on to point out that the tangible harms associated with
prostitution that we all accept, including unsafe sex, coercion of
people, trafficking, violence by clients and pimps, drug use, and
offensive signage, are all offences under the current law, so we do not
need a separate prostitution law.</div>
<a name="09021064000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
point he makes is that the people most likely to be damaged by
prostitution in a criminalised environment are the sex workers
themselves. That is the view of sex workers. I have not met a sex
worker&#151;I have met several during the deliberations of the
Committee&#151;who supports their criminalisation. Whatever their
view on the control of prostitution by pimps and traffickers, or on the
strict liability offence that we have just discussed, none of them
think that they are helped by their activities being criminalised
because it drives them further from the police. It inherently makes
women on the street more unsafe if their activities are criminalised
because a barrier is put between them and the law enforcement agencies,
which might protect them from abuse by clients or pimps.</div>
<a name="09021064000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">He also makes
the point that the criminalisation of prostitution places
responsibility on the police to enforce the law and takes
responsibility away from other agencies who should have an interest.
That is an entirely unsatisfactory way of dealing with the harms
associated with prostitution. The criminal justice system directed
against women, as clause 15 continues to allow, is the wrong way to
tackle the harms associated with prostitution.</div>
<a name="09021064000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that the hon. Member for Stourbridge asserted that she had heard an
opinion that the New Zealand system does not work well. I shall give
her the opportunity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>to intervene in a moment. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and to
think that the policy in this country is wrong, which she will agree
with. However, weight has to be given to the parliamentarians who
introduced the measure and the fact that they have a proper review
system built into their legislation.</div>

Waltho:</b> The hon. Gentleman refers to the New Zealand
example and the legislation, which is interesting and relevant.
However, the evidence&#151;or opinions&#151;that I referred to
earlier from Debbie Baker, stated that after five years of
decriminalisation</div>
<a name="09021064000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it hasn't
really made a difference to the average girl out on the street, except
there is more competition and the prices have gone down. Girls are
working longer and harder and taking more risks to get a job, they
aren't really checking out their
clients.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, research by Melissa Farley in San Francisco shows that
research does not stop the violence, abuse and stigma built into
prostitution, and that it has increased dramatically in New Zealand
since decriminalisation. Street prostitution has increased by 200 to
400 per cent. in Auckland alone. That is evidence rather than
opinion.</div><a name="09021064000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000408"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000409"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is clearly opinion. What elevates opinion to
the level of evidence is a moot point, but what helps is that it is
public. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The Minister for Security,
Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing says, &#147;It depends whether
you agree with it.&#148; Sadly, that is the approach often taken. I
was about to say how the matter is dealt with in academia. I do not
claim to be an expert on academia or this area of it, but I think that
there is a separate way of analysing it.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> As he says, the Minister was
speaking in jest. It was
funny.</div><a name="09021064000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000410"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> We have heard the opinion that violence in New
Zealand has increased in the five years since decriminalisation, but in
a five-year review published in June last year, the New Zealand
Government concluded that there had been no increase in prostitution
and that women were now more able to report violence. The
Government&#146;s review was overwhelmingly positive, saying that
five years of decriminalisation had worked to improve conditions for
sex
workers.</div><a name="09021064000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000411"></a>Dr.

hon. Lady. This is an important debate.</div>
<a name="09021064000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us deal
first with the question of opinion versus evidence. Everyone is
entitled to their opinion, and weight of opinion can be important, but
on a question of fact and whether intervention A causes outcome B, the
ideal is to have a properly designed study. That is difficult on this
subject. I suppose that New Zealand could run trials where the law
changed on the north island but not the south island, but it chose not
to.</div><a name="09021064000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the absence of a controlled trial, one must do what one can with
outcomes. However, what one must do in order for opinion to be more
helpfully considered as good evidence rather than simply a submission
is say at the outset, &#147;These are the outcomes that we&#146;re
concerned about. These are the outcomes, at the outset, that
we&#146;re going to measure. We&#146;re not going to decide
retrospectively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>what the baselines were when and what particular issues we&#146;ll
measure. This is how we&#146;re going to measure them, and this is
how we&#146;re going to do the review. The review is going to be
organised with clear terms of reference. It&#146;s going to engage a
wide range of pre-existing opinion and expertise. It&#146;s going to
have an external stakeholder group to check that it&#146;s not
getting carried away internally, and it&#146;s going to publish its
findings so that they can be criticised and debated by other academics
or people with contrary
opinions.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is what New Zealand did in its five-year review, coming up with the
conclusions that my hon. Friend cited. With great respect to the hon.
Lady, simply quoting two people who disagree with the policy is in no
way a match for a Government-organised review that considered
independent advice and evidence, used predetermined outcome measures
and carefully measured the
outcomes.</div><a name="09021064000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000412"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> The hon. Gentleman refers to my comments as
opinions. In one instance, I might agree. However, I also cited
research. The research by Melissa Farley to which I referred draws
attention to the New Zealand prostitution review committee, which
stated that street prostitution in Auckland more than doubled in just
one year, 2006-07. That is not opinion; it is
fact.</div>
<a name="09021064000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000413"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So then we come to another issue. Are assertions
of figures and findings facts? If the hon. Lady remembers the debates
in the House about scientific matters and the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Bill, during which we were on the same side, she will recall
that facts and figures were displayed by all and sundry. In such
circumstances, all that one can do is look at where the figures were
published and analyse whether they are a fair statement.</div>
<a name="09021064000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">One also must
analyse if it is the right outcome measure, to determine if we want to
reduce street prostitution per se&#151;I do not accept that the hon.
Lady&#146;s figures are valid, but let us say that they are&#151;or
if we want to reduce harm. So, if we had a scenario where the number of
attacks on women was reduced to a tenth of the original figure but the
number of women engaged in street prostitution doubled, clearly the
outcome measure that the hon. Lady is concerned about is harm to women
and not the number of women in the industry.</div>
<a name="09021064000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
stressed the importance at the beginning of recognising the right
outcome measure. Otherwise, one might find oneself in a situation where
one says, &#147;Yes, it&#146;s great, we&#146;ve halved the
number of women in street prostitution by our policy,&#148; which
might be the consequence of clause 15 and the amended section 1 of the
Street Offences Act 1959, but we have quadrupled the amount of risk
that those women face. I am sure that the hon. Lady would not want that
situation to result.</div>
<a name="09021064000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000414"></a>Nadine
Dorries:</b> I imagine that it would be almost impossible to
evaluate the number of women working in prostitution until there is
legalisation or licensing of brothels, because most of those women may
have been working underground or in indoor situations and it would be
the legalisation that brought them out into the streets. So it would be
almost impossible to say that figures have doubled if one had no idea
how to quantify the previous figure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div><a name="09021064000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000415"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Certainly there is an issue about identifying the
baseline. However, street prostitution, even when it is unlawful, can
be counted by census, because it is on the street and outreach workers
can establish the number of women involved, usually by judging the
distance between women on the streets where prostitution happens.
Clearly, if an activity is decriminalised, it becomes more observable,
but the purpose of decriminalisation is obviously not to hide away that
activity even more, nor is it necessarily to reduce the number of women
involved;  it is to reduce the harm. That is why I want to ask
the Minister, when he responds to this debate, if the aim of his policy
is to reduce the amount of prostitution or if it is specifically to
reduce the amount of abusive prostitution and/or to reduce the harm,
including forms of harm other than abusive prostitution, associated
with this problem.</div>
<a name="09021064000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have set
out why the New Zealand system is a sensible one for the Government to
have considered and even to have consulted on. I have also set out why
I am satisfied that the review that the New Zealand Government
published, which was comprehensive and which was not criticised by our
Government for its accuracy or impact, is the way forward.</div>
<a name="09021064000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me back to the point that I raised several times in one of our previous
debates. It is that the Government, in order to justify their position,
should first consult on their proposals, and if they were going to
conduct prostitution law reform they might have consulted relevant
groups to find out their views. Furthermore, if the Government were
going to review the evidence, which they claim to have done, they must
publish that review. Otherwise it is an alleged opinion or conclusion
of a review of the published evidence and we are not allowed or able to
comment on it, nor are other academics allowed to criticise it or to
express support for it. In the absence of a published review, all we
can see is that the Government, in this clause and in other clauses,
are taking an approach that cannot be said to be evidence-based;
indeed, it could be said to be
evidence-free.</div>
<a name="09021064000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000416"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise briefly to make some general comments
about clause 15. I hear and note the points made by the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon, along with some of the facts, evidence,
opinion and possible supposition that he has put forward. However,
considering whether or not we should make a significant change to
legalise the arrangements for street prostitution would take a
significant weight of evidence, persuasion and validation. Although the
points that he has made are interesting, I for one am not convinced to
take that step in the future, based on what I have heard thus far,
although I respect the points that he has made and put on the
record.</div>
<a name="09021064000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09021064000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some questions for the Minister about the operation of the clause.
Based on what the Minister said in his previous debate on some of the
amendments, I understand that the substance of the clause is to
regularise the law by deleting the term &#147;common
prostitute&#148;. &#147;Persistent&#148; being on two or more
occasions is, in many regards, a reflection of what the common law is
at the moment when seeking to define a &#147;common
prostitute&#148; for the purpose of the events.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div><a name="09021064000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could the
Minister confirm what the arrangements are, and would be moving
forward, for recording warnings given to someone found to be loitering
or soliciting? Would the recording be at a local level or on the police
national computer? Where are the records kept? In other words, is the
focus and intention of the clause very much localised, rather than in a
police force area or crossing police force boundaries, and therefore
dependent on local intelligence, with the knowledge of local community
officers or local police officers about whether someone has been acting
&#147;persistently&#148;&#151;on two or more
occasions&#151;triggering the offence? Or, is the intention that the
clause should be more wide ranging, perhaps necessitating a more formal
recording of those warnings given to test whether there has been an
offence in those
circumstances?</div><a name="09021064000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could
the Minister give some indication about what guidance or advice is
given to police officers concerning a first occasion? That is, the
first time that someone is found to be soliciting in a particular
location or loitering for the purposes of prostitution. As many have
said in Committee, there is a need to consider other
issues&#151;addiction, mental health, the potential risk of
trafficking. Therefore, what inquiries are made by police officers on
that first occasion? I hope that they do not simply move someone away,
cautioning them on that first occasion without further investigation or
consideration. That would not necessarily follow through on some of the
substantive problems and issues that might
arise.</div><a name="09021064000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
criminal justice approach may be appropriate&#151;I recognise that,
and the proposed amendments simply reflect the existing law&#151;but
so is a better understanding of the interventions available. The
reliance on the criminal justice system may not be necessary. Various
factors may be picked up at the earlier stage, to signpost people for
assistance and prevent an offence from occurring. Therefore, in the
context of considering the clause, it would be helpful to get from the
Minister a better understanding of current practice and whether ACPO or
the Home Office intend to provide any further guidance, revised and
updated, in connection with the operation of the clause and the new
offence, albeit that they reflect existing law and practice and the
common law definitions alluded to by the Minister
earlier.</div><a name="09021064000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000417"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I shall respond first to the points raised in
our discussion. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked
what is the purpose of the measure: to end prostitution or to end harm
to prostitutes? Its purpose is to reduce demand, particularly for
prostitutes who are controlled for gain and those who are trafficked.
It follows logically that the ambition must be to reduce the number of
such prostitutes and, globally, the number of women involved in
prostitution. It is not a choice between the aims of reducing
prostitution or of reducing harm, because they are two sides of the
same coin. We disagree, however&#151;I suspect fairly
fundamentally&#151;on whether the criminal justice system should have
a significant, or any, part in that
process.</div><a name="09021064000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked again about the publication of evidence. The
clause 15 measures come not from the demand review, but from the
prosecution strategy, which was subject to full consultation and
considered a range of published research. The strategy was published in
January 2006.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div><a name="09021064000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made a number of points about criminalising women and what
the effect of the measure would be in that respect. Again I point out
that the intention is not to criminalise women. At every stage of the
process, including the process that I shall describe in my remarks
about how the provision will work, we seek to give women the advice and
support that they need to get out of prostitution. However, they
sometimes resist so-called &#147;tough love&#148; and other forms
of intervention, and have to be gently pushed out of prostitution,
encouraged to leave, or even coerced a little. They need a framework
that will give them every opportunity to leave prostitution, but, if
criminal justice intervention helps to focus minds and support and to
get them into the right place, we believe that such measures are right.
It is not a question of criminalising for its own sake; it is nothing
more than using the criminal justice system as a last resort. For some
women&#151;perhaps those who are the most
damaged, live the most chaotic lives and have found themselves in
prostitution in terrible circumstances&#151;it may be necessary to
use the measures under discussion.</div>
<a name="09021064000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
introduce two other points that the hon. Gentleman did not mention. We
are talking about one of the riskiest forms of prostitution, and it is
not enough to say that women need to be given just the freedom of
choice; we need to do everything we can to give them the evidence, the
information and the support they need to make the choice to leave
prostitution, which many prostitutes tell us they would prefer to do,
because they do not want to live in such circumstances. Another reason
why we think that the criminal justice system may have a part to play
in some situations is that these women cannot act with impunity: they
cause a nuisance and create concern in local communities, so the
community has a right to expect that, if they have been given every
opportunity to leave prostitution, they will be gently pushed in that
direction.</div>
<a name="09021064000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
is that, if such a situation arose in my constituency and we wanted
these measures to have an effect, not many of my constituents who came
to complain would ask, &#147;How does academia regard this issue? Has
this been tested? Have we been able to challenge this? Which bits of
evidence have you actually used to frame this measure?&#148; We have
to get real in this argument. I do not dispute the need for an
evidence-based approach when we make public policy; on the contrary, I
have gone out of my way to point out that that is what we have
attempted to do and, I believe, succeeded in doing. But we want the
measure to have a realistic and practical effect, and that is not a
situation wherein academia can hold sway, however important we regard
the advice that we take to be.</div>
<a name="09021064000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000418"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> We need only think of Ipswich to recognise an
important question that needs to be considered: what policies make the
lives of women in that situation safer? Given that we are talking about
sometimes life-or-death situations, it is important to bring academic
evidence to bear. In my opinion, what makes the women safer is that,
first, there are well funded exit strategies for them; and, secondly,
that we do not force them into more dark, dangerous and isolated places
if at all possible, while recognising the balance that must be struck
regarding nuisance. Simply to say that a community wants prostitution
out of the way&#151;in a wood, for example, where women 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>are at far more risk&#151;is not the right approach. The problem is
multi-faceted. I hope that the Minister recognises
that.</div>
<a name="09021064000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000419"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That is precisely what the Government are doing
by introducing these measures. The hon. Gentleman is taking us back to
a debate about either/or, but in our view it is not a question of
either/or. We need to put in place the right measures to hold
accountable for their actions not only men but, if necessary,
prostitutes, and to push them towards the support that many of them
tell us they want and need. They are not necessarily the sort of people
who would arrive at that conclusion very early in the
process.</div>
<a name="09021064000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a
matter of just using the criminal law and not having in place the
measures that the hon. Gentleman is talking about. I repeat for the
record that we accept that there have to be exit strategies. That is
the reality of much of the work being done now, which we want to
extend. The implication of having those exit strategies is that women
need to be informed but they might also need, in some circumstances, to
be pushed towards making those choices; that might be where the
criminal justice system has a part to play. I have accepted that there
are resource issues and that it is important that we have proper local
services that are properly resourced. We are currently considering what
other resource implications there might be. My final plea is that
people should not go away thinking that this is either/or matter,
because it is
not.</div><a name="09021064000222"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000420"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> May I give my hon. Friend an example that supports
his case? There is a young girl in Northampton whom I have met several
times; she comes from a well-to-do family, but she got involved in
drugs and became a prostitute, and she has been sleeping in a garage.
She is lovely girl, but she has had a rough time. Innumerable efforts
have been made to help her, but however much people try to help, she
keeps slipping back to drugs and prostitution. The bottom line is that
there are public nuisance issues and that other offences are being
caused. Much though society has tried to help her, it also has an
obligation to protect itself and others who might be affected by her
behaviour. My hon. Friend is right to say that there has to be a carrot
and stick
approach.</div><a name="09021064000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000421"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful for that example, which
illustrates the point very well. We have to consider the practical
effects of the measures in our constituencies and across our country.
My hon. Friend has provided a very good
example.</div>
<a name="09021064000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000422"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> We must also consider any unintended
consequences. The New Zealand review picked up on the fact that
decriminalisation led to the spread of prostitution into residential
areas. That is a growing and significant problem in New Zealand. Our
aim is to address such problems better in the Bill. We also know from
the experience in Amsterdam that many women are being trafficked there
specifically for the sex industry, so that is another unintended
consequence of decriminalisation. It is not as straightforward as the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon suggests.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div><a name="09021064000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000423"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for providing
not only words of wisdom, but practical advice on the lessons that we
can learn. Her point illustrates the importance of looking at what is
happening in other countries and how they are tackling the problem. We
can learn lessons from their experiences without necessarily following
the routes that they have
chosen.</div><a name="09021064000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause amends the offence of loitering or soliciting for the purpose of
prostitution, as set out in section 1 of the Street Offences Act 1959.
It removes the term &#147;common prostitute&#148;, as I have said,
and requires that a person has acted &#147;persistently&#148;
before an offence is committed. That reflects current police practice
to arrest a person for the offence only if he or she has been cautioned
on at least two previous occasions, or has been convicted of the
offence.</div>
<a name="09021064000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09021064000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s co-ordinated prostitution strategy, which was
published in January 2006 following extensive public consultation,
signalled our intention to make these changes. The measures were
included in the Bill that became the Criminal Justice and Immigration
Act 2008, but had to be withdrawn due to time pressure. We
made it clear then that we would reintroduce them at the earliest
opportunity. Perhaps the only area of unanimity&#151;at least there
was one&#151;was support for removal of the term &#147;common
prostitute&#148; from the statute, as it is outdated and offensive.
The clause therefore removes the
term.</div><a name="09021064000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also inserts the word &#147;persistently&#148; so that an
offence will now be committed by</div>
<a name="09021064000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person who
persistently loiters or solicits in a street or public place for the
purpose of
prostitution&#148;,</div><a name="09021064000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
there are better ways of dealing those who are apprehended only once.
Persistence is defined as conduct
that</div><a name="09021064000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;takes
place on two or more occasions in any period of three
months&#148;.</div><a name="09021064000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
saying that the process we are seeking to introduce is in line with
current practice, the hon. Member for Hornchurch asked what currently
happens on the ground. The truthful answer is that it varies from one
area to another. In some instances, police officers approach
prostitutes and bring to their attention what they believe is
happening; they may also offer them advice and guidance. They might
proceed to a prostitute&#146;s caution in the first instance, but in
reality that might not happen at that early stage. Practice varies
across the country, but there is good practice, and the purpose of the
proposal is to extend that good practice. We are working with ACPO on
proposals to ensure that there is consistency across the country, based
on what works. I hope that I have explained that
point.</div><a name="09021064000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked how warnings will be monitored and the information
kept. We regard this as a local matter, although not exclusively. We
expect prostitutes to be well known to the police in the area, so it is
not a question of looking to a national system. The matter is best
addressed locally and that is how we will
proceed.</div><a name="09021064000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prosecution
of the offence currently relies on the identification of the offender
as a common prostitute. As I said, the practice of all police forces is
to use a non-statutory prostitute&#146;s caution to demonstrate that
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>person is a common prostitute. Offenders are not prosecuted until at
least two prostitute&#146;s cautions have been given and witnessed.
The caution is not a formal prerequisite of conviction, but it has
become the method by which evidence is adduced to prove that an
individual charged for the first time is a common prostitute. That
generally takes the form of a brief administrative process, during
which it will be recorded that two police officers have witnessed the
individual loitering or soliciting for the purposes of prostitution.
The prostitute&#146;s caution differs from a statutory caution in
that it does not require an admission of guilt. That practice will
continue to be used to prove that conduct has taken place on two or
more occasions in any three-month
period.</div><a name="09021064000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
forms of support may be in place for women seeking to leave
prostitution. As well as establishing persistence, the cautioning
process provides an opportunity to direct the individual to services
that can offer them support to address the problems that have led them
into prostitution and to help them to find a route out. That is not a
new approach. It was set out in the original Home Office circular
issued in 1959 that was sent to police. Although the language of that
circular is somewhat archaic, the welfare approach remains valid. With
increasing partnership between the police and voluntary organisations
providing support to those involved in prostitution encouraged by the
strategy, there will be more opportunity for the police to provide
access to such support to good effect. As I said, we are working with
ACPO on that
policy.</div><a name="09021064000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will repeal section 2 of the 1959 Act, which allows a person
cautioned for loitering or soliciting to apply to a magistrates court
to have the caution removed from the police record. As I said, that
section has fallen into disuse and no longer serves a useful
purpose.</div><a name="09021064000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000424"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> In defending the clause and section 1 of the 1959
Act, has the Minister taken into account the potential for an increase
in street prostitution because of the clampdown on brothels envisaged
in other parts of the Bill, such as clause 13 and the proposals for
brothel closure orders? Does the Minister accept that if brothels are
closed, whatever the motive for doing so, there is likely to be an
increase in street prostitution unless prostitution suddenly ceases to
be an option? That will cause an increase in risk and an increased
burden on the policing of the
offence.</div><a name="09021064000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000425"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I will certainly not say that I accept that as a
likely consequence. I think that we should have this debate when
discussing closure orders. The hon. Gentleman seems to assume that the
police are to be given carte blanche powers to close any brothel; he
forgets that the measure is a targeted approach. We want to close
establishments that contain women&#151;they are predominantly
women&#151;who are being controlled for gain and/or have been
trafficked. Why would such women want to remain in prostitution and why
would they want to move from brothels to the streets? We are trying to
tackle the problem at source. Some of the establishments that the hon.
Gentleman talks of are holding and exploiting women, and that is what
we propose to clamp down on. It is not the case that those women will
necessarily find themselves on the streets.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000426"></a>Nadine
Dorries:</b> The objectives are laudable, but on 18 December a
raid took place on a brothel where nobody had been trafficked and no
one was being controlled for gain, yet the police threatened to charge
the receptionist with controlling for gain. What measures will the
Minister put in place to ensure that the police bear the
clause&#146;s objectives in mind and do not use it to close down
every brothel they know to be in
existence?</div><a name="09021064000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000427"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> We are working closely with the police to
simplify what can be difficult judgments and to ensure that the
legislation works correctly. The orders under discussion were not in
place for the December raid the hon. Lady mentions. The police
presumably had some evidence on which to act. When we discussed
amendments to clause 13, we debated the issue of what other people in a
brothel might be doing and whether that can be construed as control for
gain. During that discussion, I set out very clearly that we do not
believe the definition includes someone who is, for example, keeping
and organising a woman&#146;s diary, or someone who is at the brothel
specifically to keep the women
safe.</div><a name="09021064000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
answer to the specific question I was asked about madams is that it
would depend on their actual role. If a madam&#146;s sole purpose is
to keep the women safe and there is no evidence that she is controlling
them for gain in the way set out by the Act and by case law&#151;the
court is clear on the matter&#151;she would not fall foul of the law.
However, if there is evidence that she is trafficking, exploiting or
clearly controlling women for gain, there can be no excuse for allowing
her brothel to continue. There is no simple answer. The hon. Lady says
that the aims are laudable, but we have to make the measures workable
too. We believe that the measures will have the desired
effect.</div><a name="09021064000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are confident that continuing the police practice of issuing
prostitutes&#146; cautions provides adequate opportunity for an
individual to protest that they were not loitering or soliciting. If
there is real doubt about whether an individual is soliciting, charges
are unlikely to be brought. In the event of a prosecution, persistence
will need to be proved, and at that stage the man or woman will be able
to explain what they were doing when said by the police to have been
soliciting.</div><a name="09021064000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div><a name="09021064000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000430"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The provisions of clause 16 effectively
follow on from those of the previous clause in that, rather than
levying a fine for an offence under clause 15, the court may deal with
a person convicted of such an offence by making an order requiring the
offender to attend three meetings with a supervisor. That effectively
reproduces, with schedule 1 and with some modifications, proposals that
were dropped from the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. Orders to
promote rehabilitation are now more neutrally described
as:</div><a name="09021064000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Orders
requiring attendance at
meetings.&#148;</div><a name="09021064000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the previous provisions, it would have been permissible for an offender
arrested for breach of an order to be detained for up to 72 hours if he
or she could not be brought immediately before the appropriate court.
We will obviously go on to discuss the detail in schedule 1.</div>
<a name="09021064000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 23,
standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St.
Edmunds, is the principal amendment in the group. It is designed to
test the Government&#146;s approach to the orders and to question how
effective they will be. If we assume&#151;again, this is an
assumption made for the purposes of debate&#151;that a criminal
justice approach is right or appropriate in certain circumstances, what
should that approach and response be? In the previous debate, we heard
from the Minister that the 1959 welfare approach remains valid, so I
assume that he accepts that some form of positive intervention to try
to change behaviour and prevent harm is appropriate, in addition to or
as a supplement to the existing, more traditional criminal justice
punishment approach. If we follow that line of logic, the clause merely
provides for a requirement to attend meetings. The provisions go on to
say that the purpose of those meetings is to</div>
<a name="09021064000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;address the
causes of the
conduct&#148;</div><a name="09021064000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
to help people to</div>
<a name="09021064000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;find ways to
cease engaging in such conduct in the
future&#148;.</div><a name="09021064000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to test why an alternative approach could not be
taken&#151;a community order, for example, with a drug rehabilitation
requirement attached to it, or some other support mechanism. Would that
not be a more appropriate way of addressing some of the underlying
causes, challenges or issues that might be connected with the criminal
behaviour in question?</div>
<a name="09021064000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
determining what may be appropriate, a court will receive various
reports from probation and other services about the offender. Those
reports will set out and test what requirements or sanctions might be
appropriate to address aspects of the individual&#146;s behaviour.
Why does the Minister believe that the meeting requirement will be
effective? There is some scepticism about whether making someone who
has been convicted of an offence simply attend three meetings will be
effective. It is all very well wishing that something might happen, but
where is the follow-through?</div>
<a name="09021064000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">A court
order, which reflects a more compulsion-oriented approach, could be
more effective in providing assistance and support mechanisms in
relation to drugs and other problems. As we know, sadly, many people
involved in prostitution are also addicted to drugs and rely on a pimp
for their supply of drugs as well as for marketing their services. How
can we use the criminal justice approach in a constructive way to
direct and ensure that support services are followed through and acted
on? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>Instead of simply saying that there will be some meetings, could a
different, more effective approach be considered? That is why we
propose the reference to section 177 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
which is the signpost to those community orders.</div>
<a name="09021064000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will clarify why the Government have taken this approach.
Will he consider looking at whether it is appropriate and whether
alternative approaches, providing support through a community
punishment, might be more effective and achieve some of the ends that
Members on both sides of the Committee want to be
achieved?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000431"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I have a brief point to make that follows on from
the comments that have just been made. I wonder about the rationale
behind the three meetings that somebody convicted of loitering for
prostitution could be sent to under the clause. Will the Minister
explain how we arrived at three? What is the effectiveness of three
meetings? Are they three half-hour meetings or three one-day meetings?
What duration are we talking about? Who will organise the
meetings&#151;the National Offender Management Service or private
sector bodies that have won the contract? Will they be paid for from
the NOMS budget or will money be made
available?</div><a name="09021064000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
appear to be no arrangements to ensure that completion is noted by the
court and the police. Can the order be a repeat order or is it a
one-off? Can someone be sentenced to three meetings and a year later be
sentenced to three meetings again as a repeat offender? Under proposed
new section 1A(4)(b), which is in clause 16(3), the court will, if
sentencing somebody to attend the three meetings within a six-month
period, specify for up to six months where the person resides. That
could be seen as fairly draconian. How will it be monitored and what
are the penalties if the person moves in that period of up to six
months?</div><a name="09021064000255"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000432"></a>Nadine
Dorries:</b> Will the Minister clarify two things? First, if a
prostitute is arrested and attends a magistrates court, the original
offence for loitering will be withheld while the three meetings take
place. If the meetings do not take place because the prostitute does
not attend for whatever reason, or if she does not reside where she is
supposed to, will she be prosecuted only for the original offence or
for two offences&#151;the original offence and the offence of not
attending the meetings&#151;and be further
criminalised?</div><a name="09021064000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
16 is probably the sloppiest part of the Bill. Is it not possible
better to define the kind of services that will be administered during
the three meetings so as to specify that health services will be
administered and by whom? Rather than a person being identified as an
appropriate person, can we not say that that person should have various
health qualifications and be specialised in drug rehabilitation or in
the diseases or illnesses that a prostitute contracts as part of her
work? Can it not be somebody who has the ability and the appropriate
qualifications to deal with the problems that
occur?</div><a name="09021064000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000433"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Given that the last two contributions have
ranged more widely than the narrow questions raised in Mr.
Brokenshire&#146;s amendment, I will take further general
contributions on the clause and we will then dispense with the clause
stand part debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div><a name="09021064000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000434"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That makes it straightforward. My hon. Friend the
Member for Chesterfield asked some specific questions and I hope that
the Minister will have time to get the replies in
order.</div><a name="09021064000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to raise a few general points about the approach taken by the
measure. It will not surprise the Minister that my points are on a
previous theme, which is that those concerned with the welfare of
prostitutes, such as the Safety First coalition, have made clear their
opposition to that approach. This is essentially compulsory
rehabilitation with the threat of imprisonment if people do not go
through the
process.</div><a name="09021064000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is the question whether compulsory rehabilitation is a contradiction in
terms. The problem with a requirement for women to attend meetings is
that many prostitutes have chaotic lives; they are vulnerable and a
very high proportion have children, often young children. I pay regard
to that fact, and I hope that the Minister will do the
same.</div><a name="09021064000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Government say that people are allowed a reasonable excuse for not
attending a meeting, the intention behind backing up the provision with
a stronger penalty of a fine or even imprisonment is likely to make
matters worse, as I and the Safety First coalition believe. As I have
said, the Bill contains no provision for resources to address the
problems facing the women. For example, if the clause had a provision
whereby their needs and financial difficulties had to be assessed under
statute, with a duty of care placed on local authorities or Government
agencies that would receive resources to meet the needs and problems of
the women, there would be more justification for it. However, it refers
only to penalties. There is inadequate resourcing of support for women
and all we have received is an offer from the Government to look into
how they can better resource the services. The approach is
imbalanced.</div><a name="09021064000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
of the threat of ultimate sanction, women will be forced underground
into more isolated and dangerous areas to avoid arrest, referral and
possible imprisonment. The Safety First coalition argues that there is
evidence that compulsory rehabilitation schemes on arrest would not
help, and that it would be far better to decouple rehabilitation, in a
properly resourced way, from the criminal justice
system.</div><a name="09021064000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will know of the widespread welcome for the Corston report. It
was published two years ago, and recommended against imprisoning women
for non-violent
offences.</div><a name="09021064000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We have had a wide-ranging debate on the
overall thrust of the Government&#146;s proposals to place criminal
responsibility on the users of prostitutes. The clause deals with
procedures in relation to orders issued by a court to a prostitute for
attending meetings. We cannot repeat the wider debate, but if the hon.
Gentleman has comments about the orders, now would be the appropriate
time to discuss them as we shall not be having a clause stand part
debate.</div>
<a name="09021064000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000436"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am a little confused, because I have not talked
about the imprisonment of women and the impact that that would
have.</div><a name="09021064000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000437"></a>The
Chairman:</b> &#147;Imprisonment&#148; is the wrong word.
I think the hon. Gentleman understands my point. This is not the right
debate in which to repeat the general 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>arguments relating to clause 13. Clause 16 relates to orders for
attending meetings, and he should confine his remarks to such
matters.</div>
<a name="09021064000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000438"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I seek your guidance, Mr. Bayley,
because I thought that clause 16 and schedule 1 included a standby
measure as part of the new law under which women will face imprisonment
if they do not attend the meetings, and that that was part and parcel
of the
provisions.</div><a name="09021064000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000439"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We will have a separate debate on the
schedule.</div>
<a name="09021064000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000440"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I have tabled an amendment to the schedule, so I
am happy to remark on the impact of imprisonment then. I was seeking
not to duplicate matters, but to make new points. I accept your
guidance, Mr. Bayley, on when to talk about
imprisonment.</div><a name="09021064000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021064000441"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I will address some specific issues, but I
suspect that we shall talk about them again at a later date. The hon.
Member for Chesterfield asked why there is a need for three meetings. I
said earlier that we regard them as a gateway to other activities and
services that can be accessed. They are likely to create the foundation
on which the individual can continue to access support and advice to
exit prostitution. The duration of the meeting is up to the
supervisor.</div><a name="09021064000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
will the supervisors come from? We will expect them to be drawn from
people with expert knowledge in this field, such as those working for
local voluntary organisations dealing with drugs or whatever. Again, we
return to the issue of funding. Some local neighbourhoods have access
to funding that is ring-fenced to address issues around deprivation
that are pertinent to their area. For example, if they were to make
tackling street prostitution a priority, as it is in some
neighbourhoods, the resources would be there. Again, we need to take
into consideration any additional demands on
resources.</div><a name="09021064000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
can be a repeat order, but the longer that that goes on, the less
likely it is that the court will regard it as an appropriate way to
deal with the person. It might then find an alternative way to hold
them to account for what they are doing. As for how we monitor those
moving to other areas, the order will not be able to stipulate where a
person lives. However, moving out of an area and not continuing to
attend meetings will be regarded as a breach. In that case, the
supervisor will refer the matter back to the court, which will assess
whether there is a reasonable reason for the breach. If there is not,
it may then decide whether to intervene in some other way.</div>
<a name="09021064000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some myths
were perpetuated in some comments, not least those from the hon.
Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon and for Mid-Bedfordshire. People
will not be prosecuted for not attending meetings. If the supervisor
informs the court that, after an order has been placed, a person is in
breach of that order, the court can issue a summons. At that point, the
person will quite rightly be held to account for not responding to it.
In that process, if the order is not taking the prostitute in that
particular direction, we can go back to the original offence and look
at re-sentencing. I hope that that answers most of, if not all, the
points.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div><a name="09021064000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want briefly
to address the amendments in particular. Amendment 23 was introduced in
a very reasonable way by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, who made a
genuine attempt to discover the rationale behind the measure and why we
will not be able to accept his
proposals.</div><a name="09021064000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
23 would enable the courts to impose a community order under section
177 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The aim is to ensure that the
range of options in drug rehabilitation requirements, which can be
imposed by a community order, would be available for those convicted of
loitering or soliciting. However, we consider that the proposed orders
will enable those convicted of the offence to access the services that
the hon. Gentleman talked about. Therefore, it is not necessary to make
the amendment to allow for that, given the other consequences that will
flow from turning this new sentence into a community
order.</div><a name="09021064000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, the maximum penalty for an offence of loitering or
soliciting is currently a fine, which we think is proportionate.
Allowing a community order to be imposed will increase the maximum
penalty for this offence, because a community order is considered
significantly more serious. We do not believe that the seriousness of
this offence&#151;serious though it is&#151;justifies an increase
in the maximum penalty.</div>
<a name="09021064000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth noting that the breach of an order can ultimately lead to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 51 weeks. A prison sentence is
not a possible outcome 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>for failing to comply with an order to attend meetings, though it is for
not responding to a summons. If we allowed the imposition of a
community order, we would increase the risk of vulnerable persons
involved in street prostitution being sent to prison for a relatively
minor offence. Furthermore, allowing courts to impose the more onerous
sections of a community order would risk undermining that, as courts
would not necessarily impose rehabilitative requirements. They could,
for example, impose an unpaid work requirement that did not necessarily
address the issue of the
prostitute.</div><a name="09021064000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the order, which will be introduced by clause 13, is to provide
an alternative to a fine. That may help to break the cycle of people
being fined for loitering or soliciting and having to return to the
streets to earn money to pay the fine. It is not necessary to raise the
maximum penalty for the offence for that alternative to be available.
That is the point of the order. It is intended to allow those who are
willing to engage with support services to access such services without
the pressure of paying off a fine. In that way, it allows for a more
rehabilitative rather than a punitive approach when that is
appropriate.</div><a name="09021064000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
