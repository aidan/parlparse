vetting for work with 16 and 17-year-olds is coming back in. I would
like to ask you a couple of questions quickly. I am conscious of what
Mr Caton said; he moves us along and we do not hang about. In your
opinion, is it not time for the Independent Safeguarding Authority to
publish detailed management information on referrals and barring
decisions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? That would help to
inform decision making and the development of the legislation and the
vetting arrangements generally. That is a specific issue for me back
home, but it applies to England and Wales as well.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000009">&#160;</a>

The point, though, is to recognise that there are other prime purposes,
but the overall management information would help us to do our jobs
better as well, in terms of the nature of issues that were being
addressed and even the geography of what we needed to attend to for our
own management within our own voluntary organisation, in terms of what
to watch for, what to guard against and what to include in our training
as well as in our safeguarding

getting a lot of management information on both referrals and who it is
barring, and it will be very useful in providing an evidence base to
sectors or areas where there are particular risks, enabling us all to

                           </em> This is a very important and complex issue. We
are very supportive of the Government’s intention to bring about
portability of checks. We think this is very important. It will
simplify the system for organisations and individuals. One of the major
criticisms about CRB checks is that multiple checks have to be done for
multiple positions, so portability is key to us. I suppose it is a
complicated area, because currently under the Police Act regulations it
is possible for barring information to be made available to posts that
are outside regulated activity, and we think that is important as well.
We think it will help the portability if that is the case. Really, we
would like to see portability within the children’s sector,
whether someone is working strictly within regulated activity as
defined by the Act, or non-regulated activity. We understand that there
are other circumstances in which barring information needs to be
provided, for example culture adopting, but certainly if we could
streamline the system it will help with
portability.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000014">&#160;</a>

terms of efficiency—efficient not only in terms of the
administration of the regime, but also in terms of the volunteer
himself or herself, which is really the anxiety that we have.
Currently, many of our volunteers within our own organisation—we
have 100,000 of them—are carrying not just a disclosure for
their scouting activity but they are carrying them also for work that
they do as a sports coach and/or as a school governor and/or for their
employment, and anything we can do to get that system much more
streamlined would be of great benefit to them as individuals, as well
as to those individual organisations for
cross-checking.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000015">&#160;</a>

that is not territory in which we are heavily engaged. Ours is much

concern. Let me set that comment in context. We really believe that
tremendous progress is being made 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 121<a class="bkMark" name="Column121">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with the Bill, with the work that has gone on to get to this point and
with the recognition of some of the points that have been made even in
the discussions to date. However, we continue to have concerns with
regard to the definitions of “regulated activity” and
“supervision”. That is because in an environment where
adult volunteers are working with young people, with other adults
assisting, “supervision” can mean for some people that a
qualified adult who has his or her disclosure is present somewhere, and
there are three or four adults doing other things. Alternatively, it
can imply that the adult who is engaged with young people is constantly
being supervised.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
describe to you—it will become obvious as I ask you to visualise
it—an evening activity, which might be in an activity centre or
a community building where there is a group of scouts or guides. There
is one adult who is the leader in charge and who is providing
supervision. However, at any one time in the course of that evening or
that Saturday afternoon or that residential, there are three or four
other adults, each one with a small group of three or six young people
in a separate part of the building or in a separate part of that
campsite or activity centre, doing some map reading, some craft
activity or some drama. Therefore “supervision”, unless
it is more tightly defined, could be interpreted in many hundreds of
different ways. In our experience, “frequent contact” and
“close contact” need to be definitions that are brought
into the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000022">&#160;</a>

Reid:</strong>
                           </em> That is also our position. It is not possible
under vetting and barring to draw up a perfect system—it does
not exist. There are thresholds that were established under the
safeguarding vulnerable groups scheme and thresholds will be
established under amendments to the Bill. That is fine. It is about
taking a proportionate risk-based approach to things.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have had
helpful discussions with the Home Office about this issue. From our
point of view, the important thing is that there is a tight definition
of “supervision”, so that it does not encompass someone
who comes in unsupervised and ends up running scouts, football or
whatever. We had a discussion about perhaps changing the wording or
having rephrased wording around “close and constant
supervision”. Certainly we would welcome guidance from the
Government about exactly what “supervision” is and is
not.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000024">&#160;</a>

currently drafted, you do not think that there are sufficient
safeguards? What concerns me—it is what lies behind my
question—is that the Bill does not take account of the fact that
people who are seeking to get close to young children to do them harm
are prepared to bide their time and operate over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000025">&#160;</a>

think that we also have to bring into this discussion the fact that we
are not just safeguarding children on that afternoon or evening when
there is contact. We are also safeguarding children in terms of
relationships being formed, which can then extend into social media
contact, such as, “Give me your Facebook address or e-mail
address and I’ll be in touch with you at another time.”
That is something that we need to safeguard against, in addition to
what might be happening on a Tuesday evening, or on a Saturday or
Sunday at a residential. That is why we are concerned about those
definitions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000026">&#160;</a>

have been addressed, in the sense that there is a sequencing issue.
That makes sense from a human rights perspective, as opposed to a
situation in which there would only be a disclosure to the individual
and not to the organisation, which can come later. So the opportunity
to address an appeal for a misreporting can be undertaken. That has

is a significant point—one that we would wish to place on record

paid employment with an employer and someone who is a volunteer engaged
with young people. We believe that to be an artificial distinction when
it comes to safeguarding young people, particularly in their leisure
time activity, their sports and their non-formal education. I recognise

                           </div>initially was that the disclosure would go to the individual, then he or
she would go to another volunteer in the
community—the person in charge of their local volunteer
community group—to show their disclosure, which may contain
information that is not relevant to the decision on whether to use them
or not, but which is sensitive information about something that
may have happened well in the past but could be
seen as embarrassing or damaging to other aspects of character, if
abused in terms of chitter-chatter within the local
community.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000033">&#160;</a>

is quite different from the approach that we have welcomed, and that
our volunteers have welcomed thus far, with the disclosure going to the
individual and to the commissioning organisation—in our case,
coming to our UK-level office. The only people who then see that are
individuals trained to make those judgments in a national safeguarding
office and the individual who gets their own disclosure, so there is no
embarrassment within the wider community. We form a decision that says,
“As far as the organisation is concerned, this person is
suitable, based upon this information.” Using them locally will
depend on other features such as interview and local references. We
don’t just rely on this, but it is a tool in the

your job, because if you are in your job place, you can give it to the
HR manager, but in your local village or the estate on which you live
or the tower block or whatever, you have to find an evening when you
are free to take it around. If you then find that the person whom you
are taking it to is not in, you lose a lot of time and momentum for the
good will to volunteer. The sharing of information and the added
bureaucracy and demands on the individual were our two concerns if that
was to be the way in which it was going to be

I raise one issue about supervision? It does not matter whether we are
talking about a volunteer or a paid employee who is in a supervisory
position—it could be a scout master for example—the
supervisory role is very distinct. You referred to two or three adults
who might go off into another place and be alone with children. Do you
think that the person in the supervisory role has a duty of
responsibility over anything and anyone who is working with children
and therefore that is the key position in terms of making sure that
children are safeguarded rather than a momentary point at which an
adult—a parent volunteer or whoever—might be alone with
children?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000046">&#160;</a>

charge” would be the phrase that we would use there. That person
has additional responsibilities for the whole of the activity or the
whole of the evening to undertake risk assessment and do everything
that they can with risk management. That extends into safeguarding
issues and everything to do with training and the suitability of the
individuals. However, that still leaves open the ability of those
individuals who are entrusted to develop their relationships. The whole
point about non-formal youth work is that it is founded on
relationships. It is not just doing the activity, it is the
relationship between the adult and the young person which helps the
young person grow, develop and progress. Inherent in the nature of what
we do is the building of relationships between adults and young people.
There is a responsibility of the leader in charge, but that
responsibility also incorporates recognising the expectation of parents
that that leader will have done everything that they could have done to
look at the characteristics and the quality of the other
volunteers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000047">&#160;</a>

guidance needs to indicate that there are many other steps that
organisations have to take beyond simply carrying out a vetting check.
From our point of view, the previous system was, in effect, two
systems. It was ISA registration and it did not do away with the need
to do CRB checks. Probably where we are going is where we should have
gone at the start. We will have one system that should be as portable
as possible. That is the issue that people raise time and again. It is
not about vetting itself; it is about the numerous CRB checks that they
have to do in various different roles. So one check that is portable
across a range of sectors would be welcomed by a raft of organisations.
It would make the system simpler and it would cut out
bureaucracy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000063">&#160;</a>

issue and I want to explore something with you. Let us refer to the
very well known case of Ian Huntley and to what happened in that case.
If I understand correctly, prior to his committing those terrible
murders Huntley had been investigated by the police on nine separate
occasions, eight times for sexual assault and rape, mostly of girls
between 11 and 15. There were no convictions prior to the murders. If
there was a person like that again, a standard CRB check would not
disclose any of that information, would it? That person could then put
themselves forward as a volunteer and if they were engaged in an
activity that is not regulated and they went along with their portable
CRB check to show to a volunteer group, say a Scout group or a Girl
Guide group, the group would look at that check and think, “This
person’s fine.” Can you just reassure me that such
examples will not cause major
problems?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000065">&#160;</a>

Huntley’s vetting check—one was the process and one was
the information. Non-conviction police information is really very
important and we certainly welcomed Sunita Mason’s review, which
said that non-conviction data would continue to be provided under CRB
certificates. It is very important for all employers and organisations
to ensure that, when

is a capacity within the Police Act regulations for one to be
conducted. That is a matter for employers, to look at circumstances of
local jobs that they consider to be a risk. Not everything is in
regulated activity. There are many exceptions. We understand the
reasons why that is the case. You have to draw the threshold somewhere.
But there are options to carry out CRB checks in other circumstances. I
suppose that one suggestion that we would make to Government to improve
the Bill is to try to ensure that there is portability between
outer-ring activity, if I can use that term, and regulated
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000069">&#160;</a>

have other cases where, even if there is disclosure that comes back

organisation that said that, in spite of that “clear”
status, we are still not comfortable with that person being a volunteer
in our organisation. You referred to Huntley. I would go back even to
Hamilton in Dunblane, where he was perceived, on the basis of
non-conviction information, to be acceptable to work with young people,
but we in scouting had said no, because other people in the community
and people in the Scout Association had said, “Regardless of
that, your behaviour is not appropriate for our
organisation.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000071">&#160;</a>

experience of policing and courts, given the circumstances of these

confident that it can be resolved—is that the only appeal
mechanism is immediately to the High Court. That seems slightly
excessive and onerous if there has been just an administrative
misunderstanding or some minor misinformation given during the

is that there are many records of these offences where, because of the

offence—there is no record of the age of the other party
involved, so if you automatically disregarded all the offences you
might be disregarding offences where people under 16 were involved or

numbers. We do not have access to that intelligence. We come across
dozens of cases every year, and we are approached by people. Our
estimate would be probably more than 10,000. The difficulty also is
that you do not know whether people are deceased. I said that this
affects young people, but it also affects older people. Even when they
have retired, they may be keen to volunteer but be anxious about
presenting themselves as volunteers because of the scrutiny to which
they will be

we hope to explore with officials is that people are anxious about

been quite technical and focused on the Bill, but I think you have
alluded to some of this in some of your responses. Can you give the
Committee some impression of the impact that the disclosure of such
convictions has had on a number of the individuals who have been
concerned and who have contacted you? What are the real life
implications?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000117">&#160;</a>

though an employer nowadays is well aware that the offence would no
longer be unlawful, they would be made to feel extremely uncomfortable.
Other examples include people who are general practitioners or who are
regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council where, as a normal part
of the scrutiny to which you are subject, you have to declare
convictions that in all other circumstances would be spent. They feel
deeply, deeply anxious about these things being raised. It is very
similar to the situation that gay people were in historically in
relation to the security services. You could not say you were gay
before appointment. If you announced you were gay afterwards, you were
told that you had been dishonest at the point when you were subject to
scrutiny. The protections that the Bill proposes for people in those
positions are hugely welcomed by them. They feel it would be relieving
them of an anxiety that has overshadowed most of their professional
career.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000118">&#160;</a>

or not. The other issue that arises is the slight difficulty of someone
receiving a letter marked “On Her Majesty’s

Lawrence:</strong>
                           </em> The Local Government Group perceives the
new code of practice—I will start with that—as a useful
resource for local authorities, specifically if it becomes a single
source of guidance and advice, because there is a lot of good practice.
There is a lot of information that, if drawn into a single set of clear
and transparent items, will be, in itself, a benefit that would be
welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Two
notes of caution, if I may. One is in relation to data. Quite rightly,
there is concern that if the data burdens become onerous, that will
become an increased cost, which could be a disadvantage. The other
thing that perhaps needs to clarified, if one is to avoid confusion, is
that there are two commissioners who have oversight in this arena. One
always wants to ensure what I call clarity of response and clarity of
understanding between the police and local authorities. I think that
would need to be made clear. I am not questioning the need for two
commissioners, just trying to ensure that there is no
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
final point that I want to make is that, quite rightly, all local
authority CCTV cameras are regulated under the Data Protection Act and
under the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner. However, our
own cameras equate to only a very small percentage—something in
excess of 3%—of the total number of CCTV cameras in existence.
It is not cameras that are internal to premises that are private, but
cameras that are trained on public spaces, whether they are external to
buildings or whether they are in places like the areas of a bank that
people enter, supermarkets, trains and so on. We feel that there should
be regulations to oversee those cameras as well. In the concept of
public space, those regulations should be extended to apply not only to
local authority cameras, but to those within the private sector in the
area deemed to be defined as public
space.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000126">&#160;</a>

Johnson’s question, you know as well as I do that there is no
enforcement power in the code of practice, but one of the reasons why
the Bill contains these proposals is the apparently widespread
perception that local authorities are massively abusing their powers,
and that there is, therefore, a need for this crackdown in the Bill to
protect the majority of people out there who are having their freedom
eroded. What is your view of

There seems to be a misconception about what local authorities might
use their CCTV cameras for. As Councillor Lawrence said, they represent
about 3% of cameras in use in the UK at the moment. If you walk into
Cardiff tomorrow, you will see a bank of cameras focused on the
streets, and they are monitored by police officers. You will see a bank
of cameras to the right that are focused on the major highways and
those are monitored by council officers. They are in the same room, but
we are quite clear about what the police and the local authority role
is. It is a partnership. To suggest that councils abuse the use of CCTV
is very far from the
truth.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000133">&#160;</a>

having one commissioner. What about the proposal in the Bill that when
local authorities apply for permission to get communications data,
directed surveillance or covert intelligence they will now be required
to apply for judicial authority? Do you think that is proportionate?
Will it encourage local authorities to do that? Will it put them off?

means that there is public concern about snooping. If you read the
parliamentary reports of Sir Paul and Sir Christopher, they are quite
clear that many of the media reports are inaccurate. Sir Paul clearly
states that his inspectors found no evidence of any trivial misuse of
communications data powers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000137">&#160;</a>

Christopher made similar observations around surveillance. Local
authorities are being unfairly criticised for the use of covert
surveillance. Much of it flows from the media. The people who come and
visit us and undertake inspections in depth are telling
you—they  are your own parliamentary
watchdogs—that it is not happening.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If going to
magistrates gives the public greater confidence, then, in terms of
directed surveillance, yes. What we want to do is
achieve public confidence in what local authorities do. Our role is to
protect our communities. If that means greater clarity, that is fine.

have just proposed closing up to 18 magistrates courts. The number of
magistrates courts in the country is reducing. Hence, those that remain
will get a lot busier. If we put in a level of bureaucracy, it
sometimes means that we might not be able to react as quickly as we
would
like.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000140">&#160;</a>

terms of obtaining communications data and asking a magistrate to tell
us who the subscriber for a telephone number is, that may be perceived
as being a little too bureaucratic. If we want to access things such as
call data, I think that is a further step that we can look
at.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000141">&#160;</a>

comments in his report. I cannot tell you that a local authority has
not used covert surveillance to deal with dog fouling, because it has
happened. The debate is whether dog fouling was deemed an insignificant
issue at the time. Some took the view that it was. Sir Christopher, in
an unusual step, made an observation about the risk to the health of
young people playing in parks. It was a moot subject at the

Poole got it wrong. What I would say to you is the fact that RIPA

authorities need to be within the RIPA regime; it makes us accountable.
It is why I am in front of you today. You are challenging me about what
I do, why I do it and how I do it. I absolutely welcome that. My own
councillors in Cardiff challenge me regularly, every year. I would not
say that we do not get it wrong. The fact that it causes such an issue

more CCTV, it can cause an equal and reverse response. We have a good
example of that in Birmingham. It has to be in proportion to that which
gives rise to the request. Certainly, in many of our shopping centres
and in many of the fixed areas where people congregate and there are
known instances of crime and so on, there is properly that provision to
enable CCTV to be used to protect and safeguard not only individuals,
but premises. We have to begin to consider it very carefully is where
do you use it not so much on a permanent basis, but to deal with an
issue that arises in a particular community and locality; for example,
in relation to antisocial behaviour, where you want to detect groups of
people who are behaving in a way that acts to the detriment of a
community.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000151">&#160;</a>

How do they operate? At what time of the day? What are the techniques

domehawks are used quite often by the police as a deterrent. But you
move those around. Two things need to happen. First, there needs always
to be independent scrutiny available to ensure that such use can be
challenged, questioned and audited. Secondly, we need to ensure that we
act with the full knowledge of the communities in which we are seeking
to apply this. We need to ensure that they do not see it, as happened
in Birmingham, as a misuse, and the intended purpose was not the reason
purported to be its application in the first place. It is a question of

because there were two types of cameras—what I call the covert
camera and the very public camera. The camera stuck at the top of the
lamp-post was actually the type of facility that the community wanted,
because of some of the activities with shoplifting and antisocial
behaviour in particular roads. The covert cameras not only took
pictures but actually recorded conversations. That seriously undermined
the relationship with the

unfounded, but clearly public confidence is absolutely vital, so if the
proposals for us to go to magistrates are what is needed to gain public
confidence, we, in local authorities, will make it work. We want to
avoid bureaucracy, but we will make it work. Clearly those changes need
to be introduced carefully. How will the surveillance commissioners
deal with authorisations given by magistrates? My understanding at the
moment is that the surveillance commissioners have no remit to inspect
the judiciary. If the decision is moved away from me as an authorising
officer taking a quasi-judicial role, for which I am accountable right
now, and given to the judiciary, I do not understand how the
surveillance commissioners could exercise their inspection role and

the idea that surveillance is being used every day, when actually the
whole purpose of surveillance is that it is a last resort. There needs
to be a clear definition of what a serious crime is. To give an
example, I think most people would accept that fly-tipping is serious,
whereas the dropping of a piece of litter in the street is not.
Equally, surveillance becomes very important when you are looking into
serious issues such as child labour gangs, dangerous toys or food that
should have been destroyed being recycled back into the food
chain—all those sorts of areas. Often, covert surveillance using
RIPA powers is the only way to gather sufficient evidence to enable
local authorities to work with the police to undertake the necessary
action to bring those who have perpetrated such acts to
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000175">&#160;</a>

the Bill as it goes though to ensure that the powers are not being

months is good for us. There would clearly be exceptions, which have
been acknowledged. There is a £20,000 fine for selling alcohol
to minors, which the Government have recently increased, but there is
no imprisonment. That needs to be considered with the test purchasing
regime. There might be other occasions where the Bill could preclude us
from using covert surveillance where it might be necessary and
proportionate. As Councillor Lawrence says, we will continue to look at
that and engage with the Government as much as we can to make this
work. There is no interest in councils snooping on their residents. If
they think we are snooping, we will not have public confidence, and

residence, the relevant piece of legislation under which action is
taken goes all the way back to 1947. In that instance, you are right,
there has been a long history of legislation that gives authorities the
right and the power to enter, but it has to be on a very specific, well
evidenced, well argued basis that allows the particular warrant to be

2? What it does is repeal things that are regarded as out of date. The

whether actually any of the loss of the powers contained in that
schedule would adversely impact upon your ability to do the jobs that
you would want to do, which is the point of Mr Ellis’s question.
Some of them appear out of date. It would be helpful to the Committee

a difference.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000190">&#160;</a>

the Government about any of this, or have you heard from them about any

Holland:</strong>

colleagues sitting behind me, through the Local Government Association,
will have had some discussions with the Government around the consumer
landscape review and things like that. On the clause to ensure that
powers of entry are not used inappropriately, I do not have a problem
as long as local government is properly consulted and there is not a
knee-jerk reaction to wiping the powers away. Earlier, on the way here,
Councillor Lawrence and I were having a conversation about pieces of
legislation like the Consumer Credit Act. That Act was traditionally
used to inspect premises to make sure that credit agreements, credit
adverts and so on were being done appropriately and legally. Recently,
we have been using the Consumer Credit Act to challenge loan
sharks—illegal moneylending. The powers contained in the Act
allow us to take down some of the most unsavoury characters
in local communities; people who do real harm in local communities.
Councillor Lawrence has the English unit under his wing and the Welsh
unit sits with me. You have only to see some of the comments from the
judiciary about the cases we are currently putting in front of them to
see the damage that loan sharks do in communities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Sometimes a
piece of legislation will be used for more than one purpose. The
regulations to protect consumers from unfair trading are used to
challenge rogue traders, who damage vulnerable people in your
constituencies. We have too many pieces of evidence that show how
elderly people have lost ten of thousands of pounds to rogues. At the
moment in south Wales, a nice organised scheme is running. The rogue
goes in and does some work to the house that does not need doing. In
comes the second rogue and says, “That’s wrong. I can fix
it for you.” Then, of all the cheek, a third rogue appears and
says he is from the south Wales trading standards service, that he has
arrested the first two and for another £3,000 the person will
get all their money back. That piece of legislation tackles them in the
same way that it is used to inspect high street premises. With these
powers, you should be very careful what you choose to determine as
unnecessary and inappropriate. Local government has to be involved in
that discussion. We would absolutely welcome
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000193">&#160;</a>

subsection (2) states that that cannot be got around by someone putting
up a sign that says, “If you enter my land I will clamp
you”, meaning that someone would have given consent. Subsection
(3), however, seems to state that that does not apply as long as there
is a gate or a barrier on the land.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I suspect the
intent behind the clause is to protect the typical multi-storey car
park that is managed in the familiar way through pay-on-foot equipment
in town centres. Those operators cannot be accused of having
immobilised a vehicle when the barrier was not raised, perhaps because
someone has not paid. Of course, that creates a big loophole because it
allows any rogue operator to buy a piece of land, and as long as they
put

                           </div>a gate on that land and a sign that says, “I’m going to
clamp you if you enter this land”, the vehicle can still be
clamped. That is what the clause appears to say, and I cannot see any
other interpretation that could be put on it. There is a danger of
allowing the rogue operator to continue, and all
the Act will do is put the legitimate clamping operator out of action.
I am sure that is not the Bill’s
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000215">&#160;</a>

ours. First, we fully support the outlawing of clamping. That happened
in Scotland in 1992. There is a concern that some of those clampers
will then go into private ticketing, and the worry there is that the
same kind of intimidation tactics we have seen used by many of the
rogue clampers could be tried again—whether or not it is a
private car park—when four burly chaps come over and suggest
that you pay £500.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our concern
comes in clause 56 about private ticketing, in that it suggests that
the keeper of the car could be statutorily liable, yet there is no
independent appeal built into it, and there is no statutory legislation
on what the parking company should do. I shall give an
example.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
company, which seems to be incredibly profitable, is carrying out
private ticketing. Its website says, “Welcome to the ultimate
recession-proof business opportunity” which has
“limitless earnings potential”. All the company does is
to suggest to you, Mr Efford, that if you have a small piece of land
and wanted to make some money you could apply to my company, and I will
send you some parking
notices.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You
will take your digital camera and take pictures of the cars of
neighbours you do not like or of anyone who parks there, and send the
pictures to me. I will then apply to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency for their details, send out tickets, and if 60% pay up, which
they currently do, I’ll give you £10 for each ticket and
pocket the rest. That company claims to have 1,200 agents who ticket in
that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
concern is that even though that company claims to be a member of the
British Parking Association, the 1,200 people are, as far as we know,
just individuals. There is no control, and our worry is that the
clampers who have been making money for nothing for the past 10 years
are not going to give up, so they will be looking for loopholes that
already exist and try to exploit them. That is why I think some
sections of the Bill need to be tightened up, even though they are well
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000221">&#160;</a>

before the legislation was passed by the last Parliament. The issues
that were identified as areas where business licensing would have
required a condition for compliance were quality of signage, level of

a clamp is put on, the evidence required, records management after the

always been that if we get rid of the rogue clampers—these
people are criminals, and there is no other term for them—they
will simply move into another form of criminal activity, which will
probably be rogue ticketing. We know that there are examples of
operators ticketing vehicles and making off with the money that is paid
by motorists who are ignorant of their rights in the process.
Typically, about 40% of motorists will simply pay a ticket if it is put
on their vehicle, and do not ask questions, often because they know
they are in the wrong. But that is not the point. The point is that
rogue ticketers are not subject to any control or code of practice, and
we feel they should
be.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000224">&#160;</a>

is an unregulated area, and the British Parking Association has long
sought regulation of the whole private parking sector so that we can
sort it out once and for all. The two things that are important in the
need for regulation is, first, keeper liability—the clause that
Edmund just referred to—placing the onus on the keeper of the
vehicle rather than the driver for liability for any parking ticket
issued and, secondly, an independent appeal service so that the
motorist has protection in all circumstances. They can always appeal to
the person who issued them with the ticket, but clearly that will not
be seen as independent. There needs to be a separate, independent
system, very similar to the one that exists for local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000225">&#160;</a>

of the private parking industry, and we strongly believe that the
Government should be involved. Mr King precisely described a
situation of what we sometimes refer to as third-party ticketing, where
a firm allows another agent to issue the tickets. The Government are
complicit in that process, because they are allowing DVLA data to be
released to a car parking firm that is a member of the BPA and is
allowed to access DVLA records. That means that all the firms that Mr
King referred to—the ones in a recession-proof business
now—are able, with the Government’s approval, to access
data given to the DVLA by motorists for another purpose

I assume, that there should be some changes to that clause before the

be any changes to the clause. I wondered if we could discuss what
direction you are coming from on that, and whether it is the feeling

difference between wheel-clamping and ticketing, in that
wheel-clamping, which immobilises a vehicle, is far more intimidating
than ticketing would be? Of course, intimidation would also be possible
with ticketing, but it would require the official to remain in situ to
wait for the offender—I use the term loosely—to come
back, whereas now, the offender can drive off and wait to be called to
come back, and the intimidation happens then. There is quite a big

comes in a separate way through ticketing. On our main concerns, I can
give a couple of recent examples from colleagues at the AA; perhaps
they should learn to park a bit better. When parking in a supermarket,
one person strayed over one of the white lines; it was a big, empty
supermarket, with no one parked there. Because they had strayed over a
line, they got one of those private tickets. We said to the young lady
concerned that she should try and appeal, and perhaps not pay it. The
intimidation was the threat of bailiffs and the fact that her husband
was out of work and did not want his credit rating to be affected.
There are immense problems with bailiffs, and that system seems to be
almost as lucrative as it is for some of our friends.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000234">&#160;</a>

to get hold of information about what actually happens north of the
border on private land when it comes to nuisance parking and so on.
However, it is quite plain from reports about ticketing that it is not
the cosy situation we might be led to believe it is. In fact,
Mrs Anne McGuire MP reported to the Commons that she had
encountered ticketers on private land who had been threatening; their
other behaviour was not very good
either.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth noting that the business of ticketing, as well as
wheel-clamping, needs legislation. We need regulation in this area.
When ordinary members of the public park, they need to feel that
regulation will take care of them; there are nearly 30 million licence
holders in this country, so that means that nearly every adult member
of the population at some time parks a car or is involved in parking a
car. The processes that are in place to protect them on private land
are completely obscure, and that applies not just to their obligation
to buy tickets and so on but to how they might appeal when things go
wrong. Clearly, the population of Scotland has not been particularly
advantaged in purchasing tickets or receiving penalty tickets as a

barrier issue, although clearly no wheel-clamper is ever justified in
extorting huge amounts of money from people, is it not the case that at
least with a barrier, the driver knows that it is a barrier, as long as
it is clearly indicated, and that they are going on to land where there
is some control, whereas normally the issue with private land is that
people do not necessarily know that they are going on to private
land?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000241">&#160;</a>

and private land. We need to define what we mean by it, because some of
us might be thinking in terms of supermarket car parks, residential car
parks serving flats, or our front drive. All are private land, and then
you get into areas such as motorway service areas and hospital car
parks. It depends what the private land is being used for, and whether
a barrier is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, barriers are appropriate in many situations. I mentioned
earlier the typical multi-storey car park. We would not expect to see
one without barriers, but should you always expect to see barriers on
people’s front drives? Should you always expect to see them in
hospital car parks? It is horses for courses, I think, and landowners
should be given the right to determine how best to control their land.
Our primary concern with the legislation is that it removes from
landowners the ability to make that
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
simplest way to describe this is that there are just four ways to
control parking on private land: clamping, removing the vehicle, using
barriers or gates with chains, and ticketing. The Bill proposes that
two of those disappear completely, and that the other two remain. If
that is the case, barriers will have their place, as they do now, but
for situations where barriers do not apply,

but the RAC Foundation very much doubts that the police would actually

causing a danger, presumably they would come out. Nuisance parking
concerns the public much more than dangerous parking, because it occurs
more frequently. Even the Home Office’s impact assessment stated
that the police would regard that—coming and towing away a
car—as a discretionary act. They would not see it as a duty. I

legislation coming up we have been approached by a whole range of
different landowners—the Association of Residential Managing
Agents, the Federation of Private Residents Associations and the
British Property Federation—all of which have real concerns
about the ability of the police to assist when the ban is in place, and
the inability that the landowners will have to control their own land,
particularly in residential properties. I have been struck by the fact
that there are an enormous number of residential properties around,
such as blocks of flats with car parking, close to railheads or
shopping centres, which are plagued with illegal parkers. Those
residents’ associations use the threat of clamping to achieve a
level of compliance, so that residents can find a space to park when
they return. When the legislation goes through, those signs will have
to come down, because they will mean nothing. The landowners are
concerned that simply to rely on the police in all those thousands of
situations is unreasonable and cannot be expected. I do not think that
the police will be in a position to respond to that kind of
demand.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000248">&#160;</a>

because the police do not do that themselves; they have a recovery
scheme and they use their agents. Indeed, it is used on motorways many
thousands of times a day. The police authorise it, but they have
private agents that actually carry out the towing for them. I think the
AA does some of it on motorways. It is not just a question of police

new powers to the police, to local authorities and to those peculiar
“others”, who are not defined. That leads us to the same
thing; are we going to have others doing ticketing instead of clamping?
I just wondered what the preference of the other witnesses would be for
protecting private land. If we are saying it should not be clamping,
what system would best enable residents, hotels or whoever to protect

the disciplinary code that would be in place to ensure that if they did
not comply with the code they would be expelled and no longer be able

proposal under the Crime and Security Act 2010 in terms of licensing

operate to quality standards. It would be worth remembering when we

one has to question whether, in a civilised society, immobilising
someone’s car under duress is the best thing to do. There are
numerous examples. An 18-year-old girl going to Birmingham to see a
concert paid at a pay-and-display machine, but because there was an
encore at the concert she was 10 minutes late getting back to the car;
it was a reputable clamping

                           </div>company but it clamped her car. She was stuck in Birmingham at midnight
on her own, but she lived in Cambridge. Is that just in this day and
age? I think not. I therefore think that it should be
outlawed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
clamping is outlawed what should we do? What did the people in Scotland
do? Where they could, where it was appropriate, people put up a chain
or put up a barrier. I accept that it is not appropriate everywhere,
but it would get rid of some of the problems. Frankly, that would get
rid of some of the enterprising parking companies that are basically
doing it for the money and not to control parking. There is a lot of

                        <p class="tabbed">With
ticketing, what do you do? With on-street ticketing, there is a good
independent appeals system: the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, which is
independent, and is accepted by motorists and local authorities. The
parking companies pay it a levy of approximately 65p per penalty charge
notice to pay for the system. It is perceived to be a fair system. That
certainly is something that we would support.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000259">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Is that enough
on its own? Maybe not, because what you then see is that some companies
will charge outrageous amounts. An AA patrol recently got clamped while
fixing someone’s car on a private road, and was charged
£1,080—including £50 for swearing, which I thought
was a bit excessive. We polled 12,000 AA members only last week, and
asked them, “Do you think private parking enforcement activity
should be licensed?” Forty-nine per cent. said they thought it
should be licensed by local authorities, just as they licence pubs or
whatever. In order to get a license to ticket on your land, you would
sign up and say that you would not charge more than x amount. You would
put signs up, there would be safeguards and there would be an
independent appeal. Forty-nine per cent. supported that, and 49%
thought it should be controlled through legislation by the Government,
which the Bill is trying to do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000260">&#160;</a>

ticketing. We do not support motorists parking where they want, when
they want and how they want. They should not do that. We feel that it
has gone too far the other way. There are things that landowners could
do. If there is a ticketing system, it should be a fair and just
ticketing system, rather than a system where a pensioner gets charged
£150 for posting a letter before they go into the pub. That is

                           </em> One of the reasons why the SIA has not
collected more complaints—specific complaints—is that the
public have found it extremely difficult to communicate with the SIA.
The various motoring organisations have had hundreds of complaints, and
most of them have been prefaced by the fact that they could not get
through to the SIA. They would not answer the telephone. They could
send an e-mail, but even on the ISA’s website, it said that the
e-mail probably would not be responded to. I know that the SIA has been
trying to operate with its hands tied behind its back, but the SIA did
not regulate the amount of the release fee. This is something that the
Government could have done initially. They did not regulate the time
taken to release the clamped vehicle. Nor did they regulate on the
adequacy of the signage at the site where the clamping took place. So
regulation really let the public
down.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000284">&#160;</a>

raised the issue in the first place. There has always been a concern
about private land that, because it is unregulated and not subject to
any regulatory law, landowners rely on the law of contract, or
sometimes trespass, in order to carry out activities on private land.
Under those laws the driver is liable, because it is the driver who has
committed the act or misdeed, but of course they are unknown; only the
keeper of the vehicle is known because they are registered at the
DVLA.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
principle of keeper liability is nothing new. It applies under the Road
Traffic Act 1991, which was repealed by the Traffic Management Act
2004, for all local authority activities. If you get a penalty charge
notice on a yellow line you will be liable as the keeper of that
vehicle. That is enshrined in that legislation and has been the case
for 17 years, so it is a principle that is well understood by the
motorist. May I also say that it applies in local authority car parks
as well, so you can have a situation where the keeper is liable in one
car park, but in the car park next door, which happens to be privately
run, the driver is
liable.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000293">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have argued that particularly if clamping is to be banned, there must
be a means by which landowners and their operators can manage their
land properly through ticketing. The only way to do that is to make the
keeper liable. There needs to be protection, and that is why we are
arguing for regulation around this to ensure that that notion is not
abused in any way. It would work simply by the operator issuing the
ticket to the vehicle in the traditional way. The recipient of the
ticket does not pay, so the operator applies for keeper details from
the DVLA and writes to them to say “You must pay this
ticket.” It is exactly the same thing as local authorities
already do up and down the country. The missing piece of the jigsaw is
that there must be an independent appeals service in order to protect
the keeper when they argue that they were or were not the keeper, or
that they sold the vehicle, or
whatever.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000294">&#160;</a>

difference is that under the Road Traffic Act, regulations are laid
down by the Secretary of State that govern parking, and the
restrictions, and then the companies can chase the keeper. That is
regulated. If the clause was introduced without some kind of regulation
system I think it would be a constitutional anomaly, because you are
basically saying that an individual company could chase the keeper when
there were no set rules or regulations that that driver had entered
into. He entered into a contract if he did or did not see a sign. If he
did not see the sign, the keeper can then be chased, and harassed by

only picked him up going back. In a case like that the keeper would be
chased, even though he had a legitimate reason or otherwise for going
to McDonald’s. I think there are number of cases like that that
come up; if the number plate is read incorrectly, or if it is a cloned
plate as you say. That is why we would be concerned about this clause

just say something about the figures with respect to CCTV? The figure
that is often put out is that there are 4.2 million CCTV cameras; in
fact, it is sometimes put higher than that. When the witnesses from the
Association of Chief Police Officers came on Tuesday, they said that
they thought that the figure was actually about 1.8 million. What is
your view on this? Have you made an assessment of the number of CCTV
cameras?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000302">&#160;</a>

think that it is one of the large gaps in our current knowledge, quite
frankly. I think that it is high time that we had a proper assessment
of the number of cameras and the scope of surveillance. I am pleased by
the work that Graeme Gerrard has done in Cheshire, because it helps to
shed more light on this issue. His work was quite a detailed account of
all the cameras within his force area—within the
county—and then there was an extrapolation. I think that that is
more accurate than the 4.2 million figure.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000303">&#160;</a>

corrected if I am wrong, but it was said that the Bill would apply to
approximately 29,000 or 30,000 cameras. In other words, the number of
cameras affected by the provisions in the Bill is a very small
proportion of the total number of cameras. Is that right?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000306">&#160;</a>

Rennison:</strong>
                           </em> Initially, I think that that is correct.
The CCTV User Group put the number of cameras in public ownership at
about 50,000 to 60,000, so it is a small part of the total. I have long
argued that regulation of CCTV cameras or surveillance cameras should
encompass this broad scope and not just those cameras in local
authority and police ownership. That is something that I have discussed
with colleagues in Scotland, because they are developing their own CCTV
strategy. I spoke at a conference a few months ago and initially I was
critical of this approach of just starting with the publicly owned
cameras. I thought that there should be a much broader push to start
off with. A lot of the cameras I described as being in quasi-public
ownership are in shopping centres and areas to which the public have
free and ready access. Is there any real difference between those and
local authority-owned cameras?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000307">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Having spoken
at length to colleagues in Scotland, I was persuaded that the proper
approach is to start with publicly owned cameras and test the water
with codes of practice or whatever you want, with the full intention of
expanding it later on. Trying to do all in the first throw of the dice
is probably almost unachievable and puts too much pressure on things,
but we have got to leave the door open to regulate much more widely
further down the road.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000308">&#160;</a>

and local authority cameras, but we should leave open the option of
moving on? From memory, I am not sure whether there is anything in the

the codes of practice should start with high-level principles that
everyone complies with, regardless of where the cameras are and who is
operating them—principles of respect for privacy and
accountability. We might have to think through how they are applied in
different situations, but I do not see why we would want any real
difference between public and privately owned cameras. I can quote you
examples of privately owned cameras with equally troubling privacy
issues, such as collateral intrusion into neighbours’ gardens
and other areas.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000318">&#160;</a>

instance.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000325">&#160;</a>

                           </em> That is probably the most hotly debated
area around camera systems, surveillance systems, CCTV systems. I have
not commissioned any research—I have no budget to do
that—but I have recommended that more research be done. I think
we would need to be very careful about the design of some of that
research.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
research that is often quoted currently is actually quite dated, so we
have people like the Campbell Collaboration who in their 2008 report
neatly summarised 46 other research projects, the oldest of which was
from 2006. Systems and uses of surveillance cameras have changed
significantly since
then.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
you can call it research, I have spent a good deal of my time visiting
users of camera systems and police forces such as Cheshire, Greater
Manchester and the Metropolitan police, to see how they have changed
their use of the information—the images. Since I left the police
five years ago, the police use of CCTV systems has changed quite
significantly for the
better.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
research we saw up to about 2006 was in a period when I do not think
that the systems or the product were used particularly efficiently. I
have seen quite a sea change in that use. Also, the technology has
changed, making the product much more useable, so it is high time we
did some up-to-date research, to see how people are using the product
and how the product has improved, because digital technology is
providing a vastly improved image quality. There is more scope
there.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
flip side of that for me is that while this improvement in technology
will have an impact on the effectiveness of CCTV, it also puts us on
the cusp of a whole new series of problems, which I think is a clear
reason for good regulation now. The technology has the potential to
have an enormous impact on privacy, The modern megapixel cameras that
are being put in, which are very affordable nowadays and easy to
install—you can plug them into a network or into internet
systems quite easily—have very clear images, with powerful
optical and digital zooms. In the past, Mr Brokenshire’s face in
the crowd would not have been particularly clear or discernable, but
that is no longer the case with more modern systems. It is much easier
to pick people out in a crowd, and it is much easier to identify
someone.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000330">&#160;</a>

advances in the software in the
background—facial recognition and other software is still a few
years away from being very effective, but the improvements are
rapid—and that will change the picture, if you will excuse the

no statutory underpinning to those codes. They are in effect voluntary

have some independent oversight of the quality of the use of CCTV. I
was approached by Graeme Gerrard’s team and the National
Policing Improvement Agency to see how my model worked in the
regulation of forensic science quality standards. So it was the
building of codes of practice and voluntary compliance. The codes of
practice were achieved through intense consultation, consensus and
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000341">&#160;</a>

like to take on some of that work for us as the interim CCTV
regulator?” That was working to the national CCTV strategy, so
we set up a framework around that and we set up a new strategy board. I

                           </em> I did not have particularly strong objections
to CCTV cameras before last spring, when more than 200 cameras were
installed to encircle two communities in Birmingham in what was
described as a ring of steel of automatic number plate recognition
cameras. Basically it created a surveillance ghetto in those two areas.
It struck me as an obvious shift in the relationship between the
citizen and the state and a step change in British policing. What
appeared to be happening was that we were importing the policing
strategies that had been developed in Northern Ireland and installing
them in British cities as if that were perfectly normal and acceptable.
I thought that if that were allowed to go ahead there, then it would be
allowed to go ahead elsewhere until eventually it became the norm,
which I think would be very
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000351">&#160;</a>

an enabling Act which facilitates the proliferation and expansion of
the use of surveillance cameras. It is concerned mainly with technical
standards to do with compatibility and networking of systems. As
described in the code, it is designed to be an A to Z manual of how to
get the most out of your camera systems. It does not appear to have
anything to do with protecting the rights of the individual. There is
nothing in there about protection from

minute details rather than fundamental principles to do with freedom.
The Bill and the provisions in the code of practice relate to things
like how long we should retain personal data and specific details like
that, rather than whether it should be taken in the first place. So,
yes, there may be a complaints procedure. You mentioned consultation.
Will that be an informed, proper, genuine consultation that takes
account of the facts, which have not been made known to the British
public, or will be it be a box-ticking exercise where we are simply
told that the people want it: “We asked them if they wanted it;
they said they wanted it and therefore we will install
it”?<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000357">&#160;</a>

that report, which was highly significant in illustrating the

but it would have had a huge impact on the Lords report because its key
finding was that

                           </div>CCTV schemes in city and town centres and public housing, as well as
those focused on public transport, did not have a significant effect on

one story in the media about CCTV that gives the impression that it is

public perception of CCTV and its actual capabilities. CCTV has been
promoted by successive Governments because, for whatever reason, it has
been seen as either a generally good thing for society or a popular
thing for MPs, councillors and Ministers. I do not think it has been
driven by factual reality. If we are going to consult the public, we
need to ensure that the public are properly informed, not
misinformed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000359">&#160;</a>

not seem to be any restrictions. There is nothing about limiting CCTV

perception of CCTV cameras can be misplaced, case after case would not
have been proved in court had it not been for CCTV cameras. Conversely,
clients of mine have rightly been found not guilty, directly because of
the evidence. I am not saying that that makes CCTV some sort of silver
bullet, but that the cameras are a very effective tool, when used
properly, in the combat of crime. Do you not accept that what the Bill

more cameras. Of course you can find individual cases, but that does
not, in my view, justify this massive proliferation and expansion.
Whether we have 1.8 million or 4.2 million cameras—we do not
know the exact figure, as Mr Rennison has acknowledged—the
statistical probability of there being anecdotal evidence of their
usefulness, as claimed by the police, is inevitable due to the sheer
numbers and volume, but that does not prove that CCTV is an effective
tool. We go to the academic research, which is peer-reviewed
studies—a meta-analysis of 41 or 44 different
evaluations—which I would give more credence to, and it says
that it does not work.<a class="bkMark" name="1103254000376">&#160;</a>

almost no crime, it has been surrounded and saturated with ANPR and, I
believe, CCTV cameras in an effort to completely eliminate crime. The
assistant chief constable there said, “This is not about
reducing crime, but about providing confidence and reassurance to the
residents.” We have even lost sight of the purpose of
surveillance. We just seem to have come to believe that it is a
