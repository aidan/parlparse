David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I welcome you to
the Chair of the Committee this afternoon, Mr. Jones. I cannot claim to
have made more than introductory comments on the group of amendments
under consideration during this morning&#146;s sitting, so I will
reiterate.</div><a name="06062156000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause, as the Committee will recall, deals with the possession of
articles for use in frauds. The issue is whether there should be an
express intent in the clause. There is no mens rea provision at the
moment. Interestingly, in clause 7, there is such a provision, so there
is a difference between the two clauses. The only thing that might be
construed as intent is the importation of the form of words from the
Theft Act 1968:</div><a name="06062156000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for use
in the course of or in connection with any fraud.&#148;</div>
<a name="06062156000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that that has been construed
to imply intent. It is certainly not explicit and it requires
interpretation.</div><a name="06062156000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is whether we should make it absolutely explicit that the
article in question should be in the possession of the person with a
clear intent to commit a fraud. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr.
Grieve) has already moved amendment No. 5, which would insert the word
&#147;intended&#148; after &#147;article&#148;, so the clause
would read</div> <a name="06062156000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any article
intended for use in the course of or in connection with any
fraud.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I intimated to him in an intervention, my difficulty with that wording
is that an article may be intended for use in fraud but by a different
and separate person from the person who is carrying the article or has
control of it. So I am not sure that the amendment specifically
addresses the issue that we wish to raise.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 42</div><a name="06062156000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
No. 9, I propose an alternative form of words, which makes it clear
that the person who is guilty of the offence has the article in his
possession or under his control and intends it to be used in the course
of, or in connection with, fraud. That makes the connection between
possession and intent absolutely explicit and, I think, improves the
wording of the
clause.</div><a name="06062156000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
10 would make the connection still more explicit. I understand that the
Solicitor-General may say that it is better to have conformity between
the two pieces of legislation, so that they are expressed in the same
terms. I think that &#147;in furtherance of&#148; is better than
&#147;in connection with&#148; because there are many items that
could be used in connection with fraud but are not intended for use in
a fraud. A printer on which counterfeit documents are produced might be
an article that is used in connection with fraud but there may be no
intent to do that, whether implicit or explicit, in possessing that
printer. The words &#147;in furtherance of&#148; make it clear that
there is a causal relationship and one of intent between possession and
use in the prosecution of a fraudulent or dishonest act. I commend that
amendment to the
Committee.</div><a name="06062156000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 11 is perhaps a counter-balance to what I said earlier. If it is
clear that the intent must be proven by the prosecution, it seems to be
entirely reasonable that the provision should not require that the
article for use in the fraud is to be used by the self-same person.
What I am suggesting is that, by
inserting</div><a name="06062156000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which he
intends to be used&#148;</div><a name="06062156000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
adding</div><a name="06062156000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;carried out by
him or any other
person&#148;</div><a name="06062156000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">we will retain
the sense by which an article might be carried by one person, to be
used by another, but we insert the clear requirement for intent to be
proven.</div><a name="06062156000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause as
currently worded is capable of being construed in the way that I want
it to be construed, but it is not unambiguous. My amendments would
strengthen the provision, make the intent clear, and to a considerable
degree bring clause 6 into line with clause 7, where the intent is
clearly
stated.</div><a name="06062156000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000338"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> Welcome to the
Chair, Mr. Jones. Hopefully we will make some brisk progress today
under your chairmanship. I am sure that we will all have an interesting
debate on some of the
clauses.</div><a name="06062156000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I detect some
difference in view between the Opposition parties. The Conservatives
seem to want a more specific intention drawn into the clause, whereas
the Liberal Democrats want a broader, or general intention of the sort
that the Government favour. The objective of the Liberal Democrats
seems to be to insert into the clause that which we believe is already
there by case law. The view of the Conservatives, unless I have
misinterpreted it, is to be much more specific about the nature of the
intention.</div><a name="06062156000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been living with an offence worded in the same way as clause 6 for
nearly 40 years. That offence is in section 25 of the Theft Act 1968,
which applies not only to burglars but to those going equipped to
commit a cheat. A cheat is defined as a crime of obtaining property by
deception under section 15 of the Theft Act. The years since 1968 have
provided case law on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 43</div>provisions, the most important of which for our present purposes is
Ellames, which I mentioned on Second Reading and is referred to in the
explanatory notes.</div><a name="06062156000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will be a bit broader than the explanatory notes in identifying some of
the issues here, as that may be helpful to the Committee. Mr. Justice
Brown said during the Ellames
case:</div><a name="06062156000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In our
judgment, the words in section 25(1) of the 1968 Act: &#145;has with
him any article for use&#146; mean &#145;has with him for the
purpose&#146; (or &#145;with the intention&#146;) &#145;that
they will be used&#146;. The effect of section 25(3) is that if the
article is one &#145;made or adapted for use in committing a
burglary, theft or cheat&#146;, that is evidence of the necessary
intention, though not of course conclusive evidence. If the article is
not one &#145;made or adapted&#146; for use, the intention must be
proved on the whole of the evidence&#151;as it must be in the case of
an article which is so made or adapted, if the defendant produces some
innocent explanation. We agree with the learned authors of <i class="I">Smith and
Hogan: Criminal Law</i>...that section 25 is directed against acts
preparatory to burglary, theft or
cheat&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062156000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that
questions of Mr. &#147;D&#146;s&#148;, the
defendant&#146;s&#151;</div><a name="06062156000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;knowledge
of the nature of the thing can hardly arise here, since it must be
proved that he intended to use it in the course of or in connection
with&#148;</div><a name="06062156000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">the burglary, theft
or cheat</div><a name="06062156000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and that the
mens rea for this offence includes &#145;an intention to use the
article in the course of or in connection with any of the specified
crimes&#148;.</div><a name="06062156000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
continued:</div><a name="06062156000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
our view, to establish an offence under section 25(1) the prosecution
must prove that the defendant was in possession of the article, and
intended the article to be used in the course of or in connection with
some future burglary, theft or cheat. But it is not necessary to prove
that he intended it to be used in the course of or in connection with
any specific burglary, theft or cheat; it is enough to prove a general
intention&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062156000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that is the important phrase
here&#151;</div><a name="06062156000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to use it
for some burglary, theft or cheat; we think that this view is supported
by the use of the word &#145;any&#146; in section 25(1). Nor, in
our view, is it necessary to prove that the defendant intended to use
it himself&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062156000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is the point that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)
made&#151;</div><a name="06062156000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it will be
enough to prove that he had it with him with the intention that it
should be used by someone
else.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062156000339"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I shall take this
opportunity to clarify a remark that the Solicitor-General made
earlier, when he thought that there was a difference of approach
between the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and me. I do not believe
that there was. I understood fully the difference between the two forms
of wording and, as I acknowledged at the outset, the wording proposed
by the hon. Gentleman may be better than mine, but our intention was
identical. I want to make it clear that I certainly was not seeking, by
way of the amendment, to narrow the provision so that it had to be
proved that the person intended to use the article in some specific
form of fraud. On the contrary, the proposal was merely that it would
be for use in
fraud.</div><a name="06062156000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000340"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
that clarification of his position and I accept that both Opposition
spokespersons want an outcome that is not too different from what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div>Government want. The question is whether we need to import that by way
of amendment or whether it is, in effect, already
imported.</div><a name="06062156000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 25
of the Theft Act 1968 needs to be replaced by clause 6, because it does
not cover cases in which the possession takes place in the home, and
the objective is that the provision should include such cases. Concern
about it being used against people who have no fraudulent intention is
misplaced, as Ellames makes it clear that an intention is required.
Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are unnecessary because the Ellames case will
be imported, in effect, into the
clause.</div><a name="06062156000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 10 and 11 are also unnecessary. The part of Ellames that I quoted
makes it clear that the intended fraud does not have to be committed by
the possessor; it may be committed by someone
else.</div><a name="06062156000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same case
provides authority for attaching a wide meaning to &#147;in
connection with&#148;. This part of the Ellames judgment is relevant
to that. I think that I have already quoted some of it, but essentially
it says:</div><a name="06062156000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
object and effect of the words &#145;in connection with&#146; is to
add something to &#145;in the course
of&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
&#147;in furtherance of&#148; would carry such a wide meaning is
open to question. We do not want to risk not covering any of the huge
variety of acts that may be preparatory to fraud. Opposition Members
may believe that &#147;in connection with&#148; is too wide, but I
do not agree, as the whole offence is underpinned by the requirement
for a general intention to commit fraud, so no truly innocent person
has, in my view, anything to
fear.</div><a name="06062156000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">All four
amendments are not only unnecessary but undesirable, because they would
take us away from the section 25 wording and thus deprive us of the
case law associated with the existing provision, and the case law has
been extremely useful in making it clear to the courts where they ought
to be going. Accepting the amendments would have implications for
section 25, which will remain in force to cover burglary and theft. We
do not want to have one form of wording for one set of offences and
different wording for a very similar set of offences relating to fraud.
The courts would want to construe what the difference was, and we know
from this discussion that no difference is
intended.</div><a name="06062156000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
necessary to ensure that we keep the similar case law and the similar
intention. I do not think that there is any great disagreement of
principle between any of us on how we would like the clause to be
applied, but I want to ensure that we maintain the clarity of the
provisions, that the courts know what they are about and that the jury
is therefore able in due course to make a judgment about the outcome of
a
case.</div><a name="06062156000059"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000341"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am most grateful to the Solicitor-General for the
way in which he has approached this discussion. I agree with him: I do
not think that there is any difference in our intentions&#151;in what
we want the clause to do. I believe that, were section 25 of the 1968
Act not to be in place and were we to be creating an offence today in
isolation, my wording would be better. I have been quite plain about
that. My wording is more
explicit.</div><a name="06062156000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06062156000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Solicitor-General is confident that the Ellames case, imported into
consideration of this offence, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div>will identify the necessity to prove intent and will be construed in
terms of the article being in the possession of one person, although
possibly being used by another person in the commission of a fraudulent
act. If that confidence is well placed&#151;I have no reason to
suppose that it is not&#151;I think that the provision comes to the
same conclusion as my amendment, were it agreed
to.</div><a name="06062156000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000342"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me provide some reassurance. In
construing a statute, the courts are able, under Pepper <i class="I">v</i>. Hart,
to take account of ministerial statements in the House and explanatory
notes. The explanatory notes on the Bill draw attention to the case of
Ellames. It may be helpful to tell the hon. Gentleman that Lord Steyn
said in Westminster city council <i class="I">v</i>. National Asylum Support
Service in 2002 that explanatory
notes</div><a name="06062156000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;cast light on the
objective setting or contextual scene of the statute and the mischief
at which it is aimed, such materials are always admissible aids to
construction.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact
that the explanatory notes specifically mention Ellames means that the
case is
important.</div><a name="06062156000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000343"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I think that we have successfully Pepper-and-Harted
Pepper <i class="I">v</i>. Hart, which is helpful in respect of any future
construction placed on the clause. On that basis&#151;I understand
what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said&#151;I do not intend to
press my
amendments.</div><a name="06062156000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000344"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Jones. I reiterate
what I said to the Solicitor-General a moment ago in my intervention.
The purpose of my amendments was not to narrow in a huge fashion the
definition of the person who would be caught by clause
6.</div><a name="06062156000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth bearing
in mind&#151;perhaps we have not touched on it&#151;that the clause
differs in one important material particular from going equipped to
cheat or to commit theft, in that that is restricted to a person not at
their place of abode. It was clearly envisaged that that definition
should refer to the person with the bag marked &#147;swag&#148;
with a jemmy inside it. That has a rather old-fashioned ring about it
when viewed by the standards of 21st century crime. The Bill would
widen the scope of the effects to include equipment found in a
person&#146;s home. There may be some common ground between the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome and I on
that.</div><a name="06062156000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of the
fact that I suspect that a great deal of the relevant equipment could
also have an innocent use&#151;I am not an expert, but I can see that
there may be innocent uses for the sorts of equipment that could be
used for the purpose of fraud, including computer fraud&#151;we have
to be careful about ensuring that we leave people with the ability to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000348"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. That was
precisely the source of my concern. As to the difference in wording
between what I should like to see included and that of the hon. Member
for Somerton and Frome, on reflection I am not sure that it makes a
huge difference. It is clear that the word &#147;intended&#148;,
inserted by my amendment, could apply to an article that was intended
for use by another as well as for use by that person. My amendment is
more limited in scope than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, which is why I
was surprised to hear the Solicitor-General suggest that I was trying
to narrow the scope further than the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06062156000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000349"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The observation was from the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s broader comments, rather than on the clause. I tend
to agree with his interpretation of the difference&#151;or
not&#151;between his amendment and that of the Liberal Democrats. It
was listening to his remarks rather than looking at the clause that
caused me to make the comment.</div>
<a name="06062156000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000350"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General. This was a
probing amendment, and he has provided a great deal of reassurance. I
hope that the debate, having gone on the record, can, if necessary, be
quoted along with the explanatory notes should any issue arise. I
certainly agree with the Solicitor-General that it is probably
undesirable for there to be a difference in wording between this and
going equipped. However, there is an inherent difference of wording in
that the scope of the offence is wider because it applies to
people&#146;s domestic premises.</div>
<a name="06062156000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in mind, I beg to ask

Dominic Grieve</b>: I beg to move amendmentNo. 1, in
clause 7, page 3, line 15, leave out &#145;or' and insert
&#145;and'.</div><a name="06062156000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
follows on from our earlier debate, but is slightly different because
there is no equivalent offence to making or supplying an article as
that is defined here. Subsection (1) states:</div>
<a name="06062156000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person is guilty of
an offence if he makes, adapts, supplies or offers to supply any
article&#151;knowing that it is designed or adapted for use in the
course of or in connection with fraud, or intending it to be used to
commit, or assist in the commission of,
fraud.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">If paragraph (a)
were confined to knowing that it is designed for use in the course of
fraud, I should not be so concerned. However, adapted for use in the
course of or in connection with fraud seems to be a wide term. I worry
that it could catch somebody who makes a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>perfectly reasonable device for legitimate use. On
Second Reading, I used the example of the conjuring trick. Such tricks
usually require somebody to commit a fraud upon a willing group of
spectators. To say that an article of that sort is unlawful causes me
concern, particularly as it is not &#147;and&#148; intending it to
be used to commit, or assist in the commission of fraud but
&#147;or&#148; intending it to be used to commit, or assist in the
commission of
fraud.</div><a name="06062156000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">One way of
dealing with the matter would be to say that it should not be
&#147;or&#148; but &#147;and&#148;. That is what the amendment
would achieve. However, I am aware that that would create a restricted
offence of specific intent. I acknowledge straight away to the
Solicitor-General that that might be too restrictive. Therefore, this,
too, is a probing amendment, designed to tease out in the course of
debate whether what has been drafted here correctly meets what we are
trying to achieve, or whether it goes a little too
far.</div><a name="06062156000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall listen to
the Solicitor-General with interest, but my first reading of the clause
made me slightly surprised, because articles made, adapted, supplied or
offered is a wide term. The nature of fraud being what it is, all sorts
of items could be included in that category. I shall be interested to
know what defence could be raised, for example, if a person knows that
he is supplying an article to a conjuror. He knows very well that it is
designed or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with
fraud&#151;or could be&#151;but that is not what is intended. Does
he have a defence? That is the key question that the Committee needs to
debate.</div>
<a name="06062156000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000352"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause makes it an offence for a
person to make, adapt, supply or offer to supply any article for use in
fraud. The impact of the amendment would be to place a highly
undesirable restriction on the breadth of the offence. It would narrow
the offence much too much.</div>
<a name="06062156000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it stands,
clause 7 allows for a precise distinction to be made between the parts
played by those who know that an article is made or adapted for use in
the commission of fraud and those who intend that it should be used for
fraudulent purposes. I assure the Committee that the distinction is a
significant one. For example, it is possible to imagine the supply of
an ordinarily innocent article&#151;in other words, an article, that
under any circumstances, could be used legitimately&#151;to be used
in the commission of a fraud.</div>
<a name="06062156000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The example of a credit card
reader comes to mind. The device has not been made or adapted with the
fraud in mind but could be supplied with the intention of it being used
fraudulently. There are other examples. A person may have software that
is capable of being used fraudulently, but it has not been made for
that purpose. The hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)
referred to such an item. A person supplies security devices that are
designed either to prevent fraud or to give legitimate access to
something and it may well be that a person intends that they be used
for a fraudulent purpose. A person might sell credit card numbers,
usually on the internet, knowing that they could be used to commit
fraud. There are all types of things that might come to
mind.</div><a name="06062156000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversely,
a criminal may make an article specifically for a fraud&#151;for
example, a device covertly to copy credit cards&#151;but be
ambivalent about whether the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>person to whom it is supplied will use it for fraud.
He will not have the intention necessary for clause 7(1)(b) but will
fall within clause 7(1)(a).</div>
<a name="06062156000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment seeks to provide
not only that the article must be specifically made or adapted for use
in fraud but that the person who makes or adapts it must intend that it
be used in fraud. That would significantly limit the clause&#146;s
effect and would not catch either of those examples.</div>
<a name="06062156000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The importance of the clause is
that it should be able to cover both varieties of offence, thereby
allowing for the fact that those who make, adapt or supply articles for
use in fraud may not have any intention to carry out the fraud
themselves. That carries weight in the fight against organised criminal
gangs, which often prefer to engage in fraud at several moves from the
action, for example, by selling personal financial information. The aim
is that that will be used for a fraud, but they do not carry out the
fraud themselves. Clause 7 will not capture the actions of the
innocent, which necessarily include the actions of those innocently
unaware but somehow caught up in the commission of an
offence.</div>
<a name="06062156000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause 7
offence, like the existing law in section 25, does not contain a
dishonesty requirement, but requires that the article be made for use
in a fraud. Therefore, the supply or manufacture of articles, such as
devices and software, which are designed innocently, but might possibly
be misused to commit a fraud would not be grounds to give rise to a
charge for fraud.</div> <a name="06062156000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording used in clause 7 follows the existing law in section 25 of the
Theft Act and, as we have discussed, case law has established that it
requires a general intention to commit fraud. I hope that hon. Members
are reassured by that and that we can make some
progress.</div><a name="06062156000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000353"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000354"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause defines
&#147;article&#148; for the purposes of clause 6 and 7 offences and
some other connected provisions. It gives the term a breadth of meaning
that is needed in these days of computer crime. It makes it clear that

intense and rapid extension of technology in recent years, it is vital
that the new offences give sufficient coverage to articles such as

important, and I do not want in any way to reduce its effectiveness in

not refer to creditors of the business but to creditors of any person,

simplification and a clarification to use the simple phrase &#147;for
any fraudulent purpose&#148; rather than the obscure phrase that is
in the Bill. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will be able to tell me that
I am quite wrong and that there is a specific meaning that necessarily
attaches to the phrase and must be in the Bill. I look forward to his
response.</div><a name="06062156000102"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000356"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The amendment is designed to
rationalise the wording of clause 9 by focusing solely on the
fraudulent nature of the offender&#146;s conduct. In my view, it is
unnecessary.</div><a name="06062156000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
fraudulent trading offence originates with a recommendation in a 2002
Law Commission report on multiple offending. It was based on what the
commission concluded was a gap in the law that arises because it is
possible to prosecute UK incorporated companies for fraudulent trading
but not to pursue other fraudulent traders for that
offence.</div><a name="06062156000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 9
extends the fraudulent trading offence in section 458 of the Companies
Act 1985 by creating a corresponding offence that will apply to all
businesses not already covered by the 1985 Act. Logically, the wording
of clause 9 must follow that found in section 458&#151;hence the
wording in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062156000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
to bear it in mind that clause 9 creates a parallel offence linked to
the existing fraudulent trading offence. The rationale and structure of
the new offence flow directly from the Companies Act offence, and as
such attract the case law that attaches to it. If we were to start
changing the legislation, the courts would be busy trying to work out
why we changed precise wording in section 458. We must remain
consistent. Initiating a change here would have consequences for the
interpretation of section 458. Therefore, it is sensible and desirable
that the wording of clause 9 should stay as it is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div><a name="06062156000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We used the
phrase to ensure that we got the parallel offence right. The new
offence applies to businesses that obviously are not companies. The
creditors can be creditors of the business, but the business is not of
itself a legal person in the sense that companies or individuals are
legal persons. A partnership, or another business relationship, may not
of itself be a legal person, and the creditors can be creditors of the
business, but the business is not a legal person in its own right;
rather, the creditors will be creditors of the owners of the business,
who may or may not be the defendant.</div>
<a name="06062156000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that answers the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and that he can withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062156000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000357"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> Predictably, it does not. I have always found that
consistency in error bedevils our debates; it seems a pointless view
that just because a thing was done once before, it needs to be done
again, even if it is self-evidently unnecessary or otiose. I cannot
conceive of any circumstances in which</div>
<a name="06062156000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intent to defraud creditors of
any
person&#148;</div><a name="06062156000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
not be encompassed in the phrase &#147;for any fraudulent
purpose&#148;. It is a tautology, and plainly so. The only part of
the Solicitor-General&#146;s argument that commends itself to me is
the need to apply consistency between the two company offences. If we
introduce no error in law by removing a tautology, it is worth doing.
That is my personal opinion, but I give way to the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield, who may tell me why I am
wrong.</div><a name="06062156000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000358"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> For what it is worth&#151;and the hon. Gentleman
knows the number of times that I have argued over drafting&#151;I
agree entirely with him. That said, the words are completely innocuous
if they remain in the Bill as they are. They are just odd, and no more
than that can be
said.</div><a name="06062156000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000359"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> No more than that might be said, but it undoubtedly
will be. The words are odd, but what nags away at the back of my mind
is the fact that someone at some stage must have had an intention:
someone, in drafting the original Act, must have detected a
circumstance in which</div>
<a name="06062156000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intent to defraud creditors of
any person&#148;</div><a name="06062156000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">did not fall
within the general compass of a fraudulent purpose. However, we have
not heard yet what that distinction might have
been.</div><a name="06062156000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000360"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is over-optimistic
in his view that there was necessarily a rationale behind the drafting.
I have seen too much such legislation. There was the Public Processions
(Northern Ireland) Act 1998, which dealt with the playing of
&#147;musical or other instruments&#148;, and nobody was able to
explain what an &#147;other instrument&#148; might be. We actually
got that deleted as a result of my participation in that debate, but I
leave the hon. Gentleman to speculate on what was in the mind of the
draftsman in that occasion. I suspect that in this case the
legislation, particularly in view of its derivation and origin, belongs
to the classic period of belt-and-braces
drafting.</div><a name="06062156000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000361"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I say one word to the hon. Gentleman: bagpipes.
That is perhaps unfair; I am actually rather 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>fond of bagpipes, but they are commonly held not to be the most musical
of instruments, stirring though they are. He is probably right: it is a
belt-and-braces provision. I do not want to make a meal of it, and I do
not think that there is any mischief in the words remaining as they
are; it just irritates me when drafting is tautologous. When I rule
everything, I shall not have laws drafted like that. However, I shall
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062156000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062156000362"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Geoffrey Cox</b> (Torridge and West Devon) (Con): I do not
know whether this is a speech or an intervention; it was intended to be
the first, but it will be very short.</div>
<a name="06062156000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to this very
interesting and learned debate may lie in the fact that the section was
originally drafted in the Companies Act. For companies, there are
multifarious opportunities to have related
companies&#151;subsidiaries, parent companies and so on&#151;and
one may very well operate a company in order either to defer the debts
or to defraud the creditors of a related parent or subsidiary
company.</div><a name="06062156000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000364"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> I hear one company appositely named; I could probably
think of quite a few others. The point is that the wording was probably
interpolated from the Companies Act to deal with cases where, although
the creditors were not of the specific limited company, they were
creditors of a related company. The danger was that the defence might
argue that the debts related not to the company but to the subsidiary
or affiliated company. It might therefore be otiose to insert that when
one is charging a sole trader or a partnership.</div>
<a name="06062156000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">One suspects that that was the
reasoning behind section 458 of the Companies Act 1985, the wording of
which is not</div> <a name="06062156000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for any
other fraudulent purpose&#148;,</div>
<a name="06062156000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">as it is in clause 9(2)(b), but rather
relates to any fraudulent purpose. The general theory applying to
fraudulent trading is that a person can be charged for continuing to
trade in order to defraud the creditors of the company, or a related
company or person, or for carrying on the company to operate as part of
a wider fraud. I suspect that because the
wording</div><a name="06062156000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for any other
fraudulent purpose&#148;</div><a name="06062156000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">has
been translated from companies to sole traders, it might actually not
be necessary. The Government might simply have translated wording
apposite to limited companies to sole traders.</div>
<a name="06062156000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that was an intervention, it
was very long; if it was a speech, I hope that it was relatively
short.</div><a name="06062156000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000365"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am most grateful for that intervention by the
hon. Gentleman, who knows an awful lot more about the matter than I do.
His interpretation suggests that the requirement was supposed to be
inclusive and to expand the scope of the provision, rather than to be
exclusive and to narrow the scope. In that case, it is most likely that
the wording has been translated from one enactment to another, simply
as a matter of course, without anyone thinking about whether it is
necessary.</div> <a name="06062156000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat
what I said earlier: I do not think that any mischief is involved. I
want the clause to be able to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>used for lots of actions on the part of traders&#151;the disposal of
assets prior to liquidation and matters of that kind. I hope that it
will be enforced rigorously for those purposes. I want it to be as wide
as possible in its application. Given that retaining the words does not
reduce the width of the application but simply states it in two
different ways&#151;one partially and the other totally&#151;I can
find no fault with it. So, for the second time, I beg to ask leave to

in the Theft Act 1968. We agree that that is a sensible change,
particularly in the context of the Fraud Bill, under which 10 years is
the maximum penalty for the general offence of fraud. Fraudulent
trading can have serious consequences, and although relatively few
cases are prosecuted, average sentences are higher than for other types
of fraud.</div><a name="06062156000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000369"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> The amendments are quite separate, and I shall deal
with them in
turn.</div><a name="06062156000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 12
might sound like a very small distinction, but actually it has greater
import than would first appear. First, stylistically, it brings the
text of the clause in line with the clause title: &#147;Obtaining
services dishonestly&#148;. That seems appropriate.</div>
<a name="06062156000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
however, there is a difference between a dishonest act and a person who
performs an act dishonestly. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>A dishonest act is, or could be, interpreted to be so at a later date,
and the perpetrator may not be party to that interpretation. In other
words, he may not have been behaving dishonestly but may have committed
an act that, on consideration, is seen as dishonest. That puts the act
at one remove from the intent.</div>
<a name="06062156000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The distinction is very narrow:
in most cases, a person who commits a dishonest act will know perfectly
well that they are doing so and will have been acting dishonestly.
However, on a limited number of occasions, an act that could be
interpreted as dishonest is committed by a person who believes that he
is acting honestly. Using the adverb rather than the adjective would
remove any possibility of ambiguity or legal argument on that nice
distinction. There could be no distinction: if the person was obtaining
services dishonestly, he would be doing so by a dishonest act, but
would also know that he was doing so by a dishonest act because he was
acting
dishonestly.</div><a name="06062156000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000370"></a>Michael
Fabricant:</b> The hon. Gentleman is saying that the person
should have mens rea&#151;a guilty mind&#151;and that there should
be an intent to obtain services dishonestly. However, subsection (1)
also says that the act should be in breach of subsection (2). Does that
not also imply that he must have a guilty
mind?</div><a name="06062156000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000371"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I do not think that it does. Subsection (2) lists a
number of circumstances in which a person has obtained services, and I
do not think that the two necessarily relate.</div>
<a name="06062156000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is narrow and I
do not want to labour the point. However, simply using the adverb
improves the clause and makes it say exactly what the Minister would
want it to say. He may feel that the clause will be interpreted in that
way in any case, in which case the amendment becomes
unnecessary.</div><a name="06062156000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second amendment in the group, No. 13, is a probing amendment to enable
the Minister to say what I understood him to have said on Second
Reading. It relates to a particular circumstance in which the service
obtained is watching or taking in an event&#151;a sports match or a
performance perhaps&#151;without paying. There are circumstances in
which that would clearly be a fraudulent and dishonest act. A person
who goes under a fence, knowing perfectly well that he has avoided
going through the turnstile, is trying to obtain a service without
paying. That is not in dispute.</div>
<a name="06062156000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is a further and
greyer area: when a person is watching a match because he has secured a
vantage point from which he can see it, clearly with the intent of not
paying, but nevertheless without potential detriment to the person who
has put on the event. I can give an example of that from
Bath.</div> <a name="06062156000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I regularly
watch Bath play rugby; the experience used to be good, although it is
often unhappy nowadays. People can pay for seats at the Rec, the
recreation ground in Bath. I received my season tickets just today and
am now much less well off than I would otherwise have been. If a person
happens to live in one of the houses on Great Pulteney street that
overlook the ground, he can see the match for free. I do not think that
in any circumstances a person could be deprived of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div>the right to look out of his window or stand on his balcony and watch
the match for free. He is as entitled to look out of his property in
that direction as any other. That is not the
problem.</div><a name="06062156000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
one is clever, one can also go down one of the side turnings off Great
Pulteney street, hoick oneself up to look over a wall and see the match
equally free from a public thoroughfare. I do not believe that that
should be a criminal offence. It is merely a happenstance. The simple
fact that one can see the match from there does not mean that Bath
rugby football club&#151;or Bath Rugby plc&#151;would be entitled
to commence proceedings against someone who happened to be able to see
the match from that vantage point outside the ground&#146;s
perimeter.</div>
<a name="06062156000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will make it absolutely clear in his response, so that I
do not need to press the amendment, that in such circumstances an
offence would not be committed, despite the fact that the person was
not on their own property and was partaking of the event&#151;the
spectacle or match&#151;without paying and with the intent of not
paying, as they had no intention of going through a turnstile. Will he
reassure me that just because they have not tried to secure entry to
the ground, arena, theatre or whatever, they are not securing that
service dishonestly and would not be liable to prosecution under the
provision? If he can do so, it is not my intention to press the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000372"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman.
Although I understand what he is doing with the first amendment, I am
not sure that I agree with him. I wait with interest to hear what the
Solicitor-General will have to say, because it seems to me that the
nature of the obtaining of a service requires a &#147;dishonest
act&#148; to obtain it. Using that expression rather than the word
&#147;dishonestly&#148; might well be a correct piece of drafting
and does not in any way imply that dishonesty does not have to be
proved. I shall wait to hear what the Solicitor-General has to say.
</div><a name="06062156000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
regards the second amendment, again I shall wait with interest to hear
what the Solicitor-General has to say, but as the service is the thing
being obtained it strikes me that if someone is perching out of their
window watching a cricket match that they are not paying for, they are
not obtaining a service, which is the entry into the ground to watch
the cricket or football match.</div>
<a name="06062156000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000373"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> That is precisely the point. Is the service entry
to the ground or watching the match, event, spectacle or whatever? I am
not sure that we are as clear cut in that distinction as we would like
to be.</div>
<a name="06062156000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000374"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> And the hon. Gentleman was right to raise it.
Applying some common sense to subsection (2), I think that the service
must be the right to enter a particular area in order to watch the
game. If in fact one can watch the game from somewhere where one does
not have to pay for the service, that is tough on the service provider.
I certainly do not think that the Government intend to criminalise
people who look off their balconies, nor do I think that that the
subsection does so. His argument is ingenious, but I do not think that
it would carry much weight with the court.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 55</div><a name="06062156000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062156000375"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that there might be another potential difficulty that perhaps the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has not considered? One of the
issues that the Government considered in relation to clause 11 was the
problem of those who watch television through cable or other
connections that are supplied through fraudulent means. The difficulty
with the clause, if it were to be drafted as the hon. Gentleman wishes,
would be that those who watch sporting performances on television might
be caught by his redrafted clause. I am sure that he would not want
that.</div>
<a name="06062156000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000376"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> My hon. Friend raises an interesting
point&#151;perhaps another conundrum for the Solicitor-General to
answer&#151;and it seems to me that his argument has some
force.</div> <a name="06062156000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall wait
to hear from the Solicitor-General, but on both matters I think that
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, with whom I often agree, is for
once probably worrying about nothing.</div>
<a name="06062156000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000377"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall begin with amendment No. 13,
and reassure those who want to watch the rugby from Great Pulteney
street that they should be able to continue to do so. Not only that,
the crowds who sometimes watch the cricket from windows and rooftops
around the Oval are not intended to be caught by the
clause.</div><a name="06062156000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
test is the one in the Ghosh case in 1982 that I mentioned earlier. It
is a two-stage test that is well known. The first part is whether the
defendant&#146;s behaviour would be regarded as dishonest by the
ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people. If it would, the
second part is whether the defendant was aware that his conduct was
dishonest and would be regarded as such by reasonable and honest
people. When we apply those tests, we can distinguish the sorts of
circumstances that hon. Members are concerned about.</div>
<a name="06062156000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure those who watch a
game by luck and opportunity that they should not be in a position
where reasonable and honest people would regard them as acting
dishonestly. That test enables reassurance to be given in the
particular circumstances that concern hon. Members with regard to
amendment No.
13.</div><a name="06062156000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 12
would alter clause 11(1)(a), which requires that for the offence to be
made out a &#147;dishonest act&#148; is required. The hon. Member
for Beaconsfield has set out my case very well. Just to assist him in
that, I shall quote the Law Commission&#146;s 2002 report, which
stated:</div><a name="06062156000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should not be possible to commit the offence by omission alone. This
offence would not, for example, be committed by a person who innocently
happened to be on a boat and, despite hearing an announcement that
anyone who had not paid for the next trip should disembark, remained on
the boat and thus received a free ride&#148;.</div>
<a name="06062156000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government agree with the
view that there should be an act and that it should be explicit that
there is an act. We do not want to criminalise the obtaining of
services by omission, as that risks leaving citizens too much at the
mercy of unscrupulous service providers, who provide unrequested
services, for example through the internet or by telephone.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div><a name="06062156000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the dishonesty requirement
should provide protection from prosecution for the innocent, we also
wish to avoid a situation in which unscrupulous service providers might
feel able to pressurise anyone who had obtained services that they had
not requested. Indeed the formulation of clause 11 may discourage those
service providers from making unwanted services available in the first
place. In our consultations in 2004, clause 11 was widely welcomed and
no problems were raised on this aspect of it. I hope that, given those
reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06062156000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000378"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am most grateful to the Solicitor-General. That
was what I hoped to hear, and it will be of great reassurance to the
hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), who raised the issue of
watching sporting events on Second Reading. I am sure that he will be
satisfied with the response, and on the basis of what the
Solicitor-General has said, which is entirely what I expected him to
say, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062156000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="06062156000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000379"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in clause 11, page
5, line 7, leave out &#145;5&#146; and insert
&#145;10&#146;.</div><a name="06062156000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment simply deals with the penalty for the offence. I am mindful
of the fact that the existing penalty for the offence under the Theft
Act is five years&#146; imprisonment and that that has been
translated as a maximum into this new offence. My reason for tabling
the amendment was simply to discuss whether, in the light of current
circumstances, we might consider raising the maximum limit. We know
that the obtaining of services by deception or dishonestly, as the new
offence will be described, can run to many hundreds of thousands of
pounds in some cases. Admittedly, it may sometimes be that the service
provider is foolish, but there have been instances when the fraud has
been of considerable scope. Some operate a system over time that
deceives large numbers of people in a number of ways, and as a result
they receive a multiplicity of services and can live a life of ease and
luxury&#151;until they are caught&#151;but it is those who supply
the services who are the losers, because those who received them are
often unable to
pay.</div>
<a name="06062156000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="06062156000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
arises in my mind whether five years&#146; imprisonment in such
circumstances will always be sufficient. That is particularly so given
that we are living in an era when the perpetration of fraud of various
sorts is so much more sophisticated. One could put another figure on
it&#151;perhaps seven years&#151;but I ask the Committee to
consider that, because five years is what appeared in the Theft Act
1968, it does not necessarily have to remain at five years.</div>
<a name="06062156000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I reread the Theft Act prior
to the Committee stage, I realised how deliciously dated certain
aspects of it seem. Indeed, we touched on that when talking about going
equipped to cheat; and obtaining of services by deception has the
slight ring of a person coming along and, in rather a small way,
obtaining some service and being unable to pay for it. The classic
example is of a person going into a restaurant, ordering a meal and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>then being unable to pay for it&#151;and never having had the
intention of doing so. We are not dealing with such problems here. In
financial terms, they will often be substantial offences.</div>
<a name="06062156000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that, I am mindful that
it may not be the only chargeable offence. In certain circumstances,
especially if a great deal of money is involved, other fraud may be
involved that could lead to a charge under clause 2. However, I would
like the Solicitor-General to consider why we should make that
distinction in such circumstances, and whether it is time to raise the
maximum penalty. In the vast majority of cases, a penalty of more than
five years imprisonment may not be required, but it would be a pity if
prosecutors found themselves facing the fact that the easy and sensible
offence to charge attracted a penalty that they considered insufficient
to meet the gravity of the case.</div>
<a name="06062156000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000380"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I welcome you, Mr. Jones, to the Chair. I too
should declare an interest&#151;perhaps I should have done so earlier
today&#151;as a non-practising barrister, but not in such an
illustrious capacity as my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West
Devon (Mr. Cox).</div> <a name="06062156000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support the amendment. The Solicitor-General knows that I raised the
matter on Second Reading, and it is worth the Committee considering it.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, it would equalise
the position between the fraudulent obtaining of services and the
fraudulent obtaining of property or money. When we as legislators
consider maximum sentences, we should consider two things. The first is
the level of criminality and the second is the value of what has been
obtained.</div> <a name="06062156000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
perfectly conceivable that the level of ingenuity used by the criminal
to fraudulently obtain the provision of services may be just as
intricate and well developed as that needed to obtain property or
money. I therefore see no logical reason for drawing a distinction in
the maximum sentences.</div>
<a name="06062156000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second question is the
value of what has been obtained. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield said, other parts of the Bill recognise the fact that the
world has moved on, as has the British economy. For example, it
recognises that it ought to be possible to commit an offence in which a
machine is deceived, although that takes away the concept of deception;
it recognises that today&#146;s economy is different to that of 1968
or 1978. However, it should also recognise that the economy has moved
on, in the sense that it is predominantly a service economy, or at
least more so than ever it was.</div>
<a name="06062156000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
just examine professional and financial services, although they are
valuable and if they are obtained by deception or fraudulently a
service of great value could have been gained. We should also consider
the worlds of sport and entertainment. The hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome talked about what may be obtained by somebody who watches a
sporting performance. How about what may be obtained by someone who
gains the services of a footballer or pop star by some form of fraud?
The value of such services could be very high indeed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div><a name="06062156000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take topical examples, if a
small football club were fraudulently to obtain the services of David
Beckham or Wayne Rooney, the value of those services&#151;metatarsals
allowing&#151;would be extremely high, higher than if that club had
by some form of fraud managed to obtain Wayne Rooney&#146;s car or
house. When we consider the situation in the modern British economy,
which is substantially a service economy, it would be wrong not to
accept that a criminal with the same degree of ingenuity as one
carrying out another type of fraud, obtaining services of the same
value, also merits a sentence of 10 years&#146;
imprisonment.</div><a name="06062156000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, not every example of obtaining services dishonestly would merit
a sentence of 10 years, and it may be that my examples are somewhat
extreme, but surely maximum sentences are designed to cater for extreme
examples. The Committee should consider making sentences equal for
criminal acts of equal
value.</div><a name="06062156000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000381"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> One is rather loth to enter the great debate about
sentencing at the moment, given the extreme views that have been taken
on all sides of the matter by various people in the past few days.
However, we would all like to see a degree of consistency. I have
argued for a long time personally and on behalf of my party that the
basis on which sentences are made should be quite different and that
there should be more openness and honesty about the intention of the
sentencer. That is a commonly held view, and I do not know why it is
not done.</div> <a name="06062156000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Offences
under clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 carry a ten-year maximum sentence,
whereas the offence under clause 6 and the one that we are currently
considering under clause 11 carry a five-year maximum. The hon. Member
for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) was right to say that we
should consider carefully the degree of criminality. If one were to
take that to its absolute, one would have to say that there is no
difference in the level of criminality of an offence under clause 6
from the other offences, only in the opportunity to put it into effect.
There is a time difference between going equipped and committing an
offence. A person may never actually commit the offence, which I
presume is why it carries a lower penalty. We are satisfied that the
five-year maximum is appropriate in clause
6.</div><a name="06062156000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 11, I
hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the value of services
dishonestly obtained, but I have some difficulty in thinking of
circumstances in which the clause would cover high-value services. The
opportunity to ask Mr. Rooney to play for the local football team with
the intent of not paying him at the end of his contract is unlikely and
the idea that he would do so for very long is rather a far-fetched
example and may involve other actionable offences such as breach of
contract or misrepresentation. We need a degree of proportionality on
the matter. I am open to the suggestion that a higher maximum sentence
is required, but I would be much happier with it if I were satisfied
that sentencing policy was in a fit state to accommodate maximum
sentencing at different levels, that judges were given the proper
discretion to do their job effectively and that there was a clarity and
honesty in sentencing that is not there
presently.</div><a name="06062156000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
general, some balance is appropriate between this Bill&#146;s
provisions and those dealing with analogous offences 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>under the Theft Act. To what degree has the Solicitor-General made that
assessment? Is this simply a read-across, or has he formed the view
that the offences set out in clause 11 are consonant with similar
offences under the Theft Act and will carry the same and appropriate
penalties? If that assessment has not been made, it should be made at
the earliest
opportunity.</div><a name="06062156000176"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000382"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We should begin by acknowledging that
the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth raised the matter with me on
Second Reading, and I have considered it again. My reaction was to
wonder whether, in order to get some parallel with offences relating to
property and money, there was an argument for extending the measures. I
thought about it with some care. There is always an argument for
increasing sentences, but then I looked at the average sentence for
obtaining services by deception, the parallel existing offence that the
measures will replace. The average sentence handed down in 2004 was
just over six months. In those circumstances, a penalty of five years
and an unlimited fine rather than the average sentence appears
adequate. We must consider what is proportionate in the
circumstances.</div><a name="06062156000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Commission considered the issue in its 2002 report on fraud. I did not
explore it in great depth, but paragraph 8.16
says:</div><a name="06062156000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
conviction on indictment, the maximum sentence available for the
existing offence of obtaining services by deception is five years, and
we see no reason why the maximum for the new offence should not be the
same.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
consulted on the matter, but received few responses. It might have been
useful if the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who originally
raised the point, had suggested it at that time. I am sure that he was
otherwise engaged winning his seat in Rugby.</div>
<a name="06062156000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the average for even the
most serious offences is just over six months&#146; imprisonment, a
five-year maximum has the degree of proportionality that one seeks when
trying to assess what the appropriate sentence ought to be. In view of
the fact that those consultees who responded endorsed the five-year
limit, that the Law Commission believes that it is right and that the
average sentence for the existing offence appears to be just over six
months, I believe that it is the right balance.</div>
<a name="06062156000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not close my mind on
the issue. If we feel at a later stage that the penalty is inadequate,
we can reconsider it, but given how the courts are dealing with such
offences, the measures will give judges enough flexibility to impose
the maximum sentence in the most serious cases while preserving the
average sentences for those that are indeed
average.</div><a name="06062156000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000383"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I listened carefully to what the Solicitor-General
said. I would simply make one point to him, of which he may already be
aware. The fact that the average sentence is of six months&#146;
imprisonment comes as no surprise to me, but I am not sure that it is
the central issue to the argument. On the whole, the sort of offence
and the reasons why such offences tend to be charged is because they
are of a rather low-grade kind. There are instances where, as I
indicated in my opening remarks, substantial services of substantial
value can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>obtained. It is in such instances that I raise the question as to
whether five years is necessarily sufficient. Rather than looking at
the average of the sentences passed for this type of offence, that
would require looking at whether there were instances where judges had
been imposing the maximum and may even in their sentencing remarks been
making suggestions that the sentence does not entirely meet the gravity
of the offence, as the Solicitor-General will be only too
aware.</div><a name="06062156000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
of the nature of the discount that a person attracts for pleading
guilty, as an example, often in such cases&#151;and my experience is
that they often end in guilty pleas&#151;that will already be
substantially shortening any sentence that is going to be served,
because it will start with five years as the maximum and then have to
discount it against that. I respectfully suggest to the
Solicitor-General that that is a more fertile area to look at than the
average sentence passed. That said, and mindful and grateful that it
will be looked at again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000384"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I have a brief inquiry. I take the view that
officers of a company should be individually responsible for the
actions of the company when it acts dishonestly. However, as has been
pointed out, there is no mens rea provision in the clause. The company
officer does not have to have formed the dishonest intention himself or
herself to be guilty of an offence under this section unless there is
perhaps another construction on the clause of which I am unaware. That
is of some concern. Is the Solicitor-General&#146;s view that as an
officer of the company they have a duty and responsibility to be aware
of whether the action in which they are consenting or conniving is a
dishonest and fraudulent act? If that is the view then by consenting or
conniving, as the clause says, they would have formed the dishonest
intent at that point. I would be grateful if the Solicitor-General told
me whether that is the construction that he places on the clause and
explained how precisely it would work.</div>
<a name="06062156000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000385"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I find myself pipped to the post by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome in rising so quickly to his feet, and I
would not rise myself unless there were a further slight gloss to apply
to precisely the same point I wanted to raise. I think that part of the
answer to his question can be given; namely, that as a company can only
commit an offence through its officers, it must follow that if the body
corporate is going to commit the offence, someone in the body corporate
must be acting dishonestly. That would normally be the person who would
be seen to be consenting or conniving to the commission of the
offence.</div> <a name="06062156000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">But the nub,
and maybe the point that the hon. Gentleman is getting at, is that it
seems to me that it at least technically possible on the reading of
clause 12&#151;I am aware of its derivation; this has been around for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>rather a long time&#151;for one to have a company where a body
corporate commits an offence through the dishonesty of one of its
directors, but with the consent of another of its directors who is not,
himself, acting dishonestly. Technically, in such circumstances both of
them would be convicted of the offence when the body corporate was
convicted. If that is the case, it might be readily curable. However,
the Solicitor-General might indicate that that is not necessary, or
that if we were to try to cure it we would cause all sorts of other
problems. However, that was what struck me about the clause as, I
suspect, the main issue struck the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome.</div><a name="06062156000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000386"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> In essence, clause 12 follows section
18 of the Theft Act 1968. It is the standard provision that makes
company officers who are party to the commission of an offence under
the Bill by their body corporate liable to be charged for the offence
as well as the company. A director, manager, secretary or other similar
officer of the body corporate, or a person purporting to act in that
capacity, has to be in a position in which he can be diligent about the
work that he does. There must be a reasonable standard of diligence;
such people must know what they are about. The requirement in the
legislation is connivance or consent, so they must know what they are
conniving or consenting to. If they are conniving or consenting to
something that is clearly dishonest, and they are sufficiently aware of
that to be aware of the implications, then they are in a position in
which they have connived or consented to an
offence.</div>
<a name="06062156000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000387"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I take the Solicitor-General&#146;s point, but
there is a difference between consent and connivance. Connivance, by
its nature, implies guilty knowledge&#151;that is how I always
understand the word, given its ordinary meaning&#151;whereas consent
need not. It might be that there is a flaw in the Theft Act 1968, or it
might be a problem that has never arisen, but it is at least possible,
taking the strict technical meaning, that the body corporate commits an
offence because one of its directors does so deliberately&#151;so the
dishonesty comes from that director&#151;but several other directors
consent innocently to the commission of that offence. In that case, as
the clause is drafted, they could be caught with all the draconian
consequences that flow from it. I have to accept that the reality is
that the prosecutor probably would not prosecute them. However, if
there is a way of avoiding the danger that they could be prosecuted, it
might be worth considering, because they are not the people against
whom the clause is, or should be,
aimed.</div><a name="06062156000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000388"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause is aimed against those who
have given informed consent, to use the phrase, in relation to an act
that has been done. As the hon. Gentleman said, for a company to be
liable, an officer of that company has to have committed the offence.
That is the identification principle. Others may connive or consent,
but they must know what they are conniving or consenting to. It must be
an informed consent, or a connivance, so they must be sufficiently 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>informed that they are aware of the nature&#151;or, at least, to some
extent, of the dishonesty or implications&#151;of the act.</div>
<a name="06062156000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some provisions of this type
include neglect, but that is not included here. This is not about
somebody who is a bit negligent and does not know; he has to have the
ability to take a view on a matter, and then to have taken that view by
having given his consent in a practical way. We consider that that
informed consent is sufficient to amount to a knowledge of dishonesty.
Whether a person is, himself, dishonest might well be a different
matter; it is a fine line. The question is whether they are they well
enough informed about the implications to have taken a step that
amounts to consent based on uninformed knowledge of the possible
consequences.</div><a name="06062156000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000389"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in clause 13, page
6, line 3, at end add</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;that the
Secretary of State may by order
prescribe.'.</div><a name="06062156000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I thank the Solicitor-General for his letter in response to my point
made to his ministerial colleague on second reading. The intention of
the amendment is to add clarity to subsection 4(b), which defines
&#147;related offence&#148; as &#147;conspiracy to
defraud&#148; and</div>
<a name="06062156000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other offence
involving any form of fraudulent conduct or
purpose.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition does not have any clear indication of what appendices are
intending to be included, and I accept that there are a finite number.
It would be of value, in terms of clarity, if the Secretary of State
prescribed the offences that he considers to be caught by that
definition. Everyone would then be clear about which offences are being
referred to in applying section 13. It is a fine point. The
Solicitor-General may be able to help me out by saying whether he will
accept the amendment or what his definition is&#151;that will have
almost the same effect&#151;if he cares to read it into the
transcript.</div><a name="06062156000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000390"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am not going to read a definition as
such. As drafted, in our view, clause 13 makes clear that the offences
under discussion are those involving any form of fraudulent purpose or
conduct. That provides the right degree of specification for the
context. We should bear in mind that the clause addresses the needs of
civil justice and not to be deprived of evidence in property
proceedings on the grounds that the answers and documents given may
incriminate the person who gives them.</div>
<a name="06062156000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the stage when someone is
giving answers, the matter of whether an answer or a document discloses
a fraud under the Bill, or some other type of fraud, may not be clear.
It is likely that it will only be clear that his answers might show
that some form of fraud has taken place. That might be a fraud that
could be prosecuted under the Bill, or possibly under section 458 of
the Companies Act, VAT legislation or tax law. We should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div>not tie the law to a specific list of offences which might leave gaps in
which a person who does not want to answer questions, might say that it
may or may not fit into a particular list.</div>
<a name="06062156000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want any form of fraudulent
purpose or conduct to be covered by that provision. For example, with a
list of specific offences, a person might say that the clause does not
apply. Therefore, he is not going to answer any questions because he
might disclose an offence of benefit fraud, for example, that should be
dealt with under the Social Security Acts. We would have to list
everything in order to make sure that we do not give a loophole, that
someone could use not to answer questions in a civil case.</div>
<a name="06062156000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could put the Social
Security Acts on the list and all the offences that could be
characterised as fraud. However, it would be much simpler, more
straightforward and understandable for individuals and for the court,
to know that we have a generalised definition in the Bill. Ultimately,
it will be a matter for the judge in the trial as to whether a party to
civil proceedings can refuse to answer questions on grounds of
self-incrimination. It is the judge who has to decide whether clause 13
should apply or not and clause 13 exemption applies. Judges are
perfectly capable of applying clause 13. Our approach is better than
the specific list of offences that the amendment suggests. A specific
list would add to a great deal more confusion. It might also encourage
persons who wish to refuse to answer questions to find a loophole.
Something might not be on the list, which they might have cause to
fear, and they might not want to incriminate
themselves.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000391"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> Let us suppose the party to the civil litigation was
obliged under the clause to concede that part of the property that had
been accumulated had been invested in a drugs enterprise. Would he be
protected under the first line of subsection (2), as further defined in
subsection (4)? I respectfully suggest that he might very well not be,
which would be a grave lacuna in the protections under the Bill and
likely to be incompatible with the European convention on human rights.
If a party to civil litigation&#151;let us say that he is a
trustee&#151;is obliged to answer that part of the property has been
invested in a drugs enterprise, and if he answers honestly, as he must,
he could, as I read the Bill, be prosecuted on the strength of his
admission, because drugs enterprises would not necessarily include
fraudulent conduct. Will the Solicitor-General give urgent and genuine
consideration to the real risk that there is a lacuna in the clause and
particularly to the compatibility of its provisions with article 6,
among others, of the convention.</div>

Solicitor-General:</b> In the end, it will be up to a judge to
decide how to apply the provisions. However, I shall examine the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point and its implications, and I shall then write
to him, if that is appropriate. I suspect that there is not a lacuna,
but he raises an interesting and potentially difficult point, and I
ought to give it more thought. If necessary, we can return to it on

<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>judge makes the judgment. Is it the judge in the civil proceedings who

<a name="06062156000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000395"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> The Solicitor-General is nodding, so that is the
point at which the person is excused or otherwise. In that case, what
happens in cases where criminal proceedings take place subsequently and
the prosecution wishes to use evidence that was given on the basis of a
decision by the civil court judge? What if that person was not covered
by the clause, and the civil proceedings judge had wrongly directed
that the person was obliged to answer the questions, because the
offence was not an offence or a related offence under the clause? The
judge in the criminal proceedings would inevitably say that the
evidence was admissible, and nothing could be done to turn back the
clock. The defendant&#146;s convention rights would be breached by
virtue of those two decisions, both of which could be entirely proper.
Obviously, one of the decisions must be mistaken, but they can both be
made in good faith by two judges in quite different
proceedings.</div> <a name="06062156000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">A degree
of clarity in the definition, rather than it allowing an infinitely
expandable group of related offences, would therefore be advantageous.
It would be perfectly in order in statute terms to say that all
offences are covered by the provision. That would very debatable in
terms of convention rights, but it is a perfectly arguable position to
say that all offences could be covered. The Minister would then have a
provision to say that, on any offence, that the information would not
be admissible.</div> <a name="06062156000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is in some difficulties, having two points at which an offence
is included or not: first, when the judgment is made in civil
proceedings, and then when it is made in subsequent criminal
proceedings. The judgments can be different on quite proper grounds.
So, I invite the Solicitor-General to give that further consideration
before Report, as I fear that we may unintentionally be producing a new
difficulty through that lack of precision.</div>
<a name="06062156000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000396"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I am sorry to have been out of the room briefly
when the hon. Gentleman first raised the question. It seems to me that
it cannot have been the Government&#146;s intention to remove the
privilege against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings&#151;if
that is indeed what clause 13 does, as highlighted by my hon. Friend
the Member for Torridge and West Devon, outside the scope of fraud and
related offences&#151;and that in those circumstances, the provision
must be wrong. If the Solicitor-General can reassure us on Report or in
writing that we have misunderstood the position, so be it. Otherwise,
the Government will be constrained to do something about it, because it
is clearly incompatible with every principle of law in this country,
quite apart from the Human Rights Act 1998.
</div><a name="06062156000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000397"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I think the waters are rather murkier than might
have been presumed, so a little further consideration is required, but
if the Solicitor-General does not accept that and thinks that the
provision perfectly self-evident, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>I have obviously failed to understand the
situation&#151;which is entirely likely, as I do not have the
expertise in these matters of the hon. Members for Torridge and West
Devon and for Beaconsfield. If I have misunderstood, I would be
delighted if the Solicitor-General explained what I have
misunderstood.</div>
<a name="06062156000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000398"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Briefly, the intention of clause 13 is
to remove the right relating to self-incrimination in property cases.
However, if the person answers in civil proceedings, the evidence
cannot subsequently be used in a criminal trial&#151;in a drugs case
of the sort to which the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon
referred and which I said I would examine in greater depth. If the
person refused to answer questions in civil proceedings, the privilege
against self-incrimination is not removed, if his answer relates to a
drugs offence.</div> <a name="06062156000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
person refused to answer but the civil judge ruled that subsection (1)
applied, and ordered him to do so, the use of the evidence is
prohibited by subsection (2). We do not consider that a criminal judge,
who has to comply with human rights legislation, would take a different
view from a civil judge. Even if neither applied the Human Rights Act
1998, the evidence would be excluded under section 78 of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984. I think that we are covered, but I hear
what the hon. Gentlemen have said, so I shall look again at this
complicated area of law. On the face of it, the provision seems
reasons, but, as I have indicated, I will look at it
again.</div>
<a name="06062156000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000399"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General and look
forward to hearing his further consideration at a later
stage.</div>
<a name="06062156000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000400"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> I wonder if I might make a supplementary point on the
clause. I am necessarily thinking as I go along, but I ask the
Solicitor-General to consider one further point. Under subsection (1),
and leaving aside the question of &#147;complying with any
order&#148; for now, the person would not be excused from</div>
<a name="06062156000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;answering any question put to him
in proceedings relating to property...on the ground that doing so
may incriminate
him&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062156000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">leaving
aside also the other persons referred
to&#151;</div><a name="06062156000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of an offence
under this Act or a related
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would appear
that if what the Solicitor-General just said is correct, someone would
retain their privilege if answering might incriminate them of a drugs
offence. That was the Solicitor-General&#146;s answer to my question.
In those circumstances, the defendant would be entitled at the first
stage to say to the civil judge, &#147;I am not answering because my
answer may incriminate me of an offence.&#148; The difficulty I
foresee is that the judge in a civil case will not be able to inquire
much further. He may have to say, &#147;Will you tell me for what
offence you think I may afford you the grounds to refuse before I can
decide whether you are correct?&#148;</div>
<a name="06062156000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I foresee
some difficulty that may benefit from further consideration by the
Solicitor-General. Would he be good enough to write to me on how the
system would work under clause 13? Clearly, if the offence is a drugs
offence or another offence unrelated to property, the system will be
highly unsatisfactory at the civil stage of proceedings. I imagine that
it will be a judge with a glowering face who faces a litigant who says,
&#147;I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>taking the fifth and the offence is not one relating to
property.&#148; It is difficult to see how the system will work, so I
would be most grateful for further
examination.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000401"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000402"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon raised
a point that I was coming on to: the fact that the litigant must decide
during the civil proceedings what he might be accused of at a future
stage by a prosecuting authority. He must decide about the range of
offences on which he might be indicted before seeking to excuse himself
of giving evidence. That is not an entirely satisfactory position to be
in. Given that the Solicitor-General has said that he will reconsider
the matter and communicate his views to the Committee, and with the
specific leave of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon because I
do not want to catch him out again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000406"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> We come now to the clauses on commencement. The
amendments deal with the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.
We could have a long debate on the merits or otherwise of the offence,
but that would not be a productive use of the Committee&#146;s time
because there is broad agreement on both sides that the common law
offence should be abolished. That is the theoretical position of the
Law Commission, which indicated that it was insupportable to retain the
offence in law once the new statute was in place as a replacement.
However, on Second Reading, the Minister said, quite properly, that
although he wanted the common law offence to be abolished, he had to
take note of the very strong reservations expressed in the consultation
process, not only by the wider spectrum of consultees but specifically
by parts of the judiciary, who together with some of the prosecuting
authorities perceived the offence of conspiracy to defraud as being of
value.</div><a name="06062156000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I slightly
discount the opinions of prosecuting authorities, because it is always
helpful to them to have the widest possible number of offences at their
disposal to secure a conviction. For them to argue that they should
have a wider spectrum, even in the context of new offences, is to some
extent to be expected and is natural. However, it is not a position
that we as a legislature should take if we are content that the full
range of offences under the broad title of fraud is covered by the new
law.</div><a name="06062156000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The offence of
conspiracy to defraud has been widely criticised. As I said on Second
Reading, one of my principal concerns about it is that, because it is a
catch-all offence, it provides a very straightforward route by which
the dual criminality requirements of an extradition application can be
met. It is easy to establish that someone has, or could have, committed
the offence in this country and that that person is therefore
extraditable on a related fraud offence in another country. I
instinctively feel that that is a dangerous
position.</div><a name="06062156000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
having listened to the arguments on both sides and being firm in my
conviction that the offence of conspiracy to defraud should be removed
at the earliest opportunity, I accept the Minister&#146;s comment
that he would prefer a &#147;suck it and see&#148; approach in the
short term, so that an assessment can be made of how the new offences
bed down and of the pattern of prosecutions. He was kind enough to
provide the draft guidance for prosecutors, which I think is extremely
helpful.</div> <a name="06062156000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We therefore
have a choice. The first course of action open to us is to have a
period of review in which the Solicitor-General or the Attorney-General
carefully consider the prosecution patterns and whether there have been
offences that have proved impossible to prosecute except under
conspiracy to defraud, followed by introduction of new primary
legislation to abolish the common law offence. Alternatively, at this
stage and as a better process, we could incorporate into the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>Bill a provision for abolition, with safeguards for the Minister in the
form of a delay in commencement, as I have suggested, or a sunset
clause for the offence, as suggested in the amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for Beaconsfield. Either approach ends at almost precisely
the same result. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach has an
automaticity that mine does not&#151;mine simply allows for a delay
in commencement of the relevant part of the Bill until such time as the
Minister introduces an Order in Council. To some extent mine is a more
Government-friendly amendment than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s in that
his forces their hand, whereas mine invites them to consider the point.
The merit of both courses is that we would not have to start from
square one with a new Bill or find another suitable vehicle for the
repeal or abolition of the conspiracy to defraud offence. Either way,
the spade work is done, the legislation is on the statute book and
someone only has to press the button to make it
happen.</div><a name="06062156000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the
Solicitor-General has made it clear that he would prefer to abolish the
offence in due course, it is unquestionably better in procedural terms
to deal with it in the Bill now, rather than revisit the matter later.
However many Home Office and Department for Constitutional Affairs
Bills we have to deal with month in, month out and year in, year out,
hon. Members can bet their lives that someone will say that none of
them are appropriate for the specific purpose and there will be a
substantial delay, which is avoidable and unnecessary. I commend my
amendment and the new clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="06062156000235"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000407"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is quite
right: new clauses 2 and 9 set out different ways to achieve the same
thing. I prefer my amendment, because the implication in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s is that although the common law offence of
conspiracy is abolished, that can be delayed to enable a review to take
place. I drafted my amendment on the basis that we should have a
five-year period to see how the new Act operates, after which it would
be incumbent on the Government, if they decided to keep the common law
conspiracy to defraud offence, to get a resolution of both Houses of
Parliament to do so. I was trying to reflect the debate on Second
Reading. I was persuaded by the Solicitor-General and by rereading the
Bill that in the next five years we may conclude that, despite best
efforts, the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud must be
retained. I am open-minded about that. The arguments about why it would
be desirable to get rid of the offence&#151;if that is
possible&#151;have been well
rehearsed.</div><a name="06062156000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
common law offence is wide and has some unintended consequences, the
worst of which is the possibility of an individual being prosecuted for
conspiracy to commit an offence which, if he had acted on his own,
would not amount to a substantive offence at all. That has always been
the greatest criticism levelled against it. However, having said that I
also accept&#151;after conversations with others who have had greater
use of the conspiracy offence&#151;that it is and may remain an
important tool in bringing prosecutions that cannot be covered by the
offences that we have
identified.</div><a name="06062156000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am open
to persuasion. I should like the common law conspiracy offence to go,
but that might not be possible. New clause 9 would enable that to
happen in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div>straightforward fashion. If there were unanimity that it should not go
within five years, the Government would only have to introduce a
resolution in both Houses of Parliament, on which we could vote pretty
readily&#151;it is a matter of half an afternoon&#146;s business in
both Houses&#151;in which case we would have decided that it should
remain. Knowing after nine years in the House how the place works, my
worry is that if we do not do that or accept the proposal advanced by
the hon. Gentleman, it will be difficult to find Government time even
for a short Bill to get rid of the common law offence of conspiracy. I
should add that it would be difficult whether the present Government or
a Conservative Government were in office. That is the reality, so I do
not want us to let this moment pass and lose the opportunity for what I
think can be relatively short consideration, probably backed up by a
report produced by the Government or a further report produced by the
Law Commission on which Parliament can base a final decision, having
had an opportunity to see how the Act works in
practice.</div><a name="06062156000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Government to consider in a constructive light either my proposal or
that of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, because it is difficult
to see, particularly as regards new clause 9, any real downside for the
Government in accepting it, or any downside in the operation of the
courts system or the bringing of justice. It is a simple device that
would ensure that, within the next five years, the matter would be
reconsidered in a manner that did not take up too much of the
House&#146;s time, and we could make a final decision with the
benefit of a more informed view of the operation of the
legislation.</div><a name="06062156000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000408"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> It seems clear in the draft guidance that the
Solicitor-General has helpfully allowed all of us on the Committee to
see that the Government&#146;s intention is, if they can, to persuade
prosecutors not to use the common law offence, but to use instead the
new statutory offences in the Bill. As has been said, there is a
measure of agreement in the Committee that that is a wise thing for the
Government to do. If that is the case, it would also be wise of the
Government to make it as clear as possible to prosecutors that the
Government&#146;s intention is that the common law offence should, if
possible, be phased out. Adopting new clause 9 would give the clearest
possible signal in that regard and might help the Government to achieve
what they are properly trying to achieve in the draft guidance. For
that reason, I support the new
clause.</div><a name="06062156000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000409"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> Not having been present for previous debates on the
Bill, I am uncertain of the basis on which the Solicitor-General
advanced the argument for continuing the conspiracy to defraud offence.
I can understand the need to see how the clause unfolds&#151;I was
going to say &#147;unravels&#148;, but that would probably be an
unfortunate way of putting it. I hope that it does not unravel. I can
understand the need to see how the clause unfolds in practice in the
courts. It is presumably possible to indict a defendant for conspiring
to commit fraud under the Bill, so that one would have a charge of
conspiracy to commit fraud with the particulars of the offence to be
committed in one of the three ways set out in the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div><a name="06062156000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government&#146;s
objective of drawing a wide offence of fraud is achieved, it is hard to
see what is left for conspiracy to defraud. I know that the
Solicitor-General is not necessarily saying that anything may be left;
it is just a question of testing to see. I imagine that I am right
about that, but if any specific instance or occasion of fraud were
thought to be omitted potentially from the Bill, I would be interested
in hearing about it in the Minister&#146;s response. I, for my part,
cannot see one and I am surprised by the Solicitor-General&#146;s
want of confidence in the Bill that he is presenting.</div>
<a name="06062156000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fraud is a broadly defined
offence and it seems to me that there will be little opportunity for
indicting the common law conspiracy to defraud. Judges will, I suspect,
want to hear a justification in the light of the Act&#151;as the Bill
will be&#151;for why the common law conspiracy is being indicted.
Once the Bill becomes law and has settled into the mind of the
profession, I would be surprised to see any further conspiracies to
defraud on indictment, because judges have historically wanted to
understand what it is about a conspiracy to defraud&#151;a common law
conspiracy&#151;that it is required on an indictment. Why not a
substantive offence? Why not a conspiracy to commit a substantive
offence? When the new offence exists, they will ask, &#147;Why not
conspiracy to commit these substantive offences, or this offence
committable in a number of ways?&#148; Many prosecutors will feel,
before they put a conspiracy to defraud count on the indictment, that
they will be forced to justify it in a preliminary hearing, or possibly
a preparatory hearing. I suspect that they will be deterred by that
prospect when the Bill is enacted and its provisions become available
to
them.</div><a name="06062156000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="06062156000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether there will be many opportunities for the Government to watch
how this measure is used. I hope that I have not perplexed the
Solicitor-General; If I have not made my point clear, it is basically
that if I were prosecuting, and I had this measure to indict fraud,
whether it be on the basis of a conspiracy to commit it, or a
substantive charge of fraud, I would expect the judge to be quite harsh
to me if I chose to indict for a conspiracy to defraud. He would want
to know why&#151;what was the specific reason? What did I espy in the
conspiracy to defraud that went wider than the charges of conspiracy to
commit the other substantive offences?</div>
<a name="06062156000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect, therefore, that
there will not be much testing of the provision. I very much doubt
whether many conspiracies to defraud will be seen on the indictment. I
imagine that the Solicitor-General will respond, &#147;Well, if
that&#146;s the case, then so be it&#151;we&#146;ll get rid of
it,&#148; but if, as I predict, it simply withers on the vine, would
it not be better to interpolate into this Bill a provision for its
termination, than to wait for all the process to be gone through, in
years to come? It would have to be removed by a special Act of
Parliament, or by some insertion in another Act reforming the criminal
law; I would suggest the
latter.</div><a name="06062156000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000410"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hoped not to have to go into why we
need to retain conspiracy to defraud, because I thought that there was
consensus on that, but for the benefit of the hon. Member for Torridge
and West 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>Devon I shall explain why we need to retain it. There is broad consensus
that we probably need to retain it for the time being, because there
are circumstances in which it may need to be used. I have circulated a
copy of the working draft of the Attorney-General&#146;s guidance on
the use of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud and the
circumstances in which it may continue to be used. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman has it; we hope to be able to publish it when Royal Assent is
given to this Bill. The aim of that guidance is to indicate the
Attorney-General&#146;s wish that we do not use conspiracy unless it
is necessary to do so, but it accepts that there may well be
circumstances in which it is necessary.</div>
<a name="06062156000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We wish to review the operation
of conspiracy to defraud after three years. We want to see how this
Bill, when it is law, affects the way in which prosecutions take place.
We hope that it will cover most circumstances, although it will not
cover them all, and that the courts and prosecutors can therefore
examine the Bill and other legislation to see whether most of the
mischiefs that we want to deal with can be dealt with otherwise than by
conspiracy to
defraud.</div><a name="06062156000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all want
that common law offence to be removed, and we hope that we will be able
to do that in due course. We hope at the end of three years to be in a
position to say that we will remove it. We all accept that we need to
wait for that three-year period to end. My concern about the amendments
is that they seem an untidy way of going about that removal. Having a
sword of Damocles dangling over the legislation, or over the common law
offence, would create a level of uncertainty among prosecutors about
whether they ought to be charging it. Parliament will clearly have said
that it should not be there, and there will be a time scale on it.
Well, perhaps we do that with other offences, but in this circumstance
we would be saying, over a period of five years&#151;or,
alternatively, a shorter period&#151;that the intention is to get rid
of it. The concern is that that would have a negative effect on our
prosecutions from the moment of Royal Assent, as Parliament would have
expressed its view that the offence should be abolished. There would
then be uncertainty and possibly a little confusion among prosecutors
about how very serious alleged offences and offenders should be
investigated and charged, and whether they should be using the offence
at all. Arguably, there would be the Attorney-General&#146;s guidance
to reassure them, but there would also be the will of Parliament
suggesting that Parliament does not have a great deal of faith in this
offence. That is an untidy and uncertain way of proceeding.</div>
<a name="06062156000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that there is
any great difference in view, at least among Front Bench Members, on
what ought to be done. In terms of how things should be done, I think
that there is a fear that perhaps the Government will not get round to
doing them. I have noticed&#151;the Opposition have made quite a
point of saying this&#151;that there has not been a dearth of
criminal justice Acts in recent years. I suspect that in the coming
years there will not be a dearth of such Acts either, and that will
enable conspiracy to defraud to be dealt
with.</div><a name="06062156000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000411"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> My heart sinks. The last thing that I want to do
is to encourage another criminal justice Act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div>in any circumstances. Swords of Damocles concentrate minds wonderfully.
The one thing that I have learned in politics in the past nine years is
that most of the problems that we experience are due to inertia.
Anything that shifts inertia is worth having.</div>
<a name="06062156000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it
difficult to accept that introducing my sunset clause will suddenly
mean that the existing law becomes unusable. I find that a poor
argument. There are sunset clauses for all sorts of other things that
we have done&#151;or that we do&#151;in this Parliament. They do
not mean that the legislation becomes unusable as a
result.</div>
<a name="06062156000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000412"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Not so much unusable, because that is
not what I have argued. I have argued that such a provision would
produce uncertainty. It is untidy and uncertain, and that uncertainty
would lead to some prosecutors feeling that they should not charge
under conspiracy to defraud. That might well mean that the full range
of the culpability of a particular defendant might not be covered, even
though our intention is that it should be.</div>
<a name="06062156000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are saying,
&#147;Prosecutors, you need to continue to use this in particular
circumstances&#148;&#151;we shall discuss those in a
moment&#151;&#147;but we do not think it is a good piece of law and
we intend to abolish it in due course.&#148; Sunset clauses have been
used on occasion, but they are not the best way of proceeding. They
have some faults, particularly when we are dealing with a common law
offence that is based on case law and the development of the law over a
long period. There is an understanding of it and the way in which it
should be used. That understanding would be complicated by a sunset
clause that says, &#147;This isn&#146;t very good at all. You ought
not to use it&#151;or you should not use it very much&#151;except
when the Attorney-General says perhaps you should.&#148; It is
probably workable to do what the hon. Gentleman says; it is just that
it is not the best way of proceeding. This is matter of judgment. Such
a provision would be untidy and would lead to a degree of uncertainty
that we do not need.</div>
<a name="06062156000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that we will be
in a position where we are unable to remove the provision in three
years&#146; time, because a Bill will doubtless be present then, or
shortly thereafter, to allow a Government to deal with a conspiracy to
defraud&#151;a common law offence&#151;and to remove it from the
statute book if that is the desirable
approach.</div>
<a name="06062156000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000413"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I would entirely follow the line of argument that
the Solicitor-General is taking if it were not for the fact that the
Government, by the draft guidance, are clearly trying to influence the
behaviour of prosecutors. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot argue
that the problem with new clause 9 is that it would deter prosecutors
from doing what they were otherwise going to do when the draft guidance
has precisely that effect. Surely it must be right that if over the
next three or five years prosecutors, despite the draft guidance, say
that conspiracy to defraud is the appropriate charge in a large number
of sets of circumstances, under the proposed procedure set out in new
clause 9 both Houses of Parliament would understand that and doubtless
conclude that conspiracy to defraud, as a common law offence, should
remain.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div><a name="06062156000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000414"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The approach that prosecutors will
actually take is set out in the draft guidance. Paragraph 6
reads:</div><a name="06062156000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
selecting charges in fraud cases, the prosecutor should first
consider&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062156000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
we have&#151;a couple of
tests:</div><a name="06062156000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether the
behaviour could be prosecuted under statute&#151;whether under the
Fraud Act 2006 or another Act or as a statutory
conspiracy;&#148;</div><a name="06062156000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">and,
further,</div><a name="06062156000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether the
available statutory charges adequately reflect the gravity of the
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
tests need to be passed, but we are not deterring a prosecutor from
using conspiracy to defraud where that is the most appropriate
approach. We are saying that if one is considering that, look at the
tests set out by the Attorney-General and then make a decision about
whether one should proceed by way of conspiracy to defraud. In many
cases, I suspect that a prosecutor will decide that that is the
appropriate way to proceed. Then we will be able to consider the
outcome of those cases and take a view in three years&#146; time as
to whether it is appropriate to decide to remove conspiracy to defraud,
not just because of the Bill but because other pieces of legislation
and other views about how legislation should develop will have come to
pass.</div><a name="06062156000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will deal with
the point of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon because that
will enable me to elaborate what else will take place. We have a number
of things moving forward by way of consideration of how legislation
should develop that may well have an impact. The Fraud Bill&#151;or
the Fraud Act, as in due course I hope it will become&#151;is not the
whole answer to the issue of conspiracy to defraud in the common law
offence. Even when the Bill receives Royal Assent there will be
examples of dishonest conduct that it will not be possible to prosecute
under statute; for example, where it is intended that the final offence
be committed by someone outside the conspiracy. So, a group of people
has conspired in order to defraud, but the final act is committed
outside the conspiracy. Secondly, there will be cases where it cannot
be proved that the accused had the necessary degree of knowledge of the
substantive offence, so the degree of knowledge is an issue there.
Moreover, as Lord Rose&#146;s Committee&#151;which took a very
strong line on support for conspiracy to defraud remaining as an option
for prosecutors&#151;emphasised, conspiracy to defraud is a vital
tool in prosecuting cases with multiple defendants and multiple
frauds.</div><a name="06062156000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
vital as the Bill is, other pieces of the jigsaw have to fall into
place before the offence can be safely repealed. In addressing the
issue of multiple offences, we need time to gauge the effect of the
Lord Chief Justice&#146;s protocol on the control and management of
heavy fraud cases and the sample count provisions in the Domestic
Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 that we hope to implement later
this year.</div><a name="06062156000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In ensuring
that the law fully covers forms of participation in crime that do not
amount to statutory conspiracy, we need to consider a new law on
assisting and encouraging crime in the light of the Law
Commission&#146;s study of that issue, which we hope will be
published shortly. That again may lead to new law, which may affect the
way in which conspiracy to defraud is able to be removed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div><a name="06062156000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s review,
which is expected in three years&#146; time, will thus need to
consider the situation not only in the light of the practical operation
of the new fraud offences, but other relevant changes including any
that may flow from the ongoing review of fraud. We hope that that fraud
review will be published shortly. I cannot give a precise date at the
moment, but I am aware that the conclusions are nearing fruition. That,
too, might have an
impact.</div><a name="06062156000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="06062156000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
conclusion of the 2009 review is that the offence should be abolished,
that would be achieved with proper safeguards after a time in which the
Government and Parliament have been given a proper opportunity to
consider the matter, including whether any alternative provisions are
required. To suspend the sword of Damocles over the whole proceedings
would not be the best approach. It would lead to an element of
confusion. I hope that the Committee will not consider that an
appropriate way to proceed. It is important to remember that one
possible, indeed likely, scenario is that we will not just repeal
conspiracy to defraud but simultaneously make other changes on
statutory conspiracy or criminal procedure. We do not know what those
changes might be, because they have not yet been recommended by the
appropriate committees, but we may well have to examine a different way
of covering parts of conspiracy to defraud in a more satisfactory way
that will require different legislative changes. The amendments would
not allow for that; they would mean simply that the offence was going.
That could create a level of difficulty in developing future
legislation that we really do not
need.</div><a name="06062156000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have made it clear that they are committed to repealing conspiracy to
defraud at some stage. We have said
that</div><a name="06062156000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it remains our
long-term aim to repeal this common law crime and we will review the
position&#148;</div><a name="06062156000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">in due course.
We need to be sure that all the pieces of the jigsaw are in place
before we make the decision to repeal, and it would be inappropriate to
do so
now.</div><a name="06062156000266"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062156000415"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> That was an interesting little debate. One must
assume that prosecutors will not listen to the Solicitor-General when
he says that the Government&#146;s clear intention is to repeal the
law, because if they did they might become confused as to whether they
are to use the conspiracy to defraud provisions. As an aside, I think
that Damocles and Canute dealt wisely with people who got the wrong end
of the stick. In the case of Damocles, the concentration of the mind
was greatly enhanced by the provision of his simple memento
mori.</div><a name="06062156000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take seriously
what the Solicitor-General says on the matter, and he rightly says that
there are not great differences in the Committee on what we want to
see. I welcome the guidance, which carries a clear intimation that the
conspiracy common-law offence is no longer the preferred route for
prosecutions. I part with him on his view that it will be the lot of a
future Government to repeal the provision. In my experience,
Governments are not very good at repealing laws or removing offences.
They are very good at creating new offences and laws, which is why we
have criminal justice Bills 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>coming one after another like buses in the high street, but we do not
often have Bills that repeal existing offences or laws. That is one of
the difficulties of our system: it has a ratchet effect. We constantly
accrete new laws but we do not remove the old ones, thus ending up with
more confusion and a less comprehensible legal
system.</div><a name="06062156000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
great deal of merit in what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said about
a sunset clause, but I understand why the Minister might be nervous
about that. To an extent it would take the matter out of his control,
meaning that he or his successor would have to take action to prevent
the law from being repealed. I concede that there is a possibility that
that might affect the view of prosecutors, as we approach the time of
the expiry of the offence, as to whether it is a proper offence to
prosecute. I do not think that that can possibly be true of the
commencement clause that I have suggested as an alternative device. It
is common for Government to put provisions in Bills and then not to
commence with them when the Bill comes into force. One of the reasons
why we have difficulties with conspiracy to defraud is the problem of
multiple counts, which we dealt with in a provision in the Domestic
Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 that the Government have not yet
brought into force because it has a delayed
commencement.</div><a name="06062156000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
a perfectly normal way of dealing with things as far as this and other
Governments are concerned. Therefore, it is within the gift of future
Ministers never to commence this part of the Bill if the evidence is
that the conspiracy to defraud offence is still required to prosecute
certain cases. I do not accept that it shows any lack of clarity or
decisiveness on the part of the Government simply to provide the means
by which a future Government can take a decision without having to
start from scratch with primary legislation. I hope that my new clause
2 passes the drafting test, as it is lifted directly from the original
recommendations of the Law Commission, which is pretty good at drafting
such things.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div><a name="06062156000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I still believe that the
Government would be much better advised to include the provision now
and then to make a decision in three, four or five years&#146;
time&#151;at any time, in fact, as there is no time limit. My new
clause requires only that commencement should not be within three years
in order to accommodate the Solicitor-General&#146;s reservations,
but it does not require him to take action at any stage unless he or
his successors are satisfied that the law is working properly. The new
clause would mean that we would not have to start with new primary
legislation.</div><a name="06062156000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I remind the Committee what the Law Commission had to say
about conspiracy to defraud. It
stated:</div><a name="06062156000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On any
view, the present position is anomalous and has no place in a coherent
criminal
law.&#148;</div><a name="06062156000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could not have been more damning of the use of this offence. The
purpose of the Bill is to replace it, and replace it it does.
Reservations are still expressed partly because we have not implemented
the multiple count provisions and partly because nobody is absolutely
sure that circumstances would not arise in which conspiracy to defraud
or something similar might be required. In three or four years&#146;
time, we will know that. We will know whether there are any
circumstances in which it makes sense to retain a common law offence of
this sort. My suspicion is that there will not have been any such
circumstances, and my provision would make it easy for the Government
then to take a decision without wasting parliamentary time. I am still
hopeful that the Minister will reconsider that between now and
Report.</div><a name="06062156000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for Torridge and West Devon is not planning to intervene on me
at this stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062156000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
