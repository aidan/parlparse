<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs Helen Liddell):</B> I beg to move,

<P>
That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 89 to 103; Clause 126; Clauses 104 to 123; Schedule 4; Clause 125; Clause 129; Clause 9; Clause 13; Clause 10; Clause 14; Clause 11; Clause 15; Clauses 16 to 19; Schedule 2; Clauses 20 to 26; Clause 63; Clause 66; Clauses 27 and 28; Clause 64; Clause 29; Clause 62; Clauses 30 to 33; Clause 65; Clause 34; Clause 67; Clause 35; Clause 68; Clauses 36 to 41; Clause 69; Clause 42; Clause 70; Clause 43; Clause 71; Clause 44; Clause 72; Clause 45; Clause 73; Clause 46; Clause 74; Clause 47; Clause 75; Clause 48; Clause 76; Clause 49; Clause 77; Clauses 50 to 57; Clause 78; Clause 58; Clause 79; Clauses 59 to 61; Clause 82; Clause 80; Clause 81; Clause 83; Schedule 3; Clause 124; Clauses 127 and 128; Clauses 130 to 132; Schedules 5 to 7; Clauses 133 and 134; new Clauses; new Schedules.

<P>
The motion takes us forward by removing the telecommunications and water provisions in response to representations made to the Government. Members of the Committee are aware that we intend to secure for the energy sector a more transparent regulatory framework, as well as an independent voice for consumers and a stronger focus on protecting their interests. Those principles will continue to be part of separate water and telecommunications legislation, but the revised Bill gives us a significant opportunity to make progress on the energy industries.

<P>
The Bill remains a substantial programme of reform of the energy regulation framework, and its provisions must be scrutinised in detail by the Committee. Not only on Second Reading, but in Committee, there has been broad consensus on most of the provisions, particularly the merger of the gas and electricity regulators, the establishment of independent consumer councils, separate licensing of electricity supply and distribution and the reform of the electricity pool. There is a helpful letter in this morning's Financial Times from Mr. Roy Gardner, the chief executive of Centrica, who says:

<P>
we must not lose sight of a key purpose of the bill: reform of the wholesale electricity market. everyone who wants to see lower electricity prices has a strong interest in ensuring the speedy enactment of this Bill.
We have that very much in mind with the order of consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): Will the Minister clarify the reduction in the price of electricity? We noted that when the Secretary of State answered a question on the Floor of the House--it was almost a statement--by saying that there would be a 10 per cent. reduction in the price of electricity, the Minister nudged him and said, ``Wholesale prices''. The Secretary of State then referred to a minimum reductionin wholesale prices of 10 per cent. In all the Government's literature, they have never claimed that. Will the Minister put the record straight by saying by how much she expects the wholesale electricity price to go down and how that will effect the electricity industry's profits?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for a helpful question. I was about to come to that point, which is covered in Mr. Gardner's letter. The Government have consistently said that we envisage a 10 per cent. reduction in wholesale electricity prices. I told my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to stress ``wholesale'' because the hon. Gentleman had misheard me in our sitting on Thursday and I had had to correct him. He thought that I said something like ``we sell'', but I specifically said ``wholesale''. If he refers to the Official Report, he will see the exchange.

<P>
It has been obvious to those looking at the futures market in electricity that the market is beginning to anticipate reform of electricity trading arrangements. Indeed, in his letter Mr. Gardner says:

<P>
In the new emerging market it is possible to buy electricity for the year beginning April 2000 at prices 30 per cent. below the price at the time the government issued its white paper on energy in October 1998. And prices are falling further every day based on the expectation of a more competitive market, free from manipulation.
In a competitive market, companies that perform well and operate to the highest standards have an opportunity to enhance their performance. That is what we are seeking to achieve under the Bill.

<P>
We must make progress and not waste hon. Members' time. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said that Conservative Members will co-operate with dropping telecoms provisions from the Bill. In that spirit of co-operation, we propose to consider the remaining telecoms and water clauses first.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): How much time does the right hon. Lady think that she has wasted in putting before the Committee the many clauses on the water and telecommunications industries which we have spent hours reading, scrutinising and been briefed on by the industry? How much time has been wasted by her incompetence?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is directly attacking the representations that the industry has made to the Government. It is a shameful position for him to take. I know that he likes to be in half a dozen places at once, but scrutiny of legislation is an important part of the work of the House. That is why, given the announcement that the White Paper on the communications industry was forthcoming, the Government listened to the representations that the industry made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): Will the Minister clarify what representations she received from the water industry, and from consumer groups, suggesting that the water provisions should be dropped from the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Those matters are still under debate. The hon. Gentleman will recall that it was stated in the Royal Address that water legislation would be introduced in due course. He and I have had a number of exchanges in Committee about the fact that the water industry is different from the other utilities, in that it does not have the same competitive structures. In recognising those differences, it is now deemed more appropriate to proceed with water legislation as a separate entity, rather than as part of this Bill.

<P>
I recognise that some groups may be disappointed with the decision, but the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will address those issues when it introduces the new legislation. The principles of utility regulation set out in the Bill, which are part of Government policy, remain as true to the regulation of water as to the matters that we are discussing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> What consultation took place with consumer groups before the decision was made to drop telecoms and water provisions from the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Extensive consultation took place on both water and telecoms. I seem to recall the hon. Gentleman saying in Committee last Thursday that it would be advisable to remove telecoms from the Bill. I assume that he still stands by that statement. We must take into account the fullness of changes that will be introduced in future legislation.

<P>
For the Committee's benefit, I shall go through the order of consideration as it relates to the relevant clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Whatever our disagreements over the timing on telecommunications, the right hon. Lady knows that she was advised by the Conservative party, the industry and just about everyone apart from those in the Government that she should wait until the publication of the White Paper. We accept that the Government have now seen the sense in that argument. However, we did not hear a word from her in response to the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) about the reasons for removing the water industry provisions from the Bill. I have suggested that it is owing to a territorial war between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions--and we have heard nothing to disabuse us of that assumption. Will the Minister tell us why the water industry provisions are being removed from the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> We have had lengthy debates in Committee and on the Floor of the House, and a number of representations were made on Second Reading, about the differences between the water industry and the other utilities.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I may be able to assist the Committee. First, as I said during the previous sitting, there is no dispute between the DETR and the DTI over the course of caction that we are following. Secondly, in respect of water, about which the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) asked, we have been discussing the contents of the Bill with representatives of the industry and consumer groups since its introduction in January. Several of them expressed concern that there were to be two changes to the structure of the industry in quick succession. We therefore decided, on reflection, that it would be better to deal with matters in one go.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. I shall now return to the order of consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I happily give way. The hon. Gentleman clearly does not wish to make progress.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was astonished by the Under-Secretary's intervention on the Minister, which, while helpful, contradicted the alleged comments of Dan Corry, a special adviser at the DTI, about clashes between the DTI and the DETR over the contents of the water segment of the Bill. Are those alleged comments true?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman must stop listening to ``Jackanory''. We have already heard the rumour that 900 amendments were to be tabled--a figure that was plucked from the air--and we now hear further unsubstantiated rmours about the comments of a special advisor. The hon. Gentleman's allegation is news to me.
</P>


<P>
We propose to consider the remaining telecoms and water clauses today. On telecommunications, we shall consider clauses 89 to 103 and 126. On water, we shall consider clauses 104 to 123, schedule 4 and clauses 125 and 129. We propose that those clauses and the schedule do not stand part of Bill. We also propose that decisions of principle be made to amend clause 124, on the Competition Commission, and schedules 5, 6 and 7, to delete references to telecoms and water. Once the corresponding amendments have been moved formally, all water provisions will be dropped from the Bill. The position on telecoms is different, because clauses 84 and 88 already stand part of the Bill. We shall therefore table amendments on Report to remove those clauses.

<P>
After delaing with the telecoms and water clauses this morning, we shall continue with the original order of consideration, as follows: clauses 9 to 15, on the objectives of regulation; clauses 16 to 24 and schedule 2, on the functions of consumer councils; clauses 25 to 68, on licensing; clauses 36 to 41, on the duties of electricity distributors; clauses 69 to 74, on performance standards; clauses 47 to 76, on the enforcement of obligations; clauses 49 to 77, on remuneration and service standards; clauses 50 to 55, on electricity from renewable sources; clauses 56 to 83, on miscellaneous energy matters; schedule 3, on transfer of functions, property and so on; clauses 1247, 127, 128 and 130, on the Competition Commission; and clauses 131 to 134 and schedules 5 and 7, on miscellaneous and supplementary matters. Following normal practice, we propose to deal with any new clauses at the end of the Committee's deliberations--if they are not available to be slotted in at the appropriate place in the sequence of the Bill.

<P>
It is very important that we proceed to get the Bill on the statute book, so that regulation can keep pace with the rapidly converging gas and electricity markets. The Bill will align gas and electricity regulation under a single regulatory authority; establish a Gas and Electricity Consumer Council to mirror reforms to the regulatory office; deliver measures to improve the transparency and predictability of regulation of the energy sector; and introduce the necessary powers to introduce the new electricity trading arrangements. Those are significant improvements to the operation of the energy sector, and I commend the order of consideration to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We are back at the drawing board, where we were, nine sittings ago, at the beginning of February. This is a complete shambles. Most of the substantive concerns raised by the water and telecommunications industries, with the exception of the timing of the White Paper and the water Bill, are shared by the electricity and gas industries. The four sectors are concerned about over-regulation, regulatory risks, increases in the cost of capital, the Bill's provisions about fines and the associated appeals procedures, social duties, whether the regulator will be rolled back in the face of increased and fiercer competition, the Bill's consistency with the Freedom of Information Bill, and downgrading of the duty to promote competition. However, it appears that only the water and telecommunications sectors have been victorious and had provisions excised from the Bill.

<P>
The Minister quoted from Roy Gardner's letter in this morning's Financial Times. Although he supports the Government, the second paragraph of his letter states:

<P>
Regulatory constraints, consumer protection and environmental obligations are, of course, complex issues that must be addressed.
He is concerned about the Bill's substantive proposals. Admittedly, he supports the reform of the electricity sector--

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the sentence immediately following the passage that he quoted. It states:

<P>
But everyone who wants to see lower electricity prices has a strong interest in ensuring the speedy enactment of this bill.
Do I take it from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he is going back on the commitments that he gave on 31 January and 29 February about helping to get the Bill on to the statute book?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, of course not. However, it is the Government, not the Opposition, who mishandled the Bill, have introduced two orders of consideration and drafted the Bill so badly that half of its provisions needed to be excised. It is about time that the Minister stopped trying to blame the Opposition and took some responsibility for this appalling situation. If we had drafted the Bill, we would have avoided this shambles.

<P>
Roy Gardner and others, including Opposition Members, support the reform of the electricity pool, the merger of the gas and electricity regulatory bodies and the separation of the licensing arrangements. However, many of the Bill's proposals will be damaging to consumers. The increase in regulatory risk will increase the cost of capital, and those higher costs will be passed on to the consumer. The Government's social programme means that a plethora of new regulations and duties will be imposed on the regulators and the utility companies. That will place costs on the utility companies which will, again, be passed on to the consumer. We want to protect consumers and to deliver to them the falls in electricity prices that are occurring in the market. Decreases in electricity prices should not be accompanied by the huge additional costs that will be created by other provisions.

<P>
In this week's Utility Week magazine, which was published on Friday 3 March, a letter from the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe suggests that she was--she still is--in some form of denial. She claimed that the Bill was not in trouble. In view of the magazine's copy date, it is staggering that so close to what was black Thursday for the Minister but white Thursday for the industry and the consumer--[Laughter.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister accused the Conservative party of not caring about consumers. The hilarity that Labour Members are displaying demonstrates that they do not care about the mess that they have made of the legislation or the fact that consumers will have to wait before matters are sorted out.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Mr. hon. Friend is absolutely right. Many Labour Members do not appreciate the damage that the Bill's mishandling has done to the Department of Trade and Industry.

<P>
The Minister did not ask Utility Week to withdraw her letter, although its publication was so close to the dramatic day that I mentioned earlier. She wrote:

<P>
Sir: I was amazed at Roger Milne's assertion in his article that the Bill is in trouble. I was even more amazed that the DTI was allegedly blaming the so-called 900 amendments on ``the flu suffered by the Bill's parliamentary draftsmen'' Roger Milne's assertion as to the reason for tabling Government amendments is, frankly, ludicrous. The Bill contains core provisions which can be built upon and improved by Government amendment.
</P>

Roger Milne responded to that letter by pointing out that the estimate of 900 amendments was based on the initial number of Government amendments. In Committee, the Minister was challenged over that figure, but she refused to be drawn. The response to the Minister's letter continued:
</P>


<P>
Officials made it clear to me--
that is, to Roger Milne--

<P>
that the drafting of the legislation was affected by the flu epidemic earlier this year.
What is the position? As late as Friday, the Minister was still denying in Utility Week that the Bill was in trouble and that 'flu had led to a drafting shambles and a plethora of Government amendments.

<P>
Even amendments that were faxed to me on Friday, including those to the long title, had the phrase ``still being worked on'' scrawled beside them. Given the huge embarrassment that the withdrawal of telecoms and water provisions has caused the Government, Ministers and their advisers should have burnt the midnight oil, so that they got the amendments right.

<P>
There is an atmosphere of lethargy about Ministers; they seem to feel, ``Nothing is going right, so what is the point?'' The careers of the energy Minister and the Secretary of State appear to be in their death throes. The Secretary of State is a gaffe-prone and unsafe pair of hands. His error in welcoming the resignation of the chief executive of British Nuclear Fuels plc two days before it happened was unforgivably rude, and his campaign on rip-off Britain, of which his own report failed to find significant evidence, was ill judged. In addition, and notwithstanding the Trade and Industry Committee's reports on misleading figures and the repeating of announcements, there is the shambles of this Bill.

<P>
As stated in last week's edition of The Sunday Telegraph,

<P>
New Labour has rules all of its own and Byers has broken the most fundamental. While the Blair-Campbell axis could forgive him for failing his multiplication tables they cannot countenance any incompetenance in public relations, and last week was a PR disaster.
Neil Bennett said that,

<P>
Like a child in a signal box,
the Secretary of State

<P>
is pulling all the levers without a clue there are trains crashing in front of him I suspect this summer Byers will be shunted off to another Government department where he can do less harm.
I suspect that the right hon. Lady, the energy Minister, will follow him. The article went on:

<P>
Byers' week of woe continued last Thursday with his shamefaced announcement that he was cutting his much-vaunted Utilities Bill in half, leaving out water and telecomes. Good for the water and telecoms industries, I say. But this is already such a dog's breakfast of a Bill it should be scrapped entirely.
That is absolutely right: this poorly drafted, badly conceived Bill should be scrapped entirely. It should be rethought, rewritten and reintroduced. That is also the view of the City editor of The Times, who said:

<P>
It is hard to see how legislation that requires a minimum of 450 amendments can be of benefit to anyone apart from the paper manufacturers. The Utility Bill was ill-thought-out and the risk is that it will reach the statute book in a garbled state.
</P>


<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Industry and consumers deserve to be better served. If Government must meddle, it should at least try to do so more efficiently than this. The legislative machine needs a regulator.
The matter is more than one of incompetence and bad drafting. The Bill should be withdrawn; we cannot support the proposed order of consideration. Despite a Second Reading debate and nine sittings of this Committee, the Minister has yet to make clear the Bill's root meaning.

<P>
</UL></FONT>On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the Bill involves a fundamental reform of the utilities regulator. He said that

<P>
the Government are committed to modernisation and reform in a whole range of important areas of public life. The Utilities Bill is part of that agenda  I it will modernise and reform the utilities markets and it will deliver efficiency and fairness, bringing together social justice and fairness--two sides of the same coin. It puts consumers first and provides a basis for effective competition and a stable framework of regulation for the future. It will deliver essential reform of the structure and framework.
That sounds like a fundamental change in the regulation of utilities. At the end of his speech he said:

<P>
The Bill establishes a framework that ensures a fair balance between the needs of consumers and the legitimate interests of the utility companies ... The Bill puts utilities regulation on a sure footing for the 21st century, and is good for consumers, good for competition, and good for the utilities.--[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 782_95.]
That is hyper-rhetoric.

<P>
The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe used similar language, saying:

<P>
The Bill ... will improve the transparency, consistency and predictability of regulation, and will provide a stable framework. It is a good move forward for the people of this country. It is about reform, modernisation and common sense.--[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 874.]
That implies that the Bill will be revolutionary in its dealings with the utility sector and regulation, but during the eighth sitting of the Committee, The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs gave a contradictory view, stating:

<P>
As I have said, we do not expect that there will be a dramatic upheaval--, a revolution, indeed--in utility regulation, and there is no point in Opposition Members pretending otherwise. The regulatory and economic environment in which utility companies operate will not be turned upside down.--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 29 February 2000; c. 234.]
What is the Government's view of the extent of change that will be brought about by the Bill?

<P>
Last Thursday, I sat next to Callum McCarthy at the annual dinner of the Electricity Association at which the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs made an interesting and well-delivered speech. Someone with a sense of humour was responsible for the place settings because my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset and I had spent the week before the dinner highlighting to the Committee and the press the profligacy of Ofgem. Nevertheless, we had a pleasant evening. I shall not cite our private conversations, but Mr. McCarthy would not object if I pointed out that Ofgem's view of the Bill is the same as that of the Competition Minister, and that it will be interpreted, at least while Mr. McCarthy is in charge, as providing a very limited change in the overall regulatory regime. However, that is not what the Bill states and a new chairman of Ofgem will come along and interpret the Bill. That is also the view of outside commentators. Neil Bennett of the The Sunday Telegraph stated that, from his reading of the Bill,

<P>
it amounts to a near renationalisation of the gas and power industries. Just as those two industries are beginning to take on some semblance of free competition, Byers wants to clobber them with bureaucratic consumers' groups and ``good behaviour'' clauses that could destroy our chances of building world-class businesses in these vital sectors. The Bill is also unnecessary because the industries will be governed by
the Competition Bill.

<P>
We need more clarity. We need to know the extent of the legislation. That should be clear from the Bill, but it is not, because there seems to be disagreement among Ministers, and between Ministers, the regulator, outside commentators and members of the Committee. Ministers who are trying to push the Bill through the Committee should be clear and consistent, at least among themselves, as to the degree of change being brought about by the Bill.

<P>
When we considered the first order of consideration motion, we tried to obtain from the Minister the number of amendments that the Government proposed to make, but no figures were forthcoming. We now know why: the preparation of the Bill was such shambles that they simply did not know how many amendments they would have to table. All the evidence is that chaos persists. I suspect that I shall still not receive an answer from the right hon. Lady, but I shall try, none the less.

<P>
Of the 400 amendments that have been tabled so far, most were tabled by the Conservative Opposition and some by the Liberal Democrats. However, 54 are Government amendments, not including Thursday's amendments to remove the sections dealing with the telecommunications and water sectors. Will the Minister tell the Committee how many of those 54 amendments relate to telecoms-only clauses? That will leave the remainder still to be debated. Will she also specify how many more amendments the Government anticipate will be tabled between now and Report, excluding any consequential amendments arising from her acceptance of Opposition amendments?
</P>


<P>
Paragraph 8 of the explanatory notes states:

<P>
The Bill does not currently give effect to all the proposals set out in the Government's policy documents ... Where this is the case, the Government intends to bring forward amendments later in the passage of the Bill through Parliament to give effect to them.
I am aware of certain Government amendments that affect items listed in the explanatory notes. Can she say when the remainder of the amendments, which deal with all the omissions listed in the explanatory notes, will be tabled? In that regard, I am especially interested in

<P>
amendments to the procedures for referring licence modifications to the Competition Commission, consequential on the new procedures for licence modifications (clause 32).

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
One of the criticisms made of the Bill by the operators group was that the regulations that it outlines are

<P>
too backwards looking for this industry and as a result likely to damage the development of this highly competitive and innovative industry.
Why has the Minister accepted that argument in relation to the telecommunications sector, but not in relation to gas and electricity? The detailed criticisms of the Bill by the telecoms sector, aside from the issues raised by the communications White Paper, apply equally to the energy sector. Why has she not removed from the Bill the regulatory provisions relating to gas and electricity, leaving clause 56, which relates to NETA?

<P>
As the Opposition said before, we support the reform of the electricity pool. If that were the only clause in the Bill, we would ensure its swift passage to the statute book, to deliver the reform wanted by Roy Gardner and others in the electricity and gas industries. After all, one of the Secretary of State's greatest boasts about the Bill was that

<P>
a significant number of the provisions are identical or very similar for each sector--that has been done on purpose to achieve consistency across regulation--[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 788.]
Surely all the arguments point to removing the gas and electricity sectors as well. That would mean no new regulatory burdens, no increased regulatory risk, no hike in the cost of capital and therefore no unnecessary new costs passed on to the consumer.

<P>
This is an appalling Bill. It was appalling on 31 January, when it received its Second Reading, and it became increasingly apparent that it was appalling during nine Committee sittings. The Government have now acknowledged that by decimating it. Is it not time to put the Bill and the Committee out of their misery by withdrawing all but clause 56, rewriting the Bill, and returning to Parliament with a Bill that is worthy of consideration?

<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, and agreed with many of his points. He over-egged the pudding by accusing the Government of socialist policies in relation to renationalisation. This, after all, is the Government who are privatising air traffic control and not regulating Railtrack properly. Nevertheless, I hope that the Government will accept that the remainder of the Bill is not coherent and has not been a success in terms of seamless government.

<P>
The arguments advanced last week for the withdrawal of the half of the Bill relating to water and telecoms seem solely the responsibility of the telecoms operators, who appear to be responsible for changing the Government's mind, not only on telecoms but on water. That is the only conclusion that we can reach, as it is the only external advocacy to which reference has been made in Committee and by the Secretary of State on the Floor of the House, in answer to the surrogate private notice question last week.

<P>
It would be helpful if the Government, and especially the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, would say that they have got it wrong, instead of trying to bluster through by saying that the changes have been due to the telecoms operators from start to finish. In respect of telecoms, the Government have known for months about the intention to introduce a communications White Paper, even if it was only announced formally at the beginning of February. I remember having a discussion with Ministers in The Department for Culture, Media and Sport in the autumn of last year, when the Government's intention was clear. Why, therefore, were the telecoms provisions included in the Bill in the first place? That question has never been answered. The problems could have been foreseen, as well as the objections and comments of telecoms operators.

<P>
In answer to the point made earlier by the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, I support the withdrawal of the telecommunications provisions for that reason: with my DCMS hat on, as the Liberal Democrat broadcasting spokesman, I am only too aware of the need for coherence in the broadcasting telecoms field. It is right that that should be achievedd in a co-ordinated way, with the publication of a White Paper later this year, but the telecoms provisions should not have been in the Bill in the first place.

<P>
We have no justification for the withdrawal of the water provisions. At the start of our proceedings, I asked why water was being dealt with differently from gas and electricity. The Minster's response was that water was a natural monopoly and had to be dealt with differently. I understand that point intellectually; I am not convinced by it. Regulations have been determined not by logic but according to whichever is the lead Department. We have had no proper rebuttal of the widespread belief that the decision resulted from a disagreement between the DTI and the DETR about the extent of Government regulation in the 21st century. The DTI clearly wants light-touch regulation; the DETR does not. That is an honest definition of the two Departments. Why do Ministers not say so, so that we know where we stand? They have not said so, but we have had lots of guff about why the water provisions have been withdrawn.

<P>
Nothing has changed in respect of water in the past two or three months, so why have water provisions been withdrawn? The situation for water is the same now as it was before the Bill was published. If it was right to include the water provisions in the Bill when it was published, it is right to include them now. If the arguments are overwhelming that water provisions should not be included, those same arguments applied before the Bill's publication. Nothing has happened--we have not been told about anything--between the Bill's publication and the decision to withdraw the water provisions. All that has happened is that the DETR has taken a closer look at the provisions and decided that it does not like them, does not entirely trust its DTI colleagues and wants to take its ball home and deal with the situation itself. No has has rebutted that point. If the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and Regions wants to intervene, I shall happily give way to him, but that appears not to be the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Would it not help the Committee to have a feel for what the DETR has in mind as part of the heavy-handed regulation that it wishes to impose on the water indstry? Surely the problem facing the water industry is complete uncertainty about its future regulatory regime. Would it not also help if the Under-Secretary gave a firm timetable for publication of the water Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I entirely agree; it would be exceedingly helpful. Indeed, we moved a minuscule way towards that last week. The hon. Genteleman may remember that I asked the energy Minister when the water provisions would be dealt with. There was no clear answer to that, but later the environment Minister said it would not be dealt with in this Session. In other words, the water industry will stay exactly as it is for at least a year until the DETR find a slot in the legislative programme, which may not be until after the next election. Therefore, nothing may change in water, for better or worse, until then. No doubt Ministers at the DETR have calculated that they are prepared to live with the present situation for the foreseeable future, in which case it was rather odd originally to put water provisions in the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the Government amendments. I do not pretent to be a long-standing Member of the House, and no doubt Minister will tell me that more amendments were tabled to other Bills introduced by previous Governments, but to someone coming relatively fresh to a Standing Committee--almost a layperson--the number of amendments seems extraordinarily high. I can see no reason why the Government cannot, with civil servants and proper advice, work out behind closed doors what they want to do, having taken representations from consumer groups, industry and everybody else, and the publish the Bill that they want. I find it extraordinary that so many Government amendments have been tabled barely weeks, or even days following the Bill's publication. I do not nunderstand why that should be necessary, unless the Bill was not ready when it was published. If that is the case, one wonders whether its timetable was right.

<P>
I am reminded of when I last cooked scrambled eggs. When one turns the gas off, the eggs, without heat, continue to change texture. The Bill seems to behave in the same way: the gas has been turned off, yet, somehow, magically, it is changing texture, as amendments are tabled. It is now thought wise to withdraw the water and telecoms provisions, for reasons that could have been foreseen before the Bill was published. If they had not been included in the Bill in the first place, it might have been possible for the overworked civil servants to produce a more coherent set of proposals on gas and electricity; instead, all these amendments have had to be tabled now.

<P>
This has not been a successful exercise in seamless government, and I hope that the Government will admit that they have got it wrong, instead of trying to bluster their way through and say that it is the fault of telecoms operators for making representations to the Government. Will the Bill hang together now? Only time will tell. I have not had time to analyse it in detail, but my initial perusal of the amendments leads me seriously to doubt it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is it not one of the Bill's fundamental purposes to provide consistent regulatory regimes across all four utility sectors? That can no longer be the case, given that half the Bill--two sectors-- has been taken away.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Indeed, that cannot be the case, unless the Government will give a commitment that the regultory process for water and telecoms will replicate that introduced for gas and electricity--in which case, why withdraw water and telecoms from the Bill? That, too, presents and odd predicament.
{**UF1**}Will the Minister or the Under-Secretary--I am not sure which of them will reply--give a guarantee that the two principles in the Bill relating to water and, especially, telecoms will still aply to any new Government apporach? They are the principles that consumers' interests will be put first, and that strong consumer council will be introduced. When the Government consider the new provisions for water and telecoms, will those principles that they have, rightly, advocated so strongly still be applicable to those sectors?

<P>
The right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs Liddell) was unable to tell me of any consultation that had taken place with consumer groups relating to the Government's decision to remove water and telecoms from the Bill. I have made my position clear on that matter. It would have been helpful if the Government had carried out such consultations before the decision was taken. Are the view of the industry more important to the Government than the views of consumers, especially regarding telecoms?

<P>
Telecoms operators have made numerous representations--that appears to be the reason that the Government are giving for their action--but we have heard nothing about the interests of consumers. Therefore, the suggestion that consumers come first seems to have been undermined by the fact that the Government have listened only to the telecoms operators in taking this decision, and not to consumer groups. What consultation has taken place with consumer groups on the Government's decision to withdraw water and telecoms from the Bill? I suggest that there was none. I suggest that there was a general consultation when the Bill was first drafted, but that no specific consultation has taken place on that subsequent decision. If I am wrong, I hope that the Minister will tell me so. However, no one appears to be doing that.

<P>
Furthermore, consumers have told me that they have received no proper explanation for the decision. The Government need to mend some fences in terms of their attitude towards consumer groups. They also need to re-establish some coherence in their policy of consumer interests coming before those of the industry. They should apologise for the fact that the Bill is now in such a shambles.

<P>
Having said that, it is time to move on. The Liberal Democrats want the broad thrust of the gas and electricity provisions to be introduced. It is unfortunate that we have arrived at the state that we are in today. It is no credit to the Government that we have got this far. However, we must move on, and strive to incorporate those gas and electricity provisions that will protect consumers. We shall, therefore, accede to the withdrawal of water and telecoms, although not without expressing the significant concerns to which I have referred.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> This is an extraordinary predicament to be in after so many sittings. The Committee has not been told the truth about this matter. I am not suggesting that anyone has lied to us, but no one told us what was going on within this so-called joined-up Government to get us into this position.

<P>
Did the Government have their own millennium bug? We heard about the possibility of 900 or 950 amendments being tabled. Perhaps when the magic number of 1,000 is reached, the Government automatically say, ``We cannot have that many amendments, so we shall have to do something about it.'' Apparently, the Government have chopped the Bill in half, perhaps in the hope that the number of amendments will be cut in half. I wonder whether a legal challenge was made. The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe looks amazed--perhaps bells will go off and her eyes will revolve when I hit the jackpot, so I shall pursue this line of thought.
</P>


<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
We have to be careful about the European directives to which we sign up. Because of monopolies, the Government-owned utilities model that pertained in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe created various problems in respect of European legislation. I wonder whether the telecoms industry pointed out to the Government that the Bill does not stand the legal test. That would be a suitable reason for thinking again, and Committee members should be told the truth about that.

<P>
In an earlier speech, I mentioned human rights, and it was said that it would be ridiculous to argue that the European convention on human rights, to which we have signed up, could be breached by a utilities Bill. Again, a legal challenge may have been made, of which Ministers may be aware. If so, we should be told.

<P>
Were I to be unkind to the Government--heaven forbid that I should do that--I would consider the causes of past Government U-turns. Tony's cronies beat a path to No. 10 Downing Street, saying, ``Our special interests are being upset.'' The Government were no longer able to expect the support of certain business leaders--if one can describe them as that--in the court of Tony, and I wonder whether that contributed to the U-turn. A major player in the dome was persuaded to invest a large amount of shareholders' money in the dome--again, as a BT shareholder, I should declare an interest--and I think that even the water industry was represented in the dome. Unlike those industries, perhaps the electricity and gas industries did not pay their dues to the dome, and therefore lacked the influence to have themselves excluded from the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that BSkyB, which is benefiting from the dome, has yet to contribute to it, so perhaps it should have followed suit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Perhaps BSkyB threatened to do so. It is certainly not directly involved in the Bill, but it may have asked that such issues be dealt with in a communications Act. I cannot speak for the Front Bench of the Conservative party, but I expect that we shall introduce such an Act after the next general election. Certainly, that will not happen under the tutelage of this Labour Government.

<P>
I wonder whether it is a question of plain brown envelopes, and I hope that Ministers are taking note, because this is an important matter. By donating £1 million before the general election and implying that he would donate a further £1 million if, having received clearance from the Neill committee, the Government changed their attitude towards tobacco, Bernie Ecclestone overturned a long-standing Labour party policy. Was one of the hidden donors to the Labour party involved? There remains the unknown quantity of blind trusts, and we do not know who put in the money, either for the Prime Minister or the then DTI Minister. Could that have influenced the Bill? The explanations that we have been given do not add up to such a massive U-turn.

<P>
We have already spoken about turf wars. When we hear the winding-up speeches, I hope that the Minister from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will provide us with information from the fat file in front of him. I am sure that the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe will also try to answer many questions. It is important to understand what has happened within the Government. No Committee member is naive enough to believe that Ministers in different Departments do not have different agendas. There is nothing wrong with that--Ministers should fight their corner and decide what they want. However, the Committee owes those industries that have been removed from the Bill an explanation of the tensions and pressures. What was said? What is the decision? Who won?

<P>
Every time that he is challenged, the DETR Minister jumps to his feet to say that there are no disputes between his Department and the DTI. We accept that, as the DETR has clearly won. The industry has been removed from the Bill, so of course there are no disagreements now. No doubt the DTI is saying, ``Good riddance, we have got rid of that, and no longer have any concerns.'' Why has the divorce taken place? Why does the DTI want to wash its hands of the water industry? Why is the DETR happy to keep washing its feet in it? My metaphors are becoming a little confused.

<P>
The Committee needs to know what is happening in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser)--who is one of the Dorset three--was and probably still is a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which I expect will be looking into what has happened, to try to get to the bottom of why the split occurred.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing out that I am a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. However, it is one of those Committees that forever refers matters to the Secretary of State, who sits on all our questions and never answers them. The Minister should answer this Committee's questions, instead of using the tactics of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, which are to listen to what we say but do nothing about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> That would be valuable. Perhaps the special adviser, or whoever it was in the DTI, could make some statements about what information is flowing between the DCMS and the DTI. That is extremely important, as it would begin to illuminate the issues. Yesterday, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill had its Second Reading on the Floor of the House. That Bill removes many telecommunications responsibilities from the DTI, which the Government has clearly decided is incompetent to deal with telecommunications and interception of communications. It is important that the Committee receives answers from Ministers. The Committee Room is packed with people listening to our proceedings, and suddenly reports are appearing in the main press--

<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): They are only there to hear you.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Government Whip for pointing that out. Given the length of my speech, that may be all that they hear this afternoon as well. I am trying to move quickly, and do not want to hold things up. The Committee needs to know what has happened.

<P>
Among the issues that may have occurred belatedly to Ministers are the implications of the Competition Act 1998. When one considers what the utilities regulators are supposed to do under the Bill, it is obvious, as some of the amendments that I tabled highlighted, that the Competition Commissioner will almost certainly have contradictory powers to those of the utilities regulators. Having said, ``Let's put competition under a powerful regulator called the Competition Commission'', the Government are now attempting to establish a completely separate body. That is wholly illogical, which is, of course, natural for this Government.

<P>
On telecommunications, the Government have revealed over the past week that they have competely lost touch with reality. Last Thursday, during DTI questions, the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce said:

<P>
We want fast cheap internet access to be available to everyone. That is why I welcome the recent announcements from BT and Telewest. We are promoting greater competition in fixed and mobile telephones, which will give consumers more choice and lower prices.--[Official Report, 2 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 539.]
Later on during questions, the Minister, who is not responsible for regulation--that is down to Oftel, the independent regulator--had to admit the truth of an item in that day's edition of The Daily Telegraph. I quote:

<P>
Telecoms regulator Oftel has told BT that its planned unmetered internet service, Surftime, is anti-competitive as it would not allow competitors to launch similar products at the same time.
Although, at long last, there is an e-Minister--and even an e-envoy, although he keeps very quiet--it is becoming apparent that the Government do not have a clue about such matters.

<P>
Last autum, I said that enormous competitive pressures will arise in the internet market with the introduction of extremely inexpensive systems. In line with that, Alta Vista has just announced that it is about to launch a service that costs £30 up front, and then £10 a year, for 24-hour access. That was immediately trumped by NTL, a major investor in the UK cable industry, which said that it will offer completely free access to the internet to anyone who uses its telephone service and has bills of more than £10 a month.

<P>
That is the kind of development that we envisaged when we released the telecoms industry to go out and create a real market. It is not necessary for Ministers to run around trying to promote this or that competitive product. That should be left to the market, which is performing, and leaving the Government cold. The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs is nodding in agreement. Perhaps the Government will announce that the telecoms industry does not need a new regulator; Oftel will be left as it is and allowed to wither on the vine as the market takes over.

<P>
I am totally unclear as to why the Government think it necessary to change the situation in the water industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned that the Minister in charge of the Bill represents a Scottish constituency. Perhaps her knowledge of the Scottish water industry was significant in the decision to remove the water industry from the Bill. It is important that people in Scotland should know what is going to happen to the water industry throughout the United Kingdom. We do not know whether the Government are going to prevent the Scottish Parliament from determining how it intends Scotland's water industry to be financed in future, or whether it has the power to do so.

<P>
It is worrying that the Deputy Prime Minister is suspected of intending to move backwards to a nationalised industry. That involves a rather strange juxtaposition. We heard this morning that most of the Deputy Prime Minister's constitutents are celebrating the success of Kingston Communications, which is partly privately owned and partly owned by shareholders, most of whom are Hull residents. It was a privatised industry.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> It is a public-private ownership.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for pointing that out. He probably does not know the telecommunications industry as well as I do, or that I had a meeting with Kingston Communications. It is concerned that the local government regulations mean that it already owns too much of the business, and it wants the Government to change those rules so that it can continue to maintain its ownership. The Minister should be careful about jumping in with both feet and promoting the current situation, which may be ultra vires. Ministers may have to decide what should happen and they should be careful about supporting such a proposal. The Minister should check with his legal advisers about whether a public-private partnership is involved and whether that is allowable under the Government's rules.

<P>
I support that excellent organisation, which demonstrated before the duopoly was established that BT's suggestion that only large monopolies could look after our telecoms was incorrect. We should be pleased that the company is so successful that it has joined the top 100 companies on the FTSE index.

<P>
Last week, on the day that the Government decided to withdraw the water and telecommunications provisions from the Bill, the announcement by United Utilities caught my attention. It may have been one of the companies that challenged the Government over the operation of the provisions. It is attracting investments from the United States into the United Kingdon, which the Government say they like to encourage. Interestingly, it decided to get rid of its electricity interests because it did not like the way that that industry was developing. It said that it wanted to concentrate not on electricity, which will continue to be regulated by the Bill, but on its telecommunications and water interests, which the Bill will no longer deal with. When the Government decided to remove those utilities from the Bill, had they received representations from United Utilities?

<P>
Many Opposition Members attempted to help the Government by tabling amendments. One amendment that I tabled would have referred to the Bill as an energy Bill, not as the Utilities Bill, but it was rejected by the Government. Many of our comments on telecommunications have proved to be correct--the Minister decided to withdraw all of the telecommunications provisions.

<P>
Tabling amendments feels like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. One part of the Bill has broken away from the Titanic and sunk, and it took most of our amendments with it. The situation should be clarified before we study it at weekends and discuss it until 2 o'clock in the morning. I e-mailed by hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton early one morning to ensure that we had sufficient amendments to discuss in the Committee. We are owed an assurance from the Government on exactly what they will do with the other half of the Titanic, which is wallowing in mid-Atlantic having lost its steering and its engine. We want to know whether emergency repairs will be carried out to the Bill.

<P>
If we considered just the electricity pool and what changes are required in the law to do away with the present system and introduce the new system--I am assuming that the gas and electricity regulators can be brought together without buying any more large office blocks and with a reduction in the number of people working on the consumer councils--such a Bill would merit the time of the Committee and the House. More importantly, it would be good for consumers and British industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the concern of the electricity industry that the Bill receives Royal Assent soon so that the new electricity trading arrangements can be in place by October? That is imperative and if the Government were serious about helping the electricity industry, they would introduce a one-clause Bill that could be put on the statute book rapidly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am most grateful to hear from my hon. Friend that the Opposition Front Benchers would give that commitment to the Government. It is a statesmanlike way of dealing with the matter. Let us hear some statesmanlike statements from Ministers and some honesty about how they got themselves into this mess. Parliament is forgiving when it hears the truth and receives an apology, and the Opposition are willing to work positively with the Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Has the hon. Gentleman nearly finished?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, I shall be happy to continue for another half an hour.

<P>
I give you notice, Mrs Roe, that, if I catch your eye, I shall rise again on the motion if we do not receive from both DTI and DETR Ministers a proper explanation of why we are in this position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): I confess that I had not intended to speak, but the Government Whip approached me outside the Room asked me whether I was going to speak and I was then minded to say a few words. Fortunately, Opposition Members are free thinkers and do not have to be prompted to speak or not to speak, as Government Back Benchers must.

<P>
Mr hon. Friends have described the position in which we find ourselves as a dog's dinner. The words have been used often this morning and they well describe what the Government are doing. The DTI is a burial ground for political careers and I look forward to witnessing the fate of the Secretary of State at the end of proceedings on the Bill. I suspect that he and others will be moved elsewhere--

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The undead.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Indeed. Someone else will come along and have a go at the bottom of the barrel.

<P>
The Government have put their foot in their mouth. They must understand the rudiments of the commercial world. They should not embark on legislation and then, half way through, decide that it is not what they wanted. No Government can be taken seriously if that is done more than once, but it is happening time after time. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset pointed out some of the issues that may affect the Culture, Media and Sports Committee. Even members of that Committee who sit on the Government Benches are beside themselves at the way in which they are being treated on the Committee. We are having the same problem with decisions being taken and not being followed through by the Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend points out that Labour Members on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee are willing to voice their concern about these issues, but he will have noticed that that is not the case here. We have not heard a word from the Government Benches.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I can only suggest that the Government Whip has a great deal of weight in his party. I can only assume that, when one of the current Ministers gets the push, he will land up taking the job--as happened with the Whip with the Culture, Media and Sport brief who landed up being the junior Minister--and I do not envy him his task if that happens.

<P>
The Bill is not the Bill that we began debating. The hon. Member for Lewes rightly said that it should be scrapped and started again. It is a public relations disaster for the Government, who came into office priding themselves on their communication skills. I shall not bore the Committee by citing other instances, but this has been going on for some time: what with the day-mayor and the night-mayor Labour candidates for the elections in May in London, the Government are spending too much time fighting fires instead of getting decent legislation through the House. People in the water industry said many times that the Bill was badly drafted and a shambles, but that fell on deaf ears.

<P>
The principal objective of the Bill as I understand it--I wait to be corrected by the Minister--or what is left of this biscuit, which has been eaten from all sides and which no one wants to digest, is to protect consumers' interests alongside looking after competition issues. I have already explained the issues of competition and how best one can bring prices down, but my explanation was rejected by some. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy) who keeps dropping in and out of the Committee, told me only the other day that the competition aspect of the legislation introduced by the previous Government was a good thing, but other Government Members do not seem to agree.

<P>
An article in The Daily Telegraph only last Friday said that the ``dual aims'' of the Bill would ``tug in opposite directions''. The Government must appreciate that we are asking questions about where the Bill is going. If they cannot answer them, why on earth should anybody take their objectives seriously? There is style but no substance, and policy decisions are being made on the hoof, which is not good for anybody, least of all the consumers whom the Government purport to want to work with, to help and to represent. That is a crying shame.

<P>
It will be interesting to see how the telecommunications part of the Bill is re-presented at some time in the future. I suspect, as my hon. Friends said earlier, that the proposed communications Bill will appear after the general election. Thank goodness the Labour party will not be in government then; we would have no confidence in it then, just as we have none now, to be able to put anything together. The people will rightly decide not to vote Labour because of what the Government are doing.

<P>
I am not alone in saying that. The Independent said the other day that the Government had reached meltdown in support from Labour party members, as a result of the way in which they are governing the country. It has happened as soon as we predicted.

<P>
I want to ask the Minister a specific question, which she will want to answer in full. I am sure that she will accept that, when the state becomes a major purchaser of any good or service, that has a significant effect on the market for that product. As the Chancellor intends to give away mobile phones to the unemployed, will the Minister estimate what effect that will have on competition in the market of the mobile telecommunications industry? Did that knee-jerk reaction initiative have any effect on the decision made to drop the telecoms part of the Bill? Like my hon Friends, I am mightily suspicious about why things are taken up and dropped by the Government. They must learn that the world of commerce is quite different form their own political posturing, political expediency and lack of judgment. They owe the Committee, the House and Parliament an apology for the dog's dinner that they have created.

<P>

<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> There have been a number of long contributions this morning, some of which have shed interesting light on the Opposition's position. It is interesting to see the significant U-turn by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who, on Second Reading, said that he intended to support certain aspects of the Bill. Indeed, he said:

<P>
There are one or two things that we support. We welcome, in principle, the reform of the electricity pool.
The hon. Gentleman has already said that. However, at that time, he went on:

<P>
We agree that the supply and distribution of electricity need to be separately licensed, enabling the natural monopoly area to be confined to the smallest component. We welcome the merger of electricity and gas regulators, which reflects the fact that most suppliers provide both gas and electricity. It follows, therefore, that the consumer councils should be merged also.--[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 869.]
All that has gone now. All the hon. Gentleman wants now is a one-clause Bill, perhaps because, as a member of the Opposition, he thinks that it would be easier to get through without having to do his homework. The Government are anxious to see the Bill on the statute book.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman never knowingly leaves anything understated. His love of hyperbole is matched only by that of the hon. Member for South Dorset, who was saying that he was hustling along to assist the Committee--the South Dorset Ferrari with one wheel falling off. He rambled all round the houses with all sorts of unsubstantiated allegations about blind trusts and formula 1 motor racing. One of the interesting pointers is that every time the hon. Gentleman is challenged on something that he has said, he says that he is a shareholder in the company or has shares in an aspect of the industry that we are discussing. Therefore, the synthetic ire of Opposition Members is seen for the shoddy practice that it is.

<P>
A number of issues have been raised this morning. Let me make it absolutely clear that a third of the Bill is being removed. There were 134 clauses in the original Bill, of which 82 related to gas and electricity. In addition, the Competition Commission reforms in part IV of the Bill that relate to energy will be carried forward. What remains is a substantial programme of reform that is broadly welcomed by the industry, notwithstanding some of the hysteria in newspapers like The Sunday Telegraph, which talk about the renationalisation of gas and electricity. Opposition Members would do better to spend even more time listening to ``Jackanory'', which seems to be inspiring their speeches in Committee. In most cases the gas and electricity clauses are self-standing.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wants to get rid of the Bill, although many of its clauses are self-standing. A new order or consideration will allow us to take the clauses together. Despite the hyperbole in his own contribution, the hon. Member for Lewes made a fairly reasoned argument. However, saying that he did not know whether the Bill hung together because he had not had time to look at it was perhaps an engagingly honest comment. He also asked about the extent to which consumers' organisations had responded to the Government's action. The Consumers Association wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Competition and Consumer Affairs, saying:

<P>
We recognise that there are advantages to treating telecommunications as part of wider converging industries and to treat its regulatory issues in an converged Communications Bill. It is an approach we have supported for some time.''
The association is seeking assurances from the Government, as well it might, that independent consumer councils will be an essential element of the communications White Paper. To judge by the views held by my hon. Friend who deals with those matters, they are likely to succeed in achieving that aim.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker rose--</B><P>


<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The Ofwat National Customer Council said in a press notice that it saw a chance to obtain a better deal for consumers. It stated:

<P>
We have been concerned that the powers proposed by the Government for the Consumer Council for Water would not be strong enough  There will now be time to get the proposals right before they are introduced in the Water Bill.
If the hon. Gentleman still wishes to intervene, I shall be happy to give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> It is a bit late now. However, I am grateful to the Minister for calling me engagingly honest; I have been called worse things. For the record, I did not say that I had not looked at the Bill; I said that I had had difficulty in analysing it in its new format, given the major changes that it underwent last week. That is an entirely different matter.

<P>
The Minister raised a point regarding telecoms. Will she deal with the point that I raised earlier, that the convergence of broadcasting and telecoms to which I referred on Second Reading was foreseen by the Government last year--although their announcement may not have been made until this February? Given that the convergence was foreseen last year, and given that it is sensible to deal with broadcasting and telecoms together, why were telecoms included in the Bill at all?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> We had a number of discussions at an earlier stage of the Bill, and I accepted a number of the hon. Gentleman's points about that convergence. It was originally thought that we could make the kind of progress that we sought to make, but I remember pointing out to the hon. Member for South Dorset that it would be necessary to revisit telecoms regulation because of the nature of the convergence in that industry. I felt that there was agreement between us that had to be recognised. On the detail of the forthcoming communications White Paper, the Government have made a sensible and welcome decision. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a similar point in Committee on 29 February, so I do not know why he is getting so irate now.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is obsessed by the number of amendments tabled to the Bill. I know that he is a new Member, so I must tell him that consequential amendments are tabled to all Bills as a matter of course. They are part of the procedures of the House. I have been in opposition so I know that it is hard work preparing for a Committee in that position. It is also hard work preparing for a Committee when one is in government. Nevertheless, one has to burn the midnight oil, and it comes in very useful because one ends up with a far better grasp of the Bill. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman resents having to do all that work during the wee small hours, but we, too, have had to do that in the past. I suggest to him that doing such homework is well worth while.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The right hon. Lady is missing the point completely. The Committee has wasted time debating the previous clauses, but we want to know whether we shall be wasting our time debating the forthcoming ones. The Government do not appear to know where they are going. Are we to continue with the provisions for electricty and gas?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> We would have made more rapid progress on electricity and gas had we not had to go all round the houses listening to the hon. Gentleman checking on their marble content. We have an opportunity to make good progress, and significantly to improve the Bill. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that amendments tabled by Opposition Members will be accepted by the Government. We have a wide range of expertise available in the Committee. However, we need to get down to the nuts and bolts of examining the Bill. The order of consideration is much easier to examine than the detailed substance. We have long debates such as this because they are easier and more exciting than getting our heads down and scrutinising the Bill line by line.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the right hon. Lady give way?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I will give way ina minute. The day si young; we have many hours ahead of us in which to go into detailed scrutiny, and some of us are looking forward to that very much indeed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the right hon. Lady answer this simple question How many more Government amendments are to be tabled? Can she provide a figure, or have the amendments yet to be prepared?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> There will be as many as it takes. The hon. Gentleman might like to tell Committee members how many amendments the Opposition intend to table. He and the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing), who is the Opposition Whip, are new to this House but they are experienced in the workings of Parliament. It is not unusual for Governments, particularly Governments who listen, to introduce amendments, and we are prepared to listen to what people say. We should remember the failings of the previous Administration--who was it who said that there will be no U-turns?--who never listened.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> Does the right hon. Lady accept that, in many instances, particularly in government, actions speak louder than words? She has consulted and listened, but she seems not to be doing much.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman, who is a little confused, has forgotten last Thursday's discussion. We listened to representations and took action by tabling the new order of consideration.

<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the previous Administration's attitude, which Opposition Members supported, was, ``If you listen, you're damned, if you don't listen, you're damned, so why listen?''? They did not listen and are confused about the way ahead.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I accept my hon. Friend's point. Although it is three years since the election, Opposition Members seem not to realise why they lost it.

<P>
The Bill is very significant and, as energy Minister, I am anxious to see it on the statute book. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the importance of the new electricity trading arrangements. Those are extremely important changes, which we wish to make as quickly as possible, so that the industry can adopt a fairer and more transparent structure that will reduce prices. However, there are other areas about which I have concerns.

<P>
A new principal objective for the energy regulator will be to protect consumers' interests where appropriate by promoting effective competition. We believe that competition is one of the most effective regulators, but there are areas in which competition cannot operate as freely as we might like. That is often true in respect of low-income consumers, the chronically sick, the disabled, pensioners and consumers in rural areas, who have specific requirements. Until a competitive market that will benefit such groups can be brought to bear, it is important that the regulator be required to take account of the needs of groups who do not benefit fully from competition.

<P>
The Bill will establish an independent Gas and Electricity Consumer Council that will mirror the alignment of gas and electricity regulation. It will resolve complaints, provide consumers with useful information and advocate the interests of all consumers to the regulator, the Government and others who influence regulation. The energy regulator will be empowered to impose financial penalties on companies for past and on-going breaches of licence conditions, performance standards and other specified statutory requirements. The consumer council will be empowered to publish utility information where it is in consumers' interests and does not seriously or prejudicially affect interested parties. Price-regulated energy utilities will be required to disclose any links between directors' pay and customer service standards.

<P>
The new electricity trading arrangements will be underpinned by legislation. Separate licensing of electricity supply and distribution will be required, and a bar on the holding of supply and distribution licences by the same person will be introduced. The regulatory authority will be empowered to adapt the licensing regime to changing market structures by statutory instrument under affirmative resolution, without additional primary legislation, to ensure that regulation keeps pace with a fast-changing industry.

<P>
The licensing and regulatory systems for gas and electricity will be aligned, where possible, so that companies that are active in both sectors are not subject to differing requirements and procedures without good reason. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton keeps returning to regulatory certainty and the costs of regulation, and that measure will significantly improve the former and reduce the latter.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>


<P>
New ``collective'' licence modification procedures will enable the energy regulator to modify standard licence conditions without a Competition Commission reference, even if some companies disagree.

<P>
I turn to the wider social and environmental objectives. A duty will be placed on the regulator, in the exercise of its statutory functions, to have regard to guidance issued by Ministers on social and environmental objectives for the energy sector. Ministers will be given new powers to make regulations to promote energy efficiency, which is an important aspect of fuel poverty and the overall efficiency of our economy, to promote the generation of electricity from renewable sources, which will become increasingly important as we meet our climate-change responsibilities and known reserves of existing fuels are reduced, and to provide for a cross-subsidy for the benefit of disadvantaged consumers.

<P>
The measures involve greater regulatory transparency, predictability and accountability. The individual gas and electricity regulator will be replaced with a collective regulatory authority, providing regulatory certainty and getting rid of the personalisation of regulation that has bedevilled us in the past. The regulator will be required to give reasons for key decisions and to publish and consult on its forward work programme. The Competition Commission will be empowered to veto licence modifications developed by the regulator following a reference to it if, in its opinion, they do not remedy or prevent the adverse effects identified by the commission. A single specialist gas and electricity panel of the Competition Commission will be established, one or more of whose members will be selected to serve on the various reference inquiries.

<P>
The official Opposition would scrap all those changes, although the hon. Member for Lewes indicated that the Liberal Democrats support them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> He did not.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> He just has.

<P>
The changes are significant, and will make a real difference to modernising energy regulation.

<P>
I turn to the questions that hon. Members asked. Of the 54 Government amendments that have been tabled, 15 are about telecoms. On clauses 84 to 88, five Government amendments were tabled and agreed, and on clauses 89 to 103, 10 were tabled.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset asked about the European convention on human rights. If he looks at the front of the Bill, he will see that the Secretary of State

<P>
has made the following statement under section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1988:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In my view the provisions of the Utilities Bill are compatible with the Convention rights.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My point was that if the Secretary of State discovered that he was incorrect in that statement, he would have to withdraw parts of the Bill. Did anyone challenge it, giving him legal reasons for doing so?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> There has been no such challenge. We are confident that the provisions of the Bill are consistent with EU directives, which the hon. Gentleman also mentioned, and the ECHR.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Doreset asked about the relationship between the Bill and the Competition Act 1988. The Government believe that competition provides the best possible means of promoting efficiency and driving down prices. Regulation is sometimes needed to protect consumers who are not able to benefit from fully developed competition. The 1998 Act strengthened sectoral regulators' powers to investigate and remedy anti-competitive behaviour in the utility sectors by allowing them to exercise their powers concurrently with the Director General of Fair Trading. The first proposal in the Bill is to improve sectoral regulation, making it more accountable, transparent and predictable and ensuring that consumers get a fair deal. There is no contradition in that.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset was interested in United Utilities and my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg) has passed to me a letter that he received from Norweb, which is part of United Utilities. The letter states:

<P>
Overall we welcome the merger of Offer and Ofgem, the separation of electicity distribution from supply, the greater accountability of the regulators, the transfer of social and environmental decisions from regulators to Ministers and the new powers of the Competition Commission following a referall.
Norweb then refers to other matters that they want to be explored in greater detail.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am sure that the right hon. Lady has told us all the positive points that Norweb made. Will she share with the Committee its reason for writing the letter? Companies do not write letters unless they have an element of complaint. What was its reason for writing the letter and what did it want the Government to change?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> It is in fact a kind and generous letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Halton from a representative of Norweb who states how much he enjoyed meeting my hon. Friend at a recent reception on the House of Commons Terrance. It makes it clear that he supports the action taken by my hon. Friend in listening to their industry--he represents a constituency near Liverpool. It is a most generous letter that offers assistance to my hon. Friend and the DTI during the passange of the Bill. It is a great tribute to my hon. Friend. I would willingly read out the whole letter, but the hon. Member for South Dorset has taken a long time speaking this morning and we want to make progress with the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister, having introduced the subject of the letter, would send copies to all Committee members.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> That is a matter for my hon. Friend the Member for Halton, who I am sure will discuss it in the margins of the Committee at some other time.

<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole was congratulating my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on his initiative to assist the unemployed. One of the Government's great achievements has been to reduce unemployment and it was clever of my right hon. Friend to ensure that unemployed people have access to mobile and other telecommunications. As to whether the provision will benefit any one individual. I suggest that if the hon. member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole goes into any high street shop he will find that, with the multiplicity of operators in the mobile telephone sector, he can buy a mobile telephone for £9.99. It is an intensely competitive market.

<P>
I shall conclude with the issues that are so significant in ensuring that the Bill reaches the statute book. Some provisions are yet to be introduced. We shall introduce measures consequential on the separation of electricity distribution and supply, including provisions for transer schemes for public electricity suppliers, meausres to increase competition on gas transportation and clauses implementing for gas the licence modification procedures set out for electricity. There will, of course, be consequential and tehcnical amendments arising from that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked which White Paper measures are not in the Bill. At the moment we must proceed with any further meausres that take into account the consideration of other utilities. If we proceed with the order of consideration, it will not be necessary to introduce them into the legislation.

<P>
On Second Reading the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a reasoned speech on the benefits of the legislation for consumers and the industry. I am sorry that he has turned turtle and now wishes to lose the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Again, that was an unsatisfactory response to an important debate. We have tried to make some inquiries of House of Commons authorities about whether any previous Government have withdrawn so many clauses from a Bill. I believe that it is unprecedented; it was difficult to see how the Commitee could follow any precedent when there was no precedent to follow. For the Minister still not to acknowledge that the Bill is in trouble is hubris of the worst kind. She will regret her approach to the Committee and the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend will notice that we still have not had a speech from the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Perhaps my hon. Friend will speak for a few minutes more, so that the Minister can get his thoughts together and give us the benefit of his explanation of why the water industry provisions have been removed.

<P>
<B>Mr.Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. What people think outside the House is that there has been a major dispute between the DTI and the DETR. It is said that Dan Corry, the special adviser to the Secretary of State, has been going round saying that there is a dispute between the two Departments. That is the problem that has arisen.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If it is any comfort to the hon. Gentleman, he will in due course hear my speech on the water clauses, but not at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. I hope that the Under-Secretary will confirm whether there has been a dispute between the two Departments, because that is a matter of public interest. The Committee should be informed not only if there has been a dispute, but of the nature of the dispute, because it will inevitably involve philosophical issues and different approaches to policy, which are of interest to the Committee. We want to know about the dispute, how it has been settled and what the Government have in mind for the future regulation of the water sector.

<P>
The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe made a slightly confusing point about the number of future Government amendments. First, she refused to give a number, which I find staggering at this stage of the Bill. I was not particularly surprised that she could not do so at the beginning of the Committee stage, but now we are some two months into it.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Two months?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> One month; I beg the right hon. Lady's pardon. It seems like two months. We are one month--nine-sittings--into the Committee stage and we still have not been told by any Minister the precise number of Government amendments. That implies that there is no specific number, because they have not yet been drafted, which implies that the Bill is still in a mess. It is quite astonishing for Ministers to say that the Bill is not in trouble, when it is clear, even from today's sitting, that it is still in a mess.

<P>
We are still unclear what the right hon. Lady meant about the remaining issues set out in paragraph 8 of the explanatory notes, which will still require Government amendments to implement the remainder of the White Paper's promises. She said that some of the measures would not be implemented: it would depend on how long the Committee took to debate the issues, and it might not be necessary to introduce them into the Bill. That is a totally unsatisfactory response. I shall have to look at the right hon. Lady's precise words to see what that is all about. Is she saying that, because of her Department's mishandling of the Bill, she will not introduce into it some of the key proposals in the White Paper, which were promised on Second Reading? If so, which measures does she not intend to introduce?

<P>
The right hon. Lady criticised the Opposition for performing a U-turn on the Bill. There has been no U-turn by Opposition Members, although we have seen a major U-turn on this issue by the Government. We still support the reforms to the electricity pool and we want to see clause 56 on the statute book as soon as possible, implementing the new electricity trading arrangements. We support the concept of merging the gas and electricity regulatory systems and the separation of the licensing of electricity distribution and supply, but we want those measures to be implemented in a properly drafted Bill. What has become apparent during the Committee stage is that we have an appallingly drafted Bill. One of the roles and duties of the House is to ensure that legislation that is put on to the statute book is correctly drafted, but the Government have admitted that half the Bill--or one third, as the right hon. Lady likes to say--is not properly drafted and needs to be withdrawn.

<P>
We urge the Government to take the Bill away, engage in more consultation with industry, get some proper draftsmen to draft the Bill, and return with a revised Bill later in the Session. It can then receive a swifter transition on to the statute book, as we will be dealing with a competent piece of work instead of an incompetent one.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
The wording of the telecoms and water parts of the Bill is broadly similar to that of the electricity and gas parts. If the Government believe that the telecoms and water industry sections are not appropriate for parliamentary consideration, I believe--as does industry--that the other sections must be equally poorly drafted, and should not be in the Bill. The same criticisms that were set out in the operators group letter, aside from the issue of the White Paper and duplication of changing the regulatory regime, are the same as those that paply to the electricity and gas industries, which are also of concern to the Confederation of British Industry.

<P>
There has been an appalling lack of consultation on the Bill. Did the Government discuss the impending White Paper on communications? Was it not referred to? The same questions apply to water. The Minister quoted from the Ofwat document, which stated that the withdrawal was welcome, and that now is the time to get the Bill right for the consumer. Why did the Government not get it right for the consumer first time around?

<P>
This has been an interesting experience. No member of the Committee will have seen such incompetence by a Government Department in presenting a Bill to the House of Commons. I do not think any hon. Members who are not serving on this Committee will have seen such incompetence. In view of the unsatisfactory answers given by the Minister, which included no information about the number of Government amendments to be tabled, I urge the Committee to reject the order of consideration motion.

<P>
, unless the context otherwise ``exemption'' means an exemption granted under section 5.--[Dr. Howells.]

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I hope that the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs will respond to the concerns expressed by the Opposition and other Committee members when we discussed clause 8. In his response to clause 8, the Minister said that he would refer only to the gas sector, but we felt that our concerns about the gas sector also applied to the electricity sector. I shall not try the Committee's patience by repeating all our concerns about clause 8, but I hope that the Minister will address those concerns in relation to the electricity sector.

<P>
It is still not clear how fundamental clauses 8 and 12--and 89, until it is withdrawn--are. They go to the root of the Bill, because they deal with the changing of objectives to which the regulator should have regard. The Minister does not believe that the Bill will produce a dramatic upheaval--a revolution--in utility regulation. However, that is the view neither of Opposition Members, nor of outside commentators such as Neil Bennett, who wrote in The Sunday Telegraph on 5 March 2000:

<P>
From my reading it amounts to a near renationalisation of the gas and power industries.

<P>
That is not hyperbole, as the right hon. Lady suggested. Clearly, the proposals do not involve renationalisation, but they amount to a new form of control over private sector companies through changes in regulation and licence conditions. We must get to grips with the Bill's intentions. They will affect the conditions that the utility companies can expect once the Bill is enacted. They will also affect the price increases--or lack of decreases--that consumers can expect as a result of the regulations that may be imposed by the Bill. The Minister must address those concerns, and set out the Bill's intentions once and for all.

<P>
Professor Littlechild, who was key in designing the regime currently operating in the utility sector said in response to the Bill that

<P>
most regulators felt that making the protection of customers a primary duty was not a problem but largely unnecessary, since they were already reuqired to protect the interests of customers and sought to do so.

<P>
The Minister described the duty to look after retired, chronically sick or disabled people and those living in the countryside as one of the great benefits of the Bill. However, the Electricity and Gas Acts that regulate the present system contain all those measures. There is, therefore, no need to wax lyrical about those provisions in the Bill, because they already exist. 

<P>
Professor Littlechild goes onto say that he is concerned about the Bill, because

<P>
the proposed wording of the changes here--
that is, in clauses 8 and 12, the duty clauses--

<P>
may be positively unhelpful in so far as it puts an additional obstacle in the way of regulators promoting competition. The duty to promote competition will no longer be unqualified. This will have to be demonstrated to be the most appropriate way to protect consumers.

<P>
Previously, all that the regulator had to do was to indulge in activities that promoted competition. Now, he will have to demonstrate that that will immediately result in greater benefits for the consumer. That may not necessarily be the case in the short term. Even if it were, it is often difficult to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that changes that allow more competitors into an industry will, in the short run, give rise to more innovation, greater flexibility and lower prices for the consumer.

<P>
Professor Littlechild also said that there would be no shortage of companies willing to argue the opposite, perhaps even to the Competition Commission and in judicial review. That is the problem: the Bill will be open to interpretation by the courts. The statements made by the Minister in clarifying this very ambiguous legislation in accordance with Pepper v. Hart will be most useful in providing some certainty as to what the Bill intends to achieve, and how draconian it will be.

<P>
During the debate on clause 8, we discussed an amendment relating to why the Government had omitted from the duties the phrase ``wherever possible''. The Minister's explanation was not entirely satisfactory. That phrase would impose an imperative on the regulator to promote competition more often than under the present provision of ``wherever approporiate''. ``Wherever possible and appropriate'' would place a far greater obligation on the regulator to seek out new competitive markets, and to open up the markets to more competition, wherever he possibly could. It is strange that that phrase occurs throughout all the Government's consultation documents.

<P>
 For example, the Green Paper states:

<P>
A new single primary duty should be inserted into the relevant utility statutes, requiring the utility regulators to exercise their functions in the manner best calculated to protect the interests of the consumer, wherever possible and appropriate through promoting effective competition.
The phrase ``wherever possible'' has been omitted from the Bill, which is odd, as the Secretary of State used it in a series of speeches, first of all to the CBI conference on 1 November 1999, when he said:

<P>
My approach is clear--competition wherever possible, regulation only when absolutely essential.
In case that was just a slip of the tongue and was not meant to be in the speech, he used it again as recently as 28 February in a speech to the Social Market Foundation, when he said:

<P>
A strong competition policy, promoting competition wherever possible, is a central part of new Labour's economic policy.
Therefore, twice in recent speeches and throughout the Government's consultation documents and Green Papers, the phrase ``wherever possible'' is used.

<P>
The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs believes that saying ``wherever possible'' adds nothing to the meaning of the Bill, but that is not the view of legal counsel. Any lawyer who specialises in this area of legislation will say that it makes a huge difference. We need a proper explanation of why the phrase is being omitted. It is not just the parliamentary draftsmen have said that it is not necessary, because others take a different view. It is time that the Government came clean and said why they have removed that phrase. Is it because they do not believe that promotion of competition is the imperative that we believe it is and that, despite the rhetoric in their speeches and documents, they do not believe in or want to pursue a policy that promotes fierce competition in these markets?

<P>
The Minister said that the previous regime put shareholders first and consumers second, whereas this regime puts consumers first and shareholders second--he must have been referring to the fact that, under current legislation, the primary duty is to ensure, first of all, the utilities' financial viability and security of supply--yet he said earlier in Committee that the duties in subsection (2), meeting demand and being able to finance it, were equal to and part of the primary duty to protect the consumer. The financing duty is either part of the consumer interest, in which case nothing has changed from the previous regime, or it is subordinated, in which case he has misled the Committee. Which is it? It cannot be both. Will he clarify that?

<P>
Subsection (2) clearly says ``having regard to'', which suggests that it is a subsidiary duty to have regard to the financial viability of the utility companies. If it is subsidiary, a change of regime has taken place, and what the Minister said about its all being part of the same primary duty is wrong. That is an important point that was not addressed correctly when we debated the objective clauses earlier. I hope that he will explain what subsection (2) means and how he can contend, from the wording, that it is part of the primary duty in subsection (1).

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I want to pursue my hon. Friend's point about where we are going with the clause; clause 13 has similar requirements for the authorities' social duties in regulating the gas and electricity industries.

<P>
We had, helpfully, a letter dated 1 March from Ofgem, from the director of consumer and environmental affairs--I assume that that is the director designate, although Virginia Graham does not seem to think that she is only the director designate--setting out the types of duty that Ofgem envisages under its social action plan.

<P>
Ofgem's approach seems to be minimalist. It is making the same proposals for looking after the chronically sick and the elderly as the previous regulators did. It does not appear to be going what it intended to do, except in relation to ``individuals with low incomes'' or those who are ``residing in rural areas''.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Adding the clause to this truncated Bill will create powers that are much wider than is necessary. Ofgem has said that few changes are needed, and it and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry have said that a revolutionary change is not involved in this context. However, the more junior Ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry appear to want to grant wide powers, which could be abused. We have tabled amendments that we shall debate later that would reduce the scope for people to abuse the ordinary consumer on behalf of people with particular needs. The Minister should explain the Government's intentions in the clause and why its provisions have been drawn so widely.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I do not intend to go over the ground that we covered when we discussed clause 8.

<P>
I enjoy reading The Daily Telegraph--I do so on Monday mornings, because it is given away free on the First Great Western service from Cardiff to Paddington. I do not know whether that is done on other routes--that would be worth checking. The newspaper is always a refreshing read.

<P>
I should have nothing to do with the renationalisation of this or any other industry. I was associated with the coal industry, and I am aware of the incredible inflexibility and top-heavy bureaucracy that was involved. Whitehall determined the industry's priorities, although civil servants knew absolutely nothing about the industry. I cannot imagine--I have a pretty vivid imagination at times--how anyone could suggest that this incredibly technical Bill could involve the nationalisation of the electricity or gas industries. The Daily Telegraph can be proud of its record for advocating the liberalisation of dangerous drugs--whoever wrote the article had probably been on some.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister said that he does not support the renationalisation of private sector companies because Whitehall's interference would be involved. However, the Bill will have precisely that effect although, of course, it will not renationalise the companies--the shares will remain in the private sector. The Secretary of State will be able to issue guidance to the regulator, who will pass on what are, in effect, instructions to the industry. People outside the House are concerned that that will result in a new form of governmental control of the industries, namely, governmental control by regulation. The Minister criticised nationalised industries for having such an effect, but the Bill will have a similar effect.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No, I do not agree, although the hon. Gentleman makes an important point. One of his colleagues--I forget who--made an interesting comment on Second Reading. He said that Governments should be careful not to create parallel Governments by regulation. I have much sympathy with that important point. I am a firm believer in less government, not more. I should have nothing to do with a Bill that involved the real danger of regulators who parroted a Government's demands, often for short-term considerations and to the industry's detriment. I am a firm believer in the notion that consumers will benefit most from competition.

<P>
I turn to some of the criticisms raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I am sorry to have to disagree with so learned a commentator as Professor Littlehcild, and I have already paid homage to the genuine contribution made by his RPI _ X formulation. However, it is simply not true that the Bill will downgrade the importance of competition, and the clause makes it clear that competition will be encouraged ``wherever appropriate''. As I have explained to the hon. Gentleman, that phrase has the same meaning as ``wherever possible and appropriate''. The difference is merely that of the language used in speeches and legislation.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether finance forms part of a primary duty. It does: the difference is that consumer protection, which used to be subordinate, will, quite properly, be a primary concern of regulators.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am afraid that I cannot accept what the Minister says. He conceded that, where the previous regime put shareholders first and the consumer second, the current regime does the reverse. He must have been referring to a duty to ensure the financial viability of utilities, and if so, as the Bill makes clear, that viability will be demoted. The clause uses the phrase ``having regard to'', which will subordinate that duty.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I should make it clear that I understand the drift of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but he is wrong. The duty to take account of licence holders' ability to finance their activities is part of the primary duty. It is a vital, not secondary, aspect of protecting the interests of consumers. Clearly, adequate investment, which must be financed, is required to meet consumers' needs. We must serve the long-term interests of consumers as well as their short-term interests--a point that is emphasised by including future consumers among those whose interests will be protected.

<P>
A main element of the Bill is the creation of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority in response to the convergence of those two energy markets. The Government have also sought to reflect that convergence and streamline the authority's work by aligning the principal objective with the general duties of the two sectors. In doing so, we have aimed to choose the better option from the two existing sets of duties. For example, a duty to have regard to the interests of the chronically sick will apply to the electricity sector as well as the gas sector.

<P>
In debating amendments to clauses 8 and 12, we have considered issues where the emphasis may differ slightly in respect of gas and electricity. However, I am certain that it is right to align the principal objective with the general duties, and I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not find that explanation satisfactory. Debates with the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs have proved much more satisfactory than those with the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe. They hold fundamentally different philosophies, and I agree with many of the obiter dicta of the former. Although in many ways he would be welcome to join Opposition members of the Committee, his free-market and conservative views are not reflected in the Bill. He may wish as much as he likes that he could support the Bill, but its wording differs from his comments in all cases. It is wrong to argue that omitting the phrase ``wherever possible'' from the objective of promoting competition does not alter the clause's meaning, and it will be proven wrong in the courts in the years ahead. When that happens, I hope that he will admit to the House that he was wrong, and apologise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend should point out that powers will be given to any Secretary of State. We know that Conservative Secretaries of State would not misuse them, and we suspect that the Minister would not. However, in the past 24 hours, the leadership of the London Labour party has switched to a completely different type of Labour politician. That could happen throughout this Government. Even before the next general election, a Secretary of State from the Livingstone wing of the Labour party could use the clause in a completely different way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That reflects my point about the regulators. Callum McCarthy's opinion that the Bill is not revolutionary chimes with that of the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs. However, the Bill enables regulators to be other than conservative--in fact, somewhat revolutionary--in their approach to regulation. Despite the Minister's contention that subsection (2) is not subordinate to subsection (1) of new section 3A of the Electricity Act 1989, the wording is clear. Subsection (2) states:

<P>
The Secretary of State and the Authority shall carry out those functions in the manner which he or it considers is best calculated to further the principal objective, having regard to--
It then stipulates the reasonable demands and financial viability of the utility companies. The phrase ``having regard to'' can be interpreted only to mean that subsection (2) must be subordinate to the previous subsection and, despite the Minister's view, that is how it will be interpreted in due course.

<P>
Given the Minister's unsatisfactory responses, and the remaining uncertainty as to the extent to which clauses 12 and 8 will change, or not change, the regulatory regime and its implementation by the regulator, I urge the Committee to vote against the clause, as I did when we debated clause 8. The clause goes to the root of the Bill. Those unsatisfactory and confusing responses will add to the uncertainty of the regulatory regime, which some clarity could have avoided. Any uncertainty on the part of utilities adds to regulatory risk, which increases the cost of capital. That is then passed on to the consumer, because in a capital-intensive industry there is nowhere else for it to go. I urge the Committee to vote against the clause.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider clause 90 stand part to clause 103 stand part, clause 126 stand part Government amendments Nos. 409 to 411 and Government amendments Nos. 413 to 421.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is a unique experience for me. I propose to invite the Committee to disagree to clause 89, and also to clauses 90 to 103 and clause 126. I shall also speak to amendments Nos. 409 to 411 and 413 to 421, which remove references to telecoms from clause 124 and schedules 5, 6 and 7.

<P>
Members of the Committee are already aware of our intention to remove the telecoms provisions from the Bill, as I explained during the previous sitting on 2 March. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained that to the House during oral questions on the same day. As I said then, the Government have been listening carefully to the telecoms industry's views. We have considered the representations that the relevant parts of the Bill should instead be considered in the broader process of reforming telecommunications legislation, to which the Government are committed.

<P>
In fairness, as always, the hon. Gentlemen have argued much the same thing. Indeed, I seem to recall that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton offered the Opposition's assistance in making such changes. I am glad to hear that. I will not accuse anyone of making U-turns--there has been an avalanche of clichs in the Committee this morning, and I do not intend to add to them. Indeed, if I could paraphrase something that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs Browning) said on the Opposition Front Bench last week, if I hear another clich, I will puke.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>

<P>
I should say a little more about our reasons for proposing a change of approach. It is inherent in our willingness to listen, and to act on the advice and representations that we receive, that we will sometimes agree, ``Yes, there is a better way forward''. We should be ready to say that, as we are doing now.

<P>
The views expressed by the industry were in two strands. The first was that the framework of the Bill was unsuitable for the telecommunications industry. The second was that all telecommunications reform issues would be more suitably addressed in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on the regulation of communications. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe made those points clearly. The constant aim of the Bill has been to set a long-term stable framework for utility regulation--

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman just said that there were two reasons why the telecommunications industry was against the Bill--the White Paper and the unsuitability of the framework. Given that that framework of the Bill was set out in the Green Paper and the White Paper, and in consultation documents, did the Government not hear of the telecommunications industry's unhappiness about the framework before the publication of the Bill?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Like many adult relationships, it was an organic and on-going one. We arrived at our decisions later than we should have done. That is the reality.

<P>
The constant aim of the Bill has been to set a long-term stable framework for utility regulation, which is fair to all the interest groups involved. It should be fair to consumers while providing the right incentives for innovation, efficiency and higher standards. We listened to the industry's concerns, and we accept that the regulatory burdens will be minimised if those issues are dealt with in the wider process of communications reform. A single wave of reform legislation, not two, is necessary. The purpose of removing the provisions from the Bill is not to throw all those issues back into the melting pot. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Lewes is not in the Room, as he asked about that earlier.

<P>
The Bill sets out the Government's view of what would be appropriate for the telecommunications industry. The communications White Paper will not be about starting again. Instead, it will be about what adjustments are appropriate to fit into a new regulatory regime on the broadcasting and telecommunications industries. The White Paper will be broad in scope, and will cover areas such as future regulation, broadcast content, media ownership, the role of public service broadcasting and so on. It will build on existing initiatives to improve the working of the regulatory framework, which was noted in earlier papers. It will take account of the European Commission's proposals for reforming the regulatory framework for communications at European level.

<P>
The White Paper will also address how best we can move towards a more flexible regulatory framework in which competition is sufficiently developed to enable consumers and market competitors to protect their interests adequately through the general frameworks of competition and consumer protection law. It should be possible to step back to some degree from sector-specific regulation.

<P>
I want to respond to one of the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the hon. Member for South Dorset. It concerned this morning's news that companies will compete hard on providing low-cost local telephone connections. That is marvellous news, not just for ordinary householders but for businesses and everyone who wants to be part of the internet revolution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister just said that the White Paper will talk about moving towards a more flexible regulatory framework and stepping back from sector-specific regulation when competition comes in. Given that he believes, as does his Secretary of State, that, as competition comes into industry, regulation should be rolled back, not just in telecoms but in gas and electricity, why is there no move towards a more flexible regulatory framework to step back from sector-specific regulations in gas and electricity, too? Why are those sectors so different from telecomes?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> One must take a snapshot of the industry at any one time. The Government consider that this is the appropriate degree of legislation now, but the flexibility exists--that is why I was adamant about resisting amendments over the past few weeks--because we must not tie the regulators down in their ability to stand back when appropriate and relinquish some of their regulatory powers, and the House must be able to debate that. I do not believe that any regulation, especially in areas that are evolving as quickly as these, should be carved in stone and set for ever. That degree of flexibility is vital.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman just said that he resisted Opposition amendments to bind the regulator and restrict his activity because he believes that the current framework in the Bill gives the flexibilty that he says will appear in the White Paper on communications, but that does not make sense. If the Bill already contains the flexibility that the telecommunications industry wants, why is he removing that sector form the Bill? It does not make sense.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking about a particular facet of the telecommunications industry. I was talking in general terms about the whole Bill.

<P>
It goes without saying that the Government approach these broader issues with an open mind, but they remain committed to the principles embodied in the telecoms provisions in the Bill. As I have said, we do not agree that the provisions are inappropriate for the telecoms industry. They are important reforms, which will remain relevant in any broader or extended framework that emerges from the White Paper.

<P>
Our intention is to carry forward these reforms in the legislation that will follow the White Paper, but there will have to be adjustments of detail, to align with the broader regulatory implications of the White Paper proposals. I therefore seek the Committee's agreement to our proposals to remove the telecommunications provisions from the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Everything that the Minister has said shows that the Government are in a mess, not just on telecoms and water but on the whole regulatory framework of the utility companies. There is confusion and muddle in the Government's intellectual understanding and approach.

<P>
If the Government want to move towards a more flexible regulatory regime for telecomes--the Minister and the Secretary of State have already said that they believe that the regulatory regime should be flexible for gas and electricity too--why are they removing the telecommunications sector from the Bill? If there are good reasons for doing so, why are there not also good reasons for removing gas and electricity from the Bill, to give those industries the type of flexible regulatory framework that will be delivered for the telecommunications industry and step back from sector-specific regulation when competition is fully implemented? It does not stack up intellectually, let alone in any other way.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> In the past couple of weeks, the hon. Gentleman has made some cogent arguments about the need to look at the different sectors in different ways. The privatised utilities have moved at dramatically different speeds. In terms of markets, access and choice there is much greater competition in telecommunications than in any other sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister is missing the point that the regulatory framework established by the Bill will last for some years--we hope, for 10 or more years. We cannot keep changing the regulatory regime. Therefore, it must anticipate future competition entering into those sectors. Everyone accepts that the telecommunications sector is far more open to competition than the gas and electricity sectors and that those three sectors are more open to competition than water. Clearly they are all at different stages. They were privatised at different times, and each has different monopoly elements. However, given that the regulatory regime will last for a number of years, it should anticipate a great deal of fierce competition entering those industries. It is wrong, therefore, to say that all four sectors should have different regulatory frameworks. They should all have the most flexible regime possible, so that it can be withdrawn as the industries become more competitive. It makes no sense that that flexibility should apply only to telecoms because they are the most competitive utility sector at the moment.

<P>
I agree with the Secretary of State's desire for consistent regulatory regimes across all four sectors. We could still achieve that, if the Government took out gas and electricity matters and applied the same flexible, non-interventionist, less burdensome regulatory approach that will undoubtedly arise when the White Paper on communications introduces new proposals for the regulation on telecommunications.

<P>
The Government have boasted about their consultation on the Utilities Bill. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:

<P>
Our first action was not to rush into legislating, but to consult widely on the structures that would fulfil the needs of consumers, be good for business and provide a stable framework for utility companies.
He went on to say:

<P>
We have consulted widely on the Bill's measures, which are seen by regulators, consumer groups, the regulated companies themselves and others as sensible, balanced and fair.--[Official Report, 31 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 788_795]
I find it remarkable that he can claim to have the support of the regulated companies themselves, when it is clear that the companies in two of the utility sectors were unhappy with the framework of the Bill.

<P>
We had a hint from the Minister last Tuesday that he had had a great many representations from the telecommunications industry on the matter, and that he wanted to look at them closely, but that it would be premature to say that he had made a firm decision. However, this is what the Secretary of State said during Question Time on Thursday:

<P>
We keep under review all measures that may increase the burden of regulation on business. As a result, we have been considering the views expressed by the telecoms operators in relation to the provisions in the Utilities Bill.
I thought that he had already been consulting and listening to the views of the utility companies. Surely those views that were expressed after the publication of the Bill had been put to him earlier? The Government are hearing but not listening, in the words of Simon and Garfunkel.

<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Which song was that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> ``The Sound of Silence''.

<P>
The Minister said that we arrived at the decision later than we should have done. That is absolutely right. The Government were hearing the representations of the telecommunications companies, but they took no notice of them until the pressure--especially the pressure from Downing Street--became so great that they had to withdraw the measures from the Bill. The Secretary of State might respond that the views of the operators group came forth only after they found out that the Government were to publish a White Paper on communications. He said on Thursday:

<P>
There is an important issue here. The Government received strong representations from the telecoms operators after announcing on 3 February that there would be a communications White Paper. That announcement came after the debate on Second Reading of the Bill.--[Official Report, 2 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 555_6.]
That is the excuse given. It contradicts slightly what the Minister said about there being two reasons for withdrawing the telecoms provisions from the Bill--the first being the White Paper; the second being the unsuitability for the telecommunications industry of the framework of the Bill. However, I shall leave that aside. The Secretary of State said that it would have been possible for the operators to make representations only after they had seen the announcement about the White Paper. That was three days after the debate on Second Reading.

<P>
However, the press release was issued by the DTI three days after that debate. Why did the Government, when consulting the telecoms operators, not discuss the implications of the forthcoming White Paper? Did they raise the subject in discussions, or merely sit mute, listening to the operators' concerns about measures in the Utilities Bill Green Paper and White Paper? Had they forgotten that the White Paper was coming up? It was, after all, heralded by the Government document ``Regulating Communications: the way ahead'', which was published in June 1999. The press release, which must have been in draft form at the DTI for several days before its publication on 3 February, makes it clear that the White Paper would

<P>
put forward proposals for reforming telecommunications and broadcasting regulation.
There we are. Surely the Secretary of State and the Minister would have been aware that that document contained the words ``telecommunications'' and ``regulation''.
