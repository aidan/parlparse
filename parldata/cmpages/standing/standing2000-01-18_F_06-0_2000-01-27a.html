<H2><center>Standing Committee F</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 27 January 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Sir David Madel in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/009/2000009.htm">Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill</a></center></H3><P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, the Committee may wish to note that the House authorities have not received Hansard for the afternoon sitting on Tuesday 25 January. If copies of Hansard are received during the sitting, they will be brought to this Room. Otherwise, we hope that Hansard will be available for this afternoon's sitting.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): On a point of order, Sir David. Could I ask the Minister when we can expect the tabling of amendments which will cover the structure of the rebates of the state second pension, as indicated in the explanatory notes on page 55, paragraph 218? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government hopes to bring forward legislation to implement the preferred way forward during the Bill's committee stage.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The consultation finished on 14 January. I acknowledge that it is only about 12 or 13 days since then, but I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us whether he is planning to introduce these regulations and when we can expect to see them on the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who telephoned my office this morning to alert me to the fact that she would raise that point. We intend to deal with the matter during Committee, and we hope to table the amendments early next week when we may reach the beginning of the part on the state second pension. They may be starred, but we have had the consultation and we have had a result—if I can put it that way. It is a question of obtaining clearance through the Government machine. Work is in hand, and we intend to deal with this matter in Committee rather than at a later stage of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Further to that point of order, Sir David. Could Minister possibly avoid starring the amendments? It would be helpful if we could receive little more notice, as this matter is complex. It is one of the keys as to how the system will work, and we would prefer not to have to deal with it right at the last moment. I should be extremely grateful if we could receive as much notice as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is my intention. We may start on the four relevant clauses and the schedule before we reach these amendments, as I assume that we will not deal with stakeholder pensions in one sitting. I am not aware of any discussions that have taken place through the usual channels, but we are moving as quickly as we possibly can to get the necessary inter-government procedures completed between ourselves and the Treasury and achieve clearance through the various sub-committees. I should like the amendments to be tabled by Tuesday of next week, so that they are cleared and available for selection on Thursday. It would be ideal if we reached the provisions on the state second pension by next Thursday.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>(SUBSTITUTED PART I OF SCHEDULE 1</center></H4>
TO THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991)
<P>
Amendment proposed [25 January]: No. 67, in page 71, line 32, at the end to insert the words—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The regulations shall in any event provide that the net weekly income of the non-resident parent shall be reduced in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) and by the method mentioned in sub-paragraph (5), but subject to the limit mentioned in sub-paragraph (6).
<P>
(4) The circumstances referred to in sub-paragraph (3) are where the parent with care has a gross annual income from all sources for the most recently completed financial year of more than £25,000.
<P>
(5) The method referred to in sub-paragraph (3) is that for every pound by which the gross annual income of the parent with care exceeds £25,000 the net weekly income of the non-resident parent shall be reduced by one penny.
<P>
(6) The limit referred to in sub-paragraph (3) is that the net weekly income of the non-resident parent shall not be reduced by more than 50 per cent.
<P>
(7) The regulations shall in any event provide that net weekly income shall include both earned and unearned income.'.—[
Mr. Pickles.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>. I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 116, in line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) the income of the parent with care is high'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I was moved to speak—although we do not have the benefit of a copy of Hansard for Tuesday afternoon's sitting—following the contribution made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). I felt that amendment No. 67 brought an issue into focus. I am sure that many hon. Members will have had similar cases brought to their attention in their surgeries and elsewhere. A particularly vindicitive separation may occur when a parent with care through a lottery win, a partnership with someone wealthy or the receipt of an inheritance, is able to bring up the child without the support of the non-resident parent, while the non-resident parent is struggling to meet his responsibilities and to pay his own contribution.
<P>
We all accept that we should base the Bill on the principle of the ability to pay. However, the legislation and the agency has been brought into disrepute when a settlement has seemed vindictive. A parent with care may have some wealth but is being supported by a contribution from the non-resident parent, who is finding it difficult to meet his financial obligations. The parent with care may be able to manage with a lesser contribution, but is insisting that the non-resident parent should struggle to meet those payments. The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) suggested, perhaps rightly, that such cases are very few in number. I do not know whether the statistics can be relied on, whether they come from the Child Support Agency or—
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> The hon. Gentleman must take it on trust that when the statistics I give to him are quoted, they are a best attempt. If there is a question of accuracy, I always let the Committee know.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I do not doubt the Under-Secretary's integrity, but some Committee members have not always found statistics from the CSA to be reliable. This is a fundamental point. Even if we assume that the statistics are accurate and there are very few such cases, the principle is still worth pursuing. I am not qualified to comment on whether the amendment is appropriately worded, but I agree that it is appropriate to consider the issue raised by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, because the CSA could in the future be brought into disrepute by a few such cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I have had my doubts about certain aspects of the Bill because I believe that the decision we made earlier to do without a maximum payment—a cap on the payments of the absent parent—will exacerbate the situation under certain circumstances, given the decision not to take into account the income of the parent with care and the decision to exclude consideration of earnings from investment income.
<P>
Many people will command a significant income, and will have enough financial sophistication to take what they would consider to be legitimate action to protect their income from being paid out in maintenance for the child. As a result of the assessment of their substantial income, they would estimate that they were paying more than enough to maintain the child. They would therefore engage their accountants and advisors to ensure that a significant a proportion of their income was payable in the form of investments— what we would call unearned income. That is the prerogative of wealthy people who are able to pay for such advice.
<P>
Poor people may be poor, but they are not stupid. We have all had people in our surgeries telling us about the ingenuity of their former spouse in concealing his income. I had a case recently of an absent former husband who had ensured that he enjoyed a substantial lifestyle with money from his own company, but had put the company, property and its assets in the hands of his mistress. He was her lodger, so the income was almost entirely secured against the partner with care receiving any of it.
<P>
I believe that this provision will have a further impact on the question of—I have lost have my train of thought momentarily.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman needs more sleep.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> As the Under-Secretary says, perhaps I need more sleep. The decision to do without any consideration of the income of the parent with care will have a knock-on effect. Despite the clear intention to portray any payment as a payment to the child for the maintenance of the child, there remains a pervasive perception that an element of the payment is for the maintenance of the former partner. The money is paid to the former partner. We must always bear in mind the fact that former partners often view each other with loathing and intense passion.
<P>
If the wife has an income, the roles may be reversed. I had an extraordinary case recently of a lady who had made considerable provision for her family, who now reside with her former husband. She was the single, absent partner and the husband was the parent the care. She had paid off various debts and had made arrangements for the mortgage. She complained that a substantial proportion of her residual income was now being paid to maintain the children, even though her former husband had a substantial income and was able to maintain them himself. The complaint was from the woman. In many ways, it was a legitimate complaint.
<P>
Clearly, the principle in the Bill, which is a good one, is that a parent must make a contribution towards the maintenance of the child. That is entirely proper, and we must protect that. However, is it enough to say that the contribution that parents with care make is entirely accounted for by having the children with them? The parent with care may benefit from a certain lifestyle. She provides the home and so on, but is that enough if she has a significant income? Undoubtedly, the parent with care benefits from having the children. Often the absent parent believes that he is denied proper access to the children.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): Will the hon. Gentleman explain why his arguments about the value of having children with the parent with care are applicable, apparently, only to rich people? Why does he not apply his arguments right across the board and say that we should revert to the status quo which is that we take into account the income of both parents?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The answer to that is simple. We were advised by Baroness Hollis, when she gave evidence to the Select Committee, that only a small proportion of parents with care had a substantial or significant income. The whole thrust of the argument is that the need to consider the income for the parent with care is fairly small, because most of them do not have significant incomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> The hon. Gentleman's answer makes my point. At least once in his speech he said that this is a point of principle. Why should we amend the legislation to take account of, say, just one case in each constituency? There is probably not even one in mine. If it is a genuine point of principle, the hon. Gentleman is surely arguing for means testing across the board, and that we should have a system that applies means testing as its principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Inevitably, there would be an element of means testing. The level of income of the parent with care would have to be considered. That is entirely appropriate as there is a principle involved. The higher the income of the parent with care and the lower the income of the absent parent who has to make contributions, the more the grievance will be felt. If the level of income of the parent with care is marginal or low, the grievance will not be particularly felt.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman had people in his surgeries with newly-established second families after a partnership has broken up complaining bitterly that they are means tested under the current system to pay for someone else's children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Means testing in some form or another is an inevitable consequence of any form of child support. Everyone's income will be assessed along with their ability to make payments for the maintenance of their children. Means testing is at the heart of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): May I put another point about the 200 rich people whom the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about? When I was in legal practice, I knew of some quite high-earning women, most of whom were still in settled relationships. To be able to make high-level earnings, they had to spend a phenomenal amount on child care, even when they were in a settled relationship. Some of them had to pay several hundred pounds a week for nannies and au pairs. Should that fact also be taken into account? If that factor were taken out of the figures, it would push the woman's level of earnings down even further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is odd that Labour Members argue that merely because one might be rich—as the hon. Gentleman described it—such legitimate concerns and grievances should be ignored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Is this not all about preventing the Government from looking ridiculous? It would be ridiculous if the parent with care were earning £100,000 or £200,000 and the non-resident parent were on a low income. It is all about preventing the Minister's successors in title waking up one morning to see The Sun, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail saying, ``Stop this madness. Are our Ministers mad?'' We are helping the Government by pointing out that the provision should work only when the parents with care have an income above that of non-resident parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely correct. Any grievance will be heightened if it is reported in the papers. The simple fact is that unfairness will begin to taint the whole system, and it will be used as an excuse for reducing the level of compliance.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Has the hon. Gentleman considered the cost to the agency of spending so much time examining the cases of a handful of people when it should be thinking about the majority of children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is an entirely legitimate concern. There has to be a balance between designing a simple and effective system that is not weighed down by these considerations and one that addresses legitimate grievances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Let me deal with the hon. Lady's point first. Baroness Hollis, dwelling on the hon. Lady's concerns, told the Select Committee in paragraph 35 on page xviii of the report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We do not think we should devise a system for that very tiny minority.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Addressing the concerns of Mr. Mostyn QC, she said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for him to suggest that we should have an elaborate assessment of the parent with care's income when, as I say, only 4 per cent. of parents with care have an income of over £100 a week and only 200... have an income of over £500 a week seems to me folly actually, administrative folly.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So I accept that there must be concern about the administrative costs of addressing the problem. However, one cannot have it both ways.
<P>
I am at odds with the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne), who wondered why we were worried only about the rich and not about the poor who were aggrieved about differential payments. Yet, as the noble Lady observed, it is a problem only for a small proportion of the sample, simply because of the levels of income involved. As I said, one cannot have it both ways and say that it is a tiny problem affecting only a few people and then assert that there will be an immense administrative cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Stewart rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> As I am among such distinguished competition, I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for being given preference. The arguments of Labour Members are surely wrong, because the amendment is about protecting poor people from being ground down by the system. It offers help to children where the parent with care has more than enough resources not to rely on the CSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. Gentleman read out a Baroness Hollis quote from the report which I was going to put to him. Perhaps I may develop the point.
<P>
We know that the CSA's caseload was in the order of 1 million cases. To find the 200 that we are talking about would mean interrogating all those 1 million women with care to discover which of them fell into that category. Of course, we do not know how many of the 200 women have extremely wealthy ex-partners—we are probably talking about a handful of cases out 1 million, which is like looking for a needle in a haystack. If that is not the height of folly, I do not know what is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I do not believe that it would be administratively difficult to establish a threshold and deal with those who come above it. We heard evidence regarding the arrangements in Australia, where they seem to have a simple, acceptable and workable system for dealing with these matters.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, I entirely understand the argument that the Government seem to be making. The principle of less eligibility has a certain attraction for me. There is a case for saying, ``Because you've found yourself having to rely on the Child Support Agency and these arrangements to secure maintenance for your children and because you've delivered yourself into that condition by what might be termed a life style choice,''—after all, people do not usually just wake up one morning and discover suddenly that they are divorced or that their relationship has broken down; there is at least a measure of contributory negligence in finding oneself in that position—``we will assist you, but it will be very rough justice. It will be this system, which is designed on the basis of simplicity and, let's face it, simplicity means the minimum effort in administrative terms by the state to deal with your problem. So because you deserve this treatment, it will be meted out to you.''
<P>
There is a certain attraction in that for someone with my point of view. It is, after all, a powerful imperative not to deliver oneself into those conditions. It reinforces the powerful message that if people allow their families and their arrangements to break down in that way, this is the level of treatment that they can expect. What I find so extraordinary is that the Government are adopting this view and are not prepared to allow a certain level of natural justice by amending the Bill in a small way. I accept that that would compromise its simplicity, but there has to be a balance between simplicity, and justice. The Government are tilting the balance towards simplicity but that means a rougher form of justice.
<P>
By tabling the amendment, Conservative Members are merely asking the Government to think carefully about an injustice that will undoubtedly be magnified in the reporting—there will be cases splashed over the tabloids of wealthy women being paid by men who are struggling even to afford to make arrangements to see the children to whom they have legitimate access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): Does my hon. Friend think that opposition to the amendment would be just as strong if, for example, the man had care? Men might be expected to have access to greater incomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is entirely possible. I know of one such case myself, but, in the main, I think that it will be the other way round.
<P>
The independent case examiner gave evidence to the Select Committee. Paragraph 31 on page xxvi of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Independent Case Examiner could see a positive advantage to ignoring the parent with care's circumstances.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The proposal to focus maintenance on the needs of the child rather than taking account of the needs and income of the parent with care will address the concerns of those non-resident parents who have said that they resent supporting the lifestyle of their former partner.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot for the life of me fathom the meaning of that. I hope that the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) will be able to assist me.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's remarks. He seems to be most concerned about cases getting into the papers. Imagine if the former partner of one of the Spice Girls, now with a great deal of money from his very wealthy ex-partner, went to the CSA about his situation; that might well get into the papers. But the sort of thing that the hon. Gentleman is talking about is ludicrous.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Lady disappoints me in two respects. First, she did not explain what I thought she was going to explain. Secondly, she invited me to imagine the Spice Girls—a highly desirable prospect—but then spoilt the image by bringing into the imagination their husbands or former husbands.
<P>
Perhaps I may persist with the case examiner's evidence. She saw a positive advantage in ignoring the parent with care's income on the ground that that would focus the mind of the absent parent on the thought that they were maintaining not their ex-wife but their children. I think that the opposite is the case. It stands ordinary logic on its head, but we are not dealing with ordinary logic: we are dealing with people who have developed a deep dislike or loathing for their former partners. It is important to address these issues, because they will have a knock-on effect on compliance.
<P>
There is a possibility that the problems may multiply. The Family Law Bar Association said that this measure would have an impact on the number of private cases seeking access to the CSA in order to get round arrangements that had been made in court. More important, it would lead to more people being reluctant properly to engage in negotiating the divorce settlement in the belief that they would be able to exploit the CSA's formula and simplicity at the expense of their former partner. There is the potential for a significant movement in case load from the private sector to the CSA simply as a result of these weaknesses in the formula. and it is proper to defuse that now. We therefore offer these amendments to the Government.
<P>
I caution the Government: although they may not think it important to consider what they believe to be the concerns of rich people, they are entirely misguided. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, these measures are designed to protect poor people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The Committee is facing a difficult conundrum. I do not think that all the arguments are necessarily on one side or the other. From the point of view of not taking into account the income of the parent with care, one can certainly adduce the urgent need for simplicity. I accept that in a case load of 1 million people, when only 6,000 cases might be relevant to such a proposal, we are placing a great burden on the CSA, but I can think of some ways to circumvent that difficulty. We would not have to have detailed evidence of the income of the parent with care.
<P>
I understand where the Government are coming from because they are trying to manage the CSA. That is their problem. The CSA is clearly not working; it spends too much time on assessment rather than enforcement. In all these debates, the Government are looking for ways to simplify the system. From their point of view as managers, I understand that. I suppose that if I were a manager, responsible for ensuring that the CSA worked better, I would approach the argument differently and say that the problem was far too complex.
<P>
However, I am not managing the CSA, but trying to adduce arguments that introduce an element of fairness and natural justice into the system. If we stop thinking in terms of managerial efficiency and open our mind to justice, it must be fair to take into account the income of both parents. It may be true that there are relatively few cases where that matters. The money that the non-resident parent pays is not supposed to go to the parent with care; it is supposed to be a contribution to the upkeep of the children. I understand all that. It is also true that simply considering the income of the parent with care may not adequately assess the costs that are placed on the parent. The parent with care may have to employ expensive child minders, while the non-resident parent does not have that problem.
<P>
I understand all that, so I do not think that there is a hard and fast case to make. The evidence leads us to the inescapable conclusion that there will be absurd cases—admittedly, relatively few—when the income of the parent with care is never taken into account. Such cases may be relatively few, but they would be so absurd and lacking in any sort of natural justice that they would call into disrepute the whole system.
<P>
We need not follow the argument that someone may win the lottery, become a Spice Girl, or any of the other things that we have talked about today. That is taking the argument to absurd lengths. In the modern world, many parents with care will have substantially greater incomes than non-resident parents. Although the Spice Girl case is very rare, if we have a hard and fast rule that we should never address the problem, we shall be building up possible resentment. There will be non resident parents who have a reasonable income, but because they know that the CSA never takes into account the income of the parent with care, their general view of the fairness of the system will be affected. If there were a mechanism by which the income of the parent with care could be taken into account, which may be triggered only in certain circumstances, that would increase confidence in the system. People would be confident that the system examined both parents' incomes.
<P>
How do we achieve that? My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) referred to some of the evidence that was given to the Select Committee. One hesitates to refer to the evidence of the Select Committee and that of Nicholas Mostyn because I know that there is a point of view that he represents a few rich clients. People say that he is a barrister who does not live in the real world. The CSA has about a million ordinary cases to deal with and then there is this chap. I know that that is going through the mind of the hon. Member for Hendon, whose point of view I understand.
<P>
Mr. Mostyn brings a wealth of experience. When I questioned him in the Select Committee, I made the points that I have been making in the past five minutes. I asked him how a system that took account of the income of the parent with care could work. When I asked him about the Australian system, his reply on page 84 of the report was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is terribly simple. They have a percentage system, although it is done on gross income rather than net income. It is done on the gross income that is reported to the Tax Office in Australia, but the father's gross income is reduced if the mother's income is above a certain level. That level is the average national wage. If the mother's income is above the average national wage, the father's income is reduced dollar for dollar by every dollar that her income exceeds the average national wage. It is simple really.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members will say that it does not sound very simple to them. We cannot deny that it is very similar to the system that we want to create. The Australians have, in difficult circumstances, succeeded in devising a system that takes into account the income of the parent with care.
<P>
If no one is prepared to lend credence to Nicholas Mostyn, the Institute for Fiscal Studies also dealt with the issue. In its evidence on page 164 of the Select Committee report, it stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The question of whether or not to take account of the earnings of the parent with care or a non-resident's partner is a difficult one. Not taking account of the income can lead to claims of unfairness, which may have negative implications for levels of compliance, whilst taking account of it introduces additional layers of complexity into the assessment process. One solution, which has been adopted in reforms to the Australian child support system, is to disregard earnings below a certain threshold, set high enough to reduce the majority of women earners''—
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a very important point that the Committee should consider—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for instance, average male earnings. This has the potential to improve perceptions of fairness, but does not compromise the simplicity of the scheme, as the need to undertake additional assessment arises only in a minority of cases.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Committee will feel that that evidence is set out clearly, logically and well. It is not just the view of an ivory tower think tank. The people involved are trying to understand the present system and what we are hoping to achieve. They are proposing an alternative. I hope, too, that the Government will not brush these arguments aside and say that it is only a device to help rich people, fathers and so on. It is not as simple as that. The issue is far more complex. First, even if one accepts that only 6,000 people are affected, surely as a matter of natural justice we should not devise a system that disregards them. If we believe in a parliamentary democracy, those 6,000 people are important. We know that 6,000 people will be put in an unfair position.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> May I correct the hon. Gentleman's figures? Six thousand people would not be affected. There are 580 people who currently have earnings of more than £350 a week; another 200 have earnings of more than £500 a week. My English maths makes that 780 people.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We will have to get further particulars on where the figure of 6,000 comes from. It was given repeatedly—

<B>Mr. Pickles rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall first give way to my hon. Friend and then to the Under Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The figures given by the Under-Secretary are interesting. At our previous sitting, the Minister of State said that we should not see these things in isolation and that other parts of the Bill interrelate. The Bill envisages quite an expansion in the purview of the CSA. It will go well beyond benefit cases and, to use the words of the White Paper, all agreements will be made within the shadow of the CSA.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is the point that I wanted to come to. I shall give way to the hon. Lady in a moment. We can go on arguing about the figures. I accept that as a Minister she has the figures, but my argument stands whether it is 6,000, 5,000 or 4,000. [Interruption.] The Under-Secretary disagrees but these figures have been given to the Select Committee. Whatever the figures state, some people are affected. My hon. Friend makes a powerful point.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall in a moment. Once the reform is in place the courts will inevitably shadow these agreements. These matters will be determined at all income levels in the courts and 15 per cent. will become the general rate if there is a break-up of a relationship. People will have to give over 15 per cent. of their income. That argument will be particularly powerful because no upper limit is set. We will no longer think that the CSA is just for people on average incomes and that the courts deal only with people on higher incomes, which is what happens at present. No maximum level is set, so when a relationship breaks up people will want their 15 per cent. cut of their former partner's income.
<P>
Indeed, only last week I was talking to somebody about this. She told me about her appalling predicament and how difficult her former partner was being. He had an extremely high income but was not paying her a fair share. I told her that under the new system she could go to the CSA and whatever his income—she was claiming that he was earning up to £500,000 a year—in theory she would be allowed to claim 15 per cent. She obviously brightened up at that. I am not surprised. It is difficult to argue that all that money will be needed for the child, but that presumably will be the system. Whatever is the case at present, the CSA will set the rate. A large number of cases will come within the ambit of the CSA. The hon. Lady has been very patient and I now give way to her.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The figure of 6,000 that the hon. Gentleman quoted is those who have earnings of more than £200 a week. That is below the figure of £350 in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) has just passed me the same information, which I was about to share with the Committee. The figure of 6,000 may not relate specifically to the amendment but it does not affect our arguments. They are perfectly valid. I am sure that the Government majority will ensure that the amendment is rejected, but if they say that it is wrong because it sets too high a figure and that too few people will be affected they can always come forward with an amendment of their own. That does not affect the general principle and the point we are trying to make.
<P>
There are 6,000 people with incomes of £200 a week That is not a huge income but one that could be taken in account. Whatever argument one adduces on one side or another, one must accept that the arguments are not clear-cut. A minority of parents with care have an income that could be taken into account. The CSA will set the rate in future and if we completely ignore the income of the parent with care we are potentially building up enormous problems for ourselves. I accept that the Government want to reduce complexity, but they must also have some regard for fairness. I hope that they will not sweep these arguments aside and will at least deal with them sensitively and constructively.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall not take long as we have looked at this in great detail, but I have one or two new points to make. Many Members of Parliament have lived with the CSA for a long time. We have already agreed that we do not wish to come back to another Standing Committee to re-amend the legislation. We want to create a system that will last for 10 or 15 years or even longer. We want to avoid these hours and hours of agony looking at all the issues surrounding the painful problem of couples splitting.
<P>
We have concentrated on the woman who has access to a higher income, preferably her own. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have used examples from their own experience. I am always struck by how much that experience differs. Some hon. Members represent poor constituencies, others represent wealthy constituencies. I am lucky to have represented constituencies—I use the term advisedly—where there is a mix. In Hastings and Rye and in Beckenham I have had cases involving very poor people and others where one partner is much wealthier than the other.
<P>
As I said, we want to talk about the future. More and more women are earning larger and larger sums of money. Indeed, in some cases—I suspect that a trend is emerging—the man could be looking after the children and not the woman. There are valid arguments that a father can look after children just as well as a mother. If we flip the argument over and stop talking about wealthier women and poorer fathers and start talking about the richer women who do not have care, we will see more and more cases like that in the future. How would we react if we approached it from that angle? That is why we should look laterally at future trends in society as well as at what happens at the moment.
<P>
I accept that the CSA has few such cases to deal with. In an earlier exchange we agreed that practically everyone with an income of more than £200,000 will use the courts rather than the CSA. That argues for considering the bracket between those who pay 40 per cent. tax and those who go to court. Within that bracket, it can be argued that the resentment that builds up between partners of both sexes over wealth and over who has the children becomes a factor in any split-up.
<P>
I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said about managerial problems. Yes, it is difficult and complicated. The Under-Secretary described the computers that the CSA has to use and it is to be hoped that in time the agency will have better computers to handle its work. Managerially, it is impossible to deal with those problems. We must ensure that we can predict future trends and provide for them in legislation, so as to avoid resentment being added to the emotions of the circumstances—something that we as legislators do not have to deal with.
<P>
That brings me to the point about the pattern of paying that the Under-Secretary and I agree should be put in place, especially with self-employed men who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, are now in a position to put their earnings into a company and take them as a dividend. That practice exists and can be used, but current legislation does not take account of it. All members of the Committee will be pleased to hear the Minister's assurance about that.
<P>
Men go through those hoops for the precise purpose of avoiding paying maintenance. If we have to bring in investment income, as I prefer to call it rather than unearned income, although the latter is Treasury-speak—in a previous sitting, we debated the use of the word ``men'' when the term ``women'' would be more appropriate—we would then get at the 40,000 people who do not want to pay although, as we all know, they have an income. We would get them into the habit of paying by building in financial incentives. Our amendment would be a way of helping to build in incentives by getting these people into the habit of paying maintenance for their children. I support the purpose behind our amendment and I hope that Ministers will respond positively.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendment No. 67 would change the way in which the maintenance liability of a non-resident parent is calculated in cases where the parent with care has a gross annual earned and unearned income available to her from all sources in excess of £25,000.
<P>
Let me put before the Committee a little of our experience of trying to run the CSA with the current system, which does take into account the income of both sides of the broken marriage or partnership.
<P>
The complexity of the rules for determining that income and what is available to parents with care, and to non-resident parents, is a major reason for the failure of the current system. One principle underlying the changes in the Bill—I keep having to say this and I suspected that the pressure about this would come during the Committee stage—is a move to a simpler system so that we can change the current ratio of assessment to enforcement activity that the CSA is required to undertake. We know that 90 per cent. of the agency's time is spent assessing and only 10 per cent. of its time is spent enforcing. That has led to the difficulties with which all of us are grappling. I ask members of the Committee to bear that in mind when they consider amendments.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would quickly take us back to where we are today. Its purpose is to make the maintenance calculation reflect the income available to the parent with care where the income is substantial. Most of these figure have been mentioned in the debate but I will repeat them and ask hon. Members to keep them in mind.
<P>
What struck me when I read the figures was how poor most parents with care, whether men or women, are. Only 4 per cent. Of them have earnings of more than £100 a week. We must remember that they are the ones with the children.
<P>
What is also at the centre of our deliberations today is the welfare of the children. That includes the amount of money available to help those children to be raised in an appropriate and decent way. As I said, 4 per cent. of those parents earn more than £100 a week. There are 677,000 on benefit, with no earned income at all. There are 84,000 with less than £100 a week. Six thousand people—the figure that the hon. Member for Gainsborough bandied about–have earnings of more than £200 a week, while 580 have earnings of more than £350 a week—the relevant figures in terms of the amendment—and only 200 have earnings of more than £500 a week.
<P>
The amendment would make it a requirement that the net weekly income on which child support liability is based be reduced by lp for each pound by which the annual gross income available to a parent with care exceeds £25,000, subject to a limit which would prevent the non-resident parent's income from being reduced by more than £50. That is the Australian system. In appropriate cases, this would lead to consequential reductions in the amount of maintenance payable, thereby reducing the amount going to benefit the child.
<P>
One of the first things that one notices about the amendment is that it would provide for different rules to be applied in determining the income of parents with care which we shall discuss on amendment No. 110. At present, the figure is net available income, but under the terms of the amendment, we would have to consider gross income and other income from all sources. In a literal interpretation of the wording, that would include the income from a new partner, as well as child benefit, housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<P>
The key point about the amendment is that that process would involve three or four means tests per case. Should we take account of the income of the new partner of the parent with care? Is the new partner means-tested as well? Is the non-resident parent's partner also means-tested? Will there be three or four new means tests for the 800 people who will fall into this category? By my calculations, that would mean 3.6 million means tests if there are three, and 4.8 million if there are four. That is what the amendments ask the CSA, which we take great delight in complaining about, to do. But if we want the CSA to improve, as it has done substantially in the past two years—[Interruption.] It has: I can give figures, but not now. I was saying that if we want it to run the system properly, we must not burden it with extra means testing for very few people.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If the poet Coleridge will forgive me, we are in danger of having figures, figures everywhere and not a pause to think. Surely these figures depend on the way in which net income is defined. Later in the Bill we shall look at net income. If the hon. Lady will accept the amendment, I undertake to table amendments to ensure that none of the problems she envisages will occur.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> If we have to take account of the incomes of parents with care—and, presumably, all the extra partners who are also included in the equation— we must have a means test. It is as simple that. We cannot apply the test only to those people whom we think should be tested. We will have to apply it to everybody—the entire case load—which means millions of extra means tests to catch only a few hundred people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I understand the hon. Lady's point, but would it not be possible to consider a system whereby the means tests were normally carried out only on the application of the non-resident parent—[Interruption.] There is no point in Labour Members laughing. I am trying to come up with a solution. Non-resident parents would presumably apply if they were convinced that the parent with care had a substantial income. Surely there must be a safety net—a mechanism to deal with injustices—that would allow a way out of the system that the Minister is introducing. There must be a way out of this conundrum.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The Bill contains provisions for variations in particular or unusual circumstances. I can envisage that that might be one way to deal with the problem. The hon. Member for Gainsborough must remember that the principle behind the simplification is that we want to take into account only the net income of the non-resident parent. Because it would bring us back to the present system, I shall take no account—I shall not concede the point—of anyone else's income. We have decided to focus on the net income of the non-resident parent and the number of children, and work out a percentage from that. That is the very essence of the system, and we are now being asked to dilute it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We shall read Hansard most carefully, but did the hon. Lady just announce a concession? She is shaking her head, but she should wait to hear the question. Perhaps the idea of making a concession frightens her. Did she say that we should not worry, that we can have variations and that variations might take care of the problem? Is she now announcing to the Committee that if the income of the parent with care is sufficiently high, it could be taken into consideration?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> No. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. I am pleased that he should get so excited at nuances in my speech, but before I gave way to him—perhaps he was too excited to hear me—I said that we do not intend to change the principle that underlies our reform, which would take the net income of the non-resident parent, the number of children and apply a percentage. Introducing a different rule for parents with care, especially having regard to the new partner's income, cannot be reasonable or fair. If we are to take into account the income of the new partner of a parent with care, should we take the same approach with a non-resident parent? If not, why not?
<P>
The amendments would introduce a huge increase in means testing. That would result in a huge extra administrative burden for the CSA for only a few cases. Amendment No. 116 seeks to take account of the income of the parent with care by allowing an application to be made for variation of the amount of maintenance payable if the income of the parent with care is high. That income should not be taken into account for three reasons. First, parents with care already contribute directly to the care and support of their children, and it is wrong that their own income or the income of a new partner, however much it may be, should reduce the support provided by the non-resident parent to his or her child.
<P>
Secondly, we are replacing the current complex child support scheme with a radically simpler system of rates that will be easier for parents to understand. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar must not wish the old system back, because it will still have the persistent problems that we are attempting to tackle. One of the key simplifications is that no account will be taken of the income of the parent with care. With that in mind, we have set the new rate at a level that produces a fair result based solely on the non-resident parent's income. Complex rules for determining income will lead to a delay in the information-gathering process and undermine the transparency of the scheme. For that reason, we intend to provide simplified rules to determine income, which we shall talk about in later debates.
<P>
The administrative implications are not secondary thoughts. They need to be considered and the hon. Member for Gainsborough, to his credit, raised them. Amendment No. 67 would require the agency to obtain personal and financial details of parents with care and, it would appear, their partners in all cases. That would include those on income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance, whose total gross income could be in excess of £25,000 due to the need to take into account income from all sources including child benefit and housing benefit. It is not for those who administer the system to second guess what that figure will be before means testing, so there must be testing for everyone.
<P>
IT set-up costs alone would be between £5 million and £10 million, yet under current rules for determining income only 780 parents with care have net earnings of more than £350 a week. The complexity of the current rules for determining income available to parents with care and non-resident parents is one of the major reasons for the failure of the current system. If we do not tackle that, our reform will not succeed.
<P>
Building additional information-gathering requirements into the assessment stage, or increasing the number of cases in which maintenance levels may be varied, is bound to lead to delays and undermine one of our key aims—that maintenance should be decided in days rather than the months that it takes at present. We must keep the scheme simple if it is to work. For those reasons, I must ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister discuss investment income at all?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> With your permission, Sir David, I would rather discuss that issue on amendment No. 110.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> A simple yes or no, a smile or a suggestion that we may have a point would have done. We are trying to ensure a fairer assessment. I am disappointed that the Minister has not tackled that issue, as I do not believe that it should be left in the air. It would have helped if she had hinted whether the Bill was intended to include investment income or not, but I suppose that we shall have to be patient.
<P>
The Government's response disappoints me. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Ah.''] I know that that grieves many Government Members, but it takes quite a bit to disappoint me. I am disappointed by her saying, ``It's all a bit complex. It will cause the system problems.'' If we argued the same way, we would say that our hospitals would run better if they did not have to take care of sick people, and that our schools would be better if they did not have children to educate. We should devise a system to meet the needs of the people, rather than expecting the people to meet the needs of the system. We have suddenly discovered what the third way is. It is the party of bureaucracy and better administration. I do not find that convincing.
<P>
The Minister spent ages juggling the figures and saying, ``Let me show you this: there are only six people in Argyll, three people in Brentwood and Ongar and a woman with a lisp somewhere in Kent; believe me, it's not a problem.'' We have been told not to consider the situation as being solid, as the reform is fundamental. One of the reforms is that the CSA's net will be widened so that the shadow of its building will fall across the English and Welsh legal system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> God forbid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is the intention. All the numbers of people that have been carefully added up by the officials and handed to the Minister do not mean a jot. The situation will be the same. Anyone would have thought that we were not doing the Government a favour. It will be no use coming to me or my hon. Friends, waving a copy of The Sun or the Daily Mail with headlines saying ``Stop this nonsense''. The provision will bring the entire system into disrepute. It will ensure that the CSA's last sip at the last chance saloon is doomed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> What would Mr. Alastair Campbell say about all this?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Mr. Alastair Campbell will be looking for someone to blame. The Committee list is available, and he will know where to look for people who let this attack on middle England go through.
<P>
When I moved the amendment on Tuesday, the hon. Member for Colne Valley intervened to ask whether the figures should be gross and net, as in the Australian system. To tell the truth, I was more worried about ensuring that I finished on time, and did not give her question the consideration that it deserved. I should have pointed out to her that they cover gross and net figures, and I apologise for not having said so at the time.
<P>
We are reasonable. We concede that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the income of the parent with care should not be taken into consideration. We are discussing only those cases in which the income of the parent with care is considerably higher than that of the non-resident parent. The Bill is all about social justice and ensuring that the state is not used to grind down a poor person when the maintenance of the child is well and truly taken care of. It is not about ensuring that people who break up relationships are punished. The law is entirely neutral on that matter. The Bill is about maintenance for children.
<P>
I want to make progress, because only two or three large issues are involved, so I shall bring my remarks to a close.

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We now move to another important topic, on which I hope we shall spend some time. We have tabled various amendments to the clause. Most people are conscious of what has emerged in this area. I confess that I had not looked at ``Voucher's'' before our proceedings started, but now that we are becoming familiar with the Labour members of the Committee, we know that we have some lawyers among us who formerly specialised in this field. I hope that we will hear from them, because if there was ever a need for lawyers to be listened to—and listened to attentively—it is on this aspect of the legislation.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State referred to the lawyers and the Liberal Democrats. I shall not quote the Official Report, but many members of the Committee heard him, and will correct me if I am wrong. He said that he had rarely met a judge who had any understanding of the benefits system and that the courts did not readily lend themselves to a determination of the right level of maintenance.
<P>
We have tabled a series of amendments that offer a wide choice of alternatives. Most of the amendments, with the exception of perhaps one, would allow the Child Support Agency to deal with parents with care who are in receipt of benefits. That would allow the courts—this theme runs through the amendments, most of which I shall discuss in due course—to deal with more complex cases where the balance of assets could be put in a better mix. Why should that happen? For one overriding reason: it is in the interests of the child.
<P>
There are many reasons why we wish to consider something as complicated as this provision. It might be used with regard to, say, school fees. The non-resident parent might be paying school fees which, as we see from the limited list, the Government think legitimate. It might be used in regard to such things as mortgage payments or how pensions are divided—or there may be a significant capital turnover in the settlement. We need to take that into account. The court currently has the power to do that, and it is interesting that that was envisaged in the White Paper.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Two o'clock.
