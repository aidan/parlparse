<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we come to amendment 
No. 34, I should inform the Committee that the hon. 
Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) may wish to move 
formally amendment No. 36, which was discussed in a 
group of amendments at our previous sitting. I shall call 
the hon. Member at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I beg to move 
amendment No. 34, in page 3, line 28, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and for requiring employers to take reasonable precautions so that 
the fact that an employee is in receipt of tax credit is not disclosed 
to any other employee except those directly responsible for the 
administration of the payroll.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
amendment No. 37 in page 3, line 38, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2C) An employer who is responsible for the tax credit received 
by an employee shall take reasonable precautions so that the fact an 
employee is in receipt of tax credit is not disclosed to any other 
employee except those directly responsible for the administration of 
the payroll.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Good morning, Mrs. Roe. I hope that you 
enjoy this sitting of the Committee.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to explore 
confidentiality issues. Opposition Members are worried 
that the details of people's private affairs could get into 
the public domain of a company. Employers do their best 
to ensure that payroll details remain as private as possible, 
but the information required in payroll departments is 
highly intrusive.
<P>
I thank the Minister for sending us the draft application 
form, which I read with interest last night. If I were the 
sort of person who checked texts, I would suggest that 
one or two matters required examination. Having read the 
form and the information required for the Inland Revenue 
to calculate working families tax credit and child care tax 
allowances, it is clear that if people wanted to pry into 
other people's affairs they could do so merely by knowing 
the information that is required to complete the payroll. It 
is easy for people to surmise and gossip and they do not 
depend on firm information. Any change in the rate at 
which the tax credit is paid could be an immediate cause 
for surmise. We all know how Chinese whispers work, 
"Have you seen that so and so is receiving so much more 
or so much less? I wonder why that is."	 In no time at 
all, mountains of speculation have arisen about people's 
personal circumstances, which they may wish to remain 
confidential.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): There may be a problem 
for people who are paid in cash instead of through a pay 
slip. Perhaps the hon. Lady will invite the Minister to 
comment on the fact that some people are still paid in 
cash and that it may be apparent, when the pay packet 
contains a larger wad of cash, that the tax credit is in it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right and I suspect 
from the tenor of his comments that he, like me, would 
prefer people not to be paid in cash for security reasons 
and because the temptation of going to the pub that 
takes us back to our previous debate is much stronger if 
payment is in cash. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us 
on that.
<P>
Payment in cash may increase the possibility of people 
knowing whether a pay packet is thicker or thinner than 
the previous week they would need to be eagle eyed. It 
piles on questions about the confidentiality aspect of the 
information that employers are required to hold, which 
increases the opportunities for employees to speculate on 
people's personal circumstances.
<P>
The problem ranges across companies, irrespective of 
size. The fairly large company that I spoke to employed 
thousands of people, but it had not fully taken on board 
the effects of the Bill. A great deal needs to be done to 
ensure that the business sector is aware of the Bill's 
implications. In our discussion, representatives of the 
company immediately saw the problems, in particular that 
of confidentiality. Its payroll section, which was not 
subcontracted, employed a large percentage of women.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis </B>(Bury, South): Will the hon. Lady 
comment on the fact that it should be taken as read that 
any company with a payroll section or any other 
mechanism for calculating salaries, allowances and so on 
should keep those details confidential? Any changes that 
are made to people's salaries and take-home pay be they 
to tax codes or marriage allowance could give rise to 
speculation if people who operate those systems in 
companies do not behave professionally. I assume that 
most companies that operate payroll and personnel 
systems maintain confidentiality.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The hon. Gentleman is agreeing with me. I 
hope that companies maintain confidentiality, but there is 
no guarantee that people's circumstances will not get into 
the public domain. The volume of information and its 
effect on take-home pay will be so apparent, that it will 
be easy for an inadvertent word to make a person's 
circumstances more widely known than that person may 
want. Our point is that the sheer volume of information 
that is required might expose people to gossip about their 
circumstances. None of us would want that. The 
amendments would ensure that that possibility is 
minimised. We must recognise that it is impossible to 
make anything totally secure. Surely we can agree on that. 
After all, newspapers would not carry the stories that they 
do if information about people was completely secure. 
The situation is the same in companies.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. 
Lewis) will agree that there are problems. They have 
caused us to be worried about confidentiality. The calibre 
and professionalism of most members of most payroll 
sections is beyond reproach. But there are inadvertent 
words and rogue elements. Someone knows someone who 
knows someone and the penny drops that is why so and 
so has moved next door to so and so. We know how that 
happens. We can trace its path. We are trying to minimise 
and to warn against the Bill's potential for confidentiality 
to be broken.
<P>
The well-run company that I spoke to was aware of the 
problems of confidentiality. We are not just talking about 
small businesses. The problem goes across the spectrum 
where there is potential for gossip about people's affairs 
in a way that many people may not want.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to make the Committee 
aware of the problems that could arise from the Bill and 
the likely impact on company payrolls and payroll 
departments. If employees are going through a difficult 
time, such as splitting with their husband or wife or facing 
other changes in family circumstances, the last thing that 
they need is further pressure on them because of gossip 
about circumstances that they may not wish people to 
know about. The Bill may therefore create further 
problems the gossip may get everything out of 
proportion. How does the Minister think that that can be 
avoided?
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I am not 
sure that the usual channels have the timing of the Bill 
right. It is possible that we will finish today; however, our 
initial instincts are that we shall take longer. I see the 
Whip disagreeing and looking a little grumpy, but let me 
explain, as I am sure that he will agree with me in a 
moment.
<P>
The more that we have gone into the Bill and begun 
to deal with important aspects, the more we have moved 
towards consensus. I regard the intervention of the hon. 
Member for Bury, South in the speech of my hon. Friend 
the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) as extremely 
useful, because clearly hon. Members on both sides of the 
Committee are saying the same thing: we understand
the need for confidentiality. The hon. Gentleman's 
intervention went some way towards the point that I was 
about to make.
<P>
It is clear that, under the Bill, firms will for the first 
time be used to administer a benefit to their employees. 
Therefore, on top of their traditional duty to ensure 
confidentiality through the payroll system, there will be a 
little bit extra: it will be confidentiality plus. We know 
this because firms will use a different method of 
assessment for family credits. Previously, only one 
intervention was necessary to certify that a person 
worked there and that his or her salary was right. A 
reassessment will now take place every six months that 
will involve the firm in paying out benefit.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham touched 
on another point the question of esteem in the eyes of 
fellow employees. We know, because of the Social 
Security Committee's excellent report on fraud, of the 
problems with family credit. We also know, because of 
the work of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. 
Field), that working families tax credit will provide even 
more opportunity for fraud. Therefore, those on working 
families tax credit will be particularly prone to 
accusations that they are fiddling the system or getting 
more than they are entitled to.
<P>
From the briefest look at the form and I thank the 
Financial Secretary for ensuring that we received it it is 
clear that anyone who wants to commit a fraud will find 
it easy, because the form is riddled with opportunities for 
fraud. Those who fill it in will command the benefit. 
Given the way in which the system will be checked, it 
will be riddled with fraud. The working families tax credit 
will therefore be a particularly discredited form of benefit. 
Firms will have to take that into account, because it will 
cause major disruption in the workplace.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury, South is right to point to 
an existing tradition of protecting people's confidentiality 
through the pay-as-you-earn system. However, the 
amendment would apply an extra test and puts in 
reasonable terms the steps that should be taken. Currently, 
the level of protection offered by the PAYE system is 
inadequate. For the most part, employers will be resentful 
of the extra burden that the Bill will impose. We must 
make it clear to employers that we are aware of the 
difficulties that the extra burden will create and that we 
understand the resentment they will feel at being asked to 
do the Government's job by handing out benefits. 
However, they should also understand that the system 
must work, and that employee confidentiality is central to 
it. Employers, who will be involved in the private 
financial affairs of their employees to an unprecedented 
extent, have a duty to ensure the protection of employee 
confidentiality.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman comment on 
the implications of his rhetoric, which suggest that 
employers need to be told, through a Bill, to maintain the 
confidentiality of their employees' financial affairs. What 
does that say about the current state of the Opposition's 
relationship with the business community?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is trying 
to bale out from his earlier position which, I recall, 
prompted an expression of sheer disgust on the face of his 
Whip. If launching such an attack against me was 
intended to tackle that problem, I am prepared to respond 
in kind by saying that his comments were outrageously 
partisan.
<P>
Politics is not about protecting a rainbow coalition. It 
is not a matter of saying that the Conservative party is the 
party of business and bosses must always get their way, 
or that the Labour party is the party of the workers. This 
issue is not about class, but about standing for the whole 
community. We need to ensure the protection of the 
privacy of the individual. It is not merely a matter of 
human rights and dignity, but of ensuring that a 
company's work force contributes to its smooth running. 
Gossip and resentment must be minimised and people 
should not be made scapegoats.
<P>
The working families tax credit will prove divisive and 
will create a stigma and all manner of problems in the 
work force. The amendment seeks to ensure that all 
reasonable steps are taken to protect employee's privacy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury, South should not have tried 
to bale himself out. He should be proud of the stand that 
he took this morning, albeit briefly, on behalf of the 
individual. The Whip, who is a reasonable man, will 
forget the incident. Within two, three or four years it will 
be written out of the file.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): 
Good morning, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
The amendment would require employers to take 
reasonable precautions to ensure that only those who deal 
directly with the payroll are aware of which employees 
are in receipt of the working families tax credit, or the 
disabled person's tax credit. Instead of the normal 
practices of business with regard to the confidentiality of 
an employee's salary which the hon. Member for Bury, 
South pointed out the Bill should insist on 
confidentiality. That is because the credit is a statutory 
benefit, which is paid through the payroll. The same 
statutory protections should therefore be applied by the 
employer as would be applied by the Department of 
Social Security.
<P>
The Committee has discussed at great length the 
question of whether paying WFTC through the payroll 
will increase or decrease the stigma attached. Opposition 
Members believe that that poses the significant risk that 
claiming benefits will become known to work colleagues. 
Although such risk is not confined to small companies 
as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said it 
will be increased in small firms using manually produced 
pay slips. As the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) 
said, many people are still paid in cash in a weekly pay 
packet, and such people will undoubtedly have 
hand-written pay slips accompanying the cash 
payments many people who are paid directly by bank 
giro credit will also have hand-written pay slips. 
Therefore, one or two people in the payroll department 
or even the company's financial controller may know all 
the financial details of employees.
<P>
Employees of big firms talk about their salaries, even 
though they are not supposed to, and it causes all sorts of 
difficulties. The same thing happens in small companies. 
Human nature dictates that people will gossip about other 
employees' benefit claims when they realise that they are 
paid through the payroll. What is problematic about 
inserting a reasonably worded amendment requiring 
employers to take reasonable precautions? We are not 
suggesting that employers should ensure that not a single 
scintilla of detail leaks out, on pain of imprisonment.
<P>
It is not only employers' organisations that are worried 
about this matter. Organisations such as the National 
Council for One Parent Families are also worried. It 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Some lone parents may worry that their personal finances are 
becoming more visible to colleagues and employers causing a 
disincentive to take up benefits."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That proves our point if employees are paid the benefit 
through the payroll, the fact of that payment may leak out 
to fellow employees, which will not only increase the 
stigma attached to the benefit but provide a disincentive 
to taking it up.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon pointed out that the 
take-up rate of family credit among lone parents is 91 per 
cent. Therefore, if fundamental changes to that benefit are 
made in the form of WFTC, the take-up rate can only go 
down. Given the risk of leaking of information to fellow 
employees, which will bring an added stigma, the take-up 
rate is bound to fall. We want to mitigate the damage 
that the Bill will do: we want to improve the Bill for 
the Government.
<P>
The Federation of Small Businesses has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The proposal will force employers to become involved in their 
workers' personal situations, imposing on workers' privacy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Organisations representing lone parents and 
organisations representing small businesses believe that 
confidentiality is essential to making the Bill work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend referred to the National 
Council for One Parent Families. Does he recall reading 
its clear statement that employers who deal with this 
matter may need guidance on sensitivity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Later, we will 
discuss an amendment relating to the code of conduct for 
employers. All organisations that had read and thought 
about the Bill realise that the lack of confidentiality is the 
big flaw in the decision to pay WFTC through the payroll. 
If the Government were to adopt the amendment, they 
would go a long way towards mitigating the damage that 
the Bill will cause and making it less flawed.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> Good morning, Mrs. Roe. It is a pleasure to have you with us again this morning. The 
contribution of the hon. Member for Brentwood and 
Ongar (Mr. Pickles) ranged rather wide. I was also 
tempted to do so, but I will resist that temptation and 
return to the amendment proposed by the hon. Member 
for Beckenham.
<P>
I understand the context of the hon. Lady's amendment. 
Hon. Members are right to be concerned that employees' 
private financial affairs should be treated as confidential. 
However, it is unclear whether such a provision would 
ensure that. I hope to reassure hon. Members about the 
current position.
<P>
Employers are already under a common law duty to 
maintain the trust and confidence of employees. That is, 
potentially, a wide duty, and the Data Protection Act 1998 
will extend the protection of personal information. That is 
why the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>
Itemised pay statements are already prepared by other 
employees and, in practice, treated as confidential 
between employer and employee my hon. Friend the 
Member for Bury, South mentioned that that procedure 
already exists but that has never been regarded as a 
matter that required statutory provisions relating to 
confidentiality. Tax credits will be shown on payslips and 
will, therefore, be treated with the same confidentiality as 
pay. There is no logical reason why employers should be 
any less discreet about tax credit details than pay details.
<P>
A further point that must be taken into account in 
considering the amendment is that it is unclear what 
"reasonable precautions"	 means. How is that to be 
determined? are employers required to put in place special 
arrangements? If so, that could involve additional burdens 
for business burdens that we would not want to impose.
<P>
It is also unclear how the Inland Revenue could police 
employers' behaviour in this area. Even if the Revenue 
could control employers' administration systems, as the 
amendments would require, what would be the sanction 
against the employer? What would be the right of appeal 
against the sanction? If adopted, the amendments would 
give rise to a whole new regime of employer compliance, 
which I am sure was not the intention of the hon. Member 
for Beckenham in tabling the amendment. As I have 
already said, I understand the concerns that the hon. 
Lady expressed 
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I sense that the Minister is just about to 
draw her remarks to a close. Before she does, will she deal 
with a point that was raised by several hon. Members? As 
far as she is aware perhaps she has received a briefing 
on this will the Bill have any privacy implications for 
people who are paid in cash, and how prevalent is such 
payment in this section of the labour market?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> All the existing privacy law that governs 
the relationship between employer and employee will also 
relate to those who are paid in cash. I cannot tell the 
Committee how many people that is, but we estimate that 
it is very few. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that 
the same considerations will apply.



<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have some sympathy with what the 
Minister is saying, but we are worried about 
confidentiality. The Government should reflect on the 
issue, and take their provisions further. Our concern is 
that people will be stigmatised at work, and we do not 
want that to happen. We should find ways of making it 
abundantly clear that records must be kept confidential. It 
is not adequate to say, "I am sorry. The proposal is very 
difficult and will cause all kinds of problems. How will it 
be policed and enforces?"	 That problem runs through the 
Bill most of its provisions will be difficult to police 
and enforce.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
his intervention, which gives me the opportunity to correct 
what may be a misapprehension.
<P>
The amendment is fatally flawed and would involve the 
complications that I outlined. However, provisions 
emphasising confidentiality and protection are already in 
place, and they apply to details about an employee's 
financial position, including, for example, his rent and 
pay.
<P>
I shall end as I began by saying that I understand why 
the hon. Member for Beckenham phrased the amendment
as she did. It was important that she did so she gave me 
an opportunity to set out the Government's position on 
the matter. Our proceedings are quite rightly followed 
closely by people with an interest in the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Does my hon. Friend accept 
that a balance is involved? The Government are 
responsible for ensuring that the Bill adequately deals 
with confidentiality, which is an important and serious 
matter, but the relationship between an employer and an 
employee involves a balance. In my experience I spent 
20 years in industry as a trade union officer most 
disciplinary procedures adequately deal with 
confidentiality by treating it as a breach of contract, which 
is a serious disciplinary matter. The Opposition's valid 
concerns will be dealt with at least in some respects 
by the rules that already exist in industry.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that 
intervention. He speaks with much experience of industry.
<P>
In the overwhelming majority of cases, questions of 
confidentiality are handled properly and sensitively by 
employers, the great majority of whom have a proper 
system in place. However, when there is a difficulty, 
existing provisions, which may derive from legislation or 
from common law, already provide protection.
<P>
As I said earlier, I understand why the hon. Member 
for Beckenham raised the matter, and I am grateful to her 
for doing so. I hope that I have persuaded her that the 
amendment is not necessary. However, if she feels that 
she cannot withdraw it I advise my hon. Friends to vote 
against it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for her 
reasonable explanation, which all Opposition Members 
appreciate. However, I have to confess that I still have 
some concerns. I understand the role of common law and 
the point that was made by the hon. Member for Eccles 
(Mr. Stewart) but, if I may be so bold, his point applies 
principally to large companies. I know that I cited the 
example of a large company with a problem, but my 
argument was based on an employer's response to me. 
The problem exists not only in the large company sector 
but in the smaller company sector, which may not have 
the elaborate rule structure to which the hon. Gentleman 
referred.
<P>
It was interesting that the Financial Secretary, when 
referring to the Data Protection Act 1998 thank 
goodness for the flexibility of the English language used 
the words "will seek"	, which does not imply that the rules 
will be in place immediately. I am sure that they will 
come in quickly, but we may find ourselves with a hiatus.
<P>
For one moment I thought that the Financial Secretary 
would take the amendment away and redraft it. I would 
have accepted that offer with alacrity. However, because 
she did not do so and because I still have concerns about 
this new system of paying benefit, I urge my hon. Friends 
to join me in pressing the amendment to a vote.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 
3, line 36, after `calculated', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but to exclude any interest charge where an overpayment arose as 
a result of incorrect instructions from the Inland Revenue.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 5(2)(f) provides that regulations shall be made 
for charging interest on sums due to the Revenue. The 
amendment would prevent any regulation made under that 
paragraph from enabling the Inland Revenue to charge 
interest on sums due by the employer, where the employer 
has been incorrectly notified of money to be paid to an 
employer and goes ahead and pays the money to the 
employee. In due course, the Revenue learns that the sum 
paid is wrong and tells the employer that he should have 
paid a different sum or no sum at all. If the employer then 
tries to recover the money from the employee and there 
is a delay in doing so for example, the employee may 
have left it would be inequitable to charge the employer 
interest on that money.
<P>
I may have misunderstood how and when interest will 
be applied, but that is inherent from the way in which the 
Bill is drafted. The amendment would make it clear that, 
if excessive money is paid to the employee as a result of 
incorrect notification by the Revenue, no fault will apply 
to the employer and interest will not be charged on the 
money owed back to the Inland Revenue.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary could 
clarify another point on a similar theme. Will an employer 
be required to pay the Inland Revenue interest on the 
funding provided to the employer under regulation 7 of 
the Draft Tax Credits (Payments by Employers) 
Regulations 1999? Those are the regulations that enable 
the Revenue to fund employers who would suffer a 
cash-flow problem in paying working families tax credit 
and disabled person's tax credit, because they are paying 
more out in those benefits than they are receiving in 
PAYE and national insurance contributions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The amendment proposes that interest 
should not be charged where an overpayment arises from 
incorrect instruction by the Inland Revenue. Interest will 
be charged and paid on sums overpaid or underpaid. As I 
am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, that applies to the 
rest of the tax system, and of course it is right that it 
should apply to tax credits, but the interest will run only 
from the end of the tax year, as happens with PAYE. If 
the employer and the board have rectified the error by 
then, no interest will be charged. However I hope that 
this will reassure the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) arrangements already exist to 
deal with the sort of situation envisaged by the 
amendment.
<P>
If the Inland Revenue discovers that misleading 
information or incorrect advice from Revenue staff 
contributed to the late payment of tax, part or all of the 
interest charged will be given up. That is covered in 
guidelines published by the Inland Revenue, and will 
depend on the circumstances of each case. It would, 
therefore, not be appropriate to enshrine that sort of 
arrangement in legislation. However, I assure the 
Committee that the same arrangements will also apply 
where a mistake by the Inland Revenue in relation to 
working families tax credit payments result in an interest 
charge.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about refunding. I can 
tell him that no interest will be charged in those 
circumstances. I hope that that reassures the hon. 
Gentleman, and that he will feel able to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister's response was helpful in 
clarifying that no interest will be charged in the event of 
incorrect notification by the Revenue in the circumstances 
set out in the Revenue guidelines. However, it is a pity 
that more and more reliance is being put on Revenue 
guidelines, which receive no parliamentary scrutiny. That 
is an issue of concern outside the House, especially among 
tax professionals. It is better to debate such issues in the 
House and include them in legislation rather than pass 
legislation that gives the Revenue the power to charge 
interest and then, subsequently, to mitigate those measures 
in a Revenue guideline.
<P>
However, given the Pepper v. Hart case, it is helpful 
that the Minister referred to that guideline in Committee 
and has assured the Committee that interest will not be 
charged in those circumstances. It is also helpful that the 
Minister has made it clear because this is not clear in the 
regulations that no interest will be charged on funding if 
the employer pays out more in working families tax credit 
and disabled person's tax credit than is received in PAYE 
and national insurance contributions. In view of the 
helpfulness of the Minister's statements, I beg to ask leave 
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move the amendment No. 32, in 
page 3, line 38, after `appeal', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(h) for funding the administration costs incurred in paying the 
credit by employers whose annual National Insurance contribution 
payments do not exceed £20,000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have been discussing the very real costs and 
burdens that the Bill imposes on employers, both large 
and small. The regulatory impact assessment demonstrates 
that the Bill will impose more than £100 million of 
recurring annual costs on British industry. As most people 
will suspect, such assessments tend to underestimate 
rather than overestimate the costs. Of the £100 million, 
£49 million will be borne by employers with fewer than 
100 employees. It is also clear from the regulatory impact 
assessment that £35 million of annual costs will be borne 
by employers with fewer than 10 employees. Thus one 
third of the costs of the Bill will be borne by very small 
employers.
<P>
The amendment would mitigate some of the damage 
that the Bill will cause by enabling the Inland Revenue to 
provide some assistance for small companies and small 
employers by bearing the extra costs that will result from 
administering the working families tax credit and disabled 
persons tax credit through the payroll. In its report, 
entitled "Implementation of Tax Credits"	, the Social 
Security Select Committee expressed concern about the 
responsiveness of the Inland Revenue in providing 
funding for employers who pay out more in working 
families tax credit than they receive from PAYE and 
national insurance contributions. It was also concerned 
about the extra burden of administration costs on small 
employers. Its report says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that small employers who administer WFTC 
should be awarded reimbursement of their costs similar to that which 
currently applies in relation to Statutory Maternity Pay, whereby 
small employers are entitled to an additional payment of 7 per cent. 
of the payment of SMP."<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I have an awful lot of sympathy with
the hon. Gentleman's general point. Will he tell the 
Committee how small firms are defined in relation to the 
additional payment for administering statutory maternity 
pay and whether that definition is the same as in his 
amendment? My reservation about the amendment is 
whether one wants to put in the Bill a specific amount, 
which might have to be changed every year with 
amendment to primary legislation. It might be better to 
stipulate something general in the Bill and then specify 
the precise figure in regulations.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. The 
definition of small company in the amendment is the same 
as that used for statutory maternity pay in the regulations, 
which specify the figure. If that is inconvenient and the 
Government are prepared to legislate on the matter in 
another way, I would accept that, but we adhere to the 
basic principle. I hope that the Government will accept 
the amendment and that when they prepare the regulations 
they will have such a payment in mind.
<P>
That is also the view of the Low Pay Unit, which stated 
in a briefing to Committee members:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It should be the responsibility of the Inland Revenue to make 
sure that WFTC is paid on time and in full, with the employers 
acting only as intermediary."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any administrative cost incurred in paying it should be reimbursed, 
at least for small employers. Similar schemes exist for SMP and 
SSP".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition used in relation to statutory maternity 
pay and statutory sick pay, as I mentioned in an 
intervention on the hon. Member for Northavon, is an 
employer who collects less than £20,000 annually in 
national insurance contributions from employees. That 
definition, used in Statutory Maternity Benefits 
(Compensation of Employers) and Miscellaneous 
Amendment Regulations 1994, is the same as that used in 
the amendment.
<P>
If the Government accept the principle of the 
amendment, but find the point raised by the hon. Member 
for Northavon compelling and wish to legislate by another 
method to enable the £20,000 to be index linked so that 
it does not give the administrative benefit to smaller and 
smaller employers as time goes by, we would accept that 
assurance from the Minister. Without that assurance, the 
matter is important enough to be pressed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The amendment would require the board 
to fund the administration costs incurred in paying tax 
credits by employers whose annual national insurance 
contribution payments do not exceed £20,000. My 
comments to the Committee on this amendment will be 
very similar to those on amendment No. 10.
<P>
The tax system does not provide and has never 
provided, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton knows from his background outside the 
House, a direct subsidy or compensation to employers 
who fulfil their obligations is relation to tax. As I said 
on amendment No. 10, employers are not reimbursed for 
operating the PAYE system and I can see no reason why 
the payment of tax credits should be treated differently.
<P>
I have said many times that the Government are 
committed to trying to ensure that burdens on employers 
are kept to the minium necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Minister said that no allowance is 
made for administering PAYE, but the hon. Member for 
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out that a special 
regime exists for statutory maternity pay. Is the Minister 
saying that the administration of the working families tax 
credit is so different from the administration of statutory 
maternity pay that completely different arguments apply? 
Surely the delivery of statutory maternity pay involves the 
same issues as the delivery of the WFTC.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. However, I am grateful to the hon. 
Gentleman for that intervention, which goes to the heart 
of the Bill and exposes the political and philosophical 
differences between the Government and the Opposition. 
We believe that the Bill involves not a benefit but a tax 
it is a Treasury Bill. I know that I have said that on several 
occasions, but it is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> We still do not believe the Financial 
Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> My point exposes the difference between 
the Government and the Opposition. Those differences lie 
behind some of the amendments 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am baffled by the Financial Secretary's 
refusal to accept the similarity between statutory 
maternity pay and statutory sick pay and the WFTC. 
Her argument all along has been that paying WFTC 
through the payroll will reduce stigma by associating 
payments with work, but no stigma is attached to statutory 
maternity pay or to statutory sick pay. I bet that all 
Committee members in their previous employments were 
sick at some time, and that their employer claimed 
statutory sick pay on their behalf. Zero stigma attaches to 
those benefits. Surely the Financial Secretary is trying to 
associate the WFTC with those benefits. To say that there 
is a complete distinction blows a hole through her entire 
argument invalid though it already is that the WFTC 
would reduce stigma. The Government previously 
claimed that the benefits are meant to be similar, but the 
Financial Secretary just argued that they are completely 
different.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman has totally 
misunderstood the point. I drew an analogy with the 
taxation system, of which our proposal is a part, and with 
the PAYE system. He must keep that comparison in mind. 
When WFTC payments are made through the pay-packet 
employers will be able to set off the amounts paid against 
their PAYE and NIC liabilities. If the tax credits to be 
paid are expected to exceed all of those deductions, 
employers will, as we explained, be able to apply to the 
Inland Revenue for funding, and they will be able to do 
so before paying the tax credit, which will ensure that a 
company will not be out of pocket.
<P>
Employers whose national insurance liability does not 
exceed £20,000 will tend to be small employers, and they 
will incur some costs, but we will continue to work 
as we have all along with employers' representatives to 
minimise those costs. The compliance costs will vary 
according to various factors, including the payroll 
system used.
<P>
Our proposals have to be seen in the context of the 
many measures that we have introduced to help business. 
We firmly believe that a system that upholds and 
reinforces the dignity of work will feed through into the 
business world, where it might help the relationships that 
small companies have with their employees.
<P>
Some of the arguments that I have used in this debate 
I have previously used in other contexts. Our debate may 
reveal the political differences between the Government 
and the Opposition. If the amendment is pressed to a 
Division, I advise my hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was an unsatisfactory response. The 
Financial Secretary referred to the administration of 
PAYE, but we all know that the WFTC will not be paid 
through the PAYE code. It will be a separate item on a 
payslip the Inland Revenue will give a separate 
notification of the amount to be paid, which will be based 
on a daily rate that the employer must multiply to 
calculate the amount to include in the pay-packet. It is 
wrong to say that WFTC is part of the PAYE system. The 
Office for National Statistics clearly said that it is not 
integral to the tax system. It does not depend on an 
employee's marginal tax rate and can only be calculated 
independently of the tax system.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): My hon. Friend 
makes an excellent point. There is a crucial difference. In 
the same way that statutory maternity pay and statutory 
sick pay require a different funding process from taxes, 
which are paid out of money earned as part of a 
straightforward cash flow from employers to the Revenue, 
employers will be asked to claim money from the 
Revenue to pay their employees a benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that 
valid point. Working families tax credit is similar to 
statutory maternity pay and statutory sick pay, both of 
which involve payments going to the employee that do 
not come from deductions from the employee's salary or 
wage. The Government's best argument for the working 
families tax credit is that it will reduce stigma and is part 
of the payroll system. A better argument would be made 
by comparing it to statutory maternity pay and statutory 
sick pay. The Financial Secretary rejected that by saying 
that there is no similarity because they are simply benefits 
paid through the payroll system. But the working families 
tax credit and the disabled persons tax credit are also 
benefits that are paid through the tax system. Everyone 
understands that, even the Ministers, who pretend not to.
<P>
There is no political difference. This is not an issue
of philosophy, but a straightforward difference of 
understanding of how the tax and benefits systems work. 
WFTC is not a tax issue because it is a benefit paid 
through the payroll system. The Government are wrong 
to impose a huge burden on business, especially the 
disproportionate burden that will fall on small businesses. 
The amendment would have helped to ameliorate that. 
However, as time is brief, and despite the Financial 
Secretary's inadequate answer, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I begin by quoting part of a hymn:

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that you are familiar with that, Mrs. Roe. The 
Government have an opportunity to be embraced in 
redemption. The Committee is giving the House the 
chance to reassert itself. The hon. Member for Bury, 
South (Mr. Lewis) took the first tentative step towards 
redemption. We are offering other Labour Members the 
opportunity to join him on that long march. We have a 
chance to make history and to ensure that the House of 
Commons starts to do what most people, when they elect 
Members of Parliament, think it does, which is scrutinise 
law.
<P>
As a senior and experienced Member of the House of 
Commons, Mrs. Roe, you will know that the use of 
secondary legislation has increased. Committees do not 
have the opportunity to affect that legislation. About 
1,600 statutory instruments were passed by the House last 
year. Few received the scrutiny that they should have 
received. That is endemic in the system. We are faced 
with a charming Minster, like the Financial Secretary, 
who stonewalls for the Government. It matters not a jot 
or tittle if Opposition Members, or even Government 
Members, have worries that the statutory instrument may 
be fundamentally flawed or have something wrong with 
it, because Committees cannot change it: they must take 
it or leave it.
<P>
I was never a Minister.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Shame!
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was an apparatchik at central office 
overworked and no pay. That was my view at the time. 
That is why I have never kept a cat, because in July I 
would fear for its safety. I can imagine what it would be 
like in the Secretary of State's office if a Minister of State 
or Parliamentary Secretary said, "Secretary of State, I got 
to the Committee, I found that what we were producing 
was inadequate, I listened to what the Committee said and 
I thought that the best thing to do would be to withdraw 
it."	 I have a feeling that, the way the system works, the 
Secretary of State would not say, "Well done, O faithful 
servant"	 and send the Minister out to deal with some more 
Bills. The Bill always has to go through.
<P>
Because of the pressure of scrutiny, I see an increasing 
trend. A couple of weeks after a Committee has finished, 
one gets a nice little note. I have not spoken for the 
Opposition on statutory instruments more than 10 times, 
but I have already had two notes saying,"We have now 
discovered that clause 37 has proved to be inadequate and 
is creating a problem that was unforseen at the time."	 Was 
it heck unforseen at the time. I have the Committee record 
to prove how wrong that statement was; we had listened 
to the Government who explained how the Bill would be 
perfectly all right.
<P>
Some instruments so greatly affect the liberty of our 
citizens that we should have the opportunity to amend 
them. Why here? First, we want to debate this issue. 
Secondly, the Bill has been nicknamed the Henry III Bill, 
after that 16th century military tyrant. I look across at the 
Financial Secretary and I cannot think of anyone less like 
a 16th century military tyrant and I understand how 
hurtful such a remark will be to her.
<P>
All the clauses of the Bill might as well be one clause, 
saying that the Government can do what they want. We 
are saying I put it gently, because we are moving 
towards the conclusion of the Committee that the Bill is 
immensely important. It will affect the liberty, the rights 
and the purse or wallet of our electors. They expect us to 
give the Bill some scrutiny.
<P>
I recently had an opportunity to listen to the Leader of 
the House talking on a radio programme about precisely 
that problem. She said, as many Labour Members say 
when first answering a question, "It was all the previous 
Government's fault, because they started this process of 
secondary legislation."	 However, both under the previous 
Government and this Government there has been an 
acceleration in the use of these forms of secondary 
legislation. To say that the previous Government did it is 
not an inadequate response. It is like saying "I'm an 
alcoholic now, but it was all the fault of the person who 
gave me that first shandy all those years ago."	
<P>
The Committee gives us an opportunity to do what our 
electors expect us to do amend legislation on their 
behalf.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I will be brief. I cannot match my hon. 
Friend's lyrical and revivalist eloquence, but I thoroughly 
enjoyed and support his views. Another of the 
Opposition's goals is to give the House of Commons 
and the House of Lords, whatever form it might take 
the opportunity to debate those details of the Bill that we 
have not debated. The flaws in the philosophy behind the 
Bill have become apparent as we have examined different 
clauses; we expect those flaws to be magnified in the 
regulations. That is why amendment No. 41 states that 
both Houses of Parliament should debate the regulations 
in detail the Bill refers to "either House of Parliament"	.
<P>
We have raised issues that are of great importance to a 
range of different bodies representing the people who will 
be most directly affected. With the utmost respect and 
humility, the use of the negative resolution procedure in 
one or other House of Parliament would significantly limit 
the opportunities of the British people, through their 
elected and non-elected representatives, to draw attention 
to any problems with the details of the Bill. Hon. 
Members have a responsibility to debate such matters, but 
the opportunity to do so is expressly forbidden by the Bill. 
Parliament's new two and a half day week from the 
point of view of the Government's programme gives us 
plenty of time to debate the regulations. It is a negation 
of the role of Members of Parliament to spend only two 
and a half days a week on such matters. We should be 
spending four, if not five, days debating the details of 
legislation, which directly and crucially affect our 
electors.
<P>
I hope that the Government will take on board those 
deeply held views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friends 
the Members for Beckenham and for Brentwood and 
Ongar, who have made excellent speeches. Mine will be 
more dull.
<P>
The three amendments relate to some of our worries 
about the proliferation of secondary legislation in this and 
other Bills. The delegated powers described in clause 
5(1) there are a number of them, which are set out in 
paragraphs (a) to (g) amount to the whole architecture 
and configuration of the WFTC and DPTC. We believe 
that that architecture should be in the Bill. Those who 
read the Bill from cover to cover perhaps Labour 
Members have done so since I warned them about not 
reading it last week without reading the accompanying 
glossy document from the Inland Revenue or the plethora 
of draft regulations spawned by the Bill, will not have 
any idea how WFTC or DPTC will work. Even the basic 
architecture will be decided by secondary legislation, 
which is wrong. The whole architecture should be dealt 
with in the Bill, rather than through secondary legislation, 
but if such legislation is to be used it should not be 
implemented by way of negative resolution. In effect, 
Parliament will be unable to debate the Government's 
whim.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 would delete clause 5(3)(a), 
which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regulations under this section...may make different provision 
for different cases or circumstances".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That phrase is too wide-ranging. Were we not debating 
the provision, which will empower the Inland Revenue to 
make regulations in specific cases or circumstances, it 
would verge on the hybrid.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 concerns clause 5(3)(b) and would 
change a negative resolution procedure into an affirmative 
resolution procedure, which would guarantee that 
Parliament can at least debate these important regulations.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would introduce the new concept 
of a super-affirmative resolution procedure, which is 
recommended in the report by the Select Committee on 
Social Security, House of Commons 29, entitled "Tax and 
Benefits: Implementation of Tax Credits". In it, the 
Committee expressed concern at the way in which the 
working families tax credit is likely to be implemented. 
The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Inland Revenue's willingness to consult...regarding the 
detail of secondary legislation does not address the more 
fundamental issue of adequate parliamentary scrutiny of major 
change. Even if the affirmative procedure is used...this is a 
`take-it-or-leave-it' process which is one of debate, not detailed 
examination; and, again, amendment is not possible."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The super-affirmative procedure was originally proposed 
during the previous Parliament by the Select Committee 
on Procedure. It requires Ministers' proposals to be 
submitted to both Houses and to be scrutinised in detail 
by Committees, which may draw on outside evidence and 
propose amendments. To be enacted, the regulations must 
then be passed by both Houses. That is a more satisfactory 
method of dealing with these important regulations, and I 
urge the Committee to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have enjoyed the debate, particularly the 
speech by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. 
On Second Reading, he referred to Henry VIII and I 
wondered whether he would mention that monarch again. 
I believe that he also quoted from the Marie Lloyd song 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> "Every one an 'Enery"	.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Since Second Reading, I have waited for 
the opportunity to recite to the hon. Gentleman the words 
of that song:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Every one an 'Enery, never a Willie or a Sam. I am 'er eighth 
old man called 'Enery-- 'Enery the VIII I am".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the great song of the widow next door, which I 
am sure that he knows well. I should make it clear that I 
am not offering to form a singing partnership with the 
hon. Gentleman once our proceedings have finished, 
tempting though that may be. In saying so, I do not wish 
to cast aspersions on the quality of his singing voice. Mine 
is absolutely dreadful.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am fascinated by the point that the 
Minister makes. The tax credit I hesitate to mention the 
phrase will transfer money from wives to husbands. Is 
not Henry VIII precisely the sort of man to whom the 
credit should not be given?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yet again, we see the wisdom of the 
interventions of the hon. Member for Northavon. He has 
enabled me to reassure the Committee that the Bill has no 
Henry VIII clauses. As you will know, Mrs. Roe, Henry 
VIII clauses confer power on the Executive to amend 
statutes through delegated legislation and that is not the 
Government's intention in this case.
<P>
The amendment would combine the aims of 
amendments Nos. 40 and 41. First, it would remove the 
power to make regulations for different cases and 
circumstances. Secondly, it would provide that regulations 
under clause 5 should be made by so-called 
super-affirmative procedures.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 5(3)(a) gives the board of the Inland Revenue 
the power to make regulations to suit new circumstances 
that may arise in future. The current wording of the 
paragraph is the normal way to ensure that 
regulation-making powers conferred in primary 
legislation are not so narrow that they allow no scope for 
changing circumstances. The wording is often used in 
both tax and social security legislation. Opposition 
Members try most engagingly in the case of the hon. 
Member for Brentwood and Ongar but they cannot get 
away from the fact that the same procedure was used 
extensively by the previous Government.
<P>
Clause 5(3)(b) provides a power for regulations to be 
made following negative resolution procedure in both 
Houses of Parliament. That is the normal process in the 
tax system. Indeed, it is more usual for tax regulations to 
be laid only before this House.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I may have missed something, but I thought 
that the Minister said that the clause provided for a 
negative resolution in both Houses of Parliament. Line 43 
on page 3 of the Bill says "a resolution of either House"	, 
although amendment No. 41 proposed that it should be 
considered by both Houses of Parliament. If the Minister 
will agree to amendment No. 41, I shall be delighted.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, "either House"	 means that either 
House may annul, because both Houses will have the 
opportunity to do so. That is clearly set out.
<P>
Social security legislation also frequently provides for 
regulations to be made by negative resolution procedure. 
Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. I assume that 
it was prompted by hon. Members' legitimate concern to 
ensure that all regulations made under clause 5 will be 
subject to proper scrutiny. I hope that I can reassure them 
on that point. As many Committee members will know, it 
is common practice for the Inland Revenue to consult 
widely before making new regulations, especially relating 
to PAYE. In this instance, Committee members and hon. 
Members in the other place are happy for it to draft 
regulations that govern payment of tax credits by 
employers. The drafts have also been circulated to several 
interested parties, and will shortly be made available to a 
much wider audience for comment. Of course, that is the 
normal process of consultation on Inland Revenue 
regulations and the negative resolution procedure is a tried 
and tested system for introducing secondary legislation. I 
hope that I have reassured the Committee about the 
Government's intentions, but if the amendment is pressed 
to a vote, I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We are soothed but not reassured by the 
hon. Lady. I believe that this is a Henry VIII Bill in more 
than one way. It is certainly the Government's intention 
to move working families tax credit further and further up 
the income scale, so that if Henry VIII were still alive, 
he might possibly benefit under the Bill and woe betide 
anyone who tried to take the form away from him.
<P>
After consultation with my hon. Friends and to ensure 
that the hon. Member for Bury, South has the opportunity 
to become a Minister at some stage, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 
3, line 44, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The Board shall, in consultation with employers who are 
likely to be paying a tax credit to employees when this section 
comes into force, publish a Code of Conduct for such employers by 
6th April 2000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The amendment was tabled on the off-chance that the 
Committee had not agreed to previous amendments. As it 
turns out, they were not agreed to and the amendment, 
which would require the Inland Revenue to issue a code 
of conduct for employers, is therefore necessary.
<P>
The code of conduct would be devised after extensive 
consultation with the employers who will have to 
administer the benefit, but a code of conduct it would 
nevertheless be. It would deal with the Opposition's 
concerns, especially those about stigma and 
confidentiality. The Government did not accept our 
amendment that would require employers to take 
reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of 
employees. The next best thing would be to include that 
requirement in a code of conduct.
<P>
The gist of the amendment is that the Government will 
produce a code of conduct in consultation with employers, 
which will help to maintain confidentiality in the 
administration of the benefit and to reduce stigma, and it 
should go some way towards remedying the Bill's 
fundamental flaws.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> To misquote Clint Eastwood, I am going 
to make the hon. Gentleman's day. The Inland Revenue 
has already begun work on a code of practice, which it 
will publish in October 1999. It will consult 
representatives of employer groups while the code is 
being drafted. It will also produce a code for applicants, 
which will be published in October 1999. Given that good 
news, I have absolutely no doubt that the hon. Gentleman 
will have the good grace to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Financial Secretary has made my day. 
In view of her commitment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 
3, leave out line 45 and add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) This section shall not come into force until the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer has laid before both Houses of Parliament a statement 
that he is satisfied that employers are likely to be in a position to 
comply with their obligations under this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would place a duty on the Chancellor 
of the Exchequer to lay
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"before both Houses of Parliament a statement".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that employers are ready to implement the WFTC before 
it is implemented. I notice that the Bill's cover page 
includes a statement from the Chancellor about the Bill's 
consistency with the European convention on human 
rights, and I want him to make a similar statement about 
the fact that employers are ready to implement the 
WFTC's introduction.
<P>
Why is that important? The WFTC will deliver, I 
believe, £5 billion to lower-paid working families. How 
much of that will come through the pay-packet? It is 
difficult to give a precise figure but I notice that the Inland 
Revenue's regulatory impact assessment assumes that 
approximately two thirds of employers will opt for 
payment through the pay-packet. We can exclude the 
self-employed from the calculation, but all lone parents 
will be obliged to receive the credit through the 
pay-packet. To take a fair stab at a figure, I would guess 
that about £3 billion a huge sum will be received 
through the pay-packet. It is therefore vital that that 
money is delivered effectively and efficiently.
<P>
We might estimate that only 1 per cent. of firms will 
not be ready and able to administer the WFTC on time 
but 1 per cent. of £3 billion is £30 million. If 1 per cent. 
of employers are not ready in April 2000, £30 million will 
not reach the pockets of needy lower-income families. 
That calculation assumes a problem rate of only 1 per 
cent., but a rather large proportion of employees who will 
be covered will be working for small firms, and the 1 per 
cent. figure might therefore be a modest assumption.
<P>
What reasons are there to think that firms will not be 
ready? Committee members have heard that jewellers in 
Bromsgrove and small businesses in Beckenham do not 
know that the reform is coming and no one in 
Northavon has mentioned it to me. Small businesses will 
have many proposals to cope with, including the 
minimum wage, which I support in doing so, I part 
company for once with Conservative Members. They will 
also have to deal with the new fairness at work legislation 
and the fact that the WFTC will be introduced only three 
months after the millennium bug is due to 
surface.However, we are discussing placing on small 
businesses an obligation to deliver £3 billion to 
low-income families.
<P>
Why do we want the Chancellor to make a statement? 
Because it would acknowledge personal ownership and 
responsibility of this "project"	. The Chancellor introduced 
the working families tax credit by force of personality. 
His fingerprints are all over it. There is not much 
argument; it is part of a creed. The Financial Secretary 
said that there is a difference in political philosophy. We 
have not evidence but assertion. A cost of £100 million 
will be placed on business on the back of the 
Chancellor's hunch.
<P>
The Chancellor I am sure that my hon. Friend the 
Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) will back me on 
this needs to admit ownership of, and take responsibility 
for, this project. If employers do not deliver and the 
system is the shambles that we fear it will be, the 
Chancellor should be responsible. Nothing would make 
that clearer than the Chancellor placing before Parliament 
a statement in which he says that he believes that 
employers are ready. If I were Chancellor of the 
Exchequer as one day I hope to be and had to lay a 
personal statement before the House saying that, in my 
judgment, employers are ready, I would be sure that they 
were. A statement would give the Treasury an extra 
impetus to ensure that firms know about the measure 
when it begins and what it involves make it as easy as 
possible for it to work.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary, in her response to 
this simple amendment, will advise us what steps have 
been taken to ensure that employers are ready and that the 
500,000 firms that are to deliver the credit will be able to 
put their payroll systems in place. Although I do not 
support this use of public money, I want the Bill to work. 
I want to be confident that employees will be able to get 
the money to vulnerable people. I have grave doubts about 
their ability to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I rise to make a brief contribution. I agree 
with much that the hon. Member for Northavon said. The 
proposal is modest. The Chancellor of the Exchequer 
should make a statement. His fortunes are held together 
by the Bill, which makes me, as a Conservative, very 
happy because I do not think that it will be regarded as a 
great triumph. Labour Members will rue the day that they 
introduced it.
<P>
However, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman in one 
respect his ambition to become Chancellor. In a 
previous debate, he said that he tended to agree with the 
last person who has spoken to him. That is not a 
prerequisite for becoming Chancellor.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I think that the hon. Member for 
Northavon went on to say that that explained why he was 
a member of the Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amendment would delay the introduction of clause 5 "until 
the Chancellor of the Exchequer has laid before both Houses of 
Parliament a statement that he is satisfied that employers are likely 
to be in a position to comply with their obligations under"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Bill. The amendment is unnecessary. The Chancellor 
would not have proposed the payment of tax credits by 
employees if he had not been satisfied that they would 
be able to comply with their obligations. We are doing 
everything that we can to ensure that employers are in a 
position to fulfil their new duties.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon overestimates what 
we are asking employers to do. They will not have to 
assess applications for tax credit. The Inland Revenue will 
do that. It will tell employers when to start paying the 
credits, how much to pay and when to stop. Employers 
will be paying tax credits as well as carrying out their 
normal PAYE duties, with which they are, of course, 
familiar, and will account to the Revenue for tax credits 
paid, in the same way as they send in annual returns for 
PAYE tax deducted.
<P>
In case there could have been any doubt about 
employers' ability to cope with their new obligations, we 
have, properly and rightly, involved employer 
representatives in the design of the scheme and we are 
grateful to them. This debate provides me with the 
opportunity to thank them for the many valuable 
suggestions on the detailed aspects of the system. The 
consultations with representative bodies will continue.
<P>
In addition, in the run-up to April 2000 a targeted 
publicity campaign will ensure that employers know 
exactly what they have to do. There will be a helpline for 
employers and the Inland Revenue will provide 
information, easy-to-use guidance and educational 
material to help employers.
<P>
I am a trusting soul but not as trusting as the hon. 
Member for Brentwood and Ongar and I presume that 
the hon. Member for Northavon tabled the amendment to 
probe the Government so that we put on the record our 
intentions on the targeted publicity campaign. Having 
provided that information, I have no doubt that the hon. 
Member for Northavon will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The hon. lady used the word "delay"	. She 
said that I sought to delay implementation until the 
statement had been placed before the House. If employers 
are ready, requiring the Chancellor to make a statement 
that they are ready will not delay implementation. It 
would not take the Chancellor long to make a statement, 
nor would it hold up implementation. It would cause delay 
only if employers were not ready. Implementation will 
either be delayed because employers are not ready, in 
which case it should be delayed, or it will not be delayed. 
I am puzzled at the Minister's use of "delay"	.
<P>
This is a modest amendment and would give the 
Chancellor an impetus. He has not been party to our 
deliberations, he did not contribute to the Second Reading 
debate and we do not expect him to contribute on the 
Third Reading, so he has been rather distanced from the 
process and from scrutiny of the Bill, although I do not 
doubt that he has read my contributions with interest. We 
require this personal ownership by the Chancellor and I 
am unable to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 47 in page 
3, line 45, at end inset
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except in the case of employers who employ fewer than 21 people 
when it shall come into force on 6th April 2002.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment would not have been necessary had 
earlier Opposition amendments been accepted. We have 
set out in detail our concerns about the burden that the 
working families tax credit will impose on small 
employers. The regulatory impact assessment calculated 
that it would place £100 million of extra costs on 
business, of which £49 million will apply to employers 
with fewer than 100 employees and £35 million to 
employers with fewer than 10. The amendment would 
delay the implementation of the benefit administration 
system until small employers had had time to make sure 
that their systems were in place, which would make it 
easier for them to cope with the administration. There is 
also a large upfront figure of £43 million for the one-off 
set-up costs in preparing systems for the new benefit 
administration system.
<P>
The charity TaxAid, which provides free tax advice to 
people in financial need, says that a delay until 2002 is 
essential because it will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"give small firms more time to prepare themselves for the change, 
and allow many practical difficulties to be ironed out before smaller 
firms are brought within its scope."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
TaxAid's argument is that difficulties will inevitably arise 
in the introduction of such a system and that it is better 
to spot them and to hinder the work of larger companies 
rather than smaller companies, which may be less well 
equipped to deal with them. Let us put the system in place 
for larger companies in the first instance, get the problems 
ironed out and then, two years down the line, apply it to 
smaller companies. In the meantime, employees working 
for companies with fewer than 21 employees, who are 
entitled to the benefit, will be able to have it paid direct 
by the Inland Revenue, in the way that couples can elect 
to be paid.
<P>
TaxAid goes on to say that if the delay is implemented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that this will help to ensure that when the scheme is 
extended to smaller firms it will be more `user friendly' and 
therefore less likely to be resented by smaller employers or the 
subject of abuse."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government must agree that they do not want the 
system to be resented by smaller employers; they want it 
to function smoothly. This is a genuinely helpful 
amendment to assist the Government in getting the system 
accepted by the hundreds of thousands of smaller 
employers who will have to implement it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I echo the thoughts of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton when he 
said that this is a genuinely helpful amendment. Indeed it 
is. We are here on this occasion not only to help small 
businesses but to help the Government and the 
implementation of the Bill.
<P>
Hon. Members who have had an opportunity to read 
carefully the report of our deliberation on Tuesday will 
have read the many contributions explaining why small 
firms are at a disadvantage and how costs peculiarly hit 
them harder than larger undertakings and I do not intend 
to repeat those arguments. I want to make two fresh and 
distinct points.
<P>
The first relates to phasing. The amendment would give 
the Government an opportunity to phase the measure in, 
applying it first to businesses that are more likely to be 
able to cope with this new form of paying benefit than 
smaller firms. That would allow smoother implementation 
and give small firms breathing space to prepare for the 
new system. It would also ensure that the lessons learnt 
from the implementation by larger firms can be passed on 
to smaller firms.
<P>
The second point is giving much concern to the Public 
Accounts Committee. You will no doubt recall, Mrs. Roe, 
the warning that was issued to the Inland Revenue by the 
Comptroller because of concerns that in four instances the 
Inland Revenue computer is not millennium compliant. 
Already there are signs of problems. I have a similar 
concern. If we are to implement the Bill a few months 
after trying to sort out those four problems, we are simply 
asking for trouble. The Government would be wise to 
accept the amendment, because it will allow them to phase 
in the Bill and will give them a necessary breathing space 
to ensure a smooth transition, once the Inland Revenue 
has dealt with all the problems that it faces regarding 
millennium compliance.
<P>
This is a helpful amendment and I am confident that he 
Financial Secretary will respond in the spirit in which it 
is moved.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As I keep saying, the hon. Gentleman is 
very engaging. When one looks at him, a wonderful 
phrase springs to mind. What he is really saying to the 
Government is, "I am from the Opposition; I am here to 
help."	 But on this occasion I shall resist his banter.
<P>
I was interested by the debate, because the hon. 
Gentleman then bit his tongue when the hon. Member for 
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the Bill as 
"this new tax system"	. Clearly my remarks are getting 
through to Labour Members, so I am grateful that they 
tabled the amendment.
<P>
The amendment seeks to defer until April 2002 the 
payment of tax credits by employers who employ fewer 
than 21 people, because Opposition Members believe that 
they will need two years more than others to prepare for 
the new system. Perhaps I may give the Committee, some 
reassurance, as I did in the earlier debate. All employers 
will be given ample guidance by the Revenue before April 
2000, so that they understand what the payment of 
taxcredits will mean for them. As well as a targeted 
publicity campaign, when small firms will be much in our 
minds, there will be an employer helpline.
<P>
To defer payment through the payroll for employees of 
smaller companies would be unfair. All employees should 
have a right to tax credits with their pay. It would be 
wrong to make some wait a further two years.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and would have 
undesirable results for employers. Therefore, I urge the 
Committee to reject it.

Clauses 6 and 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Penalties for fraud etc. and failures to comply</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 
4, line 29, after `liable', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`both to repay such amount as is fraudulently or negligently so 
claimed and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment has two purposes. First, it aims to 
resolve a slight ambiguity in the wording of the clause, 
by inserting into clause 8(1), the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"both to repay such amount as is fraudulently or negligently so 
claimed and".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, any money that is fraudulently claimed 
will be repaid. In addition, the amendment would impose 
a penalty, which would be the difference between the 
amount of the tax credit to which the claimant was entitled 
and the amount to which the claim relates. The wording 
of the clause is ambiguous on whether a penalty is 
imposed in addition to the common law requirement to 
repay money that has been fraudulently claimed, or 
whether the penalty itself is the only repayment of the 
fraudulently claimed money. In that regard, the 
amendment is probing. It allows the Government to 
clarify their intention.
<P>
Secondly, the amendment aims to put on record the 
Opposition's concern about fraud. A number of hon. 
Members raised the issue on Second Reading and it has 
been alluded to during the Committee. The best 
contribution came from the right hon. Member for 
Birkenhead, who said on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"fraud is generally accepted to account for about 15 per cent. of 
the American equivalent of working families tax credit. If the same 
happens here, we will face a fraud bill of £750 million."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is £750 million of fraud to be added to the £100 
million of burdens on business, according to the 
regulatory impact assessment. The right hon. Member for 
Birkenhead continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In Committee, we shall need to consider carefully how much 
more effectively the Treasury will protect taxpayers' money than 
the DSS sadly has in the past."	 [Official Report, 26 January 
1999; Vol. 324, c. 168.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a pity that, after such a heavy hint, the Government 
did not feel it appropriate to put the right hon. Member for 
Birkenhead on the Committee, so that he could consider 
carefully how to protect WFTC from fraud.
<P>
Fraud is a problem not only in America but in Canada, 
where the system was even more similar to WFTC. Fraud 
was so prevalent in Canada that the system was scrapped 
after only five years of implementation.
<P>
Finally, I should like to refer to the Social Security 
Committee report on family credit fraud document HC 
217. Although the statistics that were used were small and 
therefore not significant, the pilot study shows 32 
instances of proven fraud in the administration of family 
credit and a further 50 instances of high suspicion of 
fraud. That is a 10 per cent. fraud rate and a 16 per cent. 
high suspicion of fraud rate. Family credit is widely 
regarded as well administered and does not suffer from 
the inherent difficulties of the WFTC system, yet the 
Government want to introduce a system that has a proven 
track record of fraud elsewhere in the world. Therefore, it 
is likely that fraud will become more of a problem. Will 
the Financial Secretary explain why she believes that the 
new system will be less fraudulent than that which 
already exists?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Let me start off on a good note in replying 
to the hon. Gentleman: we welcome the intention behind 
the amendment. However, I am unable to support it 
because it duplicates an existing provision in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister explain?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course I shall explain. As I was going 
to say before that interruption a courteous interruption, 
but one from a sedentary position I do not think that the 
hon. Gentleman has read the Bill with care. [Hon. 
Members: "Withdraw."	] Sometimes, my discourtesy 
almost amazes me.
<P>
The amendment would enable the Inland Revenue to 
collect an overpayment of tax credit from someone who 
claimed it fraudulently or negligently. It is proposed that
the amendment should be inserted in the clause that 
provides for a penalty to be charged on such a person. I 
understand what motivated the hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton to table such an amendment, and 
I am sure that the whole Committee is united in the aim 
to do everything we can to combat fraud.
<P>
The right to collect an overpayment of tax credit when 
the overpayment has arisen from a misrepresentation, 
whether fraudulent or otherwise, is contained in section 
71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and 
section 69 of the Social Security Administration (Northern 
Ireland) Act 1992. Those sections will apply to tax credits, 
with the modifications set out in schedule 2 part IV of the 
Bill. The Government fully intend that those who claim 
too much tax credit as a result of misrepresenting their 
circumstances should pay back what they falsely claimed. 
The Bill provides for that, so the amendment is 
unnecessary, although I am grateful to the hon. Member 
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for tabling it because 
it has given me the opportunity to draw attention to that 
part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Given that, in two separate reports, the 
Social Security Committee indicated how the working 
families tax credit would be more liable to fraud, and 
given experience in America and Canada, will the 
Minister explain what additional measures the 
Government have introduced to ensure that fraud is not 
more prevalent in working families tax credit?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman will understand from 
what I have already said that some of the safeguards 
suggested by the Social Security Committee have been 
incorporated in the Bill. We have included powers in the 
Bill that will ensure that we can be vigilant about fraud.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My remarks referred to additional powers, 
not to those that relate only to family credit.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I said that we have both the powers in the 
Bill the very powers that the hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton asked us to include, and the 
powers that we have included for, and on behalf of, the 
Revenue. I hope that that reassures Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister confirm to the Committee 
that clause 8 provides for a penalty in addition to 
repayment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes, I am happy to confirm that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is very helpful. Now, it is clear that 
the clause provides for a penalty in addition to the 
requirement to repay the money owed, and that there is a 
genuine deterrent against misclaiming working families 
tax credit. If there were only a requirement to repay the 
money, there would be no downside to submitting a 
fraudulent claim, but it is now clear from clause 8 that 
there is a penalty, albeit a penalty equal to the amount of 
fraudulently claimed working families tax credit. In view 
of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clauses 8 to 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Persons qualifying for disabled person's tax credit</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> This clause relates to persons qualifying 
for disabled person's tax credit. Significantly, our 
discussions have paid insufficient attention to the disabled 
person's tax credit, which we have tended to bracket 
together with WFTC. If those who cheer whenever the 
Chancellor says, "And we've introduced a disabled 
person's tax credit,"	 knew how minor and insignificant it 
is, they might think again.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us how many people will qualify 
for disabled person's tax credit compared to the disability 
working allowance? Can she provide an estimate not 
merely for the first year of implementation, but for 
subsequent years, when the credit will have had time to 
bed down?
<P>
During my time in social research, it became clear that 
the disability working allowance was a complete flop. I 
knew social researchers who were able, because the 
allowance was negligible, to conduct a 100 per cent. 
survey of those who received it. I hope that the disabled 
person's tax credit will not suffer the same fate, but I 
suspect that, although it sounds good, it will deliver 
relatively little. Therefore, the Minister should give 
concrete estimates of the numbers involved.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am slightly disappointed by the hon. 
Gentleman's remarks. I am delighted to introduce clause 
13, which will enable more people with short-term 
illnesses and disabilities to benefit from in-work support. 
The disabled person's tax credit replaces and enhances the 
current disability working allowance a benefit that has 
to a great extent failed to encourage people with an illness 
or a disability to enter the work force, rather than to rely 
on out-of-work benefits. Take-up has been only a quarter 
of the level that was forecast when it was introduced.
<P>
The disabled person' tax credit has a lower taper, higher 
thresholds and will provide improved help with child care 
costs. We hope that more people with illnesses or 
disabilities will see the benefits and greater rewards of 
work, and we shall do all that we can to help them make 
the transition.
<P>
The credit will provide a further £30 million for 
in-work support. I would have thought that such a sum 
would have received a rather warmer welcome from the 
hon. Gentleman. We anticipate that 6,000 more people 
will be able to take up the credit a not inconsiderable 
figure.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> That is pathetic!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> A condition of the disability working 
allowance is that claimants must be in receipt of one of a 
range of benefits when they claim, or during the 56 days 
prior to claiming. Therefore, some people with an illness 
or disability that makes it harder for them to look for work 
will have only eight weeks to find work after ceasing to 
qualify for an out-of-work benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> For clarity, is the 6,000 the extra number 
created by the provisions in clause 13 the extension 
from 56 to 182 days or the global total of extra 
recipients? If it is not the latter, what is the grand total of 
extra recipients?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is the whole total. The hon. Gentleman 
is not being helpful by making remarks from a sedentary 
position. We are talking about real people whose lives are 
going to be made much, much better. Their lives will 
change immeasurably. Indeed, the extra sums are 
considerable. I would have expected the hon. Gentleman 
to give the proposal a warm welcome. However, I agree 
with him on one point: it is a shame that we have not had 
more discussion on this aspect of the Bill.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I rise to seek assurance on the clause, under 
which arrangements would be made for the necessary 
money to be paid out to various bodies. Will local 
authorities be covered by the clause if they incur extra 
costs? I know that the Financial Secretary does not expect 
the number of child minders to increase but, should that 
happen, local authorities will incur extra costs because 
they have to register and inspect child minders. If central 
Government are not prepared to ensure that local 
authorities get the extra money, either through ring-fenced 
grant or standard spending assessments, those authorities 
will be forced to skimp on the provision of inspectors and 
inspections, which could result in scandals similar to those 
that have already occurred in that sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a similar point, the Bill does not provide 
for the passporting of benefits that previously applied to 
family credit. The Government have not decided whether 
to allow the same passport rights to apply to the working 
family tax credit. Is that still under consideration? If it is, 
have the Government, in their Red Book and the 
Pre-Budget report published in November, provided in 
their accounts for those passporting benefits to be 
continued under WFTC?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> You have a puzzled Minister before you, 
Mrs. Roe. Clearly, you want me to be in order, but clause 
15 is about a "sink of italics"	. It assists the drafting of the 
Bill. Its sole purpose is to avoid the need to italicise parts 
of the Bill that will lead to expenditure by the board, or 
to increased payments out of votes or into the 
Consolidated Fund under other Acts. The clause puts all 
the italics in one place. We will have an opportunity to 
discuss the point raised by the hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton when we debate a later clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham was not precisely in 
order, although I am not trying to usurp your function, 
Mrs. Roe. She made the same point when we discussed 
eligibility for child care. The Government do not accept 
the premise that people will revise their child care 
arrangements on the basis of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee, but 
can I take it from that interpretation that, if our prediction 
of what will happen to child minding occurs, the 
Government will refuse to reimburse local authorities for 
any extra expenses?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Well 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes or no will do.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Hon. Members forget the usual courtesy 
with which we conduct our proceedings.
<P>
I have made it clear that we do not expect anything of 
that sort to happen. Opposition Members must return to 
the reality of how people conduct their childcare 
arrangements. They do not conduct them on the basis of 
money, but on the basis of what is in the best interests of 
the child. I did not hear such questions when family credit 
legislation was being considered. We shall make no 
special arrangements because we expect child care 
arrangements to operate in the same way as they operate 
with local authorities and child minders at the moment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) This section applies to 
<P>
(a) any contract for the supply of goods or services to the

(b) any contract for the supply of goods or services to the

transferred functions or only to retained functions, but 
whose terms are wholly or partly determined in accordance

this section applies.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
The new clause is a technical provision to deal with the 
transfer of certain contracts supplying a range of services 
throughout the Department of Social Security, including 
the family credit unit. They include information 
technology service contracts, which are at present 
operated in the Department by the Information 
Technology Services Agency.
<P>
After the introduction of working families tax credit, 
the new tax credit office will need to rely on services 
provided by those contracts. The new clause simply 
allows the new tax credit unit to access the benefits of the 
contracts, while the contracts themselves will remain 
under the management of the Department of Social 
Security.
<P>
The new clause is being added to the Bill as a result of 
detailed examination of the contracts involved in the 
transfer of functions. A similar provision was included in 
the Bill to transfer the Contributions Agency.
<P>
I hope that that explains the reason for the new clause. 
It is purely a technical amendment.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Recipients of a tax credit shall be entitled to the benefits to which 
claimants of family credit and disability working allowance were 
entitled under the National Health Service (Travelling Expenses and 
Remission of Charges) Regulations 1998 as they had effect 
immediately prior to the coming into force of this Act."	. [Mr. 
Webb.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a 
Second time. This gives me the opportunity to reflect on 
the passported benefits on which the hon. Member for 
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton touched. It is a concern 
that we share. The more that I have reflected on those 
benefits, the more concerned I have become. I want to 
probe the Minister on two passported benefits in relation 
to working families tax credit. First, on NHS benefits, 
which cover free prescription charges, eye tests, dental 
work, wigs and fabric supports, we want the Government 
to clarify whether they intend that recipients of working 
families tax credit will be entitled to those benefits.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
was interested in the fact that, at present, family credit 
recipients are entitled to social fund grants, including 
funeral and maternity grants. The WFTC will extend to 
higher rate taxpayers. Either recipients of the WFTC, 
including those on very modest incomes, are about to be
denied funeral grants, or higher rate taxpayers are about 
to start getting funeral grants. I hope that the new clause, 
which probes that question, encourages the Government 
to give their views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I echo the hon. 
Gentleman's comments and I share his concerns. The fact 
that the benefit system has de facto been extended so far 
up the income scale is complete and utter nonsense. If all 
the benefits that he mentioned will apply to everyone who 
is eligible for WFTC, we will face an horrendous bill, but 
if none of the benefits will apply to anyone who is eligible 
for WFTC, there will be hardship and major disincentives 
to work.
<P>
We cannot seriously want to tell the parents in a 
low-income family, who have three or four children who 
need to be supported, that they cannot get their children's 
teeth fixed for free, a funeral grant, free school meals or 
any other similar benefit, and tell the members of the 
family who live next door but who are on the dole that 
they can get those benefits. That would send the worst 
message. The problem must be dealt with but, frankly, 
the Government have not explained their intentions I look 
forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Government face a dilemma. We are 
concerned that entitlement will move further up the 
economic scale and that, to cover those costs, people at 
the lower end of the scale will be deprived. DWA and 
family credit have been useful mechanisms for 
passporting benefits, and they involve the idea of claiming 
benefits automatically.
<P>
In its meetings with the Government, the Royal 
Association for Disability and Rehabilitation did not get 
the assurances it was seeking on eye tests and 
prescription. It would be ironic if the Government's 
efforts to ensure that people higher up the income scale 
received the WFTC meant that those at the lower end 
were deprived. The Government made a great play of 
saying that people would be better off, but if they made 
some people better off by taking away free prescriptions 
and eye tests from those at the lower end of the scale, 
those people would be worse off. The Minister talked at 
length earlier about the £1.5 billion figure. Will some of 
that sum be used for the passported benefits?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The new Clause would continue to 
passport tax credit recipients and entitle them to free 
prescriptions. It would ensure that recipients of tax credits 
continue to be entitled to free prescriptions, in the way 
that recipients of family credit and DWA are currently 
entitled to them. The hon. Members for Northavon and 
for Brentwood and Ongar rightly said that this matter 
involves the question of passporting, which I said we 
would discuss.
<P>
The Department of Health is responsible for the low 
income scheme that provides help with, for example, free 
prescriptions and eye tests. The Government made it clear 
that we will ensure that the help that is provided by the 
NHS low income scheme will continue to go to those who 
need it most. I assure the Committee that that is our 
intention.
<P>
However, it would be inappropriate for legislation 
governing tax credits, for which the Inland Revenue is
responsible, to prescribe policy for which the Department 
of Health is responsible. It is particularly inappropriate to 
lock Department of Health Ministers into a policy through 
primary legislation, when the details of the current policy 
on the low income scheme are determined by secondary 
legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Is the Financial Secretary giving a 
commitment on passporting or not?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am saying clearly, and I shall repeat it 
because it is important, that the Department of Health is 
responsible for the low income scheme. The Government 
have made it clear that the help given under the NHS low 
income scheme continues to go to those who need it most.
<P>
We are dealing with Treasury legislation governing tax 
credits for which the Inland Revenue is responsible, and 
it would be inappropriate to lock Department of Health 
Ministers into a policy through primary legislation, when 
the details of current policy on the low income scheme 
are determined by secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> On the Financial Secretary's point about 
it being inappropriate to lock other Ministries in, one of 
the few positive things about family credit, which few 
people have criticised as much as I have, was that it 
brought the range of benefits from many different 
Departments even the Department for Education and 
Employment, with free school meals and the rest under 
a single umbrella, so that they could be seen as a whole. 
Part of the Financial Secretary's manifesto was that the 
Government would look at the benefit system coherently 
as a whole. The statement that she has just made about 
this being the wrong place to do it illustrates that the Bill 
is fragmenting the benefit system, making it even more 
difficult to make it work coherently.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I hope that the Committee will forgive 
me for returning to this point. I understand what the hon. 
Gentleman is saying, but it comes back to the fundamental 
difference between Government Members and Opposition 
Members. We are talking here about a Treasury Bill that 
deals with tax credits.
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for Northavon to think again 
about the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I must finish now. If the hon. 
Member for Northavon is determined to press the new 
clause to a vote, I shall urge my hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I had hoped to intervene during the 
Financial Secretary's speech rather than make a separate 
speech. Outside bodies who have been listening to her, 
particularly the Child Poverty Action Group, will know 
that she is using weasel words that have not confirmed 
one way or the other whether the benefit is being 
passported. Can the Financial Secretary give an indication 
of the genuineness of her statement by saying whether the 
Government have included in the accounts a figure for 
the cost of passporting the benefits, as I requested under 
clause 15?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am more happy to give way to the 
Financial Secretary is she wishes to respond to that point.
<P>
I am puzzled by the response that we have had. My 
understanding is that at present family credit is a passport 
to free prescriptions, but working families tax credit will 
not be a passport; the low income scheme, which applies 
to people with low incomes whether they are on benefits 
or not, will be the mechanism used to deliver passported 
benefits only to low-income recipients. If that is correct, 
take-up issues arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The concern is not just about working 
families tax credit, but about the disabled person's tax 
credit. The Government are even reluctant to give an 
assurance on that. I can understand the problems with 
regard to working families tax credit, but to hold the line 
on the disabled person's tax credit seems a little strange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The hon. Gentleman's intervention was 
well made. The issue of free prescriptions will be 
particularly acute for disabled person's tax credit 
recipients.
<P>
I have a nasty feeling that, because the Government 
have got themselves into a mess by extending the credit 
so far up the income scale, they will now mess up free 
prescriptions for low-paid people and create further 
bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> So that I am clear, are we not also 
talking about free school meals? I would be concerned 
about that, as I receive many letters on the subject in my 
post bag. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would 
explain that difference in his new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> When family credit was introduced in 1988 
to replace family income supplement, free school meal 
entitlement was removed and family credit a cash 
payment put in its place.
<P>
The inadequacy of the response would in other 
circumstances lead me to persist with the new clause. 
Given the pressure on the Committee, however, I shall 
table some written parliamentary questions in the hope of 
getting some straight answers, which we have not had this 
morning. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 
13, leave out lines 18 and 19.
<P>
I seek an explanation from the Financial Secretary. 
With regard to transfer of functions, paragraph 9 of 
Schedule 2 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any subordinate legislation made under any of the provisions 
mentioned in Part I of this Schedule or this Part."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is unfair for readers of legislation to have to research 
such provisions. They should be set out in schedules to 
the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am always happy to help the Committee 
if I can. This is a catch-all provision ensuring that if 
provisions in subordinate legislation confer a function, 
those functions will be transferred to the board. It will 
cover situations where the regulations specify that 
decisions are to be resolved by the Secretary of State. 
Without that provision, such functions in so far as they 
related to the tax credit would remain with the Secretary 
of State. Clearly, that is undesirable, and I hope that the 
hon. Gentleman will be satisfied and will withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I find that baffling. Do the Government not 
know what the provisions are?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> By its very nature, it is a catch-all 
provision. Some provisions may have to be dealt with in 
such a way. I am slightly surprised by the hon. 
Gentleman, who I understand is very familiar with the Bill 
from close reading. He will know that such a provision is 
very common.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am worried by this point as it demonstrates 
the problem of the proliferation of secondary legislation. 
People in this country are assumed to be fully cognisant 
of all the laws that they are expected to obey. The 
Government, however, say that they are not cognisant of 
the laws that apply in this case. It is unacceptable for the 
Government to introduce Bills with the provision that any 
other piece of legislation which they cannot find at the 
moment, but which may exist somewhere will also 
transfer. Every subject of this country is expected to know 
the laws and obey them. That may be a legal fiction, but 
the Financial Secretary has demonstrated that our 
secondary legislation any practitioner outside this House 
will agree has become so complicated that even the 
Government cannot set out in a schedule to a Bill the 
provisions of secondary legislation to which it applies. 
That is a disgrace.
<P>
In view of the pressure of time, however, I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 2 agreed to.
<P>
Schedules 3 to 6 agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the 
Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> May I take this opportunity, Mrs. Roe, on 
behalf of the Government, and indeed the whole 
Committee, to thank you and your co-Chairman,
Mrs. Dunwoody, for the courteous and firm way in which 
you have conducted our proceedings?
<P>
All members of the Committee will agree that this is 
an important Bill, and hon. Members have made their 
contributions with clarity and vigour. The debate has been 
conducted in an open and courteous way, which has 
occasioned some hilarity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> May I associate myself with the Financial 
Secretary's words? Our deliberations began a few weeks 
ago and we have gently ambled through the fictional 
county of Barchester, through Ambridge and 
"Shakespeare in Love"	, touching briefly on hymns ancient 
and modern, all to the gentle, lilting tune of "Edelweiss"	.
<P>
The fact that we have not been here for weeks is a great 
tribute to you, Mrs. Roe, and your co-Chairman, Mrs. 
Dunwoody, who had occasion to tick hon. Members off 
for being too flowery in their praise of those in the Chair. 
One of the joys of being a Member of Parliament is that, 
when we see a friend in the Chair, we can heap praise on 
them, beyond the point of embarrassment. It is great to 
see a mate squirm.
<P>
We have had a good-natured debate on an important 
Bill. The Opposition have done their best to table 
amendments to improve it. To our regret, with the 
exception of a single amendment, the Government have 
not seen fit to respond.
