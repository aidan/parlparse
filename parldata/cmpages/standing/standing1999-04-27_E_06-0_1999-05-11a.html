</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 12, line 37, after ``Commission'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and employees, of any body established and maintained by the Commission,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that the highest ethical standards will apply to any lawyer employed in whatever circumstances as a salaried defender. Clause 16, which provides for a code of conduct for salaried defenders, was introduced by a Government amendment in the House of Lords. There will be consultation with professional regulatory bodies about how salaried defenders will operate, and it is likely that the pilot schemes following that consultation will consider not only what services are to be provided and by whom, but how they will be organised and established.
<P>
The Legal Services Commission may wish to consider the provision of services by directly employed lawyers and by not-for-profit bodies established and maintained for the purpose of employing salaried defenders. Under the clause as drafted, the code will not apply to salaried defenders in the second situation. Amendment No. 31 will ensure that the ethical code will apply in both situations.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 13, line 1, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The code shall include also a duty to observe the rules, principles and professional standards of the employee's professional body.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 142, in page 13, line 4, leave out from `shall' to end of line 5 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`consult the Law Society and the General Council of the Bar and such other bodies or persons as it considers appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The amendments are probing amendments and, in the light of the Minister's explanation of Government amendment No. 31, I hope that he will be able to reassure us that our concerns revealed in amendments Nos. 141 and 142 have already been taken into account. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's reassurance, after which I shall withdraw our amendment at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I hope that I can do more for the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) than he requests. Not all employees will be solicitors or barristers. Some will be legal executives employed, for example, to give advice and assistance at a police station as private solicitor firms use them now, subject of course to training, quality assurance and professional safeguards.
<P>
Members of professional bodies, whether solicitors, barristers or legal executives, will be expected to observe the rules and professional standards of their appropriate professional bodies. Amendment No. 141 would require that to be stated as the employee's duty in the salaried defenders code. Although that is strictly unnecessary, as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough conceded, I am sympathetic to the amendment's underlying intention. Some employees, however, may not belong to a relevant professional body so, as drafted, amendment No. 141, is too wide. I am prepared, however, to introduce an alternative proposal on Report if that would satisfy Opposition Members.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 would require the commission to consult the Law Society, and General Council of the Bar and other bodies before preparing or revising the code. It is inconceivable that the commission would not include the Law Society and the General Council of the Bar in its consultations. Given that the amendment states the intended position, I am willing to accept it although, again, it is strictly unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the light of the Minister's remarks that he will introduce a Government amendment on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us be clear. The Minister is happy to accept amendment No. 142.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon indicated assent.</B><P>

Clause 16, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Terms of Provision of Funded Services</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B>  I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 13, line 19, leave out `the Crown Court' and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any court other than a magistrate's court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendments Nos. 33 and 34.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments make technical changes to ensure that clause 17 delivers the Government's intended policy. The clause provides that a judge may order a defendant to pay some or all of the costs of representation funded for him as part of the Criminal Defence Service. That power will replace the existing system, which means-tests every applicant for criminal legal aid at the start of a case.
<P>
Means testing is a complex and costly business. Under the present criminal legal aid system, many cases are substantially delayed while defendants provide documentary proof of income and expenses or receipt of certain benefits. Fewer than 1 per cent. of applicants are refused criminal legal aid because they have sufficient means to pay for their own defence. Another 5 per cent. are required to pay a contribution either a lump sum are a weekly amount paid for the duration of the case which is often reimbursed if the individual is subsequently acquitted. The total value of contributions collected is barely enough to pay for the direct costs of running the system, let alone the indirect costs of the delay caused to the progress of cases.
<P>
The new scheme will not delay proceedings and will be better targeted. It is absurd to waste taxpayers' money on a system in which the sums recovered are less than the costs of recovering them. For that reason, orders will be made only if the costs of the representation to be recovered are high enough to justify the cost of the scrutiny of defendants' assets by a special investigation unit. That is why orders will not be available for cases that do not proceed beyond the magistrates courts.
<P>
The Government intend that all courts other than magistrates courts should have a duty to consider, at the end of a case, whether a defendant should pay his defence costs. That will be done by a recovery of defence costs order. Someone who has been acquitted and who funded his representation by private means will generally be entitled to recover his costs from the public purse. A publicly funded wealthy defendant would be put in the same position on acquittal; he would therefore not generally be ordered to pay for his defence. As a result of evidence given during a trial, it may be apparent to the judge that the defendant has substantial assets. In those circumstances, and after hearing representations from the defence, the court could make a recovery of defence costs order. In other cases, it may be appropriate for an investigation to be conducted into a defendants' means by a special investigation unit.
<P>
As drafted, the Bill restricts to the Crown court the power to make a recovery of defence costs order, and the scope of an order to representation in the Crown court. Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 ensure that the Court of Appeal can also make such orders. Amendment No. 34 will allow the order to cover the costs of all representation, including representation in magistrates courts.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 33, in page 13, line 20, leave out `trial judge' and insert `court'.
<P>
No. 34, in page 13, leave out line 22 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any representation so funded for him (in proceedings in that or any other court).' [Mr. Hoon.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 13, line 31, leave out from `furnishing' to second `to' in line 32 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of information and evidence to the court or the Commission for the purpose of enabling the court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 36.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments are about the information necessary to allow the court to make a recovery of defence costs order under clause 17. As I said a few moments ago, the evidence given during the trial may lead a judge to believe that the defendant has substantial assets. In other cases, however, it will be appropriate for an investigation to be conducted into a defendant's means by a special investigation unit. In exceptional circumstances, it may be appropriate to prevent a defendant from disposing of substantial assets during an investigation, perhaps to avoid an order being made. Amendment No. 36 would give judges that power.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 36, in page 13, line 34, at end insert

<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Clause 19 carries over provisions from the Legal Aid Act 1988. It restricts the Legal Services Commission to funding under the Community Legal Service or Criminal Defence Service only those services relating to matters of domestic law. However, the Lord Chancellor may order the commission to fund services when it is necessary to do so in order to fulfil the United Kingdom's international obligations. For example, the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders agreement obliges us to provide legal aid for the enforcement in this country of child maintenance orders made in foreign courts under foreign law.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I should like to ask the Solicitor-General or the Minister a brief question about the clause. Will the same strict rules of legal professional privilege and client confidentiality apply to the commission, the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service as currently apply to lawyers in private practice? Clause 22(1)(a) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the relationship between that individual and the person by whom they are provided or any privilege arising out of that relationship''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will not be affected. How will clause 20 be construed in the light of that? I take it that that deals with my anxiety, and may, to some extent, answer my question, but I should be grateful if the Minister or the Solicitor-General would reassure me. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I can give that assurance. Under subsection (4), disclosure requires the individual's consent. That is the normal rule of confidentiality, which can be waived by the person in whose interest the confidentiality operates. In addition, subsection (7) exempts lawyers from the clause.
<P>
The clause largely repeats the provisions in section 38 of the Legal Aid Act 1988, but with several differences. First, subsection 2(d) goes further in allowing the disclosure of information when the information may be of use in the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offence, whether under the law of England and Wales or of any other jurisdiction. The provision in the Legal Aid Act 1988 limits disclosure to investigation or institution of proceedings for offences made under the 1988 Act only. That gives rise to a rather absurd situation. If the information furnished to the board in furtherance of an application for legal aid clearly shows evidence of a criminal offence that is not covered by the 1988 Act, the board may not divulge that information on pain of a fine. For example, evidence provided on an applicant's means may suggest that a fraud is being perpetrated on the Department of Social Security or on a local authority in relation to, for example, housing benefit. It seems only right that, in such circumstances, the commission or any person or body with that information as a result of functions conferred on them under the Bill should be allowed to divulge that information. However, the paragraph contains an important qualification. Information may be disclosed only if regulations do not otherwise proscribe disclosure. In some circumstances, there may be genuine anxieties about disclosing information. For example, it may not be appropriate for information in an application for support to be disclosed to the prosecuting authority to assist in developing the charge for which defence services are being provided. Other circumstances may become clear over time. It seems right that, although the general presumption should favour disclosure, there must be a power to limit it in the light of circumstance and experience.
<P>
Secondly, subsection 3(b) puts it beyond doubt that information about how public money has been spent, whether by grant, loan or other payment, may be disclosed. I do not believe that the present provisions in section 38 of the 1988 Act prevent that, but the subsection puts it beyond doubt.
<P>
Thirdly, the new provisions require the consent of the Director or Public Prosecutions to prosecution for an offence under the clause. The Director is a more appropriate person to give consent in such circumstances.
<P>
Finally, subsection (7) makes it clear that information given by a client to his lawyer will not be subject to the provisions of clause 20, as I pointed out in reply to the honourable and learned Member for Harborough. Therefore, any disclosure could not render the lawyer liable to prosecution under subsection (5). That information remains subject to privilege, and clause 22(1), to which the honourable and learned Gentleman referred, will ensure that the privilege is not affected by a client's being in receipt of funded services.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Misrepresentation etc</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does clause 21 mean that a lay client who tells a lie to his state-funded lawyer commits an offence under subsection (1) or is liable in damages under subsection (5)? I hope that Minister or the Solicitor-General will be able to answer that simple question.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The clause carries over provisions from the Legal Aid Act 1988, and creates no new powers compared with the existing provisions. In the situation that the honourable and learned Gentleman has posited, I would have thought that such people would be guilty of an offence, in the sense that they are intentionally bound to comply with any requirement imposed by virtue of the legislation.
<P>
10.45 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am interested in the Solicitor-General's answer. I am not an expert in legal aid matters as my practice is entirely privately funded. However, as he and I know from our days in practice, from time to time clients do not tell their lawyers the complete and unvarnished truth. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Good heavens!
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> That comes as a surprise to my hon. Friend, an experienced solicitor.
<P>
We need to be a little clearer on the subject. An instructed lawyer, funded by the commission or the Criminal Defence Service, may have to give evidence against his lay client in civil proceedings under clause 21(5) or criminal proceedings under clause 21(1). That is not necessarily wrong in principle, but we need clarification of what the clause is intended to do so that lawyers in private practice instructed by the CDS may know in advance what they may have to contend with if one of their clients tells them a lie.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Let me reflect on the subject and write to the honourable and learned Gentleman. At first blush, I would have thought that the provision will catch a client who makes a false representation relevant to the provision of legal services, but will not catch a client who tells a lawyer a false story about a specific incident.
<P>
In other words, the provision will be confined to the likes of means and merits tests, which are matters required, as subsection 1(b) says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by virtue of this Part''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his offer to write to me. My question, asked out of a sense of genuine inquiry, has revealed a problem to which he and the Minister may not have given the attention that it deserves. I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General would respond in a letter in reasonably quick time, as we expect the Bill to be on Report within the next fortnight, and it would be a pity if we were unsighted at that stage.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I have responded to several members of the Committee fairly quickly, and I shall do so in this case as well.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and any authorised by the Commission to be taken.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 144, in page 16, line 6, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`save such expenses or fees incurred in
<P>
(a) preparing, obtaining or considering any report, opinion or further evidence, whether provided by an expert witness or otherwise; or
<P>
(b) obtaining transcript of shorthand notes or audio or video tape recordings of any proceedings, including police questioning of suspects;
<P>
where an application for such funding has been refused by the Legal Services Commission.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendment No. 15 corrects an omission in the Bill as drafted. Clause 22(2) states that people providing services funded by the commission cannot take any payment for them, other than that made by the commission. That carries over from section 31(3) of the Legal Aid Act 1988 the existing prohibition on topping up that is, seeking to supplement legal aid rates by charging the client an additional sum. The Legal Aid Act 1988 allows for exceptions to be made by regulation. Amendment No. 15 will enable the commission to authorise exceptions to the general prohibition, which it will do as a term in a contract. The different approach reflects the different natures of the old and new schemes.
<P>
The commission will be actively responsible for deciding how best to purchase services in different circumstances, whereas the board's role is to administer a scheme fixed by regulation. The power to make exceptions is necessary, for example, to allow for limited litigation support funding for a case that is otherwise being funded privately. The Legal Aid Board proposed that option in the draft funding code that it published in January.
<P>
Under amendment No. 144, the rule against topping up would be disapplied in relation to the costs of reports, transcripts and so on, if the commission decided not to fund those costs itself. In some circumstances, contract prices are likely to be set to cover such costs; in others, they will be outside the main contract price, and funded separately after the commission has authorised the expenditure. In amendment No. 144, it is assumed that the latter circumstances only will apply.
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be that, if the commission refused to authorise that expenditure no doubt, because it considered it unnecessary or inappropriate the lawyer could charge the cost to the assisted client. That seems to be an extraordinary proposition, and it is wholly unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> When the Minister uses terms such as ``wholly unacceptable'', I am reminded of the Lord Chancellor's response to a question asked by the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson of Lymington ``It is not a good way to enter a debate, let alone to leave it.''
<P>
I invite the Minister to reflect on amendment No. 144, because there are many perfectly acceptable reasons why a client may be advised that he requires additional evidence or expert attention to progress his case. There may be a perfectly genuine difference of opinion about the worth or otherwise, or the use or otherwise, of obtaining such additional advice between the instructed solicitor and the Community Legal Service or the Criminal Defence Service. However, if the CDS says, ``We don't think it is necessary'', that will be the end of the matter, and the lay client will go without the opinion, other evidence, transcript or other recordings.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is important that the honourable and learned Gentleman grasps the new circumstances that the proposal is meant to deal with. It is meant to deal with the circumstances in which prices for work are set by contract. The contracts will state whether or not a particular report should be covered. That is already dealt with in the arrangements. We are not dealing with the current scheme, which includes topping up for such matters. It will be a contracted system in which many of those provisions will already be incorporated into the cost of the contracts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It is good of the Minister to help me out. He has shown one of the major problems with the Bill. I shall use one of my dear old expressions again. Which expression does he prefer ``Christmas tree'' or ``coat-hanger'', both of which are relevant? If the Government insist on drafting the Bill in that way, event obtuse lawyers such as myself will, from time to time, have to ask the Minister to explain it more precisely.
<P>
I do not accuse the Minister of being ill-motivated; I merely accuse him of lack of clarity. It is a pity that every time I have to ask him a question, because the Bill is not clear, he has to answer it. I am always delighted to hear the Minister speak he speaks so well and to hear the angelic way in which he responds to my obtuse questions.
<P>
I ask the Minister to provide the profession and the public with greater clarification of the Government's intentions under the clause. Can he reassure them that the contract system will enable lay clients to have the fully range of legal services that their legal advisers consider appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall try to respond to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, who has not entirely grasped the changes that the Government propose. There is an important principle involved in contracted work. I am talking not about coat-hangers or Christmas trees, but the principle of swings and roundabouts.
<P>
With regard to contracted work, the assumption is that less than the average amount of work might be required in some cases, whereas in others, lawyers might be expected to do a little more. The new system will mean that they will be unable to charge the client or the Legal Aid Board for the extra work, as they can do under the present arrangements. By the operation of swings and roundabouts across a contract, clients will be properly protected.
<P>
It is important for the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to grasp that basic change in provision. I recognise that he has practised as a lawyer for many years, and changes in culture and approach are difficult for him. This is a fundamental change. If it is understood by the hon. and learned Gentleman, he will have no difficulty with the remainder of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am deeply grateful to the Minister. I should like to say that I am reassured, but what I have divined is that his Government want a rough-and-ready approach to justice, whereas I want something rather akin to needlepoint. I understand how the arithmetic be it rough or ready in the room is stacked up against me, so I shall not waste the Committee's time by seeking further elucidation from the charming Minister.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 94, in page 16, line 18, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
Government amendment No. 94 is a drafting amendment, which is intended simply to shorten the Bill by eight lines. Clause 22(5) carries over into the Bill section 31(2) of the Legal Aid Act 1988, which is a provision that has appeared in legal aid legislation, in more or less this form, since 1949.
<P>
The purpose of the provision is to put it beyond doubt that a successful legally aided litigant can recover his or her costs from the other party to the case. It seeks to prevent any argument that the assisted person is not entitled to costs under the so-called indemnity principle, on the ground that the litigant was not personally liable for his or her own lawyers' costs because the action was funded ``maintained'' is the technical term by legal aid.
<P>
As I have said, the provision dates originally from 1949. Since then, legal aid has become a firmly established part of the legal system, and several other forms of funding which override the strict indemnity principle have developed. Indeed, amendments to abolish the principle altogether have been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and by Opposition Members. The Government have tabled their own amendment to allow rules of court to override the principle, so it is now inconceivable that any court would seriously entertain the argument that a legally assisted litigant was not entitled to costs under these ancient common law rules
<P>
Even if that were in doubt, clause 22(5) is unnecessary. Clause 12(2) contains a broad power to make regulations about costs in cases involving people funded by the Community Legal Service, and subsection (3)(e) specifies that these may include regulations about the principles for determining the amount to be awarded to such a person. Clause 22(5) does not apply to criminal cases in any event. Costs in such cases are governed by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, to which schedule 4 of the Bill makes consequential amendments.
<P>
On the basis of that explanation, I commend amendment No. 94 to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 22, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Guidance</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The Lord Chancellor cannot give guidance in relation to individual cases. That preserves the current position that Ministers do not intervene in the administration of legal aid in individual cases. The guidance must be published by the Lord Chancellor, or by the commission if required to do so by him.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am bemused, not least by the fact that the Government have removed eight lines from the previous clause, to make the Bill clearer, while clause 23 is unbelievably vague. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Lord Chancellor may give guidance to the Commission as to the manner in which he considers it should discharge its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Surprise, surprise, it then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall take into account any such guidance when considering the manner in which to discharge its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What will the guidance say? When will it be published? Will it be in the form of a long book, or will it consist of one side of a piece of paper, delivered to the Minister for further deliverance to other interested parties? Even at this stage of our proceedings, I ask the Solicitor-General to give us a little more information about what is encompassed within the term ``guidance''. Guidance from the Lord Chancellor is a matter in which the public have an interest, and I invite the Solicitor-General to be a little more open and allow us to know what is behind the Lord Chancellor's robes.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I find the hon. and learned Gentleman's inquiry rather surprising. Ministers often give guidance to bodies that operate under their general auspices; the Bill provides for that guidance to be published. I should have thought that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough would welcome that. Quangos have been criticised in the past for being unaccountable, with the public not knowing about the directions that have been given to those quangos. The Bill provides that any guidance that is given will be published. In reply to the hon. and learned Gentleman's specific question, that guidance will be published expeditiously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I can read the Bill, but does the Solicitor-General have an inkling of what is likely to be found in the guidance when it is published? I know that it will be published, but perhaps the Solicitor-General can give us a clue about what he expects to find.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> We have already considered the nature of the Legal Services Commission and have discussed the general issue of how the Government are trying to move towards a more user and consumer perspective. Some members of the Commission may not appreciate the changes, although I imagine that most of them will. If they do not, the Lord Chancellor may have to issue guidance. I should think that it will be exceptional for guidance to have to be given, but it could happen for exceptional funding under clause 7(8), for example. I remember debating that subsection when you were in the Chair, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Guidance may also be given on the assessment of local and regional need, and the operation of the regional legal services committee, which is an important aspect of the Bill. Those are the sort of matters in which guidance might be given. I can also concede that the guidance will be published annually.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 96 to 111 and Government amendments Nos. 115 to 119.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Government amendments Nos. 95 to 111 and Government amendments Nos. 115 to 119 make amendments and repeals consequential on the replacement of the existing legal aid scheme by the Community Legal Service and Criminal Defence Service. They supplement or correct the consequential amendments already set out in schedule 4. Most of these amendments are to change references in other Acts to legal aid to references to one or both of the two new services.
<P>
It is also necessary to change references to criminal legal aid contributions, which clause 17 replaces by a power for the judge to order defendants to repay some or all of the costs of their representation.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 97 and 106 amend the Solicitors Act 1974 and the Administration of Justice Act 1985, which provide for professional disciplinary tribunals to exclude solicitors and barristers from undertaking legal aid work. That sanction is predicated on the fact that at present all lawyers have a right to take legal aid cases and submit their bill for legal aid payment. In future, however, the Legal Services Commission will generally decide who it will contract with or otherwise engage to provide services. The exception is representation in criminal cases, which under clause 15(7) will continue to be based on the defendant's right to choose a representative, subject to any limitations made by regulations under clause 15(8). To reflect that, amendments Nos. 97 and 106 amend the disciplinary sanctions to refer only to representation as part of the Criminal Defence Service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I have no complaint about the amendments as such. I merely wish to ask why the amendments were not already in the Bill on Second Reading on 14 December in the other place, or has something subsequently occurred to make the amendments necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> In the process of drafting a complex Bill, minor references to other legislation are inevitably sometimes overlooked in the immediacy of dealing with the principles. The amendments make consequential and technical changes and, as is often the case, have been brought before the Committee at an appropriate stage for consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I have been overwhelmed by the Minister's candour and by the admission that this great Government can overlook something one might even say look down on something, but I shall not follow that route.

<H4><center>Orders, Regulations and Directions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 17, line 6, after `funds', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The principle of fair and reasonable remuneration'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This short amendment matches the words in the legal aid legislation prior to 1988. The clause ensures that before making a remuneration order relating to the remuneration of solicitors and barristers, the Lord Chancellor should consult with the general council of the Bar and the Law Society. It further provides that the Lord Chancellor should have regard to several matters: first, the need to secure the provision of services; secondly, the cost of providing those services; and thirdly, the need to secure value for money. Those are all-important criteria, but are only one side of the equation. If the Government wish to ensure the success of the Bill, they should provide a principle of fair  and reasonable remuneration. Remuneration set by regulations as opposed to prices negotiated with the Legal Services Commission will continue to apply for many years while contracting develops. I hope that the Minister concedes that in determining remuneration, the Lord Chancellor should have regard to the principle of fair and reasonable remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I cannot accept the amendment. The Bill sets out several factors that would be taken into account in securing a sufficient number of competent practitioners to deliver the services required. The inescapable facts are that whatever rates are set must be affordable to the public purse, and the Lord Chancellor, in common with the commission, should secure value for money. As has been said before in Committee, value for money does not involve only price, but the optimum achievable combination of quality and price.
<P>
The second reason that I cannot accept the amendment is its imprecision. How can the hon. Gentleman demonstrate what is fair and adequate remuneration? In securing services, it is strange that the commission should be forced to act in ways that may not deliver value for money or that it should be under constraints to prevent it from requiring its suppliers to offer the right services at the right price.
<P>
The three criteria set out in the clause provide a sufficiently comprehensive scheme within which remuneration orders will be considered before they are made. I do not believe that anything would be added by the amendment. Indeed, it would lead to endless arguments because it would make the provision imprecise and subjective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Solicitor-General said that part of the need to secure value for money implies that the person or persons doing the work should be paid fair and reasonable remuneration in the circumstances. If my understanding of his argument is correct, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman find it a little strange that the Solicitor-General attacked the amendment on the basis of its being imprecise? The problem with the whole Bill is that it is imprecise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to  the hon. and learned Gentleman. We are back again to Christmas trees. I agree that the coathanger system under the Bill is very much to be regretted. Nevertheless, the Solicitor-General has given us some comfort. He said that the principle of fair and reasonable remuneration should form part of the equation of obtaining value for money.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I did not exactly say that. I said that the Lord Chancellor is obliged to consider value for money and that that involves not only price, but quality. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) referred to the fact that the clause obliges the Lord Chancellor to consult the professional bodies before an order is made. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's aim could be attained by such consultations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General and, in the light of his last few words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There is at present an inconsistency between Scotland, England and Wales regarding the treatment of certain categories of proceedings for the purposes of legal aid. For example, mental health proceedings in England and Wales can be exempted from the financial eligibility and contributions tests in relation to assistance by way of representation, but at present in Scotland, they cannot be so exempted. The difference arises entirely from the legislative position in Scotland.
<P>
The clause amends the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 to enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to disapply the financial eligibility and contributions test for assistance by way of representation in respect of certain proceedings. It will bring the position in Scotland in line with that in England and Wales.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 27 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Recipients of Disability Working Allowance</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 28 deals with a similar inconsistency between Scotland, England and Wales and concerns the treatment of disability working allowance recipients who apply for advice and assistance.
<P>
Under the provisions of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, advice and assistance is available to disability working allowance recipients provided financial and contribution criteria are met. In England and Wales, advice and assistance is available free to disability working allowance recipients. There is no reason for that anomaly, and the clause is designed to ensure that the arrangements in Scotland are the same as those in England and Wales.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 29</center></H4>
<H4><center>Conditional Fee Agreements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 18, line 33, leave out `enhanced' and insert `success'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 146, in page 19, line 4, leave out `enhanced' and insert `success'.
<P>
No. 147, in page 19, line 39, leave out `enhanced' and insert `success'.

No. 149, in page 20, line 13, leave out `enhanced' and insert `success'.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The amendments are simple. Clause 29 proposes a new section 58 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Proposed section 58(2)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a conditional fee agreement provides for enhanced fees if it provides for the amount of any fees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We wish to  substitute the word ``success'' for the word ``enhanced'' in paragraph (b) and in other similar provisions in that section, on the ground that success is a clearer and more obvious word than enhanced.
<P>
Enhanced is a rather pompous word. [Interruption.] I did not hear what the Minister said but, knowing the origins of the Bill, I am not surprised that such a pompous word should have been chosen by the Government. If the Minister can persuade me that he finds the word enhanced more user-friendly, so be it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am not going to try. I have some sympathy with the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. The phrase ``success fee'' will be clear to all. Subject to the view of parly counsel on the effect of such a change, I am minded to table amendments on Report consistent with the hon. and learned Gentleman's purpose. I therefore hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I can hardly get to my feet; I am beginning to get rather light-headed. It is the second time this morning that the Government have agreed to Opposition amendments. I shall sit down before my luck runs out. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 19, line 14, at end insert `and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the amount of the increase must not be calculated (expressly or otherwise) by reference to the amount or value of any money, property or other benefit recovered or preserved in the proceedings.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to add another paragraph to proposed section 58(4) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Under that section, which provides for what I hope will soon by called success fees, further conditions will be applicable to conditional fee agreements. One of the further conditions to conditional fee agreements, stated in paragraph (c), is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that percentage must not exceed the percentage specified in relation to the description of proceedings to which the agreement relates by order made by the Lord Chancellor.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We wish to add another paragraph stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the amount of the increase must not be calculated (expressly or otherwise) by reference to the amount or value of any money, property or other benefit recovered or preserved in the proceedings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I respectfully suggest that the amendment is self-explanatory. If the Government disagree with it, I should be grateful to know why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government disagree with it because it is unnecessary, but I shall explain in greater detail. A similar amendment was moved by Lord Kingsland in another place and, after debate, he withdrew it.
<P>
Amendment No. 133 seeks to include a new paragraph (d) in the proposed new section 58(4) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which is set out in clause 29. The amendment would make it a requirement of conditional fee arrangements that provide for enhanced fees that the sum of those enhanced fees must not be calculated.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by reference to the amount or value of any money, property or other benefit recovered or preserved in the proceedings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should probably explain that the revised section 58 of the 1990 Act seeks to bring the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Thai Trading v. Taylor into statute law. The Thai Trading case does not sanction conditional fee arrangements prescribing a costs uplift in the event of success. It sanctions solicitors agreeing with their clients to recover less than their normal fee if they lose and in theory therefore they could recover nothing but to recover the full costs from the unsuccessful defendant if they win, despite the agreement for a reduction with their own clients.
<P>
It was not this legislation's intention to make unlawful other kinds of fee agreements that solicitors presently use as sanctioned by the Solicitors Act 1974. However, following representations to the Lord Chancellor's Department by the Law Society and the Bar, we have considered the precise effect of the wording of section 58 as proposed. There are several amendments tabled in my name that will make some small changes, but I suspect that it is likely that we may revisit the wording on Report.
<P>
The proposed section 58(4), in which the additional words of amendment No. 133 would be inserted, does no more than provide the conditions that are applicable to a conditional fee arrangement that provides for enhanced fees. That is a fee increased by a specified percentage in the event of success.
<P>
I do not see anything in the provisions or elsewhere in the proposed new section that would legitimate the use of contingency fees. Calculation of the sum payable in the event of the specified circumstances occurring will always be by reference to the fees of the lawyer and not to the award of the court. Consequently, the position envisaged in the amendment cannot arise. For that reason, I believe that the amendment is unnecessary and one that the Government cannot accept. I therefore ask the hon.  and learned Member for Harborough to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I hope that I heard the Minister correctly when he said that the Government intended to introduce certain amendments on Report to deal with clause 29. In the light of that, they may be open to further suggestions in relation to clause 29 as a whole. Today is an Opposition day, and I feel sure that whenever we get to Report, which I suggested might be shortly (Interruption.) the Minister looked rather askance at that, but whenever it comes, quite a lot of thought will have to go into clause 29. We will be prepared to deal quite briefly with the clause today on the basis that it will be thoroughly revisited by Government draftsmen and policy makers between now and Report.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would suggest that the proposed amendments are available for consideration. I obviously cannot ask him to accept amendments to amendments that he has yet to table,  but if he would let the public and the Opposition see his proposed amendments as early as possible, with the biggest gap between their drafting and their being discussed on Report, it would be greatly appreciated, not least because it would lead to more efficient use of time on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon wants to speak, although I am about to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government have considered the introduction of a contingency fee system, or whether they oppose it and it is no part of their plans for the reform of legal aid and the conditional fee system? Do they plan, either now or in the foreseeable future, to introduce an American-style contingency fee system under which costs are, when possible, calculated by reference to the value of any money, property or other benefit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sure that the Minister heard that intervention and will, at the appropriate moment, respond to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall respond to the hon. and learned Gentleman's earlier observations first. He is obviously flushed with success. I should like to make it clear to him that the Government do not accept amendment No. 133. Although they will reconsider clause 29, further amendments will be necessary only in a technical sense. The Government are content that the principal is right, but perhaps some minor amendments need to be made to clarify the legal provision.
<P>
To answer the question of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, the Government have no plans for the introduction of contingency fees. We are confident that the funding provisions in the Bill will be sufficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The Opposition will want to return to the clause on Report, and if the Government do not table acceptable amendments, the Opposition will have to do so to amend the Bill on Report if they can. With that proviso, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 150, in page 19, line 17, after ``proceedings'', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``save as those brought under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is self-explanatory, and I invite the Government to explain why it is not acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendment would allow conditional fee arrangements to be used in bringing criminal prosecutions under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which provides for summary criminal proceedings by someone complaining of a statutory nuisance. Proceedings under section 82 are criminal proceedings. As such, in principle, they would be excluded under the general exemption in section 58(10) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 of criminal proceedings from proceedings in which conditional fees may be used.
<P>
I recognise that part of the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Thai Trading case was to overturn an earlier decision in the case of British Waterways Board v. Norman, which involved a prosecution under section 82. However, the issue for the Committee today is whether, in bringing the entirety of the decision in the Thai Trading case into statute law, we should make provision for the general principle that conditional fees, with or without enhanced fees, may not be used in criminal proceedings.
<P>
Much anxiety has been expressed in the Committee, most notably by Opposition Members, that the scope and operation of conditional fee arrangements should be restricted. For that reason, having given the matter careful thought, the Government have concluded that at this stage it would not be right to breach the general principle that conditional fees are not appropriate in criminal proceedings.
<P>
The amendment proposes a single exception for criminal cases under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. There is nothing unique about that provision. There may well be provisions elsewhere in the criminal law with similar effect under which conditional fees may be a possibility. If we are to consider breaching the general principle, it is important that it is undertaken logically, and not piecemeal. Moreover, it can be undertaken only after careful consideration of the impact of conditional fees, regardless of whether enhanced fees are sought, on the criminal justice process. The Government do not believe that such careful consideration of the issues is possible in the time that the Bill will be before the House. We believe that it would be imprudent, and possibly unjust, to make a single exception of that kind without fuller consideration of all the issues of the principle and practice raised by doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of how the Government understand their Bill, and shall consider what they have to say over the forthcoming days. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Government Amendment No. 191.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This large group of amendments seeks to change clause 29, which provides for the replacement of the existing section 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 with two new sections, 58 and 58A. The new provisions provide, among other things, for making recoverable the enhanced fee or the success fee, depending on the words that we ultimately choose to use, and give statutory effect to two relatively recent judgments relating to conditional fees.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 112 to 114 and 191 deal with issues raised with my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, and separately with my Department during the passage of the Bill in another place. Amendment No. 151 would do substantially the same as Government amendment No. 113. I shall deal with that amendment later. The group also includes amendment Nos. 75 to 78 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon.
<P>
My noble Friend Lord Clinton-Davis tabled similar amendments in the other place. He withdrew them, having fully accepted the explanation given by my noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor about why he could not accept them. Having heard the reasons why we cannot accept the amendments, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon will fell similarly able to withdraw his.
<P>
Government amendment No. 112 is a drafting amendment to ensure that the Vice-Chancellor's decision in the case of Bevan Ashford v. Yeandle is accurately brought into stature. The Vice-Chancellor decided that, when a person uses an alternative dispute resolution forum in a type of proceedings in which conditional fees are lawful and, as long as the form and content of the agreement between the lawyer and the client follow the prescribed requirements for cases brought in the courts, that agreement is lawful notwithstanding that it is not technically a conditional fee agreement. The Government believe that should be more properly reflected within the statutory scheme.
<P>
The amendment responds to concerns raised by the Bar Council and the Law Society that the present provisions of the proposed section 58A(4) go further than the decision in the case of Bevan Ashford and affect other agreements that solicitors may lawfully offer under the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974. A further concern is that the present section 58A(4) deals only with whether an agreement may provide for enhanced fees, or success fees, and not with whether it qualifies as a conditional fee agreement in the first place.
<P>
Government amendment No. 113 responds to an amendment tabled by Lord Kingsland, who sought to ensure that a client could not raise a question whether an agreement was lawful if proceedings had not commenced. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough is seeking by amendment No. 151 to achieve the same outcome. Amendment No. 113 puts beyond doubt that the agreement is lawful and enforceable, whether proceedings have commenced or are only contemplated. I hope that Opposition Members will acknowledge that we have kept our promise to Lord Kingsland. The wording provided by party counsel covers the problem comprehensively and, in the light of that, I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments in favour of those standing in my name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the Minister believe that a client, before entering into a conditional fee arrangement with his or her solicitor, should obtain separate independent legal advice on the CFA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's proposition but, before I can respond to him, he must explain why he considers such a separate representation to be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> There is a conflict of interest between the solicitor and his putative client. As we have discussed before, what is the definition of success? Who will advise the client what constitutes a success, so that the solicitor can obtain his success fee? It could be considerably more than the solicitor said that it would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will the Minister give way before he responds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Being a Minister of limited ability, I can respond only to one question at a time.
<P>
The details are set out in the agreement. There is no need for separate advice or separate independent representation. Conditional fee agreements work perfectly effectively under the current arrangements, but the Government propose a refinement to the operation of CFAs that should avoid what I expect the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon is anxious about that, somehow, unscrupulous lawyers will take advantage of their clients, perhaps because of the level of the success fee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> What is success?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Hear me out. That might be a problem because if someone consults a lawyer for the first and, we hope, the only time, negotiating the level of the uplift will be in the lawyer's hands. If that uplift is higher than strictly necessary, it is not realistic to expect a lay client to be able to challenge the lawyer's judgment. However, the Government propose that the defence should have an interest in the level of the success fee. We propose that the success fee should be paid not out of the client's damages, but by the defence in practice, by an insurance company in most cases.
<P>
In those circumstances, defence lawyers, who will be experienced in dealing with the level of uplifts on success fees, will be able to provide a proper check on the temptation for unscrupulous claimants' lawyers to set the success fee too high; they will know whether it is justified by the risk involved.
<P>
Mr. John M. Taylor rose 
<P>
Mr. Burnett rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I said that I would give way to the hon. Member for Solihull.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am entirely at one with the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. He and I have pursued this path previously. These may not be exactly his words, but it is well known that English law contains concepts of undue influence, perhaps stopping short of duress, and that they can be applied if two parties are mismatched in terms of their acumen and ability. The Minister has responded as though it is our case that lawyers are unscrupulous. All I would wish to say is that there is no equality of acumen between the lawyer and the client. Does not the Minister understand that, in some cases, the client might be properly advised to take a second opinion about what constitutes a win?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is addressing an issue in the context of conditional fees that applies also to any privately paid litigation. The client wants to pay less for the lawyer's services than the lawyer wants to charge. That may be self-evident, but it is part of the way in which most market-based operations work. I would be delighted to consult a lawyer if I could specify how much he or she would charge. Lawyers tend to want to charge as much as the market will stand, which is understandable in a free market. That problem is not unique to conditional fees; it is inherent in the funding of any service provided under an agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Minister addresses only one aspect of my difficulty with conditional fee agreements the amount of the uplift. I should like him to address the value of the case to the client. In other words, the client consults a lawyer who says, ``If I achieve 10,000 for you, that will be success'', but the client should have been told that the case was worth 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or whatever. I should like the Minister to address that conflict of interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That is not an issue in such cases. Clearly, we shall address the ability of the lawyer to prove liability. Lawyers are concerned not with the assessment of damages in a particular case, but with winning the case on behalf of the client.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again on this important point. Many cases are settled before litigation occurs, so if the lawyer states in the conditional fee agreement, ``If I get you 10,000, I get my success fee'', it might be unscrupulous because he should have said, ``If I get you 50,000, I get my success fee''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is worrying unnecessarily. That matter has not been raised by any of those who are critical of the operation of the conditional fee agreements and I am not persuaded that such a problem exists. However, if it does and has not been properly addressed, I undertake to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Is it not the case that success is defined in conditional fee agreements in terms of recovering compensation without the figure being specified? In practice, the potential client shops around from one lawyer to another, asking two questions: ``How much will I get'' and, ``What percentage uplift will you charge me?'' The potential client therefore bases his decision on market factors. In any case, the discussion is somewhat academic because we are considering conditional fees as they are, not as they will be, with the recovery and success fee from the defendant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I think that I said all of that but I am nonetheless grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I agree with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). At the end of a case, the insurance company can challenge the amount of the success fee, uplift or enhancement whichever term we choose and may get a reduction from the judge. How does that help the client who has agreed an amount for the success fee with the lawyer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The system will not operate in that way. That is the problem that I am having with the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon; without wishing to be impolite, I suspect that his understanding of the operation of the scheme is less than perfect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am tempted not to, but I shall.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are in danger of conducting a debate through long interventions and I would much prefer it if hon. Members finished their contributions, so that we can move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Atkinson. You may rest assured that this will be short intervention.
<P>
The Minister is right. As I am happy to admit it is probably apparent I have never practised in contentious matters. However, the hon. Member for Hendon predicated the answer that he gave on behalf of the Minister on the fact that people shop around for solicitors. My question relates to the individual who has not shopped around and who takes the first solicitor he comes to, perhaps because he is in a rural area where there is a choice of only one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman underestimates the enthusiasm of clients to maximise their recovery in a legal case.
<P>
I was dealing with a number of Government amendments and shall continue with them. Amendments Nos. 114 and 191 cure a potential problem on the extent to which the success fee and the insurance premium would be recoverable where the forum in which the dispute is resolved is not subject to rules of court. The point was raised specifically in relation to arbitrations under the Arbitration Act 1950, which make clear that the success fee and insurance premium are recoverable in every case where a conditional fee is used, but in relation to proceedings in a court, recovery is subject to any rules of court that may be made.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 75 to 78 seek a degree of certainty in litigation that is unobtainable in a process that necessarily requires the exercise of discretion in order to achieve just and equitable outcomes. If the amendments were passed, it would lead not only to inflexibility but also to injustice.
<P>
I know that the amendments have been promoted and supported by the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, which argues that clients should have the certainty that they will recover the success fee and the insurance premium if they are successful. It argues also that where defendants successfully defend a claim using a conditional fee, they should not be allowed to recover the success fee because the costs of insurance premiums will increase if there is a possibility of a success fee, as well as normal costs, having to be met under the policy.
<P>
However, the amendments would prescribe not an equitable balance of power, but an inequitable one as between the plaintiffs and defendants in civil litigation. The provision would place claimants using conditional fee agreements in a significantly stronger, and unfair, position in litigation. The clauses seek to place the success fee and the insurance premium in the same position as normal costs: within the discretion of the court, subject to rules of court. No litigant ever goes into litigation in the certainty that he will necessarily recover all his costs even if successful. Although court rules make a general presumption that costs will follow the event, courts always retain the discretion to decide otherwise. For example, that discretion could be exercised if the behaviour of the successful party had been unreasonable or if there had been contributory negligence. For the recovery of the success fee and insurance premium to be equitable, it is important that the courts retain that flexibility. That is why we have provide for the recovery of success fees and insurance premiums to be subject to the rules of court.
<P>
I fully intend to ensure that any rules made under these provisions will continue the principle that costs should follow the event of success, with the strong presumption that they should be allowed. However, I am equally sure that it will be necessary to allow the court to exercise discretion within that general presumption. It cannot be right that the courts should be obliged to award the success fee and insurance premium in full if they otherwise exercise their discretion not to award costs or to award only part of the costs.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot hope to satisfy the hopes of the proponents of the amendments to make recovery of the success fee and insurance premium available only to claimants. It is not fair. It must be remembered that all the provisions of clause 29 apply across all areas of law for which conditional fees are presently allowed, not  only personal injury cases. I could not agree to one party being placed at a significant disadvantage from the outset of litigation by the operation of the costs rules.
<P>
The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers knows the benefit for claimants with conditional fee agreements of the Bill's provisions to enable the uplift and the insurance premium to be recovered. That will ensure the success of CFAs in practice, but the amendments go too far; they would unacceptably alter the balance or power and advantage in litigation against defendants.
<P>
As I intimated at the outset, I hope that, having heard my explanation, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon will not feel it necessary to press his amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I want briefly to speak to amendment No. 151. I shall leave the hon. Member for Hendon to deal with amendments Nos. 76 and 78, although, if he will allow me, I shall trespass briefly on his amendments Nos. 75 and 77.
<P>
I readily admit that amendment No. 151 is covered by Government amendment No. 113. The Minister said that my hon. and learned Friend Lord Kingsland had secured a promise from the Government in the other place. If Government amendment No. 113 is the delivery of that promise, I am content with it; indeed, it encompasses the thrust of our amendment. That takes that matter out of contention, and I am grateful to the Government for their response to my hon. and learned Friend's arguments.
<P>
Before the hon. Member for Hendon rises I have a question for the Minister. Amendments No. 75 and 77 seek to replace ``party'' with ``claimant''. Who other than a claimant is likely to enter into a conditional fee agreement? It seems unlikely that a defendant would enter into a CFA unless he was a counter-claimant, but he would then be covered by the term ``claimant''. I may have fallen into error not for the first time because some defendants may believe that having a CFA may be an advantage in resisting another party's claim. If that is the case, I am sure that the Minister will put me out of my temporary misery.
<P>
I shall leave the hon. Member for Hendon to speak to amendments Nos. 76 and 78, as his experience of assessing costs and so forth is no doubt greater than mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I listened to my hon. Friend the Minister's explanation when he introduced the Government amendments, and there are still one or two points that I want to put to him.
<P>
I shall pick up where the Minister left off on amendments Nos. 75 and 77, which seek to restrict recovery to claimants only. Everyone has welcomed as I do the recovery of success fees and insurance premiums, which will no longer be paid by the clients concerned. That plugs a loophole that at present eats into the damages obtained by victims in personal injury cases, and enables no-win, no fee agreements to be what they purport to be. I believe that such agreements should be restricted to claimants only and should not apply to defendants, certainly in personal injury cases I heard what the Minister said on that point and shall return to it. The Minister said that such a restriction would alter the balance of power, but, in effect, that is what we are doing anyway through some of the changes introduced in the Bill.
<P>
In personal injury cases, it is the claimant's position that will change due to the withdrawal of legal aid in some cases, which will put greater reliance on conditional fees. That will lead to a major windfall for insurance companies in that, at the moment, should they lose a legal aid case, they cannot recover their costs against a legally aided plaintiff I am sorry; I should have said ``claimant'', but am still trying to get to grips with the new terminology. Under the new arrangements they will now certainly be able to recover their standard fund costs. In the old days, it was said that insurers would often buy off that cost risk by a nominal payment to the claimant, but in practice that rarely happened. The extension of compensation recovery unit reforms for social security benefits and, I suspect, the national health service recruitment arrangements now make it no longer financially viable for insurers to buy such cases off.
<P>
If we allow insurers to recover their success fees, I am concerned that we will add to that windfall rather than redress the balance. The amendment would keep the balance of power where it is now rather than tipping it even further in insurers' favour.
<P>
It is difficult to define success for defendants: that issue picks up the remarks of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. It is relatively easy to do so for claimants, despite what the hon. Gentleman said earlier: their success is easily incorporated into the agreement as it is defined in terms of recovery of compensation, and there are special provisions for payments into court, offers connected with part 36 of the civil justice rules and so forth. If they win, the success fee is payable, but for defendants it is not simply a matter of winning or losing the case. A defendant could define success as, for example, a finding of contributory negligence, under which the claimant still wins but perhaps by not quite as much. Such a finding might be useful to an insurer in future cases arising out of similar causes. A defendant might define success by winning a point of law obiter. Although he still loses the case, that decision may include what he was seeking to achieve in other cases. Success could simply be defined as restricting the sum of compensation payable to the claimant to a figure within the insurer's reserve. The claimant would still have won, but the defendant may also claim that he or she has won, too. There is a risk that we will create the propensity for a great degree of satellite litigation.
<P>
The Minister mentioned that the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers has argued that costs of insurance premiums could increase dramatically. That could be a serious risk. At the moment, insurance premiums cover a defendant's standard costs. I do not object to that, which is in itself a windfall for insurers compared with the present position, but the effect of the uplift would dramatically impact of the costs of insurance premiums for plaintiffs.
<P>
The Minister said that we cannot make a special exception for personal injury cases, and I accept that we are trying to broaden conditional fees beyond the experience that we already have of such cases. However, I put it to him that throughout the Bill there are special provisions for personal injury cases, such as in the changes to legal aid. If we can make special provision for personal injury in one aspect of the Bill, I do not see why we cannot do so on others. If my wording does not quite achieve that, I shall be happy to consider other wording that does.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 76 and 78 deal with ``shall'' rather than ``may'' in respect of recovering the success fee. Lawyers and claimants will face uncertainty if the provision is not worded in those terms. If the claimant wins, he or she should know that the success fee will be recovered by the lawyers. If not, there is always a risk that the lawyer will try to pass on the success fee to the claimant, which is what we are trying to prevent from happening. If this were the case, the lawyer would want to claim his success fee from somewhere, so we could end up unstitching the evil that we are dealing with under the clause.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's commitment that court rules will provide for the recovery of success fees. He said that costs are always at the court's discretion. However, the civil justice system will operate under a new regime, not just that introduced in relation to funding under the Bill but also because of the new civil justice procedures that came into force last week. It is now time, for example, to examine the old costs rules I have tabled other amendments on costs and to adopt a more interventionist approach. We are into judicial intervention, so perhaps there could be legislative intervention into some of the hackneyed ways in which to deal with costs.
<P>
What was appropriate 100 years ago in terms of the court's discretion, when success fees or conditional fees were not even dreamt of, may no longer be appropriate for the new regime that we are firming up by the Bill. If we want conditional fees to work, we must ensure the certainty that would be created by my amendments. They would give protection to the court and defendants, in that they would be subject to the assessment of costs. Courts would still have the reserve power to assess costs. The success fee is calculated as a percentage of the standard costs awarded by the court and there are provisions within the cost rules on assessments for standard fees to be reduced in, for example, the event of misconduct and to be assessed as to whether they are reasonable.
<P>
The success fee uplift will always be a multiplier, based on the original standard fee assessment that will still be carried out by the courts and challengeable at that stage. Courts will still have the discretion. We must not give the courts power to interfere in a success fee ex post facto. It is easy to say after the event, and with the benefit of hindsight, that the success fee was too high, that it should not be awarded or that the matter was obviously an open-and-shut case, so there should be no success fee.
<P>
To return to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, when the lawyer is signing up to the conditional fee agreement he has only a sketchy idea of the strength of his client's case, as he does of the defendant's case. My hon. Friend the Minister said that we shall be considering making arrangements in cases when the defendant challenges the success fee at an early stage, I hope; it should certainly be done pre-proceedings. Unless the amendments are accepted, I am worried that the courts will try to operate ex post facto with the benefit of hindsight to unstitch the agreements.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister dealt with my concerns when he spoke to Government amendments Nos. 114 and 292. At present, the profession is uncertain how success fees can be recovered if the case was settled pre-proceedings. The new rules of court are silent on that point. I do not think that they have been put into practice, but I stand to be corrected on that. I do not want the amendments to create a perverse incentive to litigate when the thrust of the Bill through justice reforms is pre-proceedings settlements, wherever possible.
<P>
We have changed the system from the arrangements that were in place until a few weeks ago, under which pre-proceedings costs could form the basis of litigation if they could not be agreed with insurers. As far as I can see, we have yet to put anything in place to mirror those proceedings for the new regime. I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to explain how pre-proceedings costs, in particular success fees, will be assessed if the insurers dispute them. Who will adjudicate or arbitrate in such a dispute?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like briefly to trespass on what might be a clause stand part argument. We should make provision in the Bill for collective conditional fee arrangements, which involve block contracts between trade unions and firms of solicitors, for example. The Bill does not deal with such arrangements. I understand that discussions on that matter have taken place between the profession and my hon. Friend the Minister. Perhaps he would bring us up to date on what stage those discussions have reached and whether it is proposed to deal with the matter on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> We have had an interesting debate. I think that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough probably answered his question himself during his reflections on the use of the word ``party''. As I said earlier, it is obviously intended that conditional fees should be available to defendants. That is why the word ``party'' is preferred to the word ``claimant''. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon asked why that should be so, and suggested that there might be a major windfall for insurance companies if they are allowed to operate on conditional fees. The Government believe that there should be an appropriate balance of power between the forces of litigation.
<P>
To pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, he has considerably assisted the Government in forming their ideas on the matter. A ``defendant'' is not necessarily an insurance company. It could be someone faced with a personal injury claim, who does not have available the support that an insurance company could provide. I can see no reason in principle why such a person should not have funding available through a conditional fee arrangement. The clause leaves open that possibility. It is not for the Government to speak on behalf of insurance companies, but I suspect that insurance companies hardly view the proposals in the Bill as offering them a major windfall. Obviously, it is important to maintain that appropriate balance. Restricting conditional fees to claimants only would tip the balance unfairly in one direction.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon has probably forgotten more about this area of practice than I ever learned, but I shall answer him as he has answered me in the past. The definition of success is a matter for the agreement between the parties. That applies equally to defendants as it does to claimants. Thinking about this matter as I listened to him, I decided that there is no reason in principle why a success fee could not be achievable by both sides to a litigation case. He mentioned a case that essentially involved a point of law, but in principle I should have thought it possible to conceive of circumstances in which both sides achieve their definition of success. As the benefit to the parties to litigation is that their lawyers are free if they do not achieve that success, and must be paid for only in the event of success being achieved, that seems an appropriate way of funding cases. That underlies all the Bill's provisions.
<P>
In a sense, my hon. Friend is right to widen the argument about discretion and costs to include the more general. However, the Bill does not deal with the general question of costs.
<P>
In the context of conditional fee arrangements, it is not right to try to solve the problem of the existing cost regime simply by criticising it and broadening the debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon is trying to do. The question of discretion on costs is central to how costs are awarded. I have said that the assumption is that the success fee will be recoverable, but the rules of court will specify the circumstances and the way in which that will occur.
<P>
It is not intended that there should be ex poste facto interference on the level of the success fee, although it is equally important, for the reasons that I gave earlier, that the defendant should have an opportunity to challenge the level of the success fee. That opportunity must not be at the expense of claimants having to disclose important details of their own assessment of the risk in a particular case, which could harm their ability to take their cases forward.
<P>
These matters will have to be carefully considered, as appropriate rules of court are drafted. Work on the rules of court are under way, and there will be consultations over the summer on how they should operate. I am reasonably confident that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon will want to contribute to that process of consultation. He has been extraordinarily helpful in the past, and I am sure that he will continue to be so. He may like to know that I shall be having a meeting with the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers this afternoon, so the matter is being considered by the Government.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will be content with the way in which the process is developing. I do not anticipate that changes to the operation of conditional fees will be brought into force before the rules of court are agreed and established, so I hope that he is comfortable with that assurance.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I hope that the amendments are self explanatory they all deal with pre-action legal conduct. Amendment No. 135 would add a subsection to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. We want clarification that the advice or assistance that is provided
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in connection with the resolution of a dispute, whether or not that person also exercises, or contemplates exercising, a right to conduct litigation in relation to any proceedings'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is included in the definition of ``litigation services''. We are asking for clarity, and we hope that the Government will tell us whether their proposals will provide expressly for matters before action.
<P>
Broadly the same issue is raised in new clauses 24 and 25. Again, we want to define more clearly the expression ``litigation services'' in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. New clause 25 relates to the Insurance Companies (Legal Expense Insurance) Regulations 1990. The thrust behind our new clauses and amendments is the same.
<P>
Amendment No. 140 simply suggests that if new clause 25 is accepted, that should be reflected in the table on the final page of the Bill.
<P>
There is not much more to say because the amendments themselves provide the guts of my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This group of amendments seeks to make changes to the proposed new sections 58 and 58A of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, relating to conditional fee agreements, which are contained in clause 29. I say at the outset that while I have some sympathy with the concerns that lie behind these amendments, I am not able to accept them.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 134, 135 and 140, and new clauses 24 and 25, are all aimed primarily towards restricting the activities of non-legally qualified claims assessors. These assessors offer to recover compensation for members of the public arising out of personal injury, for a fixed percentage of the damages recovered. The effect of amendment No. 135 would be to extend the definition of ``litigation services'' as it applies to section 58 to include any assistance given by anyone, not just those qualified to litigate cases before the courts, to help resolve a dispute. New clause 24 makes a parallel amendment to the definition of ``litigation services'' in section 119 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, to include advice and assistance to the injured person on the intimation of a claim. Amendment No. 140 and new clause 25 make consequential amendments to the Insurance Companies (Legal Expenses Insurance) Regulations 1990.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor's Department has received representations from lawyers about the activities of non-legally qualified claims assessors, and of others whose activities fall short of the work of litigators solicitors as defined in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. In the case of claims assessors, it is alleged that their services, which are paid for out of settlements, are unduly costly, and that the settlements they achieve fall far below the settlements that a competent lawyer would achieve. In addition, they compete unfairly with members of the legal professions, who must bear the considerable costs imposed by regulation.
<P>
The Government have a duty to ensure that the customer is protected the more so in the case of legal services where many customers are ill-informed and the consequences of poor advice can be severe and long lasting. It would be easy to construct cogent examples. I assure the Committee that if there is a need for controls in this area to protect the customer, the Government will not hesitate to seek to introduce the necessary measures. We are already committed to taking steps to control unscrupulous immigration advisers, but, although there is anecdotal evidence of poor service by claims assessors, the Government do not yet have sufficient information to warrant taking action. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor will establish a small committee to investigate the provision of legal advice by non-legally qualified persons who act as claims assessors.
<P>
By the end of this year, the committee will report its findings and recommendations on whether further control in this sector is needed in the public interest. I recognise that that will not be before the Bill is enacted, by the Government are anxious to identify the extent of the alleged problem, and to see whether it can be addressed by way of further legal controls.
<P>
I understand the concern behind this group of amendments, but I hope that I can reassure the Committee especially the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that the issues are not entirely straightforward. They are being addressed in the proper way, so I hope that he will agree to withdraw his amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I shall speak briefly to new clauses 24 and 25. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for saying that the matter will be considered seriously by the Government. I have more than anecdotal evidence that it is a serious problem, both from information supplied by the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and my experience of dealing with personal injury claims. The client seems to be victimised by claims assessors. In my constituency surgery, I have heard of one or two examples of people having paid over huge amounts of money unnecessarily to claims assessors in cases that could have been dealt with by solicitors far more efficiently and quickly. They could also have recovered more money.
<P>
I pray in aid the point about contingency fees made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon.
<P>
The problem with claims assessors is that they always operate on contingency not on conditional fees and the public have no idea what the difference is judging by the debate on Second Reading, neither do most lawyers in the House and that is probably true of lawyers in the outside world. However, the sort of fee makes a big difference to the amount that the lawyer, or in this case the non-lawyer, charges an accident victim in personal injury cases.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A contingency fee will not be recoverable from the insurance company, but a conditional fee will be. Although claims assessors may advertise themselves as having no-win, no-fee agreements, their concept of the no-win, no-fee principle is very different from the new conditional fee system proposed in the Bill.
<P>
I accept that we might need to do more work to convince the Government that a problem exists, but it will become increasingly urgent once the new conditional fee arrangements are in place, because clients will then lose 30 per cent. or more of their damages, which will be less than they would have done if their case were handled by a competent lawyer, whereas the client who is represented by a competent lawyer on conditional fee arrangements will not lose a penny. That is why this is an important matter and why I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for taking it seriously and to the Lord Chancellor for taking steps to set up a working party that will examine such matters urgently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, especially as he has said that a body will be created to investigate this matter, which he readily accepts is causing great concern. It is not a lawyer's whinge; it is a matter of great public interest. I hope that the Government will act quickly on any recommendations that the Committee proposes.
<P>
I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Hendon for expressing his concern. I have a suspicion that he has a more open line to the Government than I do. I do not know whether the conversations are entirely one way, but I urge him to use all the force that he can muster to persuade the Government to consider the matter as quickly and effectively as possible.
<P>
The Minister says that it is unlikely that the Committee's recommendations will be acted on before the Bill is enacted, but that does not mean that they cannot be acted on before the Bill comes into force a hiatus of which the Government can take useful advantage. I hope that the Committee will start work very soon and not wait until the end of the summer to get on with its job. Given that the Minister has told us, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I shall be brief. The Minister has not dealt with some of the points that I made. I invite him to comment on collective conditional fee agreements and trade unions and on the recovery of success fees in non-litigated cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I, too, will be brief, but I do not want my brevity to be taken as total acquiescence in clause 29. I merely put my hon. Friends on notice that I shall invite the Government to reconsider clause 29, and what lies behind it, at a later and more convenient stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall respond to the point on collective agreements made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. Collective agreements are provided for, but certain matters, not least of which are questions of indemnity, are still being discussed with those who use such agreements as my hon. Friend knows. Clearly, it may be necessary to table amendments if there is any doubt once those discussions have been completed. We are confident that the present rules allow for such arrangements. It is simply a question of ensuring, perhaps through rules of court, that they operate properly and effectively.
<P>
Clause 29, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move, That clause 29, as amended, be transferred to follow clause 26.
<P>
I hope that I can deal with the matter briefly and, with your permission, Mr. Atkinson, to deal also with the motion to transfer clause 30. They are essentially housekeeping changes, if not kitchen table changes. They will give the Bill a more logical structure, especially if some of the new clauses that we have yet to debate are accepted by the Committee. The Government wish to place all the provisions relating to funding legal services, as distinct from the provisions for publicly funded services in England and Wales, in part I of the Bill. It is for that reason that I invite the Committee to allow clauses 29 and 30 to be placed immediately after clause 26. As I say, these are essentially housekeeping changes, which will give the Bill a better structure.

<H4><center>REPLACEMENT OF ACLEC BY CONSULTATIVE PANEL</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In the other place, the Government's proposal to abolish the Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct received a great deal of attention. The committee's history is short, but its work was much praised. The work of the consultative panel in advising the previous Lord Chancellor was much to the fore, and many of their Lordships found it difficult to understand why the Government wished to do away with it and replace it with the Legal Services Consultative Panel.
<P>
I read with care the Official Report on the debates on that change in the other place. I am wholly unconvinced by the arguments put forward by the Lord Chancellor and his supporters. Several constitutional matters were raised by my noble Friends and others, and I invite the Minister to respond to them today. I ask him also to demonstrate that the Government do not seek to impose yet more executive power over the courts. In a democracy, the courts should be entirely free of Government interference.
<P>
I am a moderately reasonable fellow and I am susceptible to good arguments, but I have yet to hear any. I trust that I shall hear some today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The clause will abolish the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct and replace it with a new body, the Legal Services Consultative Panel, which will be a slimmer and more cost-effective source of independent advice on legal services issues. 
<P>
ACLEC has 17 members, and it costs the taxpayer about 1 million a year. Its principal statutory role is to advise the Lord Chancellor whether to approve applications by organisations to grant their members rights of audience or the right to conduct litigation, or applications from authorised bodies to change their rules relating to those rights.
<P>
Under the Bill, the procedures that oblige ACLEC to consider every application, no matter how routine, will be abolished. Routine and uncontroversial applications may thus be approved without invoking the rather complex advice procedure. The new panel will have fewer members than ACLEC and will meet only when its advice is required on an application or other matter; it will not therefore have permanent staff or accommodation, but secretariat functions will be provided by the Lord Chancellor's Department. I estimate that that will save in the region of three quarters of what ACLEC currently costs.
<P>
The Government moved a number of amendments to the clause in another place. The new subsection (2) will ensure that the panel has a balance of experience and expertise, including knowledge in consumer affairs, among its membership so that it can carry out its duties effectively and with due regard to the needs of all users of legal services. The new subsection (5) obliges the Lord Chancellor to publish any recommendations and advice made to him by the panel in the course of pursuing its statutory duties under subsections (3)(a) and (b). It is right in principle that an independent state-funded body should publish its advice and that amendment accords with the Government's firm belief in open government. ACLEC has fulfilled a valuable role in maintaining standards in legal education and training. The value of that work has been widely recognised and consequently it is proposed that the new panel will have a remit to continue that work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The Minister is set on two courses, both of which I applaud: to achieve economy and to provide a source of independent advice. However, he said that the secretarial services afforded to the replacement body would be provided by the Lord Chancellor's Department. I may be too worldly or too cynical, but long years in local government taught me that he who has the writing of the preparatory papers and discussion documents has a significant whip hand and the opportunity to impregnate the mind of a reader who is preparing for a meeting.
<P>
Will the Minister comment on whether that provision of secretarial services by the Lord Chancellor's Department constitutes a derogation of the impartiality of the replacement body? Is there a worm of danger in that situation, or does the Minister think that it is manageable and containable, posing no threat to the impartiality of the secretarial services provided internally by the Lord Chancellor's Department?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> In all the years that I have known the hon. Member for Solihull, I have never suspected him of cynicism. I am sure that he is not suffering from that condition today. However, the administrative support or secretariat secretarial services has a slightly unfortunate connotation provided to the Legal Services Consultative Panel will be at its behest. It will determine the level of administrative assistance that it requires to carry out its functions so that, although it will receive administrative assistance from the Lord Chancellor's Department, it will maintain its independence.

<H4><center>BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the clause because, although I do not have a current interest to declare, as I mentioned on Second Reading I am a former chairman of the Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry and support its policies, particularly on rights of audience for the employed Bar. However, my criticisms of the Government's proposals on a public defender service have been misinterpreted by some of my former colleagues and good friends as undermining my support for the position of the Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry. I stress that I not only warmly welcome the changes, but that before Second Reading, I confirmed with the Bar Council and with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough and the shadow Attorney-General that as a party we support the extension of rights of audience. I was reassured that the Bar Council made clear in its briefing that it did not support the amendment that was accepted in another place to remove the rights of employed lawyers to exercise rights of audience for their employers. It said that rights of audience to employed barristers and solicitor-advocates should be extended to all those who are qualified, which is also the argument of the Opposition.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry, which I had the honour to chair several years ago, was established in 1965 to represent the interests of members of the Bar employed in business. BACFI's membership includes many barristers who either began their practice in commerce, finance and industry or, as in my own case, moved from the Bar in independent practice to the in-house corporate counsel role. Similarly, there has been a migration of lawyers from the employed Bar back into private practice. Many colleagues in the chambers where I am a door tenant have migrated in the other direction. 
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 16,000 barristers, of whom approximately half are providing legal services in some way other than in independent practice in chambers. Barristers involved in commerce are to be found throughout the breadth of the corporate world. Many are legal directors on the boards of companies and many occupy senior positions within corporate entities as I did before becoming a Member of Parliament. Types of industry cover retail and manufacturing operations, banking and finance, insurance my own interest shipping, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, chemicals and many others. It is estimated that 2,500 employed barristers are practising within firms of solicitors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> The position that the hon. Gentleman outlined is one that his association has advocated for a long time. Why has it taken so long for the Bar Council to recognise the strength of the argument that there should be fairness in respect of rights of audience to employed barristers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I have a little inside knowledge of the gradual movement of the Bar Council's position. For several years, I served on the general management committee which, as the hon. Gentleman will know well, is the inner cabinet of the Bar Council. I stepped down when I was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Ministry of Defence during the term of office of the previous Government. I served on that inner cabinet for three years, during which time the position of employed barristers increased in strength. Several of them served on various committees of the Bar Council and during the seven years of my involvement and, as a member of its general management committee for about three years, there was an increasing recognition among members of the independent Bar of the strength of the employed Bar's case.
<P>
We have seen not so much a sudden reversal of the position, but a gradual shift. I cannot speak, however, about positions in the Bar Council before I joined it or after I left. As for the way forward, I welcome such changes outlined in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe or does his party believe that rights of audience should be regulated by the Lord Chancellor acting effectively alone or by the Lord Chancellor and four designated judges, as hitherto?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I cannot give my party's position because I have not discussed such matters with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon is taking the debate to clause 34. We are debating clause 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful for your ruling, Mr. Atkinson. I do not want to be out of order, but we must ensure that any controls on the extension of employed barristers are not misused to provide a further block. I know that that has worried the chairman and many members of BACFI. Perhaps, as you suggested Mr. Atkinson, we could debate that further when we reach clause 34.
<P>
There is no evidence that the administration of justice would be impeded by allowing employed barristers the same rights of audience as their colleagues in independent practice. Employed barristers have been allowed rights of audience indeed, I have exercised them myself in the lower courts and in tribunals for several years, which shows that there has been a gradual acceptance that employed barristers do not lack objectivity. I am sure that the quality of justice in those courts is no different from that in the higher courts. The lower courts and tribunals provide an excellent service to the community, and there is no evidence to suggest that their work s prejudiced by the appearance of employed barristers. As I have cause to know, employed lawyers possess the same professional integrity and commitment to ethical principles as their colleagues in private practice.
<P>
Like the Government, industry is constantly looking for ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency. By permitting in-house lawyers to provide a full range of legal services to their employers, legal costs can be significantly reduced. Many companies will, of course, continue to use external lawyers for lengthy trials or when additional specialist help is required, but often the in-house lawyer will be the best person for the job because he fully understands the business and its needs. In such circumstances, there is no need to spend time and money briefing on the outcome that the company wants to achieve. In-house lawyers do not need to be told how their own company functions and are conscious of the fact that, although a dispute may have arisen with a customer or supplier, business still goes on and there is a need to avoid permanently alienating that customer or supplier. Above all, the in-house lawyer provides value for money.
<P>
I greatly welcome the changes. As I was about to say when I gave way to an earlier intervention, this is the best part of a Bill that in other ways, as I have said when debating other clauses, is flawed. I am therefore grateful to have had the opportunity to clarify my strong support for the change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> I rise briefly to express my appreciation that the clause has been introduced to redress a grievance of employed barristers and the other side of the profession solicitors. There is no reason why the restrictive practice that was I regret for so long defended by the Bar Council should persist in an age of open, fair and accountable competition. It is puzzling that the Bar Council has taken so long to change its previously dogged and vehement opposition to the extension of rights of audience to employed barristers, and, initially, to extending such rights to solicitors.
<P>
The clause is eminently sensible. It conforms with the Bill's overall objective, which relates to access to justice. It is entirely sensible that the Government should have decided to abolish the Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct, a body that many people thought rather too conservative in its approach to rights of audience. There should be a level playing field between barristers and solicitors. 
<P>
As a barrister, I know that the value of an independent Bar is greatly appreciated, especially by high street solicitors outside the metropolitan area. It provides a pool of expertise in specialist areas and in the expertise of advocacy that it is essential for high street solicitors' practices to be able to access. If the Bar rises to the challenges embraced not only in the Bill but in the other wide-ranging changes that the whole profession confronts, I am confident that the independent Bar will continue to exist and flourish not on the strength of entrenched restrictive practices but on its own merits. That is why I welcome clause 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wish to put on record the fact that the Liberal Democrat party welcomes clause 32 and the extension of rights of audience contained in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not want to spoil the party, but there is a hideous amount of cross-party agreement and I am always rather suspicious of that. I am sometimes a little disappointed that those of us who have lived most of our adult professional lives in the independent Bar should, from time to time, think it clever or convenient to deprecate the profession that has sustained us over the past several years in my case, since 1976, when I was called to the Bar.
<P>
I fully appreciate that the hon. Member for Clwyd, West is entirely sincere, but that does not necessarily mean that I support all that he says. Equally, I fully understand the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins). In my 23 years at the Bar, my only regret is that I have not been able to conduct a case of litigation in which my hon. Friend was my opponent, because I would, no doubt, have learnt much from him about the skills and qualities that members of the employed Bar can bring to the conduct of litigation.
<P>
I invite members of the Committee, when they have a moment, to re-read the reports of the debate in the other place on the equivalent clause. The amendment proposed by Lord Ackner carried much support. Indeed, my right hon. and learned Friend Lord Kingsland made an important speech during that debate in which he underlined the need to preserve an independent legal profession and Bar. I say this not simply because I am a barrister and have enjoyed my time as an independent, self-employed barrister since 1976, but for the reasons expressed by Lord Kingsland in the other place.
<P>
I do not shrink from being politically incorrect. It is often thought unfashionable to praise institutions that, although ancient, have much to offer. The independent Bar has much to offer and has done so over the years, not only to the ordinary, run-of-the-mill client, but to our system of justice and liberties under the constitution.

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I equally regret the fact that I did not have sufficient practice in defamation cases in my years in the independent Bar to appear against my hon. and learned Friend. I hope that he took nothing that I said in support of the organisation that I used to chair as in any way a criticisms of the independent Bar. I hope that I stressed that the independent Bar can be strengthened by these changes.
<P>
I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will agree that Lord Borrie made one of the most powerful speeches on the matter in another place. Although not a member of the organisation he made it clear that he had not previously come across it he was persuaded by the briefing issued for comment by the Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sure that when the Bill is enacted my hon. Friend will have the opportunity to appear in defamation cases, and I look forward to that.
<P>
I read Lord Borrie's speech and was interested to note that he was much influenced by the briefing that he had received. I also read the speeches of other noble Lords who were not quite so influenced.
<P>
12.45 pm
<P>
I spoke against the creation of the Criminal Defence Service and especially against the salaried state-employed lawyer. In speaking on this clause stand part debate, I do not for a moment distance myself from what I said in our debates on the subject. I also do not distance myself from the expressed or implied criticisms of the Crown Prosecution Service that I made on the same occasion. There is a danger that to allow every barrister and solicitor to appear in our higher courts will lead to a down turn in quality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. and learned Gentleman's flow of thoughts, but I am sure that he agrees that clause 32 will not give an unconditional right of audience to solicitors and barristers. Barristers will have to conform with the professional requirements of the Bar Council, including the need to undertake pupillage, and solicitors would need to undertake qualification in higher court advocacy before they would be allowed rights of audience. There are safeguards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Well, that is all right then, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention.
<P>
I was talking about the damage that the clause may cause to the Bar, and I shall briefly explain why I am concerned. There is a danger that it will inhibit people from coming to the Bar at a young age. With the greater use of employed barristers and solicitors with rights of audience, the young, independent law student will no longer feel it necessary or desirable to take the risk of launching out on his own in a set of chambers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Obviously, I am a solicitor and not a barrister, and I contest the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman made earlier about quality. I have seen some pretty lousy barristers in court on many occasions and have thought. ``Give me a wig and I'll do the job myself.''
<P>
The amendment will achieve the opposite of what the hon. and learned Gentleman is advocating. My experience of young barristers has been that many struggle to survive. By the proposed process, they can cut their teeth, earn a decent living, get experience of practising in the courts, and move into the independent Bar if necessary and if they want to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman is right, because I fear the opposite, which is that young graduates will not come into the independent Bar. Therefore we will not have a continually renewed Bar or an independent cohort of middle-aged barristers from whom, as well as middle-aged solicitors, the Lord Chancellor draws those most appropriate for judicial office. That is the way in which the process has worked until now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> Does the hon. and learned Gentleman not agree that the Lord Chancellor should draw on middle-aged women and men from all sorts of backgrounds if we are to have a truly representative judiciary? [Interruption.] He may scoff, but it is a valid point. I applaud my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon for addressing the issue yet again in his amendment on the need for a judicial appointments board. It is a real issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It is so real and so obvious that I did not think that I needed to burden the Committee by making the point. Whenever I mention the words ``barrister'' or ``solicitor'', I do not mean only men, but women as well. At this stage, I am not addressing the question of the colour, culture or creed of the individuals concerned, but the question of the profession as a whole.
<P>
The clock is moving on and I do not want to burden the Committee unduly. I want to make it clear, however, that the clause should not be welcomed with scarves and football rattles, as the noble Lord Thomas of Gresford said when he was describing a speech of the noble Lord Hacking. Yes, there will now be facility for employed barristers and solicitors to appear, but will the Minister assure me that they can appear only on behalf of their employers, not their employers' clients?
<P>
I shall cite a facile example to get my point across to the Committee. I accept that it will be appropriate for members of an in-house legal department of a large company to appear in the courts on its behalf. Can the Minister or Solicitor-General assure me that that in-house department of the company will not be able to represent third parties what I would rudely and loosely call, clients off the street as though they were in competition with firms of solicitors or other advocates? [Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Hendon wants to make a speech, no doubt he will catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson. If the hon. Gentleman finds my argument disagreeable, perhaps he will get up and speak against it. I am asking the Minister or the Solicitor-General to assure me that we shall not have what are, in effect, in-house legal department law shops competing or providing services that conflict with those provided already by the independent profession?
<P>
I have now expressed my private concerns about how matters will develop and there is probably nowhere better to keep a secret than in a Standing Committee. I fully accept that those concerns are not shared by my party, but they are shared by my right hon. and noble Friend, Lord Kingsland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. and learned Gentleman share my optimism for the Bar? Although I am a solicitor, I am a great supporter of the Bar and I know how important it is. It is vitally important that the clients of small and medium-sized firms of solicitors can access the Bar, not only in contentious but in non-contentious matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I could not agree more. It is not merely the Bill, but the Government's wider legal reforms that will have a deleterious effect on the legal profession as a whole not just the Bar, but solicitors. I shall leave the matter there. I shall not vote against clause 32 stand part. I look forward to the Minister's cogent response to my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for most of the comments that have been made from both sides of the Committee. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has left me slightly puzzled about the position of the Conservative party. I understood it to be set out by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath perhaps the Conservative party is being led once again from the rear. As for the hon. Gentleman, we should always welcome the repentance of sinners, however late in the day. I did not detect from his earlier contributions on Second Reading or earlier in Committee that we would hear such a fulsome hymn of praise for the Government's position. However, he is a worthy repentant and we welcome him with open arms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I would not want the Minister to think that what I said in Committee was along the lines of repentance. I ask him to re-read my speech on Second Reading, in which I said at an early stage that I fully supported the policies of the Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry. It is not a question of repentance, but of setting out in detail in Committee, as I had always intended, my criticisms of the clause. However, my criticisms of the Government on other clauses, which I set out on Second Reading, remain valid. Like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, I am just as critical now of the public defender system for the reasons I gave in our earlier debate as I was on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. It would be uncharitable to say that the Member for Surrey Heath wants it both ways, so I will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B>  We get our instructions from the Chinese embassy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I had better not stray into that area. Most of the clause is a simple re-enactment of provisions already in force under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. That Act put rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation on a systematic, statutory basis for the first time and provided that professional or other bodies could be authorised under a statutory procedure to grant those rights to their members. Authorised bodies were also given the power to regulate the exercise of those rights by their members, subject to the requirement that their rules and regulations, and any alterations in them, should be approved. At the time of the 1990 Act, there were already two bodies whose members had rights of audience or rights to conduct litigation or both: the Bar Council and the Law Society. Special provision was therefore made for both bodies; the Act made them authorised bodies for the purpose of granting rights of audience, and made the Law Society an authorised body for the purpose of granting rights to conduct litigation. Existing members of both bodies were deemed to have been granted the rights they already had, and the existing rules of both bodies were deemed to have been approved. The clause essentially continues those arrangements, with one significant difference in relation to solicitors: a new section 31 is inserted into the 1990 Act. Subsection (1) of new section 31 provides that all barristers are deemed to have been granted a right of audience before every court in relation to all proceedings. That is already the case under the existing section 31 of the 1990 Act. All barristers including employed barristers are currently deemed to have been granted full rights of audience when they were called to the Bar, but they can exercise those rights only in accordance with the rules of the Bar. Subsection (1) preserves that position and provides that rights of audience are exercisable only in accordance with the qualification regulations and rules of conduct laid down by the General Council of the Bar and approved under the 1990 Act. Subsection (1) means, for example, that a barrister who has not completed pupillage may not exercise the full rights of audience that he or she theoretically has because the requirements of the Bar's qualification regulations have not been met. Similarly, a barrister may not exercise full rights of audience as a barrister in private practice if he or she is not a member of chambers, as he or she would not be complying with the Bar's rules of conduct.
<P>
Subsection (2)(a) makes the same provision in respect of solicitors' rights of audience that subsection (1) makes in respect of barristers. All solicitors are deemed by the subsection to have full rights of audience in all the courts, but may exercise those rights only if they comply with the qualification regulations and rules of conduct imposed by the Law Society. That provision changes the present arrangements. All solicitors presently have rights of audience in the lower courts, but unlike barristers they are not deemed to have rights of audience in the higher courts. Instead, solicitors are granted rights of audience in the higher courts only when they have obtained the Law Society's higher courts qualifications. If they obtain such a qualification, they are retrospectively deemed to have been granted full rights of audience on admission to the roll of solicitors, in accordance with paragraph 3 of schedule 19 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. The Government do not want unqualified or incompetent advocates practising in the higher courts, or anywhere else. Under subsection (2)(a), the position remains that solicitors can appear in the higher courts only if they have met the requirements imposed by the Law Society. Solicitors will be in the same position as barristers in having full rights of audience, but whether they can exercise them fully will depend on whether they have complied with the relevant rules. Of course, there will still be a marked distinction in practice; the Bar is essentially a specialist advocacy profession and most solicitors are not specialist advocates. Those who do not wish to appear in the higher courts, and do not obtain the necessary qualifications, will still not be able to appear in the higher courts.
<P>
The 1990 Act enabled solicitors to obtain full rights of audience in the higher courts, yet nine years on, just over 1 per cent. of the profession about 850 solicitors out of more than 78,000 in practice have obtained those rights.
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) of the new section 31 simply maintains the status quo by providing that all solicitors are deemed to have been granted rights to conduct litigation under the Courts and Legal Services Act. Subsection (3) effectively re-enacts section 27(3) of that Act. That is designed simply to preserve the special position of the Inns of Court, since although they are not authorised bodies under the Act, they and not the Bar Council, are responsible for calling barristers to the Bar and for disbarring them or suspending them from practice.
<P>
The clause is a modest one that will not by itself have a great effect on the status quo. However, it underpins the provisions of clauses 33 and 34 and the clause relating to employed lawyers that was defeated in another place, which the Government will shortly reintroduce.
<P>
The only other question raised was that of the Bar's position on clients of employers. We will debate that under clauses 33 and 34 and the new clause, but I can say now that it is a matter for the Bar to determine under its own rules and regulations.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Further consideration adjourned. [Mr. Hill.]
