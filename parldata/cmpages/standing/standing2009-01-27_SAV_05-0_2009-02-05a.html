amendment 20, in
clause 13, page 6, line 8, leave
out &#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;must&#146;.</div><a name="09020531000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
morning to you, Mr. Taylor and to other members of the
Committee. I shall not detain the Committee long. I tabled the
amendment because I wanted to explore the Economic Secretary&#146;s
attitude to whether these accounts should pay interest. If you will
give me the leeway to refer also to amendment 21, it will not be
necessary for me to move it
subsequently.</div><a name="09020531000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000201"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am happy to allow that
flexibility.</div><a name="09020531000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000202"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Amendment 20 would make it compulsory for these
accounts to pay interest. If we wanted to stop some bank paying a
nugatory level of interest it would be necessary to include in the Bill
the minimum level of interest that could be paid. That is where
amendment 21 would come
in.</div><a name="09020531000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020531000203"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Will the hon. Gentleman
clarify this for me? I looked at the amendment and was slightly
perplexed. Clause 13 refers to interest payable to the commissioners,
not to interest payable on saving gateway accounts. So his amendment
would provide that a payment be made to the commissioners rather than
that interest be paid on
accounts.</div><a name="09020531000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000204"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be right and I may have
misread the clause. My purpose was to explore the Government&#146;s
attitude to whether these accounts should provide interest to the
saver. That is what I hope the Economic Secretary will refer
to.</div><a name="09020531000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of our expert witnesses told us that they regarded it as essential that
these accounts should pay interest to the saver because otherwise the
saver would not become inculcated with the idea that money put into a
bank account earns interest. Another expert witness told us that these
accounts would generate a market of around &#163;250 million. If the
banks used that money for their personal loan
businesses&#151;</div><a name="09020531000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000205"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The impact of the clause may have been
misunderstood. The apparent objective might well be secured by moving
an appropriate amendment to new clause 2, which deals with this
issue.</div><a name="09020531000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000206"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> That may well be the case. If the Economic
Secretary indicates that my amendment is ill founded and will not serve
the purpose that I hoped it would, I will certainly accept that and
withdraw it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>Perhaps in telling me that he will still indicate whether he believes
that the accounts should pay interest. If he will take into account my
point that these accounts are likely to raise sufficient profit for the
banks to make about &#163;21 million. That is more than enough for
them
to&#151;</div><a name="09020531000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000207"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman yet again, but we are on clause 13, which refers to interest
payable to the commissioners, not to the depositors. If he wishes to
return to his remarks when we debate new clause 2 the Chair will be
quite
content.</div><a name="09020531000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000208"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I understand what you are saying, Mr.
Taylor. I have concluded my comments. I have raised the issue that I
want to raise and I hope that the Economic Secretary will find either
now or under new clause 2 the opportunity to respond and give us an
indication of whether he thinks these accounts should pay interest to
the
saver.</div><a name="09020531000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000209"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> Good
morning, Mr. Taylor. It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship again today. I can confirm that amendment 20 relates only
to interest being paid on amounts owed to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs. The effect of amendment 21 would be to make saving gateway
accounts inconsistent with what happens elsewhere in HMRC.</div>
<a name="09020531000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend rightly wants to have a debate about the general principle of
interest and whether or not it should be paid on saving gateway
accounts. We can have that debate when we come to new clause 2. There
have been extensive discussions between the Government and potential
account providers about that issue. I will say more on it at a later
date.</div>
<a name="09020531000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000210"></a>Dr.

welcome you to the chair this morning, Mr. Taylor. Amendment
No. 35 is now redundant, because it was a probing amendment to
establish the tax arrangements for saving gateway accounts. I was

issue. I shall therefore not move the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000213"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have a quick question about the clause. My
thinking behind this is that the Minister is seeking to ensure that
saving gateway accounts can be sharia-compliant. Does he share my
understanding that if the requirement is to pay interest on these
accounts, they would not be
sharia-compliant?</div><a name="09020531000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000214"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Certainly, the purpose of the clause is to ensure
that saving gateway accounts could be sharia compliant. The hon.
Gentleman is right; my understanding of sharia law is that if interest
were paid on saving gateway accounts, they probably would not be sharia
compliant. That is something that potential providers of
sharia-compliant saving gateway accounts could certainly consider. He
makes a relevant point.</div>
<a name="09020531000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000215"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> My understanding is that the sharia-compliant
account can still pay a bonus at the end in exactly the same way that
the Government intend. If that bonus at the end happened to be the same
as the amount of interest earned, then, as it were, my hon. Friend the
Minister might say &#147;tomato&#148; and I might say
&#147;to-may-to&#148;.</div><a name="09020531000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000216"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Indeed. I am not a sharia theologian.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> That is abundantly obvious to the
Committee. Sharia compliance is a judgment to be made by a theologian.
It would be up to those theologians to decide whether the accounts were
sharia compliant. It is too early to say whether or not account
providers will offer sharia-compliant accounts. Ultimately, that is a
commercial decision for them to make and it would be up to the sharia
theologians to decide whether a bonus is compliant with sharia law or
not.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000217"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in
clause 16, page 7, line 9, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) Funds in
the account will be transferred into an Individual Savings Account as
set out in the Finance Act 1998 (c. 36) of the kind
prescribed by regulations and operated by the provider of the Saving
Gateway account in
question.&#146;.</div><a name="09020531000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the debates that we had in the morning evidence-giving session last
week was about what would happen to the money in the saving gateway
account when the account matured and the account-holder received the
matching maturity payment, as it is described in the Bill. We had quite
an interesting debate on that point with the various witnesses and it
was a subject that we returned to in the afternoon evidence-giving
session.</div>
<a name="09020531000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an
important issue, because the Bill&#146;s objective is to try to
develop a savings culture in the target group and we want that savings
culture to extend beyond the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>end of the two-year period. Therefore, it is important to understand
what will happen to the balance at the end of that
period.</div><a name="09020531000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
propose in my amendment that the balance on the account should be
automatically transferred into a cash individual savings account and
that that would, in effect, be the default setting. The Government,
following discussions with various potential providers and the savings
industry, have already said that if amounts are transferred from a
saving gateway account into a cash ISA they will not count towards that
year&#146;s subscription. That is a welcome move. The amendment takes
things one step forward from that, making the automatic default setting
a cash ISA. That will help potential
savers.</div><a name="09020531000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cash
ISAs, on the whole, tend to pay a much more generous rate of interest
than most instant access accounts; they are a product that the
Government have supported and they would provide the right default
setting in such a situation. However, that was not a universal view in
the evidence sessions. There was some suggestion in the afternoon
session with the potential account providers that they might prefer
another option&#151;they said that some accounts might provide a
higher rate. I suspect that they would prefer a default option into an
account that perhaps offers a lower rate than a cash ISA, because such
accounts tend to offer higher rates than most instant access
accounts.</div><a name="09020531000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Matt
Wakefield from the Institute For Fiscal Studies, who did a lot of the
relevant evaluation,
said:</div><a name="09020531000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not see why, if it is possible to organise, it should not be an ISA
that is tax free&#151;just a cash ISA that operates as a cash savings
account.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Saving</i><i class="I"> Gateway Accounts Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January
2009; c.
16.]</div><a name="09020531000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some debate about whether a cash ISA is difficult or complex to
explain to someone who has had a saving gateway account. We could
surmount that barrier by ensuring that, alongside the saving gateway
programme, there is financial education for people who take out such
accounts. The national money guidance scheme, which we are committed
to, would provide such guidance to people who have a saving gateway
account.</div><a name="09020531000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000218"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman shares my
concern that many people with such accounts will not be paying income
tax, therefore a cash ISA might not be the most sensible form of saving
for them. Perhaps a national savings account might be more
appropriate.</div><a name="09020531000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000219"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is a good point. Some people will not be
paying income tax, but they would be in the same position if the
default was a savings account that paid them a lower rate of interest
net, whereas at least the interest on a cash ISA at maturity is paid
gross. The interest rate on a cash ISA is higher as well. We should
think not just about ISAs in the context of their tax treatment but
about their characteristics in terms of the interest that they pay.
People can exit a cash ISA before its maturity period ends and they
will benefit from a higher rate of interest on that. Yes, interest may
be deducted, but under our plans we would ensure that that interest was
paid gross rather than net and if people did not pay tax they would
receive the full benefit of that. From our perspective we have squared
that circle in our policy. Perhaps the plans that the Chancellor seems
keen to bring forward in the Budget 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>will also help people in this situation, by exempting them from payment
of the basic rate of income tax on their savings income. If the
Chancellor does that, we will support that
measure.</div><a name="09020531000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a clear benefit to savers from the saving gateway account defaulting
into a cash ISA, where returns tend to be higher. Cash ISAs are well
marketed, are increasingly better understood by consumers and offer the
best deal to savers. The better option is for the saving gateway
account to default into a cash ISA, rather than simply defaulting into
a current account, where it is available to spend. The fact that the
money is not locked away but set in a separate account might encourage
people to leave it alone for a bit longer, help them build up that nest
egg and continue to pay sums into that account, whereas if it defaults
into a current account the temptation might well be to spend it. We
would all want to see more and more people who have had a saving
gateway account continue to save. Therefore, defaulting to a savings
account will help further to develop the saving culture that we are
seeking to achieve through the
Bill.</div><a name="09020531000177"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000220"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the sentiment behind the amendment,
which is that it should be made as easy as possible for account holders
to continue to save once their accounts have matured. We also agree
about the advantages that the ISA offers: the benefits of tax
advantage, saving and ISAs are enjoyed by 18 million people in this
country.</div>
<a name="09020531000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my
hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet makes a good point, and we
considered the issue carefully before reaching the decision that we did
not want to mandate a roll-over account. Let me explain why and briefly
mention something about the process. We want to make it as easy as
possible for people to continue to save, so we need to make sure that
people have a choice. However, we also need to ensure that something is
in place for those people who do not make an active decision. Providers
will therefore put in place default roll-over accounts, about which
customers will be told when they open their saving gateway accounts.
That information will be there up
front.</div><a name="09020531000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the end of the two-year maturity period of each saving gateway account
approaches, providers will remind savers of the default option at
maturity, as well as inform them about other options. If the saver does
not make any active decision about what should happen to their money,
it will move into the providers&#146; default roll-over account.
Providers will be able to choose what that default account should be;
it might be a cash ISA, or it might not. The amendment would take away
that element of choice, and I understand why the hon. Member for
Fareham thinks that that is a good
idea.</div><a name="09020531000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have considered carefully whether the type of default roll-over account
should be mandated, and specifically whether it should be mandated to
be an ISA. However, we have decided to take a flexible approach for
three reasons. First, different potential providers have different
views on the matter, as the Committee heard in the evidence sessions. A
further reason is the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South

<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>Thanet: if people are in different circumstances, it might be that
mandating an ISA would not be in their best interests. Secondly, in
support of that, last week, Adrian Coles from the Building Societies
Association said that doing
so</div><a name="09020531000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could
preclude an institution offering a better account in some
circumstances.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
</i><i class="I">Saving Gateway Accounts Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January
2009; c. 42,
Q78.]</div><a name="09020531000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
think that we can all envisage what those circumstances might be.
Thirdly, we want to make sure that potential saving gateway providers
who do not offer ISAs&#151;and there will be some who do not do so,
for whatever reason&#151;are not
excluded.</div><a name="09020531000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, it is right not to be too prescriptive about the matter.
Obviously, we will want to keep the issue under review and the
Government would, indeed, be very concerned if we thought that the
default roll-over accounts that were being proposed when the saving

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000221"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not entirely convinced by the Economic
Secretary&#146;s argument and neither was I convinced by the
arguments made by some of the potential account providers at the
evidence session. The Economic Secretary occasionally accused
me&#151;jokingly, I think&#151;of being the banker&#146;s friend
in debates on the Banking Bill. I was not entirely convinced by the
evidence that potential account providers gave that they might wish to
offer higher rate accounts and a cash ISA. I hope that my scepticism is
ill founded and that in reality, they will offer higher rate accounts.
The Economic Secretary has said that he will keep this under
review.</div><a name="09020531000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020531000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): One of the best ways to sell
this legislation to the taxpayer&#151;who, it is estimated, will pay
in excess of &#163;100 million a year to finance the scheme&#151;is
that it should imbue a saving culture among the people who participate.
Surely, that goes to the nub of the issue. We should not compel people

morning, Mr. Taylor. We just passed clause 19 rather
quickly, but Members who look at it will see that it includes a
provision for imposing a &#163;3,000 penalty on account holders who
break the rules. We have just agreed to put that into
effect.</div><a name="09020531000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
21 sets out the penalties and sanctions for account providers if they
break the rules, but we can see if we compare clause 19 with clause 21
that, whereas an account holder can be fined up to &#163;3,000 for
violating the rules, an account provider can be fined only one tenth of
that amount&#151;&#163;300. There is a long list of rules that they
are compelled to keep&#151;nine of them in subsection (1). It would
seem reasonable that account providers who break the rules should be
subject to the same penalties as account holders who break the rules.
That is the purpose of my
amendment.</div><a name="09020531000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000225"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It might be helpful if I explain that the penalty
regime for saving gateway accounts has been modelled closely on the one
for child trust funds, as the schemes share several common features. We
have not experienced any difficulty with the operation of child trust
funds, and this penalty structure closely mirrors that one. The penalty
will not exceed the greater of &#163;300 or &#163;1 per account
affected. Saving gateway providers may also be child trust fund
providers, so having the same penalties will provide
consistency.</div><a name="09020531000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, we consider that setting the penalty at &#163;300 is
proportionate in all circumstances. Banks and other institutions that
may offer saving gateway accounts&#151;there are other providers of
child trust fund accounts, including credit unions&#151;will be
familiar with this regime. We do not expect it to cause any
complication and so do not believe that the amendment is necessary. I
ask the Committee to resist
it.</div><a name="09020531000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000226"></a>Mr.

anomaly would be keenly felt by my constituents. With that, I beg to

have just tried, unsuccessfully, to make to the Bill. Subsection (7)
states:</div><a name="09020531000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
penalty must be paid within 30 days beginning with the date on which
the notice of the penalty was issued.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div><a name="09020531000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would
replace &#147;issued&#148; with &#147;received&#148;. I accept
that that change would not make much difference in most cases. However,
I am told that I will struggle to get back to my constituency later,
because the west country is covered in snow, and although I accept that
it is unlikely that snow will continue to lie deep on the ground for
the next month, one could imagine how an extreme weather event, as BBC
meteorologists have started to call them, or a postal strike could mean
that the 30-day period would be considerably reduced by the time
someone received the notice. Similarly, someone who lives in two places
or who works away from home for a period or who comes back from a
two-week holiday to find that a notice was issued in their absence will
have a reduced period in which to pay. In such cases, the period of 30
days, which sounds generous, might be less generous if taken from the
date of issue, rather than the date of receipt. I suspect that the
Economy Secretary will say that it will be difficult to measure the
date on which a notice is received, but, nevertheless, my purpose is to
try to ensure that no one is unfairly penalised, because of factors
outside their
control.</div><a name="09020531000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000228"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with what the
hon. Gentleman is trying to do. He wants the penalty charge to be
payable within 30 days of its receipt, rather than its issue from HMRC,
and he rightly points out that the notices could be delayed in transit.
If a big freeze-up lasted for a considerable time and post could not
get to account holders, HMRC would want to address that issue and, I
expect, allow some flexibility. The key reason why the time limit runs
from the date of issue is to provide certainty, because HMRC will know
that date without needing to investigate further.</div>
<a name="09020531000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be a
complete change from HMRC&#146;s normal operating procedures to do
what the hon. Gentleman suggests for saving gateway accounts. As he is
aware, there is frequently debate about whether documents have been
received, and creating potential for dispute between HMRC and people
who have been issued with penalty charges about when notices were
received and whether penalties have been paid within the permitted time
period would add unwarranted complexity. We do not expect that
penalties will be required on many occasions, and it is right to mirror
current provisions, such as those on the issuing of notices in relation
to child trust funds. Similar provisions on tax debts, which are
charged under section 100(3) of the Taxes Management Act 1970,
established the normal way of doing things. If the hon. Gentleman
thinks about this at any great length, he will appreciate the
difficulties of using the date of receipt, such as the lack of legal
certainty that would be involved in any dispute between parties. I
hope, therefore, that he will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09020531000178"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000229"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The Economic Secretary is helpful and if I were in
his shoes, I would take the same view. I am sympathetic to the
Government&#146;s position that there is greater clarity in the
current legislation, because it has allowed me to make a valid point. I
sign letters that are sent to me in big bundles from my constituency
office sometimes a few days after they have been dated, so I hope that
the Economic Secretary will do his best to ensure not only in this
legislation but more generally that HMRC does not routinely send out
letters or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>penalty notices several days after the letters have been dated. There is
no provision to prevent that from happening. HMRC could send out
letters several weeks later and people could be unreasonably penalised,
even though, in law, HMRC is entirely in the wrong. I hope that that
scenario is entirely hypothetical, and on that note, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="09020531000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government propose a minor amendment to subsection (2). Hon. Members
will know that the subsection sets out the requirement for the content
of the notice of appeal to be submitted by the appellant when an appeal
is made under clause 23. The amendment would restrict those
requirements so that they applied only to those saving gateway appeals
that concerned tax matters, and to tax and non-tax saving gateway
appeals in Northern Ireland. We intend that other saving gateway
appeals should be covered by the separate provision on this point, and
that was recently made in the tribunal procedure rules for the social
entitlement chapter of the first-tier tribunal. There is little
difference in substance between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>the requirements set out in this Bill and those in the tribunal
procedure rules. Both require that the notice of appeal be signed and
the grounds for appeal be specified. However, the Government believe it
neither necessary nor appropriate for the Bill to contain provision on
that point when provision has already been made in the tribunal
procedure rules. The rules can be amended in due course so that they
apply to saving gateway appeals where appropriate. The amendment would
remove any scope for confusion about which set of rules
apply.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000237"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> There is a somewhat ritualistic quality to these
amendments, in that they require subsequent changes to the Bill,
subject to the positive procedure. In a way, therefore, we are making a
more general point about the right of this House to scrutinise
legislation&#151;a point that parties in opposition tend to make with
greater zeal than those in government
do.</div><a name="09020531000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, on this occasion the amendments are slightly more than just
ritualistic, because the Committee will see that there are some
particularly high-profile provisions such as the 50p rate of Government
contribution&#151;we touched on that in our previous
discussions&#151;that will come back to this House for any changes
that the Government envisage ought to be made at a future date.
However, there are endless provisions for which that is not the case.
In fact, I think that I said on Second Reading that there are 32
clauses in the Bill and 29 delegated powers, so we are almost at the
point where what the Government get to decide on is greater than what
we are passing into law in this Committee and in the Commons
Chamber.</div>
<a name="09020531000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed in our deliberations on previous clauses, some of the powers
that the Government have taken upon themselves, without our having the
opportunity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>to consider them with any great certainty in this Committee, are quite
substantial and would affect the workings of the provision of the
saving gateway accounts and thereby affect our constituents. If the
Government are going to go down the path of allowing a huge amount of
flexibility, which is clearly the preferred option, when they come back
with changes in practice to the Bill, we, as Members of the House of
Commons, should have the opportunity to scrutinise those changes as
fully as we think appropriate.</div>
<a name="09020531000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000238"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I partly support the hon. Member for Taunton in his
amendments. On the first two, it is right that any changes to the tax
status of these accounts should be dealt with by affirmative resolution
not just in the first use of these powers but subsequently. We could
end up with a situation in which a future Government decided to tax the
income or the matching payment on these accounts without the
requirement to debate that measure in Parliament unless someone prays
against it. So, the key features of this Bill should be subject to
affirmative resolution when there are subsequent amendments.</div>
<a name="09020531000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
sceptical about the requirement for every subsequent adjustment to be
covered by affirmative resolution. We need to be pragmatic in deciding
where the use of affirmative resolution is appropriate and where it is
not. I am also minded to say that it is all very well for the hon.
Gentleman to propose these measures, but in the end, he or his
colleagues are required to turn up to the relevant debates. I found
that out in a debate on Monday afternoon, when it was just the Economic
Secretary and myself on the Front Benches, with no representative on
the Liberal Front Bench. So the hon. Gentleman should be very wary
about what he calls for in these
amendments.</div>
<a name="09020531000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000239"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As hon. Members appreciate, clause 27 relates to
the delegated powers in the Bill. We have debated these issues at
several points in this Committee already. It is clear that the Bill
contains a number of delegated powers. These amendments would not
remove the delegated powers, but they would affect the procedure to be
followed when they are used. It might therefore be helpful if I set out
the position as the Bill stands and the rationale behind it. As the
hon. Member for Fareham said regarding the amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Taunton, it simply would not be appropriate to deal
with every such proposal through the affirmative procedure. It would
not strike the appropriate balance, and we think that we have struck
the right balance.</div>
<a name="09020531000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally,
the first use of the delegated powers in the Bill will be subject to
the affirmative procedure, but subsequent uses will be subject to the
negative procedure, and hon. Members will be familiar with the process
by which they can pray against statutory instruments and debate them.
This approach is intended to allow appropriate parliamentary scrutiny
of the details of the saving gateway when it is introduced, and to
provide the subsequent flexibility to make minor or technical changes
to the scheme.</div>
<a name="09020531000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
five exceptions to the rule, however. The use of the order-making power
in subsection (5) will be subject to the negative procedure on each
use. The power allows an order to amend the list of enactments in
subsection (4), which may, by the regulations under subsection (3) be
applied to saving gateway appeals. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>This may be necessary to ensure that the appeals procedure for the
saving gateway remains consistent with other appeals regimes. Any
enactments that are added to the list in subsection (4) would have been
subject to full parliamentary scrutiny already, and that is a narrower
power, so the negative procedure is appropriate.</div>
<a name="09020531000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Four
delegated powers will be subject to the affirmative procedure on each
use. These include all three delegated powers on eligibility to the
saving gateway: the power in clause 3(1)(b) for regulations to set out
the UK connection that is required of a person to be eligible to open a
saving gateway account; the power in clause 3(4) for regulations to
prescribe the conditions that must be met for a person to be eligible
through entitlement to tax credits; and the power in clause 3(6) for an
order to amend the list of qualifying benefits and tax credits.
Eligibility is a central feature of the saving gateway, so it is right
that any change be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. The same is
true of the match rate&#151;the maturity payment amount that will be
earned for each pound saved. The power to set the amount under
regulations under clause 8(1) is, therefore, the fourth delegated power
that will be subject to the affirmative procedure on each
use.</div>
<a name="09020531000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would mean that the use of all the Bill&#146;s
regulation-making powers&#151;not just those four&#151;would be
subject to the affirmative procedure on each use, and, as I hope I have
explained, we do not believe that that would be appropriate. On the
point that the hon. Member for Fareham made about tax relief and
whether the affirmative procedure should be used every time, we have no
intention of changing the fact that saving gateway accounts will be tax
free. The powers might be used to reflect changes in tax legislation
and they are likely to be technical. On our general position, however,
we want the accounts to be tax free, and that is why the Bill is
structured as it is.</div>
<a name="09020531000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
rule of following the affirmative procedure for the powers&#146;
first use and the negative procedure on subsequent uses strikes the
right balance between ensuring that Parliament can fully scrutinise the
details&#151;we all appreciate that much of the Bill is left to the
details&#151;and, once scrutiny has taken place, having the
flexibility to make minor or technical subsequent changes to the scheme
through the negative procedure, which can be prayed against. We have
reached our position based on those reasons, so I hope that the hon.
Member for Taunton will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000240"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Without wishing to be disloyal to my colleagues, I
should clarify for the record that I was not due to serve on the
Committee. In centuries to come, when people read the account, they may
not appreciate how bad the weather was on Monday. It meant that quite a
few Members missed the proceedings in the House, although I was not one
of them; I was busy elsewhere in the
building.</div><a name="09020531000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the substantive point, I appreciate that the Economic Secretary has
sought to try to find a sensible position from which to pitch the
Government&#146;s stance on the matter, and I understand the logic of
his position. The hon. Member for Fareham made a reasonable point about
tax exemption, and although the Economic Secretary is entirely
trustworthy, it is a good idea in general to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>make the assumption that future Ministers might not always have the best
will of the House at heart. Nevertheless, I understand the Economic
Secretary&#146;s point, and having made my argument through my
amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09020531000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09020531000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09020531000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000241"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I have a quick question for my hon. Friend the
Economic Secretary that I am happy for him to answer in writing if he
cannot answer it immediately. Under subsection (2), the Government seem
to have a wide power to exercise discretion by regulation. How far can
that discretion extend? If I were to fail to convince my hon. Friend to
include recipients of carer&#146;s allowance in the Bill when we come
back to the matter on Report, would that discretion allow him to
include those recipients at a later date, without having to introduce
primary
legislation?</div><a name="09020531000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000242"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Very briefly, I shall explain subsection (2). It
provides that any order or regulation made under the delegated powers
given by the Bill may allow a person to exercise discretion in relation
to any matter, including residential, supplementary, consequential or
transitional provision or savings. It also provides for a person to
exercise discretion in relation to making different provision for
different cases. That is necessary to allow regulations or orders to
contain some flexibility. The power in clause 3(6) allows qualifying
benefits to be amended under the affirmative procedure. I think that my
hon. Friend will be looking to that clause, rather than clause 27, if
he wants to seek the remedy that he is
proposing.</div><a name="09020531000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause
27 ordered to stand part of the
Bill.</i></div><a name="09020531000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clauses

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">New
Clause
2</h4><a name="09020531000012"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Payment
of interest</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;There shall be
no requirement for providers of Saving Gateway accounts to pay
interest&#146;.&#151;<i class="I">(Mr.
Hoban.)</i></div><a name="09020531000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Brought
up, and read the First
time.</i></div><a name="09020531000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000243"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09020531000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether new clause 2 would add anything to the Bill.
However, it would make it explicit that it is permissible for interest
to be paid on saving gateway accounts, but that it is not a requirement
to do so. In part, the permissive nature relates to a comment that I
made in the debate on clause 15: if interest was required to be paid on
the accounts, they would not be sharia compliant. That would close off
the accounts to a significant part of the population with whom we want
to engage in terms of financial
inclusion.</div><a name="09020531000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had a debate with the various witnesses who gave evidence to us on that
point. There were two extremes&#151;perhaps that is not the right
word, because I do not think that I would ever accuse Teresa Perchard
of being extreme. Teresa took the view that interest should be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>paid on the accounts. Her perspective was that it would educate people
on the sort of terms that they could expect an account to have in the
future. I put a question to her about the requirement to pay interest
and she
said:</div><a name="09020531000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have strong views on this. If this product is designed to get people
who have not been saving into the savings habit and it does not include
the key feature that you would find in a standard savings account, you
are losing the opportunity to engage people with the idea that they
earn interest on the money that they put
aside.&#148;</div><a name="09020531000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
notwithstanding the fact that, with today&#146;s interest rates, the
amounts involved might be relatively small, the educational benefit
that comes with seeing how much interest is payable on one of these
accounts is important. People would also see that the matched amounts
were much more generous than the interest, and when they came to the
end of the two-year period, they would understand that they were moving
on to lower rates. That is what they should expect. They should not
expect another 50p-in-the-pound match in other, standard savings
products. Teresa saw this issue very much from the educational
aspect.</div><a name="09020531000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Brian
Pomeroy, who chairs the Government&#146;s Financial Inclusion
Taskforce said that he agreed in principle with the idea that interest
should be paid. However, he also made an important point when he
said:</div><a name="09020531000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be unfortunate if the Treasury were to mandate a rate of interest
and as a result killed off interest in being a
provider.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Saving
Gateway Accounts Public Bill Committee, </i>27 January 2009; c. 20,
Q40.]</div><a name="09020531000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
touched on this dilemma on Tuesday. Do we encourage as many people as
possible to provide this product by making the cost of provision as low
as possible, or do we set high standards&#151;whether on savings,
transferability or, in this case, the payment of interest&#151;that
force up the cost of the product, thereby restricting the number of
providers? The question is whether we want a monopoly on provision by
default or
design.</div><a name="09020531000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the afternoon sitting, it was interesting that one of the people who
expressed the need for a permissive Bill was Mark Lyonette, from the
Association of British Credit Unions. He understood the points about
the financial education benefit, but he said that, for this
marketplace, the motive was not necessarily the matching contribution
or the interest. Mark&#146;s experience of working with credit unions
suggested that many people save to provide a buffer for a rainy day. I
know from my discussions with the credit union to which I belong that
many people put aside relatively small amounts to provide that buffer.
They are not looking to earn interest, but simply want to put money
aside.</div>
<a name="09020531000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Adrian Coles,
from the Building Societies Association, felt that the interest rate
would not be relevant to a saver&#146;s decision on where to save or,
indeed, whether to save. A variety of views have been put forward, and
although I argued in favour of compulsion in the context of the product
defaulting to an ISA when it matures, I favour a more permissive
regime. I am mindful, however, of Teresa Perchard&#146;s point about
education, as that is part of the overall package.</div>
<a name="09020531000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
talked about this being a stand-alone product, but we need to ensure
that people will understand what the saving gateway product entails and
what they will move on to afterwards. One lesson that was learned from
the second pilot was the importance of having 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>financial education alongside these products and the value of using
third sector groups and others to help to encourage people to
save.</div>
<a name="09020531000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am content
with the permissive nature of the Bill, but I thought that the new
clause would give the Committee an opportunity to debate this issue, as
there is no other opportunity to do
so.</div><a name="09020531000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000244"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I have already made my key points, and I remind
my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary of them, so that he can address
them. An important point was made to us in evidence: if we are to
encourage people to get the saving habit, which is what these accounts
are for, it is necessary to pay some interest on them, so that people
understand that, once the Government have paid the bonus on maturity,
there is still a good reason for keeping money in a savings account and
adding to it from time to time, because interest will be
added.</div><a name="09020531000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
confess that I did not find the people from the banking industry who
gave evidence particularly sympathetic characters. Their cries of
poverty stretched credulity a little. By their own figures, this market
will be worth about &#163;250 million a year. Even at today&#146;s
rates of interest, a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the
typical annual percentage rate offered on personal loans gives them a
profit of &#163;20 million on the money that they will get free from
these savers and the Government.</div>
<a name="09020531000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#163;20 million of profit has to go to administering these accounts,
but that is not an insignificant amount of money for the banks to use
for that, given that the Bill is about building their future customer
base and encouraging people into the saving habit, which will stay with
them in the long term. Having done the paperwork involved in getting
people to open these accounts, the banks will not have to do it again
when they transfer the matured funds either into ISAs or some other
sort of savings account. That is another area of savings for
them.</div>
<a name="09020531000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if the
banks paid interest set at the current low rate, I estimate that they
would still make about &#163;14 million out of that
&#163;20 million, and they could use it to administer these accounts.
I appeal to my hon. Friend not to take the banks&#146; cry of poverty
and hardship too seriously when he is discussing whether interest
should be paid on these
accounts.</div><a name="09020531000141"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000245"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with interest
and a lot of sympathy. Would he consider another valid point? To give
people who hold saving gateway accounts a sense of what it is like to
be a saver beyond the two-year period, it would be a good idea if the
accounts bore some resemblance to a conventional savings account.
People could see the little increments. Even the fact that the pounds
do not round up, that there are a few pennies here and there and that
it all looks like the money is growing in that incremental way will
give the holders of these accounts, if they have no previous experience
of saving, a sense of what it is like to have a conventional savings
account. That may be beneficial as
well.</div><a name="09020531000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000246"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. This is
about teaching people how savings work and how beneficial to them
holding these accounts can be in the long term. I hope that they will
take that message very seriously.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div><a name="09020531000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to my
core point: I do not want my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to
think that the banks are not getting anything out of this. They are
getting something very considerable. They are getting free money to
help them to expand their customer base. Any other industry in this
country that could make a claim for getting free money to expand its
customer base would be falling over itself to get it. We have just had
a debate about the car industry, and we are essentially helping the car
industry to expand its customer base. I do not see how this is any
different. The banks should be doing their bit by making money
available.</div><a name="09020531000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
come back to the point made by the hon. Member for Taunton, perhaps the
banks will want to structure their interest differently, so that
someone who puts in their money regularly each month and does not
withdraw it in the meantime will get more interest than someone who
operates an account by putting in money and taking out money all the
time in a way that is difficult to administer. Perhaps someone who puts
in a lump sum at the start and keeps it there until the maturity period
will get a bigger rate of interest than someone who puts in money
differently. There are different ways of structuring the account, but I
encourage my hon. Friend to remember, as I am sure that he does, that
these accounts are about teaching people the benefits of saving. If we
are to do that, the banks, building societies and others should be
encouraged to pay interest on the
accounts.</div><a name="09020531000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000247"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is fair to say that there has been a healthy
debate on whether there should be a mandated rate of interest on saving
gateway accounts or whether, as in the Government&#146;s view, it
should be left to the banks, building societies and other potential
account providers to decide whether they wish to pay
interest.</div>
<a name="09020531000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain how we have reached the judgment that we have made. I note in
passing that my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet seems to have
made common cause with the right hon. Member for Wokingham, although
perhaps for different reasons, in wanting the compulsory approach. I
seem to remember his arguing on Second Reading that the payment of
interest should be compulsory, but I share the view expressed by the
hon. Member for Fareham: we should be permissive in this
area.</div><a name="09020531000180"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09020531000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me be clear that, in principle, the Government want to see account
providers offering rates on saving gateway accounts. We also want them
to offer good defaults for when accounts roll over after the two-year
period. We want to engender a market with a number of account providers
wanting to compete in offering saving gateway accounts. In those
circumstances, relatively few people will want to take out a saving
gateway account with no interest if an alternative product on the
market offered a good level of interest and a good default option after
the end of two years. At the moment we do not think that it is
appropriate to specify and mandate a rate of
interest.</div><a name="09020531000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that the match rate is by far the most important feature of
saving gateway accounts and is the biggest incentive to encouraging
individuals to open such accounts. That rate would dwarf any interest
that is likely to be awarded during a two-year period. That is the real
driver for the programme. However, I take 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>closely into account the comments made by Teresa Perchard of Citizens
Advice, and those of my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet and
others, which were that getting into the saving habit is about learning
about savings products. Having a savings product that is a gateway
account, which looks like an ordinary savings product, can have
benefits in that
regard.</div><a name="09020531000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000248"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I fear that some banks will rely on the generous
bonus as a way of attracting people into these accounts and that they
will take the same view as the bankers who gave evidence, which is that
any rate of interest that they could possibly offer will be dwarfed by
the bonus, so it is not worth paying it. They may then say,
&#147;Okay, we won&#146;t give you any interest, but we&#146;ll
transfer your money at the end of this account into a savings account
that gives a generous rate of interest.&#148; They might take that
approach, but we should not be encouraging them to rely on that big
bonus. We should be trying to put as much pressure on them as possible
at least to pay a low level of interest during the maturity
period.</div><a name="09020531000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000249"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand how my hon. Friend gets to that
point of view. As I have explained, the Government&#146;s preferred
position is to engender competition so that a wide range of
institutions participate and offer saving gateway accounts. We hope
that a number of those institutions will want to offer interest on
those accounts, as well as good default options, so that people wanting
to open a saving gateway account will have a choice of places to
go.</div><a name="09020531000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advice that I have received and the detailed work that we have done on
the cost of operating saving gateway accounts clearly shows that there
are costs involved in opening accounts for significant numbers of
people who will be saving relatively small amounts of money. I ask my
hon. Friend to take that into account. It is not as simple as he
suggests. He says that banks are being given free money to expand their
customer base, but it is not like
that.</div><a name="09020531000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000250"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> These will be my last words on this matter. The
banks seem to want to invest in children; their websites are currently
offering quite generous rates of interest by today&#146;s standards
for young people, who do put small amounts of money in and out, to
inculcate the saving habit in them. However, I do not see why their
attitude should be any different when they are operating the saving
gateway accounts. Banks invest in children because they are their
business of the future. Why should they not be encouraged to invest in
people who are eligible to open a saving gateway
account?</div><a name="09020531000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000251"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I certainly do want to encourage banks to offer
saving gateway accounts. I do not want to put them off; I want to
continue to listen to them when they say that significant business
issues will determine their decision whether to offer the accounts. The
Government are not credulous about that, and we will hold a detailed
dialogue with the banks to come to an understanding on their offering
of saving gateway accounts. Having talked to them, we remain of the
view that it is not the right approach to prescribe that interest must
be offered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>on saving gateway accounts. It is far better to create a market to
encourage a variety of providers. Our approach is the right
one.</div>
<a name="09020531000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
the comments made by the hon. Member for Fareham and the reason for his
new clause, which he correctly said does not add anything to the Bill.
I am happy to assure him that account providers will not find that the
regulations suddenly change, imposing on them a new requirement to pay
interest to account holders. That is the decision that we have
reached&#151;it is the settled view of the Government. However, that
does not mean that it would not be wise to provide flexibility in case
we change our minds in the future&#151;perhaps we will be persuaded
by the right hon. Member for Wokingham or my hon. Friend the Member for
South Thanet. That is why the legislation, and secondary legislation,
is so framed. However, were we to go down that road, we would want to
conduct a full consultation. We think that the Bill is far better as it
stands now, with its voluntary approach. Let us get these accounts up
and running and get people saving. We need to encourage that saving
habit. Let us try to create a market so that account providers will
want to offer attractive rates of interests as default positions. We
ought to proceed on that basis; that is the Government&#146;s
intention.</div><a name="09020531000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000252"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We have had a very useful debate about the role
that interest plays in such accounts and the economics of providing
them. I am keen to ensure that we have as many providers of such
accounts as possible. The cost issue weighed on the minds not only of
banks but of the Building Societies Association and the credit unions.
If we want financial mutuals to participate, they need to be confident
about the financial return. Often they are thinly capitalised compared
with banks. They do not necessarily have the wherewithal to open some
of these things. It is important to ensure that the provision is
attractive to a range of providers. However, I take on board the
comments of Teresa Perchard and Brian Pomeroy about education and
ensuring that people understand what a savings account will be like in
the future. That is an important part of the process. Given that, as I
said earlier, the new clause adds little, if not nothing, to the Bill,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
clause.</div><a name="09020531000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000253"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I was going to do this on a point of order, but I
am happy to speak to the question formally. We believe that the Saving
Gateway Accounts Bill offers an important opportunity to encourage
people of working age or on low incomes to acquire the saving habit. We
think that there are strong advantages in promoting this policy. It
only remains for me to thank you, Mr. Taylor, and
Mr. Bercow for the efficient way in which you chaired the
proceedings. I thank the Clerks for faithfully dealing with our
debates. I thank my Bill team for the sterling work that they have
done. I thank the hon. Members for Fareham and for Taunton for the
good-natured manner in which they have probed us on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>proposed legislation during Committee stage and I thank my hon. Friends
for their contributions to the debate. Our proceedings have not been
conducted through the best of weather, but we have had a good
turnout.</div><a name="09020531000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a high level of interest in saving gateway accounts and wide
cross-party support for them. That is to be welcomed. I am sure that on
Report and in the other place, the Bill will continue to progress in
good shape. I am sure that it will get on to the statute book and will
kick-start the saving habit for the
future.</div><a name="09020531000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000254"></a>Mr.

your co-Chairman, Mr. Bercow. I also thank the Clerks and
the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters for their
assistance.</div><a name="09020531000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister commented that only two Government amendments had been tabled
to the Bill. That is a tribute to the Bill team. Saving gateway
accounts were possibly easier to cast into legislation than the
proposals in the Banking Bill, which will come back to us on Tuesday
having been heavily amended in the Lords and the Commons. There has
been a great deal of consensus on this Bill. I wonder whether this is
the political equivalent to Stockholm syndrome for Opposition Members.
I am grateful for the way in which the Minister has engaged in the
debate. In contrast to many Public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>Bill Committees, Labour Back Benchers have seen fit to take part. They
are always very loyal in attending and usually in being very quiet. It
has been helpful to have participation from both
sides.</div><a name="09020531000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000255"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I was working on the basis that if I interrupted
enough, I would not be invited on to too many more Public Bill
Committees.</div><a name="09020531000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020531000256"></a>Mr.

for.</div><a name="09020531000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is widespread agreement on the Bill and we all share the aims of
encouraging a saving culture among those who feel excluded from saving.
We hope that it is successful in encouraging more people to enjoy the
benefits that most other people enjoy from having savings, such as
protection against uncertainty and the opportunity to provide for their
