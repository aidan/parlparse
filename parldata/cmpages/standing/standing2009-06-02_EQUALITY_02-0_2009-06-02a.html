<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000257"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good afternoon. I welcome everyone to the
Committee. At the outset, may I remind hon. Members and witnesses that
we are bound by the time divisions that were agreed to this morning?
That means that the first evidence session must end no later than 5 pm
and the second no later than 6 pm. I hope that I do not have to
interrupt hon. Members or witnesses in the middle of sentences. I will
try not to, but if I have to, you will have to forgive me, because I
will need to keep my eye on the time. First, we shall hear evidence
from representatives of Stonewall, Press For Change, the Runneymede
Trust and Race on the Agenda. Perhaps before hon. Members begin their
questioning, you could introduce yourselves to the Committee, starting
with Professor
Whittle.</div><a name="09060286000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> I am Professor Stephen Whittle. I am here in
my role as vice-president of Press For Change, which is the lobby group
for trans
people.</div><a name="09060286000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben
Summerskill:</b></i> I am Ben Summerskill from
Stonewall.</div><a name="09060286000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob

groups.</div><a name="09060286000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000258"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Lynne Featherstone will begin this
afternoon&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="09060286000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6666</b><a name="09060286000259"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): This is really
to Stonewall. I wondered what concerns Stonewall might have, if any,
about the new disparities that will be created by the Bill&#151;for
example, in terms of harassment, the exclusion of sexual orientation. I
would like your views on
that.</div><a name="09060286000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben
Summerskill:</b></i> I can certainly say on the issue of
harassment we are not convinced that there is a need for protection in
this area. Members of the Committee who have dealt with Stonewall in
the past will know that we tend only to ask for things where we can
provide hard evidence of need, and we tend then only to ask for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>prescriptions that might put things right. We are simply not
clear&#151;we have tested and have tested with counsel a series of
potential cases that might be picked up by harassment protection, and
we cannot find one that would not be picked up in these cases by points
that are covered by indirect or direct discrimination themselves. That
is our position. If anyone can provide us with a case&#151;no one has
been able to do this&#151;where the provision of goods and services
protections need extension in that area, we would, as you know, quite
happily support it but, as I said, we do have a history of only asking
for things that we clearly think are necessary. We are committed to
small government in that
sense.</div><a name="09060286000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000260"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> It is an area of concern. I know it is quite
hard to find precise examples, but I think one was given in which you
might be staying in a hotel where there was a poster that denigrated
homosexuals. That might be a case of harassment in a
way.</div><a name="09060286000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben
Summerskill:</b></i> The case you have cited comes from a
briefing that referred to a poster that had a rat on it, and the
legend, &#147;Homosexuals are as low as rats.&#148; We are not
aware of any circumstances where such a case has arisen. I can only
reiterate that we have a long history&#151;which I think people will
acknowledge&#151;of campaigning for legislative change, but only
where there is an identifiable, real-life mischief. I hope that all
members of the Committee will accept that we come to you only where
there are identifiable, real-life mischiefs that we want to put right.
We have not seen any genuine cases where we think that mischief could
be committed that would not be covered by existing
legislation.</div>
<a name="09060286000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000261"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> It does create an anxiety for me that there
will be a differential between some of the strands. Can I move on
quickly to Professor Stephen Whittle? Do you think that the Bill goes
far enough to protect the transgender community from discrimination,
and particularly those who choose to express their gender differently,
but do not want to go as far as gender reassignment?</div>
<a name="09060286000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> We feel very strongly that the Bill does not
go far enough. In fact, it will shortly be overtaken by European
concepts that are being developed in law at the moment. Although we
welcome the extension to people who are living permanently in their
preferred gender role without gender reassignment, as trans people who
have been there and gone through this, we recognise that our lives
change over a period of time depending on what sort of obligations and
workplaces we have. People cannot always make the decisions that they
want to make. We have an NHS that often makes people wait years to get
through the processes.</div>
<a name="09060286000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel
strongly that the Bill as it stands is reliant on the sense that people
are now living permanently in their new gender roles. The case of P
<i class="I">v.</i> S and Cornwall county council&#151;the original case that
gave permanent protection&#151;also included the notion of intending
to undergo gender reassignment, which typically is contained within
this definition. If we are going to recruit people who are intending to
undergo that, will we also include those who intend just to live
permanently in their new gender role? Will we include those who intend
to do something but have not quite made up their mind, or those who
change their mind? Once we start to go down those lines, we realise
that what we have is a characterisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>based on a put-upon definition, rather than the actual behaviour of
trans people. That definition could be reframed better to recognise the
diversity within the community, without providing huge problems for
people.</div>
<a name="09060286000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
Stonewall, we are clear that we do not want to seek help where there is
not a real need. We come to the courts or to Parliament only when there
is a real need. In the case of trans people, we think that there is a
need for protection, and the Bill does not go far
enough.</div>
<a name="09060286000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000262"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Because it is medically based?</div>
<a name="09060286000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> It is based on a particular limited idea.
The idea of then adding in an extra notion that is not gender
reassignment&#151;God knows what tribunals will make of it if there
is a definition of gender reassignment and then some people are not
undergoing gender reassignment. I can see the faces of some chairs of
the tribunal
now.</div><a name="09060286000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact is that trans people, who might be in a stage of life where they
just cross-dress part-time, get harassed, thrown out of shops, told
that they are not able to come into pubs or whatever. That goes right
through to people who have undergone gender reassignment and also face
those same difficulties.</div>
<a name="09060286000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000263"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Are you saying that there is a whole
spectrum in terms of transgender identity and that people should be
protected against discrimination wherever they are on that
spectrum?</div>
<a name="09060286000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> Absolutely. In fact, we would argue strongly
that we experience discrimination because other people think that we
look different. It is what those other people do, not what we do, that
creates that discrimination. Therefore, the Bill needs to refocus upon
what it is those other people see and react
to.</div><a name="09060286000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000264"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I am persuaded by your
argument.</div><a name="09060286000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><a name="09060286000265"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): If I might just follow up on
that, Professor Whittle, you may be aware that Dr. Harris and I are
veterans of the consideration of the Gender Recognition Act 2004. I
find very congenial your comment that there is no absolute point and
would just add&#151;perhaps you could confirm this&#151;that one of
the prerequisites of formally applying for a gender recognition
certificate is that one has lived in the assumed gender for a period of
time. Therefore, anything that has happened before is highly relevant
to the legal
process.</div><a name="09060286000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> Absolutely. People have to live for two
years permanently in their preferred gender role. People may not have
even started the medical process of gender reassignment at that point
because waiting lists are, for example, four years in Sheffield and 10
years in Leeds. People live permanently in their new gender role
without any medical intervention. The Bill technically covers them. We
think that a line needs to be drawn, particularly in respect of
single-sex services. If people are living permanently in their new
gender role, they should be covered; if not, they should not be
covered.</div><a name="09060286000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000266"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Given that, if this comes to court, it is likely
to involve a legal process, are you satisfied that you can come up with
a suitable watertight definition that reflects the diversity and
complexity of trans issues without actually making it impossible for
anyone to decide whether discrimination has taken
place?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div><a name="09060286000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> We have just spent the past week working
intensely on that, and I am off to Strasbourg tonight to talk to some
people there about it. We think that we have come up with a definition
that would work very well in a tribunal system. It would ensure that
only those people who really were covered would be able to make an
application, whether through a tribunal or a
court.</div><a name="09060286000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000267"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Okay. I have no doubt that you will want to share
that with the Committee in one form or
another.</div><a name="09060286000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I ask one other question, which is about juveniles? It surfaced in a
different context this morning. My impression is that trans people
under 18 and those who are contemplating their position are very much
under the radar of this legislation. Is that a concern for you, and can
we deal with them as
well?</div><a name="09060286000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> This is another of our big problem areas.
The legislation covers young people through various protections, but
the problem is that &#147;gender reassignment&#148; is an
absolutely inappropriate term to use in relation to young people. If
someone rings me up about their 11-year-old with cross-gendered
behaviour, and the school wants them out, what should I do? Should I
say, &#147;Let me speak to the 11-year-old,&#148; and then explain
that the child wants a sex change? Thirteen and 14-year-olds who make
that statement get entwined in a huge, goal-driven medical process that
does not let them get out, yet we know that 80 per cent. of young
people who manifest very cross-gendered behaviour will not grow up to
be trans but will grow up to be gay or
lesbian.</div><a name="09060286000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to rethink that. Again, we have come up with a phrase and a
definition that we think would suit. It is gender-varied and carefully
defined and would fit into the
framework.</div><a name="09060286000038"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><a name="09060286000268"></a><b class="B">Lyn
Brown</b> (West Ham) (Lab): This morning, I pressed on the
issue of the isolated bullied child in a school, and the possibility
that the teacher and ancillary staff colluded in or even instigated the
bullying, whether it be on grounds of religion, belief, sexual
orientation or gender variance. I asked who, in that case, would or
could take legal action on behalf of the child, and I was told that the
Equality and Human Rights Commission could or would do so. First, can I
have your take on that? What do you think? Do you think that that is
adequate? Do you think that the Bill should be strengthened in respect
of enforcement? Should it include provision for representative or class
action?</div><a name="09060286000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> First, the provision against harassment
really needs to be strengthened for young black kids. Our experience
from doing work for the equalities review and, since then, for the
European Union has been that bullying in school comes not just from
children. There is a significant problem with staff&#151;from
ancillary staff right up to the very senior staff in
schools.</div><a name="09060286000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we feel very strongly is that the power needs to be given for a
children&#146;s solicitor to step in and take a case on behalf of the
child, if need be. Just like in the matter of the ward of court, we are
talking about really serious issues here, in relation to a
child&#146;s future well-being. Our experience is that many parents
do not know how to do that, on the whole. They are too emotionally
involved and they want to protect their children&#151;so strongly
that they protect them from the courts, as well.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div><a name="09060286000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do feel it
needs to be strengthened. The Equality and Human Rights Commission
would be incredibly supportive on this; but it only has limited money
to do these cases. So far in the history of the EHRC there has only
been one trans case
supported.</div><a name="09060286000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000269"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> On a point of order, Lady Winterton. I should
briefly like to refer to the fact that I omitted the Parliamentary
Secretary, Government Equalities Office, from my list; perhaps I may
append her to it. For this purpose in particular we are extremely
grateful that she is on the Committee, with her expertise and
experience in these complex issues. I think that that will be helpful
to the
Committee.</div><a name="09060286000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><a name="09060286000270"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): A couple of things:
first, on positive action, there are two provisions in the Bill dealing
with that. Clause 152 is on the general issue, with which I have no
particular problem. The question I wanted to ask&#151;and I want to
see which witnesses want to deal with it&#151;is about clause 153,
which is about positive action on recruitment and promotion. The way it
is written in the explanatory note very much portrays it as being used
in a tie-break situation: in a narrow set of cases where the candidates
are equally qualified. On Second Reading it was put very much in that
way. The Bill talks about candidates who are &#147;as qualified
as&#148; each other, which, to my way of reading, is not quite the
same thing.</div>
<a name="09060286000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a
genuine tie-break and two equally qualified candidates meet the
requirements of the job in the same way, using one of the protected
characteristics as a tie-break to widen the diversity of the work force
seems to me acceptable. However, it also seems to me that the
likelihood of that happening very often, and of there being two equally
qualified candidates, is pretty slim. Equally, you cannot have a
general policy. That would clearly be unlawful. I just wanted to get
the take of the witnesses&#151;those who want to comment&#151;on
whether they think the clause will be of wide use, or whether it will
be used in those narrow tie-break situations. The reason I am concerned
is that I do not want it to be used to discriminate against other
groups of people. My experience is that that has a negative
effect&#151;the opposite effect to the one we want to see. I do not
know who wants to pick that up
first.</div><a name="09060286000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Berkeley:</b></i> I would be happy to. I think you are right
that there would not be that many occasions when people would be
equally qualified as somebody else. That is very difficult to prove. I
am not sure whether there would be two people, two candidates, who
would be exactly the same; but I do think it is an important provision
because this clarification, of what positive action is, is really
helpful. There has been in the past a huge amount of confusion, which
has led people to not engage in the more general positive action, or
have much guidance on what decisions they can make, so it is more an
enabling piece in the legislation which will enable people in those
rare cases to make that decision. But it is not, to me, going to be a
kind of revolution in terms of increasing the proportion of
disadvantaged groups that will take up
positions.</div><a name="09060286000046"></a>

better than the other, to pick someone who is less good? They are
qualified for the job&#151;it is not that they are not
qualified&#151;but they are not as good as someone else, and it is
purely on the basis of making your work force diverse. Do you think

that on that occasion.&#148; Much better is a sort of positive
action&#151;not positive in a legal sense. Several years ago the
Metropolitan police put up two adverts on the tube that said,

ask about the public sector duty, if that is okay with
colleagues&#151;in particular, the controversy over clause 143(1)(b).
I do not think there is any controversy over the first part, which is
the public sector duty to help &#147;eliminate discrimination,
harassment&#148; and so forth, or indeed the part that
says:</div><a name="09060286000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;foster

characteristic&#148;.</div><a name="09060286000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">But
there is the part that says &#147;advance equality of
opportunity&#148;, where it is controversial in respect of religion.
I want to ask the panel whether they can identify any examples that
would help rectify the inclusion of that duty&#151;a problem that is
based on the characteristics or needs of people who share a religion.
Perhaps they can point to one of the examples in the explanatory notes

can happily provide you with hard evidence. We would not be seeking a

were mischiefs to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>corrected. You probably need to direct that question to the faith and
belief organisations, which I am sure will have established hard
evidence if they want these provisions. It is not really for

80</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000275"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Let me explain why I think it might be for you.
The wording of the Bill implies that it should apply to the needs of
people, for example, who share a religion. People with religious views
often feel that their needs relate to the doctrine of that religion.
For example, they do not want to have a community where there might be
too much gambling for one religion, or gay nightclubs might be around
the place and they could argue that it is not fair on their needs,
which are not to see that sort of thing in their community according to
their strongly held and sincere religious views. Why are not their
needs not to have that &#147;shoved down their throat&#148; being
recognised by the relevant public authority? That has been cited in
some academic papers as one of the concerns that might emerge. Is that
something that you are aware of?</div>
<a name="09060286000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben
Summerskill:</b></i> Yes, I am mindful that these cases have
sometimes been cited in academic papers. I am not sure we have found
cases in the real world where these tensions would arise. Clearly, it
is exactly the same as the answer on harassment. If we were persuaded
that there were cases where they would arise, we might take a different
view. But it is really not our area of competence. As I said, it seems
to me that it is faith organisations that need to provide the evidence
of need for this provision.</div>

Harris:</b> What about the scenario where some religious
organisations are entitled to discriminate under the exemptions when
they are delivering services, as long as it is not mainly commercial?
Even on the grounds of sexual orientation, there is that exemption in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><a name="09060286000282"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): Thank you, Lady Winterton. To
build on some of the things that Evan Harris was saying, there are bits
of the public sector duty in clause 143 that I really like, such as the
part about fostering good relations, which is to be welcomed, but do
you feel that it puts an unfair burden on public authorities to try to
hold together the eight protected characteristics? Will they be forced
to choose between them and somehow create a hierarchy? How will they
resolve conflicts, or will there not be conflicts?</div>
<a name="09060286000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben
Summerskill:</b></i> Let me answer that in practical terms.
We now work with about 500 major employers, who employ about 5 million
people between them, and I think that two thirds of them are public
authorities. The vast majority of those employers support the proposals
in the Bill, and not necessarily for political reasons, with either a
small or capital P, but because they see a simplification and because
they see an opportunity better to deliver and tailor public services
right across the piece. Clearly it is quite proper that you should not
focus on just one area of equality.</div>
<a name="09060286000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it is
fair to say that where we have seen the biggest operational successes
in such areas, not just around issues of employment, but around service
delivery&#151;we have done some quite detailed work over five years
with the NHS in Scotland, which is now being mainstreamed right across
the Scottish health service&#151;that success came from encouraging
those organisations to see all their patients as being different. It
did not come from us going in with a series of strategies that related
simply to sexual orientation, or from saying that they should get in
someone who is an expert on race. I think the perception of a huge
number of public bodies&#151;Scottish Enterprise is another we work
with that springs to mind&#151;is that they see the prize of having a
bespoke capacity to deliver public services for everyone as the prize
contained within the public duty right across the board, rather than it
being a duty that cuts in eight different
directions.</div><a name="09060286000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Berkeley:</b></i> With or without the provisions in this
Bill, public authorities will have to deal with these conflicts and
resolve them anyway, so I hope that it gives them a space in which to
do that, and enables them to do so. Given the way in which various
equality organisations have managed to find spaces in which they can
work together, that is not impossible. It takes some work, but it is
not impossible and it can lead to some very positive changes, not just
on particular protected grounds, but right across the piece.</div>
<a name="09060286000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> I was going to add to that. I work with
public sector bodies, and there has been great enthusiasm, particularly
at local authority level, for putting together the public sector duty
obligations from the Equality Act 2006. We plan early work up in the
north and north-west of England, and perhaps it is a stronghold of
equal opportunities historically, but there has been absolute
enthusiasm for that, and some very positive experiences.</div>
<a name="09060286000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Theo
Gavrielides:</b></i> A similar question was asked when the
Human Rights Act 1998 was introduced. To answer your question fairly,
it will put pressure on public authorities to bring themselves up to
scratch. But that is not a reason to say that the Bill should not be
passed. In fact, it should be a reason to provide support for such
public authorities, whether it is training or guidance, to deliver and
implement the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="09060286000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">You spoke
about public authorities. One of our main concerns is that the duty
does not extend to organisations that will provide public services. I
am talking about the public functions definition in the Bill. The Bill
uses the Human Rights Act as a point of reference to define
&#147;public function&#148;. After five leading cases in the House
of Lords, a private Member&#146;s Bill that was proposed, the
recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and a
clear definition in that Committee&#146;s proposals under the recent
Bill of Rights discussion, we are disappointed to see a reference back
to the Human Rights Act. That means that a large majority of the
services will not be protecting some of the most vulnerable groups in
society. An example is the recent YL case in 2007, which involved an
84-year-old lady in a care home. The court said that under the current
definition of &#147;public function&#148;, that particular care
home, which was a private organisation, was not covered by the Human
Rights Act. As a result, the case was turned down. The case affected
300,000 elders in care homes.</div>
<a name="09060286000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
population of black and minority ethnic groups in care homes is even
more disproportionately represented. Black and Asian minority elders
sometimes do not have family or friends in this country. They also have
additional needs where there are language barriers, cultural needs or
dietary requirements. If they are not protected by equality
legislation, their rights, equality and dignity will be
breached.</div><a name="09060286000076"></a>

Mason:</b> On that point, may I ask you this? We also believe
in diversity, as well as equality, and trying to keep the two together.
Is it only individuals who can be diverse, or do you accept that care
homes may be diverse too, and you can have different kinds of care
homes, and people can choose which one to go
to?</div><a name="09060286000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Theo
Gavrielides:</b></i> Of course they can be diverse. The Bill
tries to encourage a mainstream culture of diversity and rights, not
just in public authorities, but in society more generally. My point was
slightly different&#151;it was about the scope of the Bill, and
ensuring that public authorities do not contract out public services in
a way that enables them to avoid their equality obligations under the
Bill. We have evidence to suggest that the BME, the black and Asian
minority ethnic groups in this country, and black boys and girls in
schools, in care and in academies, are hardly represented. We are
concerned that those services will not be covered by the Bill, which,
in the first place, was about tackling the persistent inequalities in
society.</div><a name="09060286000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000284"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> The problem that Theo is
pointing to was corrected in the health Bill. The gap that you just
referred to, rising from the cases of Heather <i class="I">v.</i> Leonard
Cheshire and YL, was filled. But I take your point about public
functions, which was unexpectedly interpreted narrowly by the court. Of
course, we are not entirely reliant on public functions. There is also
a list of public authorities in the Bill that will be covered by it,
and there will be additions to the list as time goes on. As you know,
there is now a duty on public procurers to reflect the public sector
duty in the way in which they procure goods and services from the
private sector. That is in the Bill. I am not suggesting that we have
perfected it, but almost all of the gap you perceive has been filled
in. I am sure you are making a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>good point, but I thought that those additions were helpful at this
stage. Thank you, Lady Winterton, and thanks to the next

Harris:</b> I shall have another go with Ben Summerskill from
Stonewall, if I may. I just want to get on the record his
interpretation of the Bill. On page E236 of the explanatory notes,
there is an example of what I am talking about. It
states:</div><a name="09060286000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
Church refuses to let out its hall for a Gay Pride celebration as it
considers that it would conflict with the strongly held religious
convictions of a significant number of its followers. This would not be
unlawful sexual orientation
discrimination.&#148;</div><a name="09060286000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
you think that that is correct? This is a chance to clarify your answer
from
before.</div><a name="09060286000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben
Summerskill:</b></i> With the greatest of respect, that is a
different question. I am happy to attempt to answer it. Our impression
is that as long as the church is letting out the premises in general,
the exemption does not apply. All the Bill will do is consolidate
existing law in that
area.</div><a name="09060286000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000286"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Right. So if it does something commercially to
anyone, even if its main or sole purpose is not commercial, it should
not be allowed to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation in that
way.</div><a name="09060286000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ben

92</b><a name="09060286000291"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): May I move on to the subject of
multiple discrimination? A recent Select Committee report pointed out
that the current legal framework was totally inadequate in addressing
cases of multiple discrimination. This Bill is the first opportunity to
address that. How important is it for the Bill to address multiple
discrimination? If you can, please give examples from your own
experience, so that we can understand the extent of the injustices that
are being done under the current system. I do not mind which of you
starts.</div><a name="09060286000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob
Berkeley:</b></i> I will start. It is crucial that the Bill
responds to the notion of multiple discrimination. As discrimination
becomes more complex and sophisticated, particular groups will not be
covered by a single protected ground approach. It has been relatively
difficult to find numerous accounts of situations in which multiple
discrimination applies. I suspect that, in part, that is because people
choose to go down one route or another and try to make a  case
on the basis of one ground and fail. From my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>experience, a black gay man faces a different set of prejudices to a
white gay man and other men. That would not be covered under this
legislation. That is a missed
opportunity.</div><a name="09060286000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Theo
Gavrielides:</b></i> I want to support what Runneymede just
said. The purpose of the Bill is to bring consistency and to address
persistent inequalities. Under the case law before 2004, you were able
to bring a case about multiple discrimination on two grounds, whether
it was race and gender or race and sexual orientation. After a case in
2004, you were not able to bring a multiple discrimination case. We
support the position of the Equality and Human Rights Commission that
two levels of discrimination are enough. We urge for a multiple
discrimination clause in the Bill. Otherwise, this would be another
missed opportunity, given the knowledge that we all have different
elements in our identities. We can be black and gay and we can be black
and disabled at the same time.</div>

two discriminations with very different burdens of proof? The word that
you used there of &#147;consistency&#148; is important because then
everyone knows exactly where they stand. Trying to ensure that there is
not a dumbing down of the standards of proof, which does not help
anyone, is something that will have to be addressed. Have you thought
about how we might address
that?</div><a name="09060286000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Theo

while women-only shortlists in the Labour party&#151;that is where

have not done very much to promote diversity in general. Not a single
woman has been successfully elected to Parliament from a women-only

single woman who is lesbian has been successfully elected to Parliament

has been elected. I use the word &#147;elected&#148; because there
is certain amount of sophistry about how all sorts of women have
benefited from women-only shortlists in what were unwinnable seats for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>to make provision for better representation, particularly given the very
serious under-representation of lesbian and gay people in the House of
Commons at present, could be extended in the way that it is allowed for
in terms of race and
disability.</div><a name="09060286000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Theo
Gavrielides:</b></i> I want to support what has just been
said. Of course we welcome the shortlist for women. However, if we go
back to the equalities review, which informed the Equality Bill and the
discrimination law review, it gives us dates by which the gaps will be
breached. One of the gaps that will probably never be breached is to
have a representative House and representative MPs and councils. We
want to see more black and minority ethnic groups being represented. We
want to see more gay groups. Again, we go back to the multiple
discrimination issue&#151;the BME groups can also be BME and gay
groups, or BME and disabled groups as
well.</div><a name="09060286000097"></a>

positive action. In practical terms, there is a series of things that
can be done to encourage people to engage in party politics&#151;even
though at the moment that is a challenge&#151;and to stand as
candidates in winnable seats under the current system. Clearly, it is
an issue that, in some cases, is being addressed in parallel to this
process by the Speaker&#146;s Conference, which is another terrain
for the discussion currently taking place. Clearly, we hope that it is
something that Members of the House of Commons&#151;without me being

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><a name="09060286000296"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): May I take us back to
the question of multiple discrimination, which John Howell was asking
about before? I am concerned because there is a clear intellectual
argument about why multiple discrimination is important&#151;we have
already had that very ably summarised. It is clearly a serious issue.
The problem that I have encountered until this afternoon has been in
asking a number of stakeholders in this area to provide me with
examples&#151;concrete, real world examples, rather than theoretical
ones, although there are some pretty good theoretical ones. It was not
until Mr. Gavrielides, just now, said that he had a useful
paper with examples that I had heard anyone bold enough to stand up and
say, &#147;I have got some.&#148; Would you please circulate that
to the Committee as promptly as possible, Mr.
Gavrielides?</div>
<a name="09060286000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">In advance of
that, could you tell us about those cases, which you were citing, that
were lost, post-2004&#151;I think that that is when you said the
courts changed the rules? The argument that I have had made to me was
that anyone who has had troubles with multiple discrimination since
then would have either won it or lost it on a single ground of
discrimination, whether or not they would have won it or lost it on a
multiple ground of discrimination&#151;that is to say, the outcome of
the case would not have been affected one way or another. Do the
examples that you have in your paper there, which you are going to cite
to us, disprove that assertion and show that it would have actually
made a difference to the outcome of those cases?</div>

Gavrielides:</b></i> There are some cases that you can bring
to court only as multiple discrimination cases&#151;you cannot bring
the cases to court as a single discrimination case; it has to be a
multiple discrimination issue, if that makes sense. The cases that I
have in front of me classify direct and indirect discrimination and
harassment, and combine cases such as gender and race&#151;I have a
few&#151;gender and age, gender and religion, and combinations of the
different so-called equality
strands.</div><a name="09060286000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000297"></a>John

or that they were brought on a single basis and lost, whereas in your
view they would have been run if they could be brought on a double
basis?</div><a name="09060286000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Theo

discrimination case, not as a single discrimination case, and were
lost&#151;after
1994.</div><a name="09060286000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Whittle.</div><a name="09060286000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Whittle:</b></i> It is very important to remember that if
someone brings a successful multiple discrimination case, they may well
have some sort of compensation for that from two different
sections&#151;two different parts, effectively&#151;and it may well
make a considerable difference to their potential life. Most
discrimination cases provide so little&#151;someone has lost their
job, but what the hell! It is a sort of baring chests exercise, almost.
However, when someone has experienced multiple discrimination and they
have brought both cases successfully, then their award is multiplied as
well. That can make a huge
difference.</div><a name="09060286000106"></a>

99</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000299"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I guess my point was not about the intellectual
logic of multiple discrimination existing, but whether people had
concrete examples of it existing in the real world. A final question on
this to any of the panel: how do you feel about the notion of limiting
multiple discrimination to just two grounds? We have all the different
strands of discrimination in the Equality Bill, so why limit it to only
two?</div><a name="09060286000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rob

limited to three, four or none at all, or just lump them all
in&#151;not that I think that anyone would necessarily qualify for
all of them; but, in theory, as many as

of the Fawcett Society, which is the UK&#146;s campaign for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000306"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to probe the witnesses on the issue of the
gender pay gap proposals in the Bill. At the moment, clause 73 gives
Ministers the power to make regulations without putting in a great deal
of detail about what those regulations might consist of. I know that
the Equality and Human Rights Commission is doing work on getting
agreement on the metrics and information that employers would have to
publish. It would be helpful if the witnesses could give the Committee
their thoughts on what might be
appropriate.</div><a name="09060286000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> First, let me point out that the provision is
due to take effect only in 2013. As I am sure the Committee is aware,
when the Equal Pay Act 1970 was introduced 39 years ago, there was
provision for organisations to have five years to put their houses in
order. Our view at Fawcett is that organisations in the UK have had a
very long time to put their houses in order, but we have one of the
widest gender pay gaps among EU countries. We would say that there
needs to be action much sooner than 2013.</div>
<a name="09060286000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, we welcome the provision to increase transparency in pay. One
reason why pay discrimination continues is that people simply do not
know that it is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>happening. We have called for tough preventative measures on pay
discrimination. We have called for a long time for mandatory pay audits
and for a requirement on all organisations to review their pay systems
to make sure that they stay within the law. There is a lot of myth
about what those pay audits would be and a lot of discussion as to
whether they are additional regulation. We would rather see them as a
health check to make sure that organisations are not breaking
pre-existing laws&#151;we would see them as a much more positive and
preventative approach.</div>
<a name="09060286000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why we are very strong in our call for that to be mandatory is that our
pay system is currently rather like a health and safety system that
allows workers to go on to a building site when there is a big hole in
the floor, with someone saying, &#147;When you fall through the hole,
give us a bell, and we&#146;ll protect you.&#148; That is how our
pay system is structured. It is up to an individual first to experience
the discrimination and then to be brave enough, rich enough and
long-lived enough to take up the case&#151;we know that cases take a
huge amount of time and have a big psychological cost for the
individuals involved. One reason why we argue for mandatory pay audits
is that that turns the argument upside down and puts a requirement on
organisations to prevent pay discrimination from happening in the first
place.</div>
<a name="09060286000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000307"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Just to come back on that, because I was not clear
enough at the beginning, if you were to do a pay audit, what
information would you publish? By the way, the Bill does give Ministers
the power to act on this&#151;it does not force them to wait until
2013. It is just that the Government have said that they do not intend
to make regulations yet. In terms of the kind of burden that the
provisions will impose, what exactly will you require people to publish
and will that information go to the heart of the matter? When we have
this debate, the question as to the size of the gender pay gap depends
to some extent on what you are comparing&#151;is it full-time with
full-time? Is it full-time with part-time? We have to be clear about
what we are comparing. Have you done any work on what you might
publish?</div>
<a name="09060286000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> Indeed, as have the Government. There is an
existing code of practice on equal pay that sets out an equal pay
review process, which we anticipate would continue. Although
organisations are not obliged to follow that code, the fact that they
have not done so can be taken as evidence in an employment tribunal. So
there is a code of good practice. That code sets out a full pay audit.
What you need to do is, first, to evaluate the skills and experience
that are required for jobs and then to check whether you are paying
individuals in equivalent jobs equivalent salaries. That is the system,
and you need to have a job evaluation system underneath it to make sure
that you do that full check of jobs. Historically, women&#146;s work
has tended to be undervalued, and there have been major cases around
equal value in the public sector. Because of the traditional
undervaluation of women&#146;s work, they have been paid less. The
occupations in which they are concentrated have historically been
undervalued. We already have provision that makes that illegal, but a
pay audit would make sure that you have the checks in place to make
sure that people are not discriminating. Is that clear
enough?</div>
<a name="09060286000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000308"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Yes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="09060286000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> We go some way with Fawcett on this. I would
start by saying that we welcome the debate. This is an important debate
about which way we should go and what is the most effective way of
making sure that we establish equal pay. As Katherine says, it is 39
years since the Equal Pay Act. It is now dead. It has not achieved
anything for a long time, and it is time that we re-examined the whole
question.</div>
<a name="09060286000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where I have
some differences with Katherine is that equal pay audits are only part
of the solution. We need to go much further than that. I would
certainly welcome&#151;as would the WNC&#151;a review of the cause
of the current position on equal pay, whether it is men and
women&#146;s different skills in the labour market, whether it is
women&#146;s segregation or whether it starts in education. We should
also look at the quality of work and training, and some of the history
that has established the present situation. A wider agenda than just
mandatory pay audits needs to be addressed. Although pay audits are
part of the solution, as a whole we need to have a much wider, in-depth
analysis of why the situation is as it is and why it has remained so
for 39 years, and why a solution has not been
achieved.</div><a name="09060286000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the point about the four years and I welcome the comment that it
does not have to be four years. If it looks as though businesses are
not responding voluntarily to identifying the problems, we will
obviously have to look at some sort of statutory development. Evidence
from history shows that, if you make the demands public and they are in
legislation, often cultural change follows the legislation. I really
believe that, and I hope that what is in the Bill will be achievable
and will actually
happen.</div><a name="09060286000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the other important aspects of equal pay is transparency. It is
absolutely essential that everyone knows the situation in a company. It
will make a big difference in terms of making people change their minds
and making sure that employers get embarrassed by a situation. We must
ask why so many companies have the secrecy clause. Is it because they
actually want to pay women less than they pay the man sitting next to
them&#151;for whatever reason? The transparency clause&#151;clause
72&#151;will help the process. It is terribly important that we have
it. As the Bill goes through, the debate will continue. We have not
come to a conclusion about its wording, but we welcome the debate
because it has to be had. I am not sure that just going down the road
of mandatory pay audits will satisfy the need. There is a wider need
than that.</div>
<a name="09060286000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000309"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Thank you.</div>
<a name="09060286000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> In terms of what regulations are put in
place, our view is that it is important to ensure that there is a focus
on the part-time gender pay gap. Looking at what specific information
is published and what metrics are used, we know from evidence that the
gender pay gap is significant when it comes to comparing women&#146;s
earnings on a part-time basis with men&#146;s earnings on a full-time
basis.</div><a name="09060286000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000310"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Can I just be clear about what you mean? When you
say &#147;the part-time pay gap&#148;, do you mean comparing men
working part-time with women working part-time, or women working
part-time with men working full- time?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="09060286000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> Women working part-time with men working
full-time.</div><a name="09060286000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000311"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> You think that that is an appropriate
comparison?</div><a name="09060286000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> Yes, we do. From our experience as a
front-line delivery organisation, we focus particularly on supporting
women with children back into the labour market when they have taken a
career break. We know that part-time opportunities are very few and far
between. We know that part-time work is often considered to be of low
value at low pay, and that there are not sufficient opportunities for
women who are looking to go into the labour market on a part-time
basis. Various data highlight that there are 500,000 women across the
UK who want to work, but who cannot find the kind of work that they
need to fit in with their caring responsibilities. We feel that if you
ignore the part-time gender pay gap, you are penalising a vast majority
of women with children who want to re-enter the work force. Therefore,
from our perspective, it is essential to include that.</div>
<a name="09060286000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
information is promoted is worth consideration, and our view is that it
is important to consider promoting the positive business benefits of
equality and diversity practices to employers. For instance, there
could be some sort of fair trade mark that would equate to the equality
and diversity agenda. Employers would be able to say that they are an
employer of choice and had responded to that.</div>
<a name="09060286000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We work with
a vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the other
issue for us is that legislation is only one part of this. There needs
to be a raft of measures in place to ensure that businesses,
particularly SMEs, that want to engage and offer greater opportunities
to women and men in their work force, can consider greater flexibility
in the workplace and are supported in getting access to the services
that they need. In our experience, it is essential that employers
understand the business benefits of flexibility within the workplace,
are able to see good examples of best practice and can act on it with
the services that exist to support them.</div>
<a name="09060286000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome
the recommendation that the initial stance would be on a voluntary
basis, but with very tight metrics and clear measurement. As people
have stated, if that is not implemented and we cannot measure change,
the view would be to move towards statutory
regulation.</div>
<a name="09060286000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000312"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Briefly on that point, I  am of the
view that if businesses have not done it in 39 years, I
cannot see that they will rush forward now. I wonder whether you have
any ideas about why business has been so slow to deal with this glaring
inequality.</div>
<a name="09060286000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> Some businesses discriminate knowingly. They do
it and get away with it because they know that an individual will
sacrifice their career and job if they choose to pursue an equal pay
case, because of the complexities of taking those cases. Unless they
are in a very highly paid occupation and the benefits of taking a case
are likely to be large, or they have strong union backing, it is very
unusual for an individual woman to take such cases. A lot of the people
who call us walk away from the situation feeling a huge amount of
disillusionment.</div>
<a name="09060286000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pay and
pregnancy discrimination tends to go hand in hand. Often, the last
thing that anybody is prepared to do when they have just had a baby is
to bring a joint 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>pay and pregnancy discrimination case. Some employers are simply bad
employers who break the law and know that they can get away with it.
They think that the risks and financial costs of addressing that are
higher than the risks of wittingly knowing that they are breaking the
law.</div>
<a name="09060286000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another group of employers where pay discrimination is hidden within
the system. That is because women and men are clustered in different
jobs. As I said, there is a historical reason for paying the people who
pack the meat in a factory differently from forklift drivers, even
though the skills and experience needed for those two jobs are
comparable. Because one job has been female dominated, it tends to be
lower paid than the one that has been male dominated. Those employers
are breaking the law and not necessarily realising it. That is why we
must require them to address that issue.</div>
<a name="09060286000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It breaks
down into those two cases. There are some bad employers getting away
with it and then, I suggest, there are a large number who discriminate
without knowing it. That is why transparency is the key.</div>
<a name="09060286000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> I want to pick up on the last point that
Katherine made about transparency. Having transparency in the Bill is
so important because once we disclose what some employers get up to,
they will not like it and will find that they have to conform in a way
that they did not expect. I believe that that lack of transparency has
been one of the reasons why we have not been able to achieve so much in
trying to get rid of the pay gap. However, a range of other factors
play a part. This relates to a much more social agenda and I will give
an example. I had a discussion with some women from the south-west,
where there were serious transport problems. We went to see the
Minister to talk about community buses. Because there is such
difficulty in transport, the women have to take a low-paid job that is
well below their skills&#151;it is the only thing that they are able
to get to. That is just one example, and a range of other social issues
have to be looked at as to why the pay gap has been
retained.</div><a name="09060286000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Katherine
made a point about the employment tribunals, and we know that there are
thousands of cases, but very few actually get heard. That is another

Featherstone:</b> If someone who thinks that they are paid
unequally takes a case, do you think that the necessity of having to
find a real comparator plays a part?</div>
<a name="09060286000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce

very much in favour of hypothetical comparators. We will have to see
how we progress that through the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000314"></a>Lynne

perhaps?</div><a name="09060286000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="09060286000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> I think that that makes a huge difference. The
other thing is that often, people have to take a case alone. If the
Bill had an ability for representative action, in addition to
hypothetical comparators, that would make a huge difference. Many
people whom we speak to, who have taken cases, say, &#147;I know it
is not going to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>make a difference to my life, but I am worried about the colleagues whom
I have left behind.&#148; Many of them would have left the employment
by that stage, because they know that there is a systemic problem, and
the ability to stand together to take cases is hugely
important.</div><a name="09060286000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000315"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I am sure that we will debate those kinds of
issues when we go through the Bill.</div>
<a name="09060286000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I just want to comment that in our
perspective, one of the reasons why business has been so slow is that
there are a huge number of myths, looking particularly at flexible and
part-time working, which has enabled more women to enter the labour
market after they have had children. In particular, there is a lack of
services that can help businesses to understand how to implement
flexible and part-time working. There are various specific examples,
such as how to design jobs that are part time and flexible and how to
train line managers in managing a flexible work force. The myth often
persists around the perceived regulatory cost of flexible and part-time
employees, which is not necessarily the
case.</div><a name="09060286000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000316"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thought that it was quite interesting when
Mark, through the Chair, asked you if you were comparing part-time
women with full-time men. There is obviously a huge differential. Once
you go part time, you are not considered&#151;the high jobs do not
come in part-time packages. What can I do in the Bill to help with
that? Is there some way? I understand that there is a whole raft of
things outside the Bill in terms of training, education and working
with employers. But is there anything in the legislation that you see
that we can help you with? You do not have to answer now, but think
about it. Inevitably, we will take the Bill through, and I am sure that
we will all welcome external things. I am just looking to see whether
there is something around that differential that we can work
on.</div><a name="09060286000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I think that there is a raft of measures
outside the Bill&#151;certainly, ring-fencing and ensuring that there
is a focus on auditing the part-time gender pay gap explicitly. In
other areas of the Bill, such as procurement, we certainly advocate
that in considering procuring good employers, there could be a
commitment from those employers to provide a percentage of part-time,
flexible jobs in their
organisation.</div><a name="09060286000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000317"></a>Lynne

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000318"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I just want to pick up on the point about the
gender pay gap. I was particularly interested in Baroness
Gould&#146;s point about there being many reasons for inequality in
pay. Discrimination clearly is an important one, and I think that
everyone in this room will be united in trying to find ways to sort
that out. I am just a little worried, though, about the pay audits.
Even if they are done in the way that Ms Rake was
describing&#151;following the guidelines to ensure that we are
comparing like to like&#151;is anyone on the panel worried? It might
lead to a situation where we move from false negatives, where women are
not able to bring cases when they should be able to, to a situation of
false positives, where firms may be blamed for inequality in pay, which
is not to do with discrimination. They might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>have done all the right things to ensure that they are not
discriminating intentionally or unintentionally&#151;following the
two classes of discrimination that Ms Rake described earlier&#151;but
the inequality is due to disadvantage or some other reason. Is there a
danger of that, or does the reporting guideline that Ms Rake described
avoid it entirely, meaning that we would get no false
positives?</div><a name="09060286000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> If you design the pay auditing system correctly
and as the code suggests, there is no danger of false
positives.</div><a name="09060286000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
raised the broader point of where the boundaries of responsibility for
individual employers and the state lie. Something that needs to be
developed with this legislation is a set of measures for the
Government&#146;s own delivery. Clearly, the Government should not
require other organisations to take action without making an equivalent
commitment to things such as making quality part-time work available,
improving structural provision to allow people to travel to the jobs
they want more successfully, ensuring that transitions into and out of
unemployment are supported appropriately, and child care provision.
There are problems with every one of those measures, and it is not
within the reach of an individual employer to address
them.</div><a name="09060286000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not take away from the case for pay audits, but it shows that
there must be an extended argument about the Government making a firm
commitment to addressing women&#146;s employment disadvantage more
generally, and to do so using all the tools they have. They should be
bold. We have a target to narrow the gender pay gap, but it does not
specify by when and by how much. That should be the first measure the
Government take to show that they are taking a lead by ensuring that
they provide the circumstances in which employers can pay and promote
women
effectively.</div><a name="09060286000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000319"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I will follow up on that in a second. Do the
other two panel members have a comment on the last
question?</div><a name="09060286000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> I do not disagree with that, although perhaps
I do not agree 100 per cent. with the conclusion. I think that it is
right. That is why, when I listed the things that I think cause
disadvantage, they were Government responsibilities and not employer
responsibilities. I agree with Katherine that alongside this there has
to be a focus on what the state and Government are doing to get over
some of the other problems. Some of that comes in other parts of the
Bill, not least in the socio-economic area, which I think could make a
big difference to women&#146;s lives and might assist an awful lot in
some of the areas I
listed.</div><a name="09060286000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
a gender point of view, we must ensure that we have girl and women
apprentices in training&#151;I do not think that we should have an
age barrier on apprentices&#151;as well as the concentration that we
tend to have on boys and men. We need to ensure that there is absolute
equality in such provisions that we make. Another area is paternity
leave. We should be looking not just at maternity leave but parental
leave, so that we try to get the balance right between men and women in
the work force and the facilities they
have.</div><a name="09060286000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> In terms of putting the emphasis on
employers, there is a limit to how much we can ask them to do. The
Government could step in to improve the business support services
available, particularly to small 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>businesses, through organisations such as Business Link. They could be
made to address explicitly issues of equality and diversity and to
ensure that they can provide adequate, accessible advice to businesses.
In many instances, we are looking at legislation in relation to gender
equality duty, but as you said, people will experience other areas of
inequality in businesses that are above and beyond the control of those
businesses, per se. Businesses need more support to help those
candidates, clients or employees get the support that they
need.</div><a name="09060286000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000320"></a>John
Penrose:</b> A final question on this. Let us assume that by
one means or another we manage to eradicate discrimination by employers
and that part of the gender pay gap goes tomorrow&#151;we have a
magic wand. How much of it would be left? Are we looking at a very
small proportion of the problem here, with the other factors that
contribute to the gender pay gap being much greater? Or is this by far
the biggest thing and will only a small amount of it be left to
address&#151;all the other issues which Baroness Gould was talking
about?</div><a name="09060286000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> Discrimination is a tricky thing. It is quite
difficult to observe directly, and as a former academic I know that it
is difficult to register and measure directly. However, when people
have decomposed the gender pay gap to look at the different elements
that contribute to it, discrimination is the largest factor of all, the
remaining factor. Having said that, there is an awful lot of penalty
attached to working part time, to motherhood, to discontinuous labour
market records, all of which are more familiar to women. But my belief
is that if organisations get good at addressing pay discrimination,
they also get good at diversity more generally, and promoting equality
for women.</div>
<a name="09060286000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where we see
good practice in private sector organisations, for example, they tend
not only to have pay auditing systems&#151;very successful
ones&#151;but they also tend to promote more women into senior
positions, have good flexible working policies, and have maternity and
paternity provisions above and beyond the statutory minimum. They do
that because they know that it delivers to them. In an economy that is
dependent upon human resources, it delivers the bottom line to them
because if they lose the skills of 52 per cent. of the population, they
will not be effective organisations. I think that good practice on pay
will feed through and make organisations wake up to a whole series of
issues that they have elsewhere. There will be all sorts of positive
benefits from addressing discrimination.</div>
<a name="09060286000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> Again, I do not have a disagreement with that.
I only make a couple of additional points. First, if we did
this&#151;taking the points that Katherine raised&#151;we would be
using women&#146;s skills far more effectively, which would only be
of benefit to the economy overall. Also, the removal of the pay gap
would make women more economically sound, which would benefit the
economy. It is a much wider agenda than just the pay gap&#151;the
consequences are much wider.</div>
<a name="09060286000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I support that, too. Under-utilising
women&#146;s skills has been proven to be a huge loss to the economy.
It is also a huge cost to the economy in terms of the cost of child
poverty to the Exchequer. There are definitely wider social
implications in being able to address this. I have two thoughts on the
gender pay gap 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>no longer existing. One is that we would still need to ensure that there
is sufficient volume of opportunity in terms of flexible work for new
women entering the labour market. We know that there is a huge dearth
of that at the moment. Addressing that through the gender pay gap
within individual organisations will go part-way, but we need
persistently to ensure that increasing opportunities exist.</div>
<a name="09060286000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
looking at flexible working practices for both fathers and mothers is
an essential ingredient in this to ensure that we are looking at a
change in work force culture going forward, which will enable both men
and women with caring responsibilities to balance work and home
life.</div>
<a name="09060286000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000321"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I pick up on this exchange first and ask one
question about that, and one on another issue? I will ask Emma first
and others may contribute. The question of access to employment seems
quite important&#151;particularly for women who may wish to work part
time, or return to work part time. On Second Reading I referred to an
article in <i class="I">Whitehall and Westminster</i><i class="I"> World</i> which talked
specifically about the record of the civil service in making jobs
available part time and advertising them as such. Could you tell us
from your experience whether that is changing culturally and whether it
is a problem concentrated in the public service, or is it also part of
a systemic problem throughout the employment of
women?</div><a name="09060286000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> Being an organisation working with 2,000
employers in London, our experience is that it is starting to change.
We are certainly seeing the impact of the recession changing a large
number of employers&#146; perceptions about part
time.</div>
<a name="09060286000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000322"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> So that is a positive as well as a
negative?</div><a name="09060286000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> That is a positive that we think needs to be
promoted by highlighting the business benefits and efficiency gains
that can currently be had in terms of part time, while moving forward
to create sustainable quality part-time jobs with progression that will
remain above and beyond the recession for women returners.</div>
<a name="09060286000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeing
a shift among SMEs, certainly in London, when the right messages are
put across and the right access to support is given, towards a
recognition that part-time work can be of value, and we know that there
is a lot of good practice in the public sector. The challenge is to
ensure that new jobs are created on a part-time and flexible basis, not
that jobs are negotiated once women are looking to return to an
existing
employer.</div><a name="09060286000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000323"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Are there any other
contributions?</div><a name="09060286000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> What Emma says is absolutely right. There is
evidence that employers who are taking on flexible working are
benefiting from it. They are finding greater efficiency and less
absenteeism, and all the evidence suggests that they are definitely now
in favour and supportive of promoting flexible working. That will be a
benefit.</div><a name="09060286000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> I want to make one quick comment about
legislative measures that might enable change to happen. Currently, you
have the right to request flexible working but only after you have been
in employment for a certain period of time, so the entry point is
critical. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>you have decided to change career after a break for looking after kids
or, indeed, elderly relatives, it is very difficult to negotiate at
that point. We think that day one rights to request part-time work
would be a significant
step.</div><a name="09060286000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other legislative change, which would feed into broader cultural
change, is extending rights to everybody, not just to parents. One of
the problems is in the terminology. &#147;Part-time&#148; is a
diminutive. It is compared with the norm, which is full-time. All of
this dates from the industrial revolution and the male-dominated,
male-designed workplace which, frankly, is totally anachronistic now.
We all contribute in different ways, virtually as well as physically in
the office, and do different hours. We need to get away from the notion
that there is the normal way of working, which is full-time, and then
there is the rest, which is part-time. Making the right to request
flexible working available to all would be part of a culture
change.</div><a name="09060286000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000324"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Thank you. My second question is a bit more of a
structural one. It struck me when I read the Bill that the attempt is
to bring together all the concepts of equality in one single process,
in one single house. In the interests of legal clarity and better
enforceability, I have no difficulty with
that.</div><a name="09060286000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
one anomaly, which the Fawcett Society dealt with in response to the
Green Paper, is the continuing inconsistency between the provisions of
the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. I want to unpack that
a bit for the Committee. Is your concern about what might be termed the
legal tidy-mindedness of the Bill, in the sense that it would be better
to have a one-stop shop for everything&#151;it is all expressed in
one Bill but in different provisions? Is there a formal
objection?</div><a name="09060286000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second possibility is that there are effects on what might be termed
the litigation enforcement role in relation to discrimination; that is,
you can have a different regime for pay and there can be breaches
there, and for advertising and employment law, which could be a
separate issue. Thirdly, is there a material issue about what actually
happens in the delivery of gender pay
equality?</div><a name="09060286000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I could just add a loop to that, to complicate it further, I know that
the Fawcett Society has gone on about the equal treatment amendment
directive, which deals with having no comparator, or a hypothetical
comparator. Could you unpack some of those issues? If we are to do a
once-in-a-lifetime job, ought we to be doing more than we are, and, if
so, how do we do
it?</div><a name="09060286000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> The Fawcett Society always asks for more, of
course, because we are very impatient with the rate of change in
achieving gender equality in respect of this issue and others, but you
put your finger on an important point. There has always been a dual
track in legislation with the 1970 and 1975 Acts. Obviously, tearing up
the Equal Pay Act is a very tricky thing to do politically, especially
a year in advance of its
anniversary&#151;</div><a name="09060286000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000325"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> If I might interpose for a moment, I think that
one of the arguments is that, because an implied contract is built in,
it gives greater
protection.</div><a name="09060286000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> Yes, it does on some levels, but that is not to
say that you could not write broader legislation that would maintain
the protection but do away with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>the contractual basis. We have long argued for the need to look
radically at this legislation. Indeed, the whole tone of equalities
legislation is beginning to change favourably, which is very welcome.
We strongly welcome the new gender duty&#151;the duty on public
bodies actively to promote equality&#151;and we have argued for an
extension of that into private organisations.</div>
<a name="09060286000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is part
of our argument about the Equal Pay Act. It was designed for its time,
and its life has very much come to an end. Inconsistencies remain
regarding the need for a real comparator in equal pay cases, for
example, and, as I understand it, regarding the current recommendations
on employment tribunals, which are able to make binding recommendations
on all other cases, but not in equal pay cases. That now seems totally
nonsensical, and one thing that we need to do in this and subsequent
legislation is to make sure that the strong contractual protection that
is offered in the Equal Pay Act is maintained, but that we do not
persist with these anomalies that weaken the cases that come through
the courts. We need better cure when they come through court, but we
also need to mirror the positive approach to equality that has happened
with the gender duty, and to make sure that that is in the provisions
on equal pay. That is why we argue that organisations need to prevent
pay discrimination from happening in the first place by using
mechanisms such as audit, which would be a preventive
measure.</div>
<a name="09060286000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> The Bill as a whole is, almost by default,
going to raise women&#146;s living standards overall. If you take
each part of the Bill and put them together as a package, I think that
is what you achieve and that is its real value. In terms of some of the
specifics, Katherine mentioned the gender duty that we currently have,
and the Women&#146;s National Commission supports the new equality
duty, but we are concerned. We will continue to argue that, when that
is looked at, which will be in terms of sector, not strands, the gender
duty concept is not lost, because it is terribly important that gender
goes across every strand.</div>
<a name="09060286000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000326"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Do you think there is a danger of
that?</div><a name="09060286000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> I hope not, but we do not know. There will be
consultation, and, obviously we will play our part by putting our
evidence into the consultation. In fact, we make sure that we maintain
a very strong gender element, because, as I say, it covers every strand
of the areas we are talking about; in every issue, women are involved.
For us, that is terribly important. I see the Bill like that, rather
than as something where I can pick out the differences in terms of
equal pay and sex discrimination. Of course, there are anomalies, which
I am hoping that the Bill will sort out, rather than the anomalies
continuing to exist.</div>
<a name="09060286000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specifics, on equal pay, society has changed from when the Equal Pay
Act came in. We have a different employment environment out there, and
we therefore need different legislation to counter
that.</div><a name="09060286000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I do not have much to contribute above and
beyond what my colleagues have said. Legislation is not necessarily a
core focus of our organisation, so I will leave that to my colleagues.
In answer to your question on what more the Bill could do, we advocate
assessing the 250 benchmark of the number of employees that an
organisation has to have in order to be open for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>an equal pay audit. We advocate looking to reduce that number, because
our understanding is that organisations that have 100-plus employees
often have a dedicated HR resource and therefore should potentially be
able to contribute their experience of auditing. If you do not consider
that, I think you are looking at missing out a huge proportion of
businesses in the UK, because we know that half the people in the UK
are employed in business with under 250
staff.</div><a name="09060286000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000327"></a>John
Mason:</b> I want to continue the point about comparators. You
all seemed quite optimistic, but perhaps I am more pessimistic. Having
been in Glasgow city council for a number of years, I found that
eventually the women home-help workers got to compare themselves with
the men city builders in building services, which was good because it
brought up the women. The council&#146;s problem was that it was
competing with the private sector, which was not operating under the
same bounds. So, you had one company employing men for building at a
higher rate and another company employing women at a lower rate for
home helps. The council ends up in an impossible position. Its answer
has been to chop itself into bits so that it can get round the equal
pay rules in the longer term. I just wonder about this. It is all built
on having a colleague. If organisations or employers are able to split
colleagues off from each other, does that make all of this
useless?</div><a name="09060286000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> The issue of contracted-out services and the
splitting of particular services that used to be within public sector
boundaries but now are run by smaller private organisations is
massively important. That is why the issue around hypothetical
comparators becomes so pressing&#151;you will not have an actual
colleague to compare yourself with. So, if there is a traditional and
historical under-evaluation of women&#146;s work, and it is a public
function that is being done by another organisation, that organisation
should still have a responsibility under the gender duty to promote
equality and to eliminate pay discrimination. Unless you get rid of the
provision that says that you have to have an actual comparator, you
disable that process. That is why it is so critical in the complex
world of contracted-out services to ensure that we get rid of the
anomaly that hampers those equal pay cases being taken. Your argument
is very well made, and it supports even more the need for hypothetical
comparators within equal pay
cases.</div><a name="09060286000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> Equal pay is the only area of discrimination
laws where claimants are not allowed to have a hypothetical comparator.
We are talking about the Equal Pay Act, and the Sex Discrimination Act
is a classic example of the incompatibility between the two Acts. We
feel that because of occupational segregation, if women are to be able
to make that challenge, we have to have hypothetical comparators. I
think&#151;and Emma may agree&#151;that it is particularly
important for part-time workers because who, in reality, are they going
to compare themselves with? The only way in which they will be able to
make a comparison is if they have some criteria from hypothetical
comparators. Therefore, there is a very strong case for them. My
understanding is&#151;and I stand corrected if this is
wrong&#151;that they are permissible under European
law.</div><a name="09060286000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I agree. It is essential that those
comparators are explored in further detail. With this issue, the devil
will be in the detail of how to determine  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>the comparisons. Certainly in relation to part-time, and to women coming
back into employment, having been in full-time and then looking to
renegotiate to part-time, we experienced an issue in relation to pro
rata. Part-time is not necessarily fully pro rata to the full-time
equivalent job that may well be done by another member of staff within
that organisation. Explicitly there, we need to be clear that if
part-time is properly pro rata, it means pound for
pound.</div><a name="09060286000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000328"></a>John
Mason:</b> Thank you. My second point concerns the public
sector equality duty where we are asking public authorities to take on
board all the  protective characteristics. Is that helpful to
yourselves and the issue that you are talking about, or is it less
relevant?</div><a name="09060286000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> The single duty needs to make sure that it
protects the characteristics of the existing duties in terms of the
specifics that are under the gender duty&#151;that will definitely
need to be carried over into the single duty. Legislatively, there is
no problem in having a single duty. I think that it makes it much
clearer for those organisations. Our concerns come much more from
on-the-ground practice of those bodies that are bound by the duty. We
have certainly had evidence from our work in the criminal justice
system, as elsewhere, that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of
what the duty means. A lot of organisations think that the gender duty
obliges them to treat women and men equally and provide exactly the
same services, when in fact the obligation is to produce circumstances
in which you can produce equality, so that you would have different
treatment in order to get to the same outcome. There is a big process
of education and sharing of best practice that needs to happen among
those agencies that are bound by the duties, which is not happening at
the moment.</div>
<a name="09060286000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Equality and Human Rights
Commission clearly needs to play a much more active role, both in
identifying where there is not compliance with the existing duties,
which unfortunately affects Whitehall, as it does our local
authorities, but also much more positively to make sure that
organisations learn from each other as to what the duties should be in
practice. I do not think we have any problem with the
legislative framework. The problem is on the ground, and
people&#146;s misunderstanding that this is about men and
women being treated the same, when actually it is about different
treatment in order to get the same outcome. That argument has not
necessarily been
understood.</div><a name="09060286000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> Absolutely. We believe that it is the right
direction to go, but as I said before, we have to be absolutely clear
that we do not lose anything that we currently have with the gender
duty. I do not think that has been examined in the way that it should
have been&#151;to find out what has actually happened on the
ground&#151;and we are trying to negotiate with the EHRC to do some
work for the Women&#146;s National Commission on what has happened in
terms of gender equality on the grounds of how much it has been
complied with, how much awareness there is and so on. I think that will
be very helpful when we get the public sector equality duty in helping
to provide proper guidance and proper awareness measures of what is
expected of the public services when that
happens.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div><a name="09060286000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also think
that, as part of that, there has to be transparency in the way the duty
is going to work so that people can see it working, in the way that
they do not see the gender duty working, except in some areas. That is
important.</div><a name="09060286000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the consequences of the gender duty&#151;Katherine touched on
it&#151;is that somehow there is the feeling that single-sex
activities are no longer relevant. If there is anything that I would
have liked to see in the Bill, it would have been a bit more strength
and emphasis on giving support to single-sex establishments such as
Rape Crisis to make sure that they do not get closed down, because
there is the feeling that somehow we are into a generic society and
therefore the individual organisations do not
matter.</div><a name="09060286000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that about the gender duty, the concept, where it is working, is
extremely good and we absolutely support it. When the Government gave
their evidence to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
Against Women, which they have to do every four years, this was one of
the key points that they made. The panel at the United Nations was
extremely favourable towards the actions the Government have taken and
said that it is a world-class model that they would actually use and
advertise for other countries to use. We have got a basis there. We
have to make sure that it works
well.</div><a name="09060286000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I endorse those points. I welcome the fact
that it is a very clear and simple way of bringing together a number of
measures. The key will be how to promote best practice and how to
unpack that for a large number of public sector organisations so that
they understand what they can do in practice to implement this, and how
then to measure those opportunities that are put to
them.</div><a name="09060286000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, looking at flexible working practices, a large number of
public sector employers have highlighted the fact that they offer
flexible working practices but the take-up within those organisations
needs to be clearly
monitored.</div><a name="09060286000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the socio-economic duty of public sector organisations, in
London we have seen some good examples of that working in practice and
those initiatives need to be better promoted. We know that with some of
the local authorities that we work with in Haringey there is an
emphasis on tackling child poverty, specifically in relation to
tackling inequality for women. There are initiatives looking at
providing services in PCTs and GP surgeries for women who face both
health inequality and poverty to be able to access welfare rights
services. Very practical initiatives, which I think can be promoted,
are very
valuable.</div><a name="09060286000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09060286000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000329"></a>The

Bearing it in mind that we have to keep an eye on the clock, perhaps
answers can be slightly shorter so that they can both get
in.</div><a name="09060286000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000330"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> Having worked for Women&#146;s Aid for many
years, I am aware that, under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, there
was an exemption in relation to employing only women. Baroness Gould,
are you suggesting that that is in question under the new Bill? Would
it be put at risk?</div>
<a name="09060286000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> There are provisions about single-sex activity
in respect of education and employment, and I would like to see them
extended to the much more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>necessary community-based activities. It cannot be along the lines of,
&#147;We&#146;ve been told that we have to operate generic
fund-raising and so on, so we are terribly sorry but money for your
Rape Crisis or women&#146;s centre is no longer
available.&#148;</div><a name="09060286000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities are using that argument and closing down such centres at a
substantial rate, although, to be fair, I have to say that more money
has gone into Rape Crisis, which has helped it in particular. However,
it has not changed the concept of local authorities and how they
perceive single-sex organisations, which I think are terribly
important.</div><a name="09060286000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have concentrated on women because that is what we do in the
Women&#146;s National Commission, but a number of men are asking for
men-only organisations, particularly health-type organisations, and
they have not been able to get funding for them. That is something we
should look at a little
more.</div><a name="09060286000213"></a>

124</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000331"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> Will you expand a bit on the idea of
representative actions? What benefits could that bring, for example, to
the recent single-status negotiations of local authorities? Many women
found it difficult, especially if they were not represented by their
trade union. Would such action have helped in that situation, for
example?</div><a name="09060286000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> Yes, certainly. It allows two things. First,
other organisations might take a case on behalf of the women if they
were not able to take a case themselves. It also allows women to stand
together much more effectively so that if the matter was not unionised,
a group of women could come together and either represent themselves or
be represented by an external body. If such a provision were included,
it could be incredibly
powerful.</div><a name="09060286000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> As I understand it, some work has already been
looked at to see whether representative action could now be built in
for some low-level cases. That would be very
helpful.</div><a name="09060286000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><b class="B"><a name="09060286000332"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Not long ago, Nicola Brewer of the Equality
and Human Rights Commission said that employers were rejecting women
and not even inviting them to interviews because of maternity benefits.
It is a sort of discrimination before people even get to work. For all
the reasons that we have just discussed about women having a hard time
in work, they are having a hard time getting into work. Do you think
that there is any room in the Bill for measures that would reduce
pre-work
barriers?</div><a name="09060286000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> One of the things in the Bill that we are
concerned about is the fact that it is a step back in pregnancy
discrimination. Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, there is simply
a provision to ensure that pregnant women are not treated less
favourably than anyone else, but according to the Bill there is a
reference to being treated less favourably than is reasonable. We are
strongly advocating that the &#147;than is reasonable&#148;
provision be removed because it is in contravention of European
Community directives and the Sex Discrimination Act. We hope that that
is a drafting error, rather than a deliberate
act.</div><a name="09060286000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
needs to be done to provide some basic leadership on the issue, so we
have written in association with a number of colleagues across the
voluntary sector to ask 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>Peter Mandelson to remind employers at this time that it is illegal, and
has been for many years, to discriminate against a woman because she is
pregnant or likely to become pregnant. Employers need to be reminded in
difficult times that they have to abide by basic employment law, so
there is some leadership, along with that
provision.</div><a name="09060286000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that &#147;reasonable&#148; clause is removed, we will have some
strong legislative protection against pregnancy and maternity-related
discrimination. The problem is a cultural one really, which is where
Government leadership is so critical in reminding people of the loss of
skills and the loss to the economy that would happen if we did not
offer pregnant women and those on maternity leave proper
protection.</div><a name="09060286000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
you cannot dissociate women&#146;s rights in employment from
mothers&#146; rights in employment&#151;most women at some point
become mothers. Even those who do not become mothers tend to be grouped
in the same
bracket&#151;</div><a name="09060286000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060286000333"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> It is discrimination against young
women.</div><a name="09060286000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katherine
Rake:</b></i> Exactly. It is basically discrimination against
women, so it is important that the Government send a strong signal,
both that they will remove the reasonableness test that appears to have
crept in and that they will not, culturally, tolerate that sort of
discrimination, even in difficult times.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="09060286000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joyce
Gould:</b></i> Briefly, the Women&#146;s National
Commission has also discussed the question particularly about
pregnancy&#151;people not being employed because they are pregnant or
might be pregnant, which is quite intolerable and not to be accepted. I
am delighted that people are writing to the Minister to say that it is
not something that should
happen.</div><a name="09060286000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of the &#147;reasonable&#148; clause, the
Women&#146;s National Commission held a roundtable&#151;last week,
I think&#151;when the issue was raised. Obviously, we shall be asking
the Government to look again at
&#147;reasonable&#148;.</div><a name="09060286000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Emma
Stewart:</b></i> I add more positive messages to highlight
the loss to business of an untapped talent pool that otherwise could be
utilised and contribute hugely to the economy. That is clearly
something for positive measures and initiatives outside the Bill that
we would
endorse.</div><a name="09060286000226"></a>
