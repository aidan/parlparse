<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): I beg to move amendment No. 177, in page 3, line 24, after `intentionally', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to enter land in defiance of the known wishes or instructions of the owner or occupier and while on that land'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like to know why the Bill's proposer does not support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): I shall address not only amendment No. 177, but the other amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) tabled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that, because of the way in which the amendments are grouped, he can speak only to amendment No. 177 at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Amendment No. 177 would allow hunting to continue if a landowner gave permission for a hunt to cross his land. That was not the House's intention on Second Reading, and it does reflect the tenor of our proceedings in Committee so far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier (Harborough):</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I ask for clarification. In January, we debated an amendment that was tabled by the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) and supported by the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter), who is no longer in his place. It dealt with intention. The Minister, despite his neutrality, voted for it. I cannot remember the amendment's number, but it related to clause 1. During the debate on the amendment, intention was discussed at length. Although the hon. Member for Worcester tabled the amendment, he voted against it. Are we entitled to a second debate on intention?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. It is for the Chair to decide whether undue repetition occurs. The hon. Member for Worcester has not spoken for long enough to enable me to make such a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I was simply asking for clarification. I did not make an aggressive point of order.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was not a point of order, nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman has received clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> To return to amendment No. 177, if the Committee agreed to allow hunting, provided that a landowner gave permission, it would do a disservice to the House, given its express desire on 28 November to ban hunting with dogs. It would also do a disservice to the majority of British people, who supported the view that hunting with dogs should be prohibited, even on land where permission for a hunt had been given. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am not sure whether it was recorded that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, who proposed the amendment, voted against it by shouting ``No''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish may wish to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The object of proposing amendments to the Committee is to make useful improvements to the Bill. I thought that the answer of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to the amendment was sufficient and that I should not press the matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There seems to be a spate of bogus points of order. I understand the jousting points that are being made, but would remind hon. Members that I do not have endless tolerance of bogus points of order. Indeed, there are so many points of order that I am confused about which amdendment we have reached.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 3, line 25, leave out `wild mammal' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`mammal which has been captured or trained for the purposes of hunting'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 175, in page 3, line 25, after `mammal', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`that has been bred or reared specifically for hunting'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> In order that we can make some progress, I would like to hear why my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester does not think that the amendments are suitable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I find the amendments rather obnoxious. If they were passed, the Bill would permit the hunting of animals which had been bred or reared specifically for that purpose. I can think of no more obnoxious practice, other than that of hunting wild mammals, than to breed animals only for the purpose of hunting them.
<P>
At present, there is some controversy about the use of artificial earths, which might encourage foxes to breed in an area known to a local hunt. Such use could be construed as enabling the provision of a known sport in a known venue. However, the amendment goes further. It would allow a hunt to breed an animal, release it some distance in front of the hounds, shout tally-ho and away the hunt would go. I cannot believe that the House would condone such actions and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 3, line 26, leave out `whether or not' and insert `provided'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 174, in page 3, line 26, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or death is caused by a' and insert `is caused by the'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The amendments relate to the question of whether it should be lawful for hunting to take place if the animal being hunted is not actually killed. That issue was raised earlier, but at that time we did not discuss whether the dogs could be muzzled. I do not think that it would usually be practical for beagles or hounds to be muzzled, but it might be practical in hare coursing. Anyone who has seen hares torn to bits by dogs who are turning and chasing them would find it totally unacceptable for that part of the sport to continue. I am not as convinced that if the dogs were muzzled it might not be possible for coursing to continue. I should like to hear my hon. Friend's comments on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Both amendments, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish confessed, would allow stag hunting in its current form to continue. Without repeating the arguments advanced in earlier sittings, it is clear that the Committee does not want stag hunting to continue. The evidence provided by Professor Patrick Bateson has shown that stag hunting is cruel because of the stress and strain that the animal is put under even though the dogs do not kill it. The amendments would allow stag hunting to continue and I cannot allow that to be included in the Bill.
<P>
Stag hunting is viewed as an obscene act by the vast majority of British people. Far more people oppose stag hunting than oppose fox or mink hunting. Some hon. Members who oppose the Bill are personally opposed to stag hunting. That shows how important it is that we defeat these amendments. We must give a clear signal that we want to protect not only foxes, hares and mink, but stags.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish is likely to have agreed with every word that he has just said?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Whether my hon. Friend agrees with me is entirely up to him. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) may be able to read his mind but I cannot and so I cannot answer that question honestly. This is a serious amendment. It has been tabled so that the Committee can debate it. I hope that it is defeated as soundly as possible. I urge the Committee to vote against the amendment.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 3, line 31, after `animal', insert `or property'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 182, in page 3, line 32, leave out `immediate'.
<P>
No. 181, in page 3, line 32, after `attack', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or likely to be attacked'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The amendments raise the question whether we should add to the defence of any person or domestic animals the right to defend property. I want to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester for his views on the foxes that cause nuisance to the people in the roads near me and in parts of my constituency. Unfotunately in Stockport, they have no wheeliebins, but traditional dustbins with black binliners inside. There is now a fairly thriving fox population in the area living mainly on the railway embankments and thieving from dustbins. It is annoying to get up in the morning to find that some enterprising fox has knocked the dustbin lid off and has rearranged the contents of the black binliner across the lawn. It appears that quite a few people keep dogs in their back gardens: one reason is to keep out intruders; the other is to stop foxes coming in and causing a nuisance.
<P>
I am not sure whether it would be a reasonable defence if a dog that has been put out to protect a dustbin attacks a fox. It is an odd example. I receive a huge number of letters telling me how people in towns do not understand the countryside but few people in the countryside understand how many foxes there are in urban areas. To say that foxes can be controlled only by hunting is nonsense--a hunt cannot career through urban areas to control the fox population. However, we do not want those who try to ensure that their property is kept neat and tidy, and keep a dog on it to deter foxes, to fall foul of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, I have the problem of black binliners being torn open, but I am never sure whether it is done by local cats, local dogs or foxes. However, such damage does not warrant allowing a pack of hounds down the local high street to deal with property being disturbed, binliners being opened and rubbish strewn across the garden. I made that point on Second Reading in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), who had a constituent whose two guinea pigs had been killed by an urban fox. The answer to the constituent's problem was not to allow hunting with dogs to continue, because the constituency of Vauxhall is hardly suitable terrain for hunting.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish suggested that a dog in the garden would be a deterrent to foxes. I do not know what the practice is in his constituency, but most of my constituents probably take their dog into the house in the evening, when urban foxes are around and likely to disturb binliners and other property. They certainly do not come in broad daylight, when the dog is more likely to be outside. In general, a dog is kept as a family pet rather than to stop foxes going into the back garden.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 180, 182 and 181 make it easier to justify continuing hunting as an activity. For example, amendment No. 180 talks about damage to property. If grass has been chewed on one's land, that could be construed as damage to property and therefore as justification for stag hunting. I argue against such a provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 182 seeks to leave out the word ``immediate''. If a rogue fox had caused a farmer a problem four weeks earlier, the farmer would be justified in having the hunt on his land to try to catch the nearest fox, which he could then say was the culprit. So, immediacy is important in any legislation that tries to tackle a pest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lembit &#214;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): Does the hon. Gentleman realise that that is not always feasible? However he feels about the sport of foxhunting, to press that point ties the hands of those who are trying to control foxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If I had the problem of foxes being a pest and attacking my poultry or sheep--I did not intend to mention pigs because the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) is not present--I would want it to be dealt with immediately. I would not want to wait weeks or months--certainly not until Boxing day--before the hunt came across my land so that ``pest control'' could be carried out. The very existence of the Boxing day hunt gives the impression that fox hunting is a sport rather than a form of pest control. I cannot be convinced that each year, on or about 24 or 25 December farmers suddenly suffer stock losses that justify hunts on 26 December. Immediacy is important in dealing with a pest. No one would want to wait four weeks, during which the fox inflicted damage on the poultry night after night, until the local hunt took its turn to be on one's land.
<P>
Amendment No. 181 would insert the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or likely to be attacked''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be difficult to prove that there was likely to be an attack. Merely having a fox earth a mile or so from one's farm does not guarantee the likelihood that one's farm stock will be attacked, although some people would argue that it did simply to justify continuing to hunt. It is doubtful that an attack would, of necessity, be likely to happen. This is confirmed by the report on research into the ecological and economic impact of foxes in Britain undertaken by the university of Bristol entitled, ``Is the fox a pest?'' I drew attention to the report briefly on Second Reading, but I make no apologies for doing so again. Part of its conclusion states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Foxes do not warrant their reputation as major pests of agriculture. Nationally, losses of lambs, piglets and poultry to foxes are insignificant relative to other causes of mortality.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The argument that foxes are the great pest in the countryside is false and it is used only as an excuse to justify hunting. If this group of amendments were accepted, those who hunt would try to justify their activity and would find it easy to do so. As the promoter of the Bill, I cannot allow that and so I must urge members of the Committee to vote against amendment No. 180.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am disappointed that my hon. Friend seems not to have much idea of the problems caused by dogs in some urban areas. Maybe I should urge him to do some canvassing in my constituency. A fair number of people keep vicious dogs in their back yards and often even approaching their front doors is a less-than-attractive prospect. I hoped that my hon. Friend would have thought a little more about the problem of urban foxes and the difficulties that they cause and about the real likelihood that occasionaly they will be attacked by Rottweilers, Alsatians and bigger dogs, which some of my constituents keep as guard dogs to deter foxes and other vermin.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Worcester. The first of three questions that have arisen is that of immediacy. It is a debate that needs better understanding and definition than we can give it now, particularly in the light of the amendments that we are considering. The numbers of animals killed by foxes has also arisen again, along with the question of whether foxes are pests. If the hon. Member for Worcester really wants to deal with that--I should be straying too far from the amendment if I discussed it now--we need to understand his reasons for thinking that foxes are not pests. Many people would witness against that view and it is dangerous for someone who is not directly involved in agriculture to make that judgment on behalf of people who are involved.
<P>
Compensation is an issue on which I should perhaps have tabled amendments, but which has only now occurred to me. If foxes do not take many animals, it would not be expensive.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): The hon. Gentleman returns to a matter that he mentioned previously--that for many people fox hunting is a method of pest control. Will he tell the Committee what percentage of foxes is controlled by hunting and what percentage is controlled by other methods?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> No, but I shall find out, if possible from more than one source of data, for a future sitting of the Committee. If not many animals have been taken by foxes, it should not be expensive for the Government to provide compensation. Presumably, the hon. Member for Worcester would not claim that not a single chicken or lamb had been lost to foxes. Such losses would become an additional cost to farmers under the Bill. I intend to table amendments on the matter either in Committee or on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish made it clear that dogs are kept in his constituency for other reasons than deterring foxes from damaging binliners. I do not think that he would invite his local hunt to come to the neighbourhood and charge up and down to find any urban fox that was causing a problem there.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &#214;pik) based his arguments on evidence that I assume he obtained from farmers. My evidence comes from scientific research and studies, in which farmers have been asked as part of a survey about the number of their losses. That evidence is obtained more widely than that of the hon. Gentleman, who, I guess, has done his research close to home, perhaps in his constituency. My research covers the United Kingdom. When the hon. Gentleman mentioned compensation I wondered, mischievously, whether that would be another spending commitment to be paid for out of a penny on income tax. I shall not mention that again.
<P>
If a fox is a pest to a farmer, I urge that the farmer should deal with it in the quickest and most humane manner. That is by shooting the fox, not by asking the local hunt to chase it some distance for people's entertainment. Shooting is the best way and I urge the hon. Gentleman to present that view to his local farmers.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 191, in page 3, line 37, leave out `close'.
<P>
I admit that I was not hopeful that my hon. Friend would concede to some of the previous amendments, but I hope that he will accept this one. Clause 5(2)(d) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use by a person of a single dog under his close control''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word ``close'' is nonsense. It is a word that is often used in legislation on dogs and it is a nightmare. People taking dogs on footpaths are supposed to have their dogs under close control, but no one knows what close control means. Does it mean on a lead? If so, that is what the legislation should state; if it does not, the dog obviously does not have to be on a lead. Should it be at someone's heel? Should the dog respond to commands efficiently, or is it perfectly permissible to have a dog whose response to commands is haphazard? There is tremendous vagueness in the phrase close control. Does it mean that the dog can be on an extending lead, when the dog may be about 100 yards away? The dog may be perfectly safe, but the lead is likely to trip up anyone walking on the footpath. Inserting ``close'' at this point adds nothing to the Bill. Unless the wording can be more precise, it should be removed from the Bill. I admit that the whole clause will probably be removed later, so it might be worthwhile to eliminate the vagueness now and to be precise about how someone who wants to use a dog to track an animal that has been injured or hurt in order to put it out of its misery can exercise close control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I confess that I am the owner of a dog and I use one of the extendable leads to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Is the dog under close control when the lead is reeled in, or when reeled out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> My dog in never under close control--it seems to have a mind of its own. The length of the lead is only about 15 metres, so there is not much chance--
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Fifteen metres?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Yes, when the dog is on a lead in the countryside--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Fifteen metres is quite a long distance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Yes, it is a reasonable distance. It is from where I am standing to the end of the Bench.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> That is lethal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I would not say lethal. It very much depends on who is going by and where one is walking.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to address the terms of the amendment, not the length of his dog's lead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If it would help the Committee, I could bring the lead to our next sitting and we could measure it. However, I certainly would not bring my dog.
<P>
To delete the word ``close'' would imply that loose control is acceptable. The hunt argues that it controls the hounds when they are chasing a fox, that they are under control and can be called back and pulled away from the fox. However, the Committee has heard evidence of hounds having run on to railway lines and been electrocuted because the fox went the wrong way. That is no form of control.
<P>
On Second Reading and in Committee, we heard evidence of hounds having gone across school playing fields and playgrounds used by three and four-year-olds.
<P>
That does not suggest that the hunt can control a hound or pack of hounds.
<P>
My view is that fox hounds are not controlled. The close control referred to in clause 5(2)(d) applies to dogs being used to track and locate a wounded animal so that it can be put out of its misery. For example, if a deer had been hit by a car, was disabled and needed to be killed, a dog could be used under close control--but only one or two dogs, not a pack of dogs. The quantity of dogs has as much to do with how well they can be controlled as with any other variable.
<P>
I urge that the amendment be rejected. In later sittings, we will consider how we can legislate for the tracking of wounded or disabled animals.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am pleased that my hon. Friend is having second thoughts. He keeps returning to fox hounds, but on many occasions people will chase foxes with other animals, particularly in hill areas.
<P>
In my absence, there was a long debate on the flushing out of foxes in mountainous areas. My hon. Friend must recognise that there is a problem in such areas. On the whole, the hunting that occurs along the Welsh borders and into north Wales does not involve people with horses. It involves people using dogs, often on a Saturday afternoon--I accept that it is partly a social activity--to chase foxes, with the aim of shooting them. They are not always the best shots, and some foxes get heavily peppered, but not killed. The foxes disappear into dense Forestry Commission land or piles of rocks, and it is unclear whether they are underground or merely weaving their way through the ground. In such situations, it is important that the badly injured fox is found and killed as quickly as possible.
<P>
Clause 5(2)(c) allows for the flushing out of foxes. It is important that if the fox is shot, but not killed, somebody can use a dog to go after the fox to ensure that it is dispatched as quickly as possible. It would be extremely difficult for a human being to follow the dog closely through the Forestry Commission land that I know or through piled-up rocks. My hon. Friend must study the issue carefully.

<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 3, line 49, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; or (f) falconry activities in the course of which a dog under the control of a falconer inadvertently chases, attacks, injures or kills a wild mammal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee long. Clause 5 lists specific circumstances in which what hunting means is made explicit. Clause 5(2)(e) specifically exempts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a draghunt in the course of which a dog inadvertently chases, attacks, injures or kills a wild mammal provided that the draghunt is registered''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so forth. The one activity that is not specifically provided for in the clause is falconry.
<P>
Let me make it clear that I hold no brief for falconry since the setting of one creature to kill another is always regrettable. However, the Bill is not designed to outlaw falconry; it deals specifically with deliberate acts of hunting with dogs. It would be consistent and fair to make it explicit that falconry activity, in the course of which a dog under the control of a falconer.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``inadvertently chases, attacks, injures or kills a wild mammal'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not covered by the Bill. There is an exact parallel between my proposed paragraph (f) and the current paragraph (e) on drag hunts. The amendment is a serious one and I hope that my temporary hon. Friends will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I have on board many of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and the Weald (Miss Widdecombe). The Bill is certainly not intended to outlaw falconry as a sport, regardless of my personal views or those of the right hon. Lady. However, if a dog is used to flush out a wild mammal such as rabbit to enable a bird of prey to kill it, the dog is not hunting a wild mammal as such. The offence under the Bill will be hunting wild mammals. There is no intent or deliberate motive behind the person controlling the bird of prey and the dog to hunt a wild mammal with dogs.
<P>
I urge the Committee to reject the amendment, but do so knowingly on the grounds that the clause is not intended to attack falconry--
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Will my temporary hon. Friend make explicit the precise difference between preventing and eventuality in the case of a drag hunt and preventing it in the case of falconry? If it is specified in one case, why should it not be specified in the other?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I will address that point. I intend to speak against the inclusion in clause 5 of drag hunting because it is not an offence under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> But it is the hon. Gentleman's Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is indeed. The fact that people who participate in drag hunting do not, by definition, hunt a wild mammal is important because it means that there is no need for them to be covered by the Bill. If one is drag hunting and following an artificial scent, one is not in pursuit of a wild mammal. I would apply the same logic to falconry in that the bird hunts the wild mammal. This is the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill; it does not relate to hunting with birds of prey.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am grateful to my temporary hon. Friend for his generosity in giving way. When I moved the amendment, I had no idea that he intended to delete the part of clause 5 on which it was based. I will draw his attention to the purpose of clause 5, unless he tells me that he wants to remove all of subsection (2) of that clause. Its purpose is to specify circumstances that may arise in which a mammal is flushed out and hunted or killed by a dog inadvertently as far as the owner is concerned because that is not what he had set the dog to do. The clause sets out circumstances that mean that the owner or controller of the dog will be protected under the Bill, which I would dearly love to become an Act.
<P>
If we are setting out those protections, why are we not also specifying the circumstances that can arise in falconry and drag hunting? I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the Bill is about hunting with dogs, not birds, but paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) set out circumstances in which a dog may chase or kill a wild mammal and allow people caught in those circumstances to be protected under the Bill. What is wrong with that? If there is nothing wrong, why do we not include falconry in the Bill?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I was not too clear about my intention with regard to clause 5 because I did not want to pre-empt the debate. I intend to introduce several new clauses that will replace paragraphs of subsection (2) where appropriate, so they are not being written out of the Bill, but will be introduced as new clauses.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Would falconers be protected under those new clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Falconers would be protected because they do not participate in hunting with dogs. There is no reason, therefore, why they need specifically to be exempted from the Bill. They will not commit an offence under the Bill. Many other exemptions could be listed, but that would be unnecessary because they would not be offences. If we did list them, we would end up with a massive Bill with lots of unnecessary exemptions. Falconry will be regarded in the same way as drag hunting. Falconers will not commit an offence under the Bill because they will not be deliberately hunting wild mammals with dogs.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Clause 5 should not stand part of the Bill--[Laughter.] I shall set out my reasons, although I am sure that that will provoke mockery from hon. Members who were not here this morning and who might have learnt something had they been. Those hon. Members were rebuked.
<P>
It was made clear at last week's sitting that new clause 3--which we debated, but did not vote on--replaces clause 5(1). I want to deal now with the exemptions under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).
<P>
The exemptions under paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) will be covered by new clauses. I am arguing that clause 5 should not stand part of the Bill because I am looking to replace its provisions with new clauses that are more tightly written.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does it not follow, therefore, that we have been wasting our time since 4.30 pm? I appreciate the point that those of us who were here this morning or last week or who read last week's Hansard for the Committee realise that new clause 3 will replace clause 1. However, the hon. Gentleman must have known that a new clause 5 was to be produced. He and his hon. Friends have been wasting time for the past 50 minutes. If he knew all along that clause 5 was not to be part of the Bill, what on earth have we been doing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not think for a moment that the Committee's deliberations could be construed as a complete waste of time. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to amendment No. 230, which is in my name and which is listed on the amendment paper for 18 February. It clearly states that my intention is to leave out clause 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I will not give way any more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Because I do not want to. Had the hon. Gentleman been diligent and gone through the amendments, he would have seen what I intended to do. The exemptions under paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) will be dealt with in new clauses.
<P>
Paragraph (b) deals with the defence argument. Scaring off a fox with a dog is not the same as hunting a fox, and a person who uses a dog to scare a fox off his land or away from his poultry will in no way be committing an offence under the Bill. Paragraph (b) is, therefore, a bit of an irrelevance and will not be necessary in a future clause.
<P>
Paragraph (e) deals with drag hunting. I must confess that drag hunting was originally included to make the point that it was the ideal substitute for those who wanted to participate in an equestrian activity or to follow the track of hounds through the countryside.

<P>

<B>Miss Widdicombe:</B> I am grateful to my temporary hon. Friend, but I am becoming more confused by the minute--[Interruption.] Yes, I am confused and I hope that my hon. Friend will make my confusion vanish.
<P>
As I understand it, the virtue of clause 5 is twofold. First, ``hunt'' is defined with its intentionality made specific. Secondly, the circumstances in which a dog could be hunting a mammal, but with no intentionality on the owner's part, are also made specific. If I have understood my hon. Friend--if I have not, I stand to be corrected--he proposes to replace clause 5 with new clause 3, which I shall not debate in case you leap up to rebuke me, Mr. O'Hara. I merely want to point out that if we are rejecting clause 5 in favour of new clause 3, then I have a problem.
<P>
New clause 3 states bluntly in its opening line:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person commits an offence if he hunts a wild mammal with a dog.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a different definition than in clause 5 and no exceptions are made, as they are in clause 5. Where is the definition and the specificity, which are the virtues of clause 5, in any of the hon. Gentleman's new clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> When we debated new clause 3 last week, it was clear that hunting would be understood in its everyday, common usage and that it is, by its nature, a deliberate act, so intention is automatically implied. If one hunts, one must intend to hunt--people do not accidentally organise a hunt meeting. That is the argument that has been put forward not only by me and by Anthony Scrivener QC, whom I know some people like to berate at every opportunity--
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> He has got it wrong so far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It has also been put forward by parliamentary counsel. On that advice, it was deemed that hunting is classed as a deliberate act and therefore intention is automatically implied. That is why drag hunting is safe--someone who is drag hunting is not deliberately hunting a wild mammal.
<P>
Drag hunters cannot, by definition, be found guilty of hunting a wild mammal, so there is little point, other than for political reasons, in retaining clause 5(e). Drag hunters already know that they will not be affected by the Bill, as is evident in conversations that I have had with their association. Members of the public know that drag hunting is, as far as I am concerned, the ideal substitute for people who enjoy the countryside, the chase or the ride. Because it is not an offence, there is no point in writing it into the Bill.
<P>
We should not accept clause 5 partly because new clause 3, which we have debated, covers subsection (1) and because subsection (2) will, where appropriate, be dealt with by new clauses that have been tabled, but are starred and cannot therefore be debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I share the confusion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald. She is a woman of formidable intellect and not often confused. I sympathise with her because this afternoon the hon. Member for Worcester has confused her.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to amendment No. 230, in which he proposes to omit clause 5. There is some consistency there, but unless I am mistaken, amendment No. 230 is not on your selection list, Mr. O'Hara. The hon. Gentleman therefore has a problem, because he has laid great stress on an amendment that removes from the Bill the one clause that he was happy to see in it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was minded to intervene for the benefit of the Committee before, but perhaps I ought to do so now. The Chair's view of what has been going on since the sitting commenced is that amendments in the names of various members of the Committee were selected. They insisted on moving the amendments and pressed several to a Division. Therefore, the hon. Member for Worcester had no option but to speak against them. The amendments were not his and it was not for him to withdraw them. The hon. Gentleman expressed his intention to argue that the clause should not stand part of the Bill because new clauses have been tabled. In defence of the hon. Gentleman, that is the Chair's view.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> What you have said, Mr. O'Hara, is extremely interesting, but with the greatest respect, it did not touch on my point, which has nothing whatever to do with the amendment of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, but everything to do with amendment No. 230, which has not been selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Surely you will confirm that tabling an amendment to remove a clause from the Bill is superfluous. Information is being given to the Committee. The question that a clause stand part of the Bill has to be put.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Precisely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am in danger of encouraging the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish to generate more heat than light. I cannot see that the complaint of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald has been resolved. The promoter argued fiercely in favour of the Bill on Second Reading and in the six weeks that it has taken to discover that clause 1 is defective. We have had more than an hour of debate on amendments, which he had or did not have to respond to. He is not required to respond and may offer no arguments--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish specifically asked the hon. Member for Worcester to respond. It would have been gross discourtesy for him not to reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am always delighted to engage in debate with the Chairman in any Committee. It is unusual for a Chairman to wish to descend from his Desk and--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us be clear. The hon. Gentleman is questioning Committee procedure over the past 63 minutes. The Chair is simply interpreting what has happened and what has been allowed to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not complaining about what you have allowed to happen, Mr. O'Hara. Had anything been said that was out of order, there is no question but that you would have stopped it. I am suggesting that it must be open for me to comment that, in the past hour or so, we have been discussing a clause that the hon. Member for Worcester included in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has spoken on the subject since being successful in the ballot, but now comes before us to say, ``I do not want clause 5 to be part of my Bill.'' Whether that is in order, out of order or somewhere in between is not material to my point, which is that every clause that we have considered has been fundamentally amended, thanks to the Home Office. The promoter now says that, despite our debate on clause 5, he does not want it in the Bill. I merely invite the public and members of the Committee to ponder that and ask themselves whether the past 70 minutes or so have been used sensibly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): The hon. and learned Gentleman has occupied at least seven of the past 65 minutes, but that is not the point that I wish to make. I realise that he is now the only Conservative to speak, after what happened this afternoon in the House to the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). It is a fact that the Committee is debating the clause for the first time. The hon. and learned Gentleman has repeatedly told the Committee and the House that the Committee took too long to consider clause 1. He now seems to suggest that it is taking too short a time to consider clause 5. Will he make up his mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> With the greatest respect, that is precisely what I have not said. It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman either did not understand my remarks, which may not be his fault, or did not listen.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): We have heard the hon. and learned Gentleman make the same arguments several times today. I think that he has done so because he fundamentally misunderstands what the Committee stage is all about. Hon. Members are sitting on the Committee and wished to sit on it, to examine the Bill line by line by line. I do not accept that any of that debate during the past few weeks has been wasted; it has been very valuable.
<P>
This morning, the hon. and learned Gentleman said that a good argument gets better with repetition. I put it to him that a bad one certainly does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Lady, for whose powers of intellect I have the most tremendous respect, said that the purpose of the Committee is to examine line by line by line. It has examined, line by line by line, a clause that the hon. Member for Worcester does not want in his Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Has not the Minister just messed it up and the Home Office not done its job in time? Has not that led to a lot of confusion about intentions and about what is contained in what clauses? It is a bit unfair to bash the poor hon. Member for Worcester for sins of his own Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I hate to intrude on private grief. My right hon. Friend and I are, I hope, people of firm views. When we are asked to listen to a debate that discusses line by line a clause that is, at the end of the debate, deemed to be defective and therefore needing replacement, I and the rest of the listening public are entitled to be a little perplexed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Briefly, the hon. Member for Worcester is assuming that I am not prepared to vote for the clause as it stands. I have some doubts about the proposed changes. The Committee started with a seven-clause Bill that explained to the general public what could and could not be done. It will probably end up with a 14-clause Bill with a minimalist approach. That approach must be questioned. There would have been advantages in leaving the clause as it was, and there will be advantages in leaving clause 6, the definition, and the relevant information, because it would ensure that the general public could understand the legislation. People will now have to read the blanks rather than the words.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I am extremely anxious about the changes to the clause. I have gone through the rest of the amendment paper, and seen the starred amendments, which as I understand it, were tabled yesterday, so the Chairman has not had time to include them in today's selection. I can see what the hon. Member for Worcester is trying to do. If the Committee gets rid of the clause, none of the exemptions will be in the Bill. The Committee has had many assurances about the quality of the Bill. I shall happily give way if the hon. Member for Worcester wants to give me an assurance. I fear that we will create a legalistic document, that will be hard for the public to understand. The Bill will no longer be simple.
<P>
Given the Home Office's prior complaints about the Bill, I do not understand how making the measure more vague about, for example, intentionality and the definition of hunting, will improve matters. I am not a lawyer and I am happy to give way if there is a simple explanation, but I am nervous about the transformation of the measure from a private Member's Bill to a product of draftspeople who are not represented in Committee.
<P>
The document bears no resemblance to the original Bill and I am worried about the interface between various clauses and about their consequences. I cannot ascertain whether their intention remains the same. I hope that the hon. Member for Worcester can assure me that we will not find ourselves in a quagmire, out of which the Minister will have to help us, which will cause the Bill to be redrafted for a second time.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that those who spoke on Second Reading, and many hon. Members who wanted to speak but could not, will be puzzled when they see the Bill in its new form and compare it with the measure that they considered last November?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I absolutely agree. That was to be my concluding point.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that hon. Members expect a Committee to scrutinise a Bill in detail and consider amendments before report? That happens to every Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I do not have a problem with that, but the Bill that hon. Members will see on report will look nothing like the document that they discussed on Second Reading. That makes me nervious because I cannot see the consequences for the big picture of changes to so many bits and pieces and of completely rewriting the Bill.
<P>
As I said at the beginning of our proceedings, I am not here to play games. I want an assurance from the hon. Member for Worcester about the consequences of redrafting the clauses, and of new clause 11, in the light of his proposal to abandon clause 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall point out one or two facts. The measure is not a Home Office Bill. Contributions from the Home Office have been confined to technical adjustments to the Bill. The principle of the measure has remained constant throughout our proceedings. On Second Reading, hon. Members voted on the principle of whether hunting with dogs should be allowed to continue. They left it to the Committee to examine the detail of the Bill. There is nothing unusual in that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is worried about aspects of clause 5 that will be removed. From previous conversations, I believe that he is especially anxious about flushing out. As he pointed out new clause 11 tackles that. Contrary to the claim of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that I had dispensed totally with clause 5, the provision has been replaced by others. New clause 11 is only one such provision. I reassure the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire that the funamental principles of the Bill remain unchanged. Flushing out will be an exemption.
<P>
We shall debate new clause 11 shortly. Therefore, I urge the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to support my proposal to replace clause 5.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, for having been out of the Committee for substantial parts of the proceedings. You will understand that events have taken place today that demanded my attention, both in the Chamber and elsewhere.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the point made by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald. She will accept that the Bill is not governed by the normal run of events in the House. It is unusual, although, as the hon. Lady has pointed out on previous occasions, not unprecedented, for the Government to be neutral on a Bill that has obtained the backing of the overwhelming majority of hon. Members.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My role is concerned with the technical defects of the Bill. I have been watching the Committee during the first five sittings to see whether amendments would emerge to deal with what we felt were deficiencies in the Bill. When it became clear, largely at the Committee's suggestion, that they were not emerging, we decided that it would be irresponsible for the Government not to take action to put the Bill in good order. Irrespective of whether they support or oppose the Bill, members of the Committee will agree that, once that decision was made, amendments and new clauses from parliamentary counsel came through fairly swiftly and have enabled us to have sensible debates.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall give way in a minute. I want to develop that point a little further.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough and others must understand that the underlying policy of the Bill is not the Government's policy but that of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester and those who support him. The Government's role is merely to develop amendments and/or new clauses that will enable that policy to be brought better into effect, so that in the event of a court case, for example, what my hon. Friend is trying to achieve will be more achievable.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am grateful to my hon. and temporary Friend, but this will not do and I think he knows it.
<P>
Government machinery exists for coping with Government intervention in private Member's Bills. As the Minister has conceded today, although he tried to argue with me last time, it is not unprecedented for the Government to be represented on a Committee in a neutral capacity to ensure coherent legislation that has the overwhelming backing of the House. That is not unusual. The Minister was in the Committee for sitting after sitting as we battled through a certain clause, and the issues that he finally said made that clause invalid had been raised time and time again.
<P>
The simple fact is that the Minister did not get his officials to produce the right answer in the right time for the Committee to have a sensible and coherent discussion. There is not much point in arguing about it, because we have argued the case once before, but there is now a chain effect of a mess, because the Home Office did not deal with things properly.
<P>
I remain utterly committed to the Bill. I am trying to be sympathetic to what the hon. Member for Worcester has put forward, but I too am now very nervous about what is being proposed. I am sorry that this is turning into a speech, not an intervention. I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara, that you did not cut me off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I disagree with the sentiments behind the right hon. Lady's intervention, but she will agree on reflection that at least one word was inaccurately applied--``unusual''. I concede that it is not unprecedented, but it is certainly unusual for a Government to take a neutral position on a Bill that has the overwhelming support of the House but then to have to correct drafting errors in the Bill. That was the difficulty. As soon as it became clear that the Committee was unlikely to remedy those defects, I moved as quickly as I could. I am not prepared to accept the right hon. Lady's criticism.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Will the Minister take one more intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I hope that it is brief.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Extremely brief. If my hon. and temporary Friend's Government do not learn to react to the unusual more quickly than they have shown they can do here, God help Britain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I simply corrected the right hon. Lady. She said that it was not unusual. I simply make the point that it is unusual, although not unprecedented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am concerned that those who could not speak on Second Reading will now be presented with a Bill that is different in principle to that which they were invited to consider then.--[Hon. Members: ``Not in principle!''] It differs both in principle and detail. Would the Minister bear in mind that the hon. Member for Worcester said that clause 5(2)(e) was there to make a particular point? Is legislation there to make a point or to reform or change the law? We are getting into extremely dangerous territory, not least because my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) is confused and is getting nervous, which is bad enough, but we are now faced with a clause that will be swept away from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> In my experience, the right hon. Lady is rarely confused and certainly never nervous. The hon. and learned Gentleman should bear in mind that the underlying policy--the principles if he likes--behind the Bill remains unaltered. They are those principles that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester included in the Bill at the outset. My role in this, because the Government remain neutral, is simply to enable the Home Office, through the use of parliamentary counsel, to deliver my hon. Friend's principles in the form of a technically competent Bill that can be discussed on Report. The present process, irrespective of anyone's views on the policy, will enable that to happen. Of course, it would have been better had we been able to do that at the beginning. It is unusual and we had to respond as the situation unfolded, rather than precipitately move in and turn the Bill into what would have been seen at that stage as a Government Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I have absolute faith in my hon. Friend's sponsorship of the Bill. I am not in the slightest bit nervous or confused. I know what he is trying to achieve. He has made that clear. He wants to remove clause 5 and replace it with new clauses because of Home Office advice that those matters are clearly taken into account--to hunt is a deliberate activity as one person cannot hunt by accident.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> May I remind the hon. Lady that on 12.55 pm on 28 November during Second Reading she said that this is not a bad Bill. She said that it was an excellent Bill and that its drafting had received compliments from the Public Bill Office. Does she withdraw those remarks.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Not at all. The Public Bill Office did compliment my hon. Friend on the Bill, but perhaps the Home Office has seniority here. The Home Office advice to my hon. Friend is that the points he made in clause 5 are covered. That advice should be accepted with absolute confidence.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill. I say that without any wish to be awkward to my hon. and temporary Friend the Member for Worcester. He has had a hard job to introduce a complex Bill, which is highly controversial and includes a lot of rather difficult definitions. He has made every effort to do so coherently.
<P>
The advice my hon. Friend has now received may be right, but an awful lot of the debate on Second Reading was consumed by the issue of intentionality. I will feel extremely nervous about a Bill that does not set about defining intentionality clearly and precisely. On Second Reading, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), the former Attorney-General, challenged the argument of intentionality and said that inadvertently allowing a dog to hunt could make someone guilty under the Bill. I replied to that challenge, on behalf of the hon. Member for Worcester, by referring to clause 5, which contains a reference to intentionality. I am now being invited to give up any appeal to a definition that might be comprehensible to the general public and to rely instead on a common-sense interpretation of the word ``hunt''. That is a second-best option. Hon. Members on both sides of the House must, like me, have received much correspondence asking whether this or that action would be caught by the Bill. Today I raised the issue of falconers. I see no harm in specifying the Bill that some categories of activity are not caught. Today's debate has not convinced me of the superiority of the proposed substitute provisions.
<P>
I do not want to be awkward--I am well aware of the problems caused by a Member on one's own side getting awkward--but I should find it hard to send the Bill back to the House without any provision on intentionality or any specific exemptions. I shall not join any vote against clause 5.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is the implication of what is, or may be, about to happen that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire was right?
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> No, he was utterly wrong. He is a distinguished lawyer, but when he raised the point, the definition in clause 5 made reference to intentionality. However, if that reference should be removed, he would become right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Would my right hon. Friend find it helpful if the Minister were to give the Home Office view about whether my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire was right?
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Whether the Minister can help, I do not know. On past performance, I suspect not, but he is a nice chap. I intend to rely on my own judgment, which is that clause 5, with the virtue of a definition relating to intentionality and a list of specific exemptions, is superior to what has subsequently been proposed. I may be wrong. I may later be persuaded that I have made a silly speech, but for the moment I do not think so, and I shall not support the removal of clause 5 from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I apologise for not being present this morning. I had to go to a funeral, at which my predecessor gave the address. My loyalties were torn, but I went there.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I was there too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Delighted to hear it. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald remembers the lesson from Ecclesiastes, that tells us that there is a time to keep silent and a time to speak. I have kept silent, but will speak now.
<P>
We must remember that tens of thousands of members of the public may have their lives changed by the Bill. People have been writing to me and ringing me since the major changes of last week, asking what on earth is going on. The hon. Member for Worcester must realise that those people are worried sick and that such major changes to a Bill after Second Reading make a mockery of Committee proceedings. Will he tell us whether he has any more big surprises for us?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I reassure my temporary right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald that I should not have adopted the new proposals on clause 5 had I not believed that new clause 3 would clearly define the offence relating to hunting. Given the work that has been done on the Bill since May when I adopted it, it is a cause dear to my heart and I would not allow difficulties of interpretation to be introduced into it.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Understandably, the right hon. Member for Maidstone and the Weald is concerned that removing ``intentionally''--the previous Attorney-General who intervened on Second Reading felt that it was a defect in the Bill--could lead to an innocent person being convicted of an offence. I believe that the right hon. Lady was a Home Office Minister in 1994.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe--indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> She was certainly a Member of Parliament when the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was passed. It provides a definition of the offence of rape, which does not mention the need for it to be intentional. Common sense dictates that it is impossible to rape someone inadvertently. Similarly, it is impossible to hunt inadvertently--people do not hunt by accident.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> May I say that it is indeed difficult to get a large hunt together by accident. That is common ground and not a problem between us. However, the problem remains when applied to hunting on a smaller scale.
<P>
We had a great debate earlier in which members of the Committee variously walked beagles and lurchers on the common and various things happened to them. We debated whether the various activities constituted hunting. Now a dog hunts and the issue is the innocence or otherwise of the person in control of the dog at the point of a hunt. I want the precise circumstances in which an individual is culpable to be specified in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will conclude on the point. She probably had good reason not to be, but I recall that the right hon. Lady was not present last Wednesday when we discussed whether a definition of hunting would be sustainable in the courts and whether it could be defined precisely in the Bill. My advice at that point was that it is better to rely on the ordinary meaning of the word ``hunt'', which is well understood and cannot be carried out accidentally. That definition would make success more likely in court when someone is prosecuted for breaking the spirit behind the Bill.
<P>
I stand by that advice, but I see that the right hon. Lady has a pained expression on her face. I ask her to accept my sincerity when I say that a prosecution will be more effective if the courts fall back on the ordinary and accepted meaning of hunting. That will be preferable to arcane disputes about the precise circumstances in which hunting becomes intentional.
<P>
I recognise that many circumstances may cause difficulties in theory, but in practice the good sense of a court will determine the instances in which deliberate hunting is not intended. Moreover, the prosecuting authorities will take such circumstances into account before an individual case is taken any further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Following that series of interventions--I shall gladly give way to the right hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> The Minister said that he was convinced that the clause meets the requirements. In an earlier debate at which I was present, there was a considerable interchange about the level of legal advice obtained and how it conflicted. Now I want to know exactly what legal advice has been taken and how many counsels have been consulted. Is there still a debate in the highest echelons of the legal profession over whether intentionality should be specified? If so, it will cause problems later. Will the Minister answer those questions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> The Minister may wish to answer and he will speak later. I will reply to some of the other points that have been raised.
<P>
After reading accounts of the deliberations of the House on 28 November or of those of the Committee, no one could be in any doubt about what the Bill's supporters mean by hunting, be it the organised hunt or people who deliberately set their lurchers to chase hares. Anyone who reads the Hansard reports will take comfort from the fact that that is what we mean by hunting with dogs.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire told the Committee that many people had contacted him--he is not listening, but he might learn something if he does--to express their concerns about accidental hunting. I listened to him carefully during business questions last week when he claimed that people at his local market had spoken to him last Wednesday about the price of beef and about beef on the bone. I was amazed to hear that as the hon. Gentleman was here in Committee last Wednesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has suggested that I told an untruth in the Chamber. That is a serious allegation. I did not say that I was at the market in Oswestry and Market Drayton: I said that I had spoken to people who had been at the market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I was certainly not accusing the hon. Gentleman of telling an untruth, but perhaps of exaggerating a point about that date to put a question to the Minister.
<P>
Our debates make it clear what we mean by hunting. The remarks of the former Attorney-General, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire, on 28 November were totally incorrect. He referred to rabbits and voles. They are rodents and, as such, are specifically excluded from the original Bill and will also be excluded from the current Bill. That is obvious from new clause 10.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee by speaking again, but will the Minister inform the Committee of the level, quality and amount of legal advice that he has taken? I cannot oblige him to answer, but it would be helpful to the Committee if he saw fit to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The right hon. Lady is well aware of the system. She has piloted legislation through the House on previous occasions.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Yes, and then we lost judgments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The right hon. Lady said it.
<P>
We have consulted parliamentary counsel. As she knows, it is not normal to take outside advice and we have not done so. The legal advisers at the Home Office are content that their understanding of the underlying policy intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester has been reflected in the advice that they provided and in the amendments and new clauses that have been drafted. That is the best information that I can give the right hon. Lady.
<P>
I could be drawn to debate the matters that we discussed last week on clause 1 and the new clause that was substituted, but I think that the right hon. Lady should read the account of that sitting again as some of her questions were answered during those exchanges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am amazed at the attention that the hon. Member for Worcester gives to my performances in the Chamber. Will he now answer my question? There are eight new clauses on the selection list, and 14 new clauses in the amendment paper. How many more surprises will the hon. Gentleman drag out of the hat? It is like taking a roller-coaster ride through a kaleidoscope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I have never taken such a ride. I do not know whether it is possible.
<P>
If more new clauses are drafted, they will be printed in good time in the relevant papers.
<P>

<CENTER>Clause 6</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Interpretation</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 231, in page 4, leave out lines 2 to 6.
<P>I move the amendment safe in the knowledge that it will require little debate because the terms ``captive animals'', ``domestic animals'' and ``draghunt'' have now been omitted from the rest of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 4, leave out lines 7 and 8 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```the occupier'' means any person who has control of land or is the agent of any such person or in the case of common land or a public park any member of the public lawfully there;'.</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 232, in page 4, line 7, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or is the agent of any such person'.]</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 199, in page 4, line 8, leave out from `the' to `but' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`duly appointed agent or a sub-agent or licensee of the agent'.</FONT></UL>
<p>
<b>Mr . Bennett:</b> The earlier debate about national parks concentrated on the Lake district, where there is a substantial amount of common land. Who counts as the occupier of common land and is it necessary to have an occupier for the legislation to work?
<p>
<b>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</b> I speak in favour of amendment No. 232 and against amendments Nos. 198 and 199, which would become obsolete if amendment No. 232 is agreed to.
<P>
I shall explain the technical reasons for amendment No. 232. It would omit certain words from the definition of ``occupier''. A new clause will set out the exemption for people invited on to land by the occupier.
<p>
The definition of ``owner'' in clause 6 is thought to be necessary, especially where an agent of an absent owner allows land to be used for hunting. Amendment No. 232 covers a technical matter and makes amendments Nos. 198 and 199 obsolete.
<p>
<b>Mr. Bennett:</b> My hon. Friend has not answered my question about common land where there is ambiguity about the owner and the occupier or occupiers. Will he explain that point?

<p>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> When a hunt is held on common land, those conducting it will be guilty of the offence.
<p>
<b>Mr. Garnier:</b> I am still convinced that the Minister has not answered his hon. Friend's question. Will he have another go?
<p>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> The amendment relates to control of land by an occupier. We shall introduce at a later stage a new clause relating to the definition of the term ``occupier'' for someone who occupies or uses common land. Common land will not, of course, have one specific owner, so perhaps the hon. and learned Member for Harborough is more comfortable with the term ``occupier''.
<P>
<b>Mr. Bennett:</b> I am not particularly happy about the amendment so perhaps it would be best at this stage to withdraw it and turn it into something different by next week, when more new clauses will have been selected. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<p>
Amendment made:
<p>
No. 232 in page 4, line 7, leave out
<p>
<ul><font size=-1>`or is the agent of any such person'.--[Michael J. Foster.]</font></ul>
<p>
<b>6.15 pm</b>
<p>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> I beg to move amemdment No, 233, in page 4, leave out lines 14 to 16.
<p>
The amendment would merely tidy up the Bill by omitting the definition ``pack of dogs'' in line 14 of clause 6.
<p>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 234, in page 4, line 17, leave out from `mammal''' to end of line 18 and insert
<p>
<ul><fon size=-1>`includes a wild mammal which has escaped, or been released, from captivity, and any mammal which is living wild.'.</font></ul>
<p>
<b>The Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment:
<P>
No. 208, in page 4, line 17, leave out from `feral' to end of line 18.
<p>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> Amendment No. 208 is necessary because the main amendment covers the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. Amendment No. 234 clarifies the term ``wild mammal''. It is an enabling measure to remove doubts about definition.
<p>
Amendment agreed to.
<p>
Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<p>
<center><b>Clause 7</b></center>
<p>
<center><b>Citation, consequential amendments, repeals, commencement and extent</b></center>
<P>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 235, in page 4, line 27, at end insert--
<p>
<ul><fon size=-1> `( ) Sections 4(1)(a) and (forfeiture: supplementary) do not extend to Scotland.'.</ul></font>
<p>
The amendment is similar to several others discussed this morning. It would bring the Bill, if enacted, into line with Scottish law and is a technical measure. Forfeiture does not extend to Scotland because there is already a provision in part II of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995.
<p>
Amendment agreed to.
<p>
Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<p>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> The Committee should be congratulated on its work today.
<p>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Michael J. Foster.]
