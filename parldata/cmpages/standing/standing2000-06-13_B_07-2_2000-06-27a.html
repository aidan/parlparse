<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Some of the amendments in this group have not been addressed. I shall deal with amendments Nos. 86, 237, 238 and 239 and new clauses 6 and 7. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) spoke to amendment No. 86 and the new clauses. The purpose of the other amendments is to remove the provisions that allow for qualifying candidates to form what is called a merit pool from which recruits will be selected. In effect, that would jettison the so-called 50:50 recruitment arrangement, as it would do away with the merit principle altogether. The Government consider it vital to retain that principle in selecting qualified candidates. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire clearly considers it wrong and unnecessary and has a preference for what could best be described as a programme of affirmative action to encourage under-represented groups to apply to join the police service. Those measures are set out in new clauses 6 and 7. 

<P>
The parties to the Good Friday agreement consider it imperative that a police service, if it is to be fully effective, should be representative of the community that it polices. There is nothing new in that. The RUC has for many years had a large number of affirmative action initiatives to tackle the lack of recruitment from nationalist communities. However, as things stand, the RUC is far from representative in terms of community background. There is no doubt that other groups, such as women, also suffer from under-representation, but the Catholic-Protestant imbalance was identified as, to quote paragraph 14.4 of the Patten report,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the most striking problem in the composition of the RUC.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Patten's recommendations on how to tackle the problem are unequivocal and the Government have sought to implement them. We are aware and have acknowledged, as did Patten, that there are many complex reasons for low Roman Catholic recruitment. The precursor to a new, stable beginning is an agreed political form and a more stable security situation. Within that context, the Government believe that we must make every possible effort to redress the imbalance in the RUC. I do not think that anything separates members of the Committee in terms of the desire to do so; it is how we set about doing so that is the problem.

<P>
Neither Patten nor the Government intend 50:50 recruitment to represent an alternative to affirmative action. The report clearly states in paragraph 15.2 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The key to making that police service representative of those communities-indeed the key to the successful implementation of nearly everything in this report-is that the leaders of communities now actively encourage their young people to  join the police.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report made specific recommendations to that effect and others on similar themes, such as the need to target under-represented groups in recruitment advertising. The RUC has for many years implemented a wide range of affirmative action measures specifically aimed at increasing the recruitment of under-represented groups.

<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> This is a wide-ranging clause. In future, might there be an opportunity for gender provision as well as the religious provision that predominates? When Patten was considering matters, the European Court had a rather restrictive policy. However, the subsequent decision in the Badeck case permitted extensive positive action in favour of the recruitment and promotion of women and left it up to national legislatures to implement such measures. I do not like to ask the Minister to do anything at the moment-he has enough on his plate-but might the Government consider that sympathetically in future stages of the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue-I am conscious of the debate. I have had meetings with the Women's Coalition, which
has made representations to the Committee. Unfortunately, it was too late to propose any amendments but I believe that the Government should put something in the Bill to signal their serious intention to address that point. I have in mind a statutory or regulatory requirement on the Chief Constable or the board, or both, to come up with an action plan to increase female representation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Since the Minister acknowledges that European law specifically excludes the kind of measure on religious balance that we are discussing, and since he accepts the point of the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) on the need for affirmative action with regard to sexual equality and gender balance, why can he not take the same approach towards religious balance?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is nothing to stop us doing that, but we have to go further in terms of religious balance, as Patten recognised.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman and I have had some useful exchanges and we have accepted some of his amendments-Christmas may have come early for him. I shall set our approach and the reasons behind it. On the gender issue, about 12 per cent. of RUC officers are female. Some argue that EU regulations give us the latitude to deal with the religious imbalance. That was the main issue that Patten addressed. It was clearly uppermost in his mind and was the driving force behind the efforts to get community representation within the RUC.

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): Is my hon. Friend concerned that if he follows the advice of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, he might end up being as unsuccessful in getting proper religious balance in the police service in Northern Ireland as the parliamentary Liberal Democrat party has been in getting gender balance within its ranks?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to join in a party political knockabout. I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend made; perhaps we will have other opportunities to address the issue. He has clearly upset the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire who is, I know, a sensitive soul, which is why I have been so kind to him throughout our procedures-to ensure that he feels welcome. However, I will leave the sentiments of my hon. Friend as he expressed them.

<P>
I shall set out the background to our approach. I know that the Committee will accept that there is a fundamental issue involved. Only about 8 per cent. of the Catholic community is represented in the RUC, so there is a considerable way to go in trying to tackle the issue and, I hope, to find answers to it. There is no question that individual members of the nationalist and Catholic community in Northern Ireland are victimised and pressured when they seek to join the RUC. Many stories can be told of people having to visit their family in the dead of night, or being able to meet them only outside Northern Ireland. That is clearly a manifestation of opinions that any right-minded person would object to, but resolving it does not of itself answer all the questions-as Patten picked up. That issue goes back to our earlier debate about the prevailing cultural attitudes. The nationalist community's approach to the RUC-right or wrong-is not for us to judge, but we must recognise that it exists and seek ways of tackling it.

<P>
We would all hope that the measure would not be necessary, but based on his examination of events elsewhere-primarily in the United States, where there was a racial imbalance in some communities-Patten concluded that it took a considerable time to resolve. Very progressive action was needed by the authorities, but because of the in-built hostility and suspicion in communities it still took time to make progress.

<P>
The lesson that can be learned is that what we suggest will not of itself produce results unless other changes take place. The removal of the threat of intimidation is vital and it is important that those who speak for and represent the interests of the Catholic community give the message that its members should seek to join the police service. That would take on board some of the arguments made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. If there was a tide of quality applicants to the RUC, people would be able to ask whether the legislative framework was necessary. Our judgment is that at present it is, but that does not negate the need for affirmative action as envisaged in new clauses 6 and 7. We need all the buttons to be pushed and switches to be flicked if we are to achieve the objectives.

<P>
The Police Federation has calculated that it would take 30 years to achieve a balance through such affirmative action. That is too long. We are aiming for a combined impact, to achieve a sharp boost in Catholic representation in the police service in the short term. Over time, such measures may become unnecessary- hence our intention to keep the recruitment procedure and the composition of the force under regular review.

<P>
Northern Ireland's Equality Commission has given its full backing to the concept of 50:50 recruitment against the background of the current political situation. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has constantly tried to specify the Equality Commission in the Bill as a body to be consulted. We consulted it, and it disagrees with him but agrees with the position adopted by the Government. I hope that he is therefore prepared to respect its opinion.

<P>
On amendment No. 11, I question the merit and the workability of applying the quota mechanism where such small numbers are involved. It would clearly have a negligible impact on overall composition and could in practical terms prove impossible to apply properly. More importantly, at such a low level, it virtually sets aside the merit principle.

<P>
For example, how could three-or five-vacancies be filled on anything approaching a 50:50 basis? Police support staff recruitment is generally not carried out on the basis of a large scale exercise to recruit pools of similarly qualified people. It is carried out geographically and covers a multitude of grades and skills. This diversity would be jeopardised by too rigid an application of the 50:50 recruitment principle. What if a finance director, a chief auditor, a personnel director and three personal secretaries are to be recruited? Personal secretaries are very influential, but could they sensibly be included with the heads of those services in terms of an aggregation approach? Would that serve Patten's aim? What if only Protestants apply for three scenes of crime photographers posts in Ballymena, or, later on, Catholics for IT support posts in Newry? When we discuss support services, we must recognise that we are dealing with small numbers of people and that to achieve a balance between them is difficult.

<P>
The other amendments have not been moved, and I am addressing the arguments that might have been advanced if hon. Members had been here in time to present them. They may not want to present those arguments after hearing mine.

<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The figure 10, in line 30 of the clause, is analogous to the figure specified in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. Under article 48(2) of the measure, community background composition is not required of private sector employers. I accept that the two pieces of legislation are not exactly comparable. The Government have an open mind about that figure, if good arguments are presented for raising or lowering it, or for introducing flexibility. We have done our best to meet the requirements of the Patten report in that respect. Others have argued for a figure of 2; we have set it at 10, but the matter may be debated. However, we must bear in mind the principles that apply to private sector organisations in respect of community background composition. The Government are not adopting an unreasonable position in using the figure set in existing legislation. It is not a direct comparator, but it may be the best one around. Although I am inclined to do so, I hesitate to ask the Committee to resist the amendments, as we have not heard all the arguments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister has my every sympathy and support in his desire to increase the number of Roman Catholic policemen in the Northern Ireland police service, and I suspect that the Committee as a whole will express that view. I have not the slightest doubt that those people are under-represented and should be represented to a greater extent. Speaking personally, as I said on Second Reading, I would not be at all bothered if they came to represent more than 50 per cent. of the Northern Ireland police service because it happened to be a fertile area in which they could find employment. However, I think that the Government are taking leave of their senses in introducing a piece of positive discrimination of the type that we have consistently resisted at any level within the United Kingdom.

<P>
I believe that the measure is in contravention of two areas of law. First, the Minister knows and has accepted that it will be in breach of European law. The United Kingdom is, apparently, going to seek a derogation. It is noteworthy that the Minister has not explained how the Government intend to justify that, given that we signed up to the law in the Amsterdam treaty. I would be interested to hear from him on that subject.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are not seeking a derogation. The hon. Gentleman cannot have listened to previous explanations. We will, in consultation with our European partners, try to find a way of dealing with the directive to which he refers. My experience is that, when we discuss Northern Ireland with our European partners, they are very sympathetic to measures that will help the peace process. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is pro or anti-European, but I hope he recognises that we have good relationships with our European partners. They are sympathetic, and we are not seeking a derogation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am not entirely reassured by the Minister's comment. Is he suggesting that the European Union is prepared to bend the rules if it thinks it is correct to do so? Leaving aside what the European Court may think of that, that is not the issue that has bothered me most. We will be in breach of the European convention on human rights, which is in the process of being incorporated into Northern Ireland legislation and will be fully incorporated on 2 October this year. I shall amplify that briefly, but I do not want to labour the matter-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister had better hear what I have to say before he intervenes.

<P>
Under article 9, there is freedom of thought, conscience and religion. People must have the right and the freedom to practice their religion and my interpretation of the convention is that if a person is prevented by indirect means from doing so-by discrimination in the workplace, for example-that can constitute denial of that freedom. That is enshrined in article 14 on the prohibition of discrimination.

<P>
The mind boggles when one thinks of the likely permutations that will emerge from the Bill. It will create a pool, into which many individuals will be poured. The Minister will agree with me that the 50:50 split in no way represents the religious split in Northern Ireland; I am not sure exactly what it is at present, but it is not 50:50 between Roman Catholics and others. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the Bill is that it puts Roman Catholics on pedestal one-50 per cent.-and everybody else, whether they be Protestant, Muslim or Jew, on pedestal two-

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Or Chinese.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Yes, or Chinese. That is extraordinary in the context of what the Government are trying to achieve. Once people are in that pool, who knows what will happen. Some may enter as Roman Catholics and become Protestant, or vice versa. Such things are not impossible. My experience in practising law is that the unlikely usually happens. There will be endless challenges to the measure because it must, by its very nature, operate in a discriminatory way. It is no good saying that everyone will go into the pool on merit. Everyone who goes into the pool will be assessed and given a mark and when the lawyers start trawling through the records it will be clear that some individuals started with a higher rank marking than others. Yet the Government are about to tell us that when the time comes to pull them out of the pool and put them into the RUC, they will discriminate on grounds of religion. I simply do not see how that will pass the test of the European convention. Once the possibilities and permutations start to be explored, the Government will be hung up to dry, which I regret.

<P>
I support the notion that every kind of affirmative action is required to increase Roman Catholic representation, but the Government are taking a massively wrong turn. I shall not labour the matter now as we shall return to it on Report, although at the risk of it being laboured, I give way to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that every kind of affirmative action is required. He is winning many brownie points in the debate and I am sure that he could also use his legal talents in respect of Europe, especially as we are among friends while the Government are in power. Will the hon. Gentleman say what lovely affirmative things he would do, rather than just making a clever speech?

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that I am making a clever speech. As for affirmative action, I would welcome any steps that the Government, the RUC, the Northern Ireland police service-or whatever it may be called-wish to take to encourage Roman Catholics to join, including targeting them as a group within the community that is under-represented. I have no difficulty with that.

<P>
I return to the earlier point; let us forget Europe and the European convention for a moment. The proposal offends my understanding of what equality and human rights should be. It does not matter whether we have signed up to the convention or any Euro directive by virtue of the Amsterdam treaty, or whether we are seeking a derogation. I still consider the measure to be disproportionate to its goal, and unjustified per se, irrespective of its goal. I do not believe in discrimination of any kind, and positive discrimination is simply another form of discrimination.

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 11, which deals with proportionality in the recruitment of civilian support staff. There are around 3,000 such staff, which is not a small number as may have been inferred from the Minister's comments. We believe that the quota should apply not only to officer recruitment, but to civilian recruitment for RUC support staff. The Bill introduces artificiality in requiring that at least 10 vacancies for support staff are required before the operation of the quota. It is highly unlikely that there will be 10 vacancies at the same time, the same level, and the same place and I suggest that that number should be reduced to two. We are not alone in that view: the Equality Commission in Northern Ireland made similar public comment on the issue.

<P>
We could understand the proposal if the Chief Constable were under a duty so far as is practicable to recruit according to the 50:50 principle for between two and 10 appointments. The Minster said that he had an open mind about the exact number and that it could be as low as two. I have taken that on board and look forward to some consultation on the matter.

<P>
I turn to the more general issue of the 50:50 quota to which the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for Beaconsfield referred. I am not a lawyer, but I have been reliably informed by eminent lawyers that the proposal is not contrary to European Union law. A directive on the implications of quota is proposed, but it is not EU law and I understand that the EU would not be averse to making an appropriate amendment to the proposed directive to cater for the Government's 50:50 quota. We had the impression that, in view of our problems, such a proposal would be well received in Brussels. I do not believe that the matter would create legal difficulties with the European Union.

<P>
It is difficult to argue logically for the 50:50 quota system, but it represents a distillation of Patten's consultation and recommendations, which the Government have wisely taken on board. The Minister said that the Police Federation had predicted that it would be 30 years before a proper balance was achieved.

<P>
In the context of the quota, we are dealing with an issue that is more complex than it would be outside policing. However, it is a policing problem, and there are rights to be considered-not only those of applicants, but of the people who are to be policed. There is overwhelming evidence that such rights have, on many occasions, been adversely affected by the fact that 92 per cent. of the police are drawn from one community. Unfortunately, that can manifest itself in discriminatory practices. The matter must be addressed on that practical basis.

<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As long as we have that gross disparity in membership, an inherent instability will be present in the delivery of the policing service in Northern Ireland. It is imperative from the Government's point of view, and certainly from that of the Committee, to deal with the imbalance as quickly as possible. There is no way in which that can happen within the next two generations under the normal process. We do not want the abnormal situation that we have had for 30 years to remain for another 30 years. We need a special method of quota recruitment if we are to address our specific problems. It would not be justified in many other situations, but it is justified here. The Government are correct in endorsing the Patten findings, and I support them in that.

<P>
On amendment No. 11, I hope, given the Minister's open mind on numbers in terms of civilian support recruitment, that the matter can be determined to the satisfaction of all parties before the Bill is considered on Report.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I find myself in an unusually comfortable position, in that I agree with the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for Beaconsfield.

<P>
The reality in Northern Ireland is that the community is divided roughly 40 per cent. to 60 per cent. between the two main traditions, largely excluding the other traditions to which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield alluded. It is clear from the school figures that, in the age range of 16 or 17 to 25, there has been a bulge in terms of the Catholic tradition and a reduction in terms of the Protestant tradition. Those between the ages of 16 and 25 represent recruitment into the RUC over the next nine years. There is, therefore, a wonderful opportunity for both traditions to apply to join the police and to achieve the sort of recruitment figures that the Government intend to achieve by manipulation.

<P>
Long before Patten or the Belfast agreement, the Ulster Unionist party recognised that there was an imbalance in the RUC, and we have repeatedly expressed our desire for both traditions to apply with the same degree of enthusiasm to join the police. Now that we have an agreement in Northern Ireland, there should be an opportunity for that to happen. If the figures are in any way comparable to those for the
16-to-25 or 26 age group to which I referred, the Government, if they can get things right now, will not have to manipulate the law to achieve 50:50 recruitment over the next 10 years. In fact, that should happen if the Government get matters right. I do not understand why we are imposing a quota system that will defeat that real opportunity.

<P>
However, it is worse than a quota system. The Government say that they will impose such a system, but not directly: they will set and maintain a standard of recruitment-at least, I hope that they will, and I see that the Minister is nodding-and those who achieve it will be put into a pool. Let us imagine that we fail to convince the nationalist community that they should play an equal part. Let us also assume that 200 recruits are required, and 600 people from the Unionist tradition apply, but only 150 people apply from the nationalist tradition. The one thing that we can all agree on is that standards of education are largely the same. Therefore, we shall assume the same quality of applicant across the board, and that 60 per cent. of applicants achieve the required standard. From the 150 Catholic applicants, 90 people would be put into a pool. From the 600 Unionist applicants, 360 would be put into a pool. However, only 200 recruits are needed, so one would want to take 100 from each tradition. The entire 90 people in the Catholic pool would therefore be taken up, but how many does one take from the Unionist pool? Does one take 90, so that the division is equal, and thereby fall short of the recruitment target by 20? Does one lower the threshold for Catholic recruits, and take a further 10 who almost made the pool?

<P>
How will those involved in the selection process feel about it? Merit will have gone out of the window. They will have reached the pool by merit, but selection will apply thereafter. That is utter nonsense-there is neither logic nor morality to it. Some 250 members of my tradition will be told, ``It doesn't matter that you have reached the standard; we are not going to select you.'' A 50:50 recruitment system based on merit-which accepts those who make it through the door first-would not be right, but it would be better than throwing people into a pool and cold-bloodedly selecting them according to their religious complexion.

<P>
I believe that the practicalities of this system, which I have tried to separate from the legal aspects, are divisive and demeaning-above all for the Catholic tradition. Initially, in a system such as this, there might not be enough applicants from the Catholic side. Every Catholic who joins the police will be perceived as having got there through some form of favouritism or bias. The corollary is that there will be a huge degree of dissatisfaction among people from the other tradition who feel that they have not had an equal chance.

<P>
We need a system that encourages people from every tradition to face up to the changes that are taking place in Northern Ireland and in which everyone is selected according to merit. That would achieve what Patten and the Government want to achieve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 237 to 239, the combined effect of which would be the same as that of amendment No. 86.

<P>
I am not too happy with the idea that a police force should always be representative of the community that it serves. Although, initially, it looks nice, there are on closer inspection, considerable difficulties with that idea, especially in relation to Northern Ireland. Inevitably, if we have a 50:50 police force, we will end up with Roman Catholic policemen in Roman Catholic areas and Protestant policemen in Protestant areas. That would not be a good thing for Northern Ireland.

<P>
The police are in no way to blame for the situation. There has never been any bar to Roman Catholics joining the Royal Ulster Constabulary. From the time when the Republic of Ireland left the United Kingdom, there has been a ready welcome for Roman Catholics in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, so it is not fair to say that the police have failed or are at fault because they have not attracted Roman Catholics. In recent years, the RUC has gone out of its way to attract as many Roman Catholics as possible, by adopting affirmative action programmes. We must face the fact that many Roman Catholics who may have wished to join the RUC were deterred from doing so by the intimidation that they and their families would have faced in the areas where they lived. That is why they did not join.

<P>
I live in an area that is predominantly Roman Catholic, and I know that many Roman Catholics would happily have joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary if they had had the necessary support and if the nationalist parties had encouraged them. We must encourage and congratulate those Roman Catholics who did join the Royal Ulster Constabulary. They have risen in the service-in some cases, to the very top-and have given valiant service in difficult circumstances. Even within the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the camaraderie between policemen has been very good indeed, be they Protestants or Roman Catholics. Although I believe that there is no real requirement for a police force to be representative of a community, I accept that it would be a happier situation if there were more Roman Catholics in the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

<P>
I was sent the response of the Roman Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland to the Patten report. While they argued in favour of Patten, they also acknowledged that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is important to point out that the name, symbols and political ethos of a police service are not essential to its primary purpose of detecting crime and upholding the law in service of the whole community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a great deal of truth in that.

<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
While I am happy enough with affirmative action, and with trying to get more Roman Catholics into the Royal Ulster Constabulary, I believe that there are dangers in quotas. Here on the mainland, all the police forces have now been set quotas. It would be interesting to know whether they reach them. After all, there might be people who do not want to join the police. It seems that, as long as a police force is open, and there is equal opportunity for all, it does not make much difference whether or not it protects the community.

<P>
However, what we have here is not affirmative action but positive discrimination against Protestants who might wish to join the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That is accompanied by getting rid of a number of Protestants already in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. I listened this afternoon to hon. Members talking about the full-time reserve. I know that the SDLP wants to get it out of the place within four years, despite the fact that it has about 2,900 officers. If those officers were in any other form of employment, and it was suggested that that number were to lose their jobs within four years, all hell would be let loose. However, in the Royal Ulster Constabulary there seem to be no worries about whether they will lose their jobs, or whether they will be able to keep their houses or pay for their children to go to college. No one seems to care. They can just be pitched out, and that will be the end of them. I am surprised that the Labour party, which is supposed to have an interest in such things, should utter no word of criticism about that.

<P>
It has been clearly argued this evening that this measure probably contravenes European directives. It also appears to contravene the Police Northern Ireland Act 1998, which states in section 76(1) that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It shall be unlawful for a public authority carrying out functions relating to Northern Ireland to discriminate, or to aid or incite another person to discriminate, against a person or class of person on the ground of religious belief or political opinion.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (7) sets out the bodies that are public authorities for the purpose of the section, which include, in paragraph (e):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Police Authority for Northern Ireland, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is, therefore, wrong to take this positive action.

<P>
I am amazed at the arguments that the Government should be going to Europe. It is true that, as recently as March this year, both the British and the Irish Governments were saying that they were all for the new directive. Now, two months later, they are saying that they want an exception for Northern Ireland and for the RUC. That appears to be contrary to all logic and reason. When Hitler entered Poland, he argued that he was going to liberate it, but he did the opposite. On the Government's approach, we all support equality and non-discrimination, but they argue that we must do so in Northern Ireland in the name of fairness and all the rest of it. In the long term, it will be hard for them to do that.

<P>
The best approach is to encourage Roman Catholics to join the RUC. I understand that since the ceasefire began, the number of Roman Catholics applying to join the RUC has increased. At one time, 22 per cent. of applicants were Roman Catholics. I do not know what the current figure is, but if political parties and the Roman Catholic Church encouraged young people to join the RUC, the problem would not exist. The amendments accord with the view of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, and my party will support them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> We have had a full debate. I shall keep my comments short because I hope to return to this matter on Report.

<P>
I respect Ministers at all times, and I do not doubt that they want nothing but the best for Northern Ireland. That is proved by the extraordinary generosity of spirit that they have shown at least twice today. I do not criticise or disrespect the Government's approach-it has been clearly established that we all agree with it. I see that the Minister is nodding. The question is not what we are trying to achieve, but how to do so.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) rightly noticed that I was upset when he commented on the Liberal Democrat gender balance in Parliament. However, I do not believe that positive discrimination is the solution. When the Welsh Liberal Democrats were selecting our candidates for the Cardiff Assembly, we had a debate about positive discrimination, but the proposal was rejected. However, we worked in an affirmative manner and secured a 50:50 balance in the Assembly. We achieved that not through positive discrimination but through positive affirmation, which is more than the hon. Gentleman's party has done.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> With regard to affirmative action and gender balance, the Conservative party and the Ulster Unionists have adopted the same approach, and we should take note of the gender balance in those parties.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> That suggests that of all the parties that are in opposition, the Liberal Democrats are best placed to give guidance about how to get it right.

<P>
The hon. Member for Leominster challenged me to say what affirmative action might be taken. There is much that one could do-for example, one could work in Catholic schools and ensure that joining the police was regarded as a legitimate career option, which should be promoted by careers advisers in schools. Nothing could be more obvious than that, although it might be difficult to do. Alternatively, one could work with nationalist and republican leaders to ensure that they sincerely promote working in the police force as a positive and worthwhile career. That will not be easy to acheive, but we must do so in order to reach the result that we all want.

<P>
Conversely, if the hon. Gentleman does not believe that affirmative action could be effective, what on earth is the point of having a quota? That would simply create a force-fit situation that would be even more injurious than creating sectarianism and resentment by forcing the acceptance of lower quality applicants from Catholic communities than from Protestant communities.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Down suggested that the measure is not contrary to EU law. Why then is there such talk from the Secretary of State about needing a derogation to depart from EU law? I suggest that it is a matter of timing. One could compare these proposals with existing provision in respect of sexual discrimination. It appears to be only a matter of historical accident that we have not excluded such proposals on the grounds that they are unacceptable. Perhaps, as some members of the Committee have suggested, the principle is utilitarian-a case of the greatest good for the greatest number.

<P>
If this is acceptable behaviour with regard to religious inequality in the Northern Ireland police force-where a population of less than 1 million Catholics is being discriminated against by being dissuaded from joining the police service-why not extend the derogation and fight for equal respect for the needs of the 30 million or so women who are regularly discriminated against in several walks of life? The Government would not try to do that, because they know what the reaction would be across the United Kingdom if such positive discrimination replaced the forms of affirmative action that they have rightly sought to implement through employment law by working in harmony with European legislation. It is not the whole story to say that the Northern Ireland case is more deserving than others.

<P>
I could advance many more arguments. The mathematical example cited by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone classically highlighted the difficulties. He underlined the point that one can foresee a situation in which, in order to fulfil the 50:50 recruitment quota, the standard required to become a member of the police might be reduced if the application was registered as having come from a Catholic. I am sure that none of us thinks that that is the right way to move forward, yet, crucially, it may be the consequence of what we have been discussing. The police could be sectarianised as a direct result of the Government's attempt to rectify the situation by using an incorrect process.

<P>
I have given a few examples of my concerns, but we have not even scratched the surface. I do not intend to keep repeating the argument throughout subsequent debates pertaining to the same issue, so I have tried to highlight the main points during my remarks on this group of amendments. However, many other aspects could be covered, such as why we oppose discriminatory quotas on the basis of moral, pragmatic and legal concerns, and of precedents for the rest of the United Kingdom. We could discuss what the Minister said earlier about having to implement the proposals because Patten is unequivocal about them. I remind him that he is picking and choosing in that respect. He has chosen not to implement other parts of Patten because the Government do not believe that it is appropriate to do so. As I said on Second Reading, they cannot have it both ways: they cannot argue, ``It is in Patten and therefore we have to implement it'' if at other times they choose to reject the recommendations.

<P>
I ask the Government to think again. Merit is the way forward, and that militates against having a 50:50 quota at the tail end of the recruitment process. At the same time, this is a serious argument and one must accept the points that have been made by those who support the current wording of the Bill. It is more difficult to increase the percentage of a certain kind of applicant than to have a simple quota, but that would lead to the right result. What sort of message is sent if a Protestant applicant goes home and says, ``I was better, but someone else got the job because she was a Catholic''? [
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is becoming a little too noisy.

<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> That is absolutely possible under the Bill. It is all very well for people to speak from a sedentary position, but anyone who has had such debates either within their local party-I am sure that that happened a lot before the general election-or in other walks of life when questions of positive discrimination are proposed knows that I am not grandstanding, but making a statement of fact about one of the potential consequences of implementing quotas.

<P>
I remind the Committee that I am not one of those people who rises to his feet to score political points. I try to argue my case on the basis of merit. It is probably evident that I feel passionately about the matter, although not because I am trying to show Ministers to be ineffective or incorrect in their aspirations. I am worried that one part of an otherwise pretty good Bill could needlessly increase injustice to one section of the community when we all know that the only way in which we can solve the problem of percentages and create faith in the police service in Northern Ireland is by making it a legitimate and trustworthy career for anyone in Northern Ireland. We cannot do that by tackling the problem at the tail end. We must tackle it at the start.

<P>
Will the Government accept in good faith that I am making my points sincerely, having been through the mill on this subject a number of times? I was a professional human resources manager in a company where I was responsible for a large part of the recruitment activities and I had such discussions then.

<P>
Let us do the right thing tonight and have application targets instead of quotas. I am asking the Committee to accept that fairness is more important than force-fit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall try to be brief, but a number of important points have been raised. I shall deal first with those raised by the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) who used an odious comparison. I hope that he will not again compare what the Government are trying to do with anything relating to nazism or fascism and the way in which that moved into Poland. If he does not understand our arguments, we are prepared to argue them at length and to point out the errors of his ways, but I ask him please not to use such comparisons again in this or future debates because they are deeply offensive to many people who have stood firmly against fascism.

<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred to positive discrimination and we hold our hands up. Clause 43 refers to discrimination and appointments and there is no point in saying that that is anything other than positive discrimination. The Government took that decision in response to the Patten recommendations. We are confident that we can provide a proper legal basis for the special measure under both domestic and European law. We would not have been justified in proceeding on that basis if we thought that we would be out of compliance with other legislation.

<P>
I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said about what should apply in normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances and Patten spent a long time analysing that. The hon. Gentleman gave us free advice on the European convention on human rights. I am glad that it was free, because it was wrong and I would not have paid for it. We do not accept that the 50:50 recruitment arrangements breach the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion under article 9 of the ECHR.

<P>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman claims that applicants will feel indirect pressure, but we do not believe that it will interfere with their freedom to practise their religion. Indeed, the provision is intended to promote equal access to the service for people of both religions.

<P>
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman mentioned article 14 of the ECHR, which deals with the prohibition of discrimination, but neither it nor the other convention articles are free standing. It applies only in relation to convention rights such as those listed under article 9, and article 9 does not apply for the reasons that we have given.

<P>
There is another reason why I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. We have assessed the Bill in relation to the ECHR, and the Bill makes it clear that, in the view of the Secretary of State,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the provisions of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill are compatible with the Convention rights.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As far as the imprimatur of the Secretary of State is concerned, I do not give it much weight. After the Omagh bombings, the imprimatur of the Home Secretary appeared on some of the most extraordinary legislation that this House has ever passed. That legislation flagrantly breached the ECHR and was never tested, so I am rather sceptical about the ease with which Ministers state on the back of Bills that they are willing to comply with the ECHR.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is on the front of the Bill, not the back. We could argue at length about post-Omagh legislation, and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it has never been tested or exercised by the police. We pointed out that it was, as it were, on the border, but had it brought those who committed that terrible deed to justice, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would have welcomed it, notwithstanding any challenge that might have taken a long time to resolve. However, that is a different debate, which we have had many times.

<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield also raised the issue of 50:50 representation in Northern Ireland. Paragraph 14.9 of the Patten report states that such representation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reflects the demographic breakdown of people now in their twenties, or who will reach the age of recruitment over<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the next 10 years. Patten therefore looked to the future in terms of demographic change. Secondly, monitoring of community background by religion will be carried out in accordance with the fair employment monitoring regulation. People in Northern Ireland have been monitored in that way since 1989, and if my memory serves me right the regulation was introduced by the previous Conservative Administration. We have the support of the Equality Commission, which is satisfied that the regulation will provide accurate information on community backgrounds.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked what would happen when someone changed religious affiliation after appointment. We cannot predict what would happen in such circumstances, but unless there are some very persuasive evangelists out there, I doubt whether we are talking about large numbers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The key issue is not those who change religion after appointment, but those who do so once they are in the pool.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> They may drown if they are so uncertain. It is clear that exceptional circumstances might arise, but they will not be the norm, and it would be wrong to discount this measure on the basis of such a possibility. The argument is weak, and the wrong one to advance.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that we should let changes in population play their part in changing recruitment composition, but that is not the way in which the Government have approached the matter. Had we thought that such changes could achieve that objective, we would not have introduced this measure. We do not want to rely on that slow process of change. We need to take action and achieve the critical mass that is necessary to push cultural change in the police service. There is certainly a difference of opinion on this matter. I hesitate to recall what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said in 1996, because someone could also recall things that I have said. I know that he has bravely tackled the issue of imbalance, and led the way on many occasions in arguing the need to address it. However, in 1996, while speaking on the subject of 50:50 recruiting, he conceded
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that we need to make a special effort  let's have recruiting on a 50:50 basis in a decade then we will have something like 25 per cent. of the police service which will be Roman Catholic  then no consciousness of the difference between the two traditions within the police service.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman made that statement on a television programme. He might now define matters differently. However, I am paying tribute to the fact that he has tackled the issue. I am trying to pay him a compliment on the way in which he has tried to take the matter forward. He acknowledges the extent of the problem, but we are trying to address it by a different means from the one that he is suggesting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister should remember that he is talking to an old village schoolmaster. I know what the demographic trends are. I recognised them, and saw the possibilities-in 1996, as the Minister said. However, that in no way contradicts what I said in my evidence to Patten in open session. I explained the opportunity for 50:50 recruiting, but I would be the last to suggest that we adopt a statutory arrangement, which would be totally illegal, and which we would justify by saying, ``Yes, it's positive discrimination, but we don't care.'' If we allowed the process to run its full course, and if people of both traditions had confidence in the system, I believe that it could work without all this ``illegal'' mish-mash with which we are being presented. I have not changed my attitude.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I did not want to provoke the hon. Gentleman into making that response. I was merely trying to pay him a compliment by reminding him of his words. However, he reminded the Committee that he was an old schoolmaster. I am of a generation that was brought up to respect the dominie, but-please sir-I think that he is wrong on this occasion. We have the right to dissent from our schoolteachers sometimes.

<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire made an impassioned plea for his amendment. However, one or two of his comments were wholly wrong. This provision will not bring about cases of a lower class of applicant from the Catholic community. He might, on reflection, not wish to use such descriptions. The Government feel strongly about this measure, and according to all indications it will become law. I would not want such a description to be played back to him at a later stage by those in the Catholic community who might feel that he has slighted them, when they are applying to the police service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I thank the Minister for his genuine concern about this matter. What I said to the Committee was that if an insufficient number of people achieved the level required for a job in the police service, one would have to lower the threshold in order to recruit the extra 10 people-according to the example provided by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone-needed to fulfil the quota. Briefly-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be brief.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Malins. Surely the Minister will accept that if the Protestant community emerged as a minority in the police force, the same would happen to them, and one might lower the threshold in the same way in order to fulfil the Protestant quota.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is a wrong and flawed argument, and it misunderstands what we seek to achieve. The hon. Gentleman is saying that if we do not achieve our targets, we shall simply lower the thresholds. That is not what we are seeking to do in improving the quality of the policing service in Northern Ireland. It is wrong to level the charge against the Government that we shall keep lowering the threshold to achieve a balance. If that balance is not being achieved, we must examine the reasons, but we shall not lower the quality of policing in Northern Ireland. There may be other factors that we will have to study: for example, it may be that those who seek to represent the Catholic community have not said the positive things that are required to encourage people in that community to apply. I hope that politicians of all persuasions remember that they do not own the electorate or have the right to give out commands or opinions from on high. People have the right to think for themselves. Those who want to advise a community not to join the police service are entitled to their point of view, but the body politic is bigger than any party or individual.

<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> The Minister and I agree that the key factor is the role of community leaders and others in encouraging membership at the point of application. That being the case, we should focus on targets for applications, rather than targets for recruitment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> In my opening comments, I said that there was nothing wrong with affirmative action. Indeed, the RUC is currently considering ways to achieve our objectives, and the Bill simply provides a legislative framework for that effort that is wholly consistent with European Union and domestic legislation. There are time limits, although the process must be judged over time; we will debate the way in which we should approach that. If it is not working, we cannot simply say, ``The law is the law'' and let things stand; we must examine the reasons why it is not working. For various reasons, it is important that we discover the background.

<P>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire used an unfortunate phrase when he said that the clause could create sectarianism within the police force. I am as passionate about the issue as he is, but I do not believe that that will happen, so he will have to prove his case. It seems logical to me that the same sectarianism could exist if we opted for affirmative action. I do not believe that it will happen, because people will join the police force to serve the community, not to parade their traditions. The hon. Gentleman gave us his opinions-he said that they were facts, but they were opinions, as people will see when they read Hansard that his assertions were not well-established, immutable facts.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down asked whether we still had an open mind on the issue raised by his amendment. The answer is yes. I am still fixed on the figure of 10 for support staff, because that would be analogous to the position in similar structures elsewhere. We have heard the arguments from the Equality Commission, from my hon. Friend's party and from others, and we are prepared to respond at any time. However, the arguments must be stronger if we are to be persuaded. I am not closing the door on the matter, and, if we have time before Report, I am prepared to respond. We might be able to agree on another way to deal with the issue, if the arguments stack up.

<P>
On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 20, line 43, leave out subsections (2) and (3) and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Where subsection (3) applies, the Secretary of State may in relation to appointments on any occasion under section 37 by order permit the appointment of an odd or even number of persons of whom:

<P>
(a) fewer than one half are persons who are treated as Roman Catholic, or

<P>
(b) fewer than one half are persons who are not so treated<P>

(a) fewer than one half are persons who are treated as Roman Catholic, or

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 251.

<P>
Hon. Members will realise that we have had a lengthy debate on a number of matters on the previous clause and that many of the same matters are raised in clause 43. I am sure that it will be understood that the Chair will not look kindly on over-lengthy contributions.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Following your recommendation on brevity, Mr. Malins, I simply say that the amendment has to do with aggregation. Patten recommended that if the number of Catholics appointed is too low in any one year, it should be possible to aggregate the number over several years. As I understand it, clause 43 does not permit that. The amendment would remedy that defect by imposing a duty on the Secretary of State to aggregate the numbers. It also limits the Secretary of State's power to vary by order the 50:50 recruitment principle in certain circumstances.

<P>
I realise that Government amendment No. 251 accepts the principle of aggregation, but it does not require it, whereas amendment No. 12 would make it a necessary requirement, following Patten's recommendation. It is a lengthy amendment, but that is its substance. Having followed your exhortation to brevity, Mr. Malins, I ask that the Committee approves it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's aims. We have considered the thrust of the amendment and indicated that we are persuaded of its desirability. We have discussed the matter with the SDLP and others. We accept that it may take a few years for the level of Catholic applications to the police service to build up sufficiently to permit 50:50 recruitment to operate effectively. That delay would be unfortunate, it would run counter to our arguments on previous amendments and clauses and it would be undesirable. In such circumstances, however, as Patten recommended in paragraph 15.10, we believe that a mechanism should be put in place whereby the imbalance can be redressed over the next one or two recruitment competitions. That is entirely within the spirit of what we seek to achieve.

<P>
The Government framed amendment No. 251 to enable aggregation over three years on the basis recommended by Patten. I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept the amendment, which is consistent with Patten, and not to press amendment No. 12.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I cannot accept that amendment No. 251 is totally compatible with Patten. It does not impose an obligation in respect of aggregation. Amendment No. 12 would impose that obligation. I therefore ask the Committee to accept it.

<P>
Amendment negatived.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 21, leave out lines 31 to 38.

<P>
This amendment is consequential to amendment No. 86, and I do not intend to repeat the arguments advanced in that debate. However, I want to emphasise one point in response to the Minister's earlier comments. The point of the arguments put forward by Opposition Members is not that the Catholic community would offer an inferior quality of applicant, but that it is as capable of offering candidates of high quality for work in the police force as the Protestant community-and, indeed, other communities that have been mentioned.

<P>
That is the core of our argument: we must increase the application figures, because we know that if that happens, everything else will look after itself. There is a great deal more to be said on this issue. We have only scratched the surface today. However, given your guidance, Mr. Malins, and given that we have highlighted the key areas for future debate on Report, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to amend the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 to exempt geographically based recruitment of part-time reserve members of the police service from being unlawful. In our judgment, its removal from the legislation, as proposed, would render recruitment on this basis vulnerable to legal challenge.

<P>
Part-time reservists currently operate for about eight hours a month. It makes sense for them to serve and to be recruited in the areas in which they live. It follows naturally that the composition of such groups should reflect that of their district. The districts to be targeted will be a matter for the police, based on operational requirements. I have no doubt that local recruitment, as enabled by the clause, will assist the progression towards the police-community partnership that is so fundamental to Patten's proposals.

<P>
I am at a loss to understand the direction that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is taking in the amendment. I thought that he had signed up to the overall philosophy of Patten, but now we are having debates on the minutiae-in this case, minutiae that could have an important effect. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> As I said earlier, my purpose in tabling the amendment was to tackle the issue of quotas versus targets for applications. I do not want to waste the Committee's time; I have made my point and the Minister has made his. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> On the basis of our earlier discussions, it is consistent for me to stand against this clause standing part. I am using the wrong language there, but I am sure that you know what I mean, Mr. Malins. I should like to register my opposition.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 22, line 12, leave out ``third'' and insert ``tenth''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 252 and amendment No. 14, in page 22, line 20, leave out subsection (5).

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Patten report stated that the application of quota should be kept in place for at least 10 years. The Bill, however, provides that the quota could lapse after as little as three years and must lapse after 10 years. Many Catholics will fear that the quota may be abandoned after a few years and that the recruitment of Catholics will fall off thereafter. Under subsection (5) the quota will lapse automatically after 10 years.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would rectify an unjustified divergence from the Patten report and would provide necessary assurance that the quota will remain in place for at least 10 years, as Patten envisaged. The Secretary of State has the power to review the provision every three years, but review is not the same as cessation and re-implementation.

<P>
Our amendments are preferable to the Government's amendment No. 252, which merely obliges the Secretary of State to have regard every three years to the progress that is being made towards a membership that is representative of the community. However, the quota could continue after three years if the Secretary of State so chose.

<P>
The quota is the only sure way of tackling the reluctance of the Catholic or nationalist community in Northern Ireland to join the police service and its distruct of it. It is vital that there is confidence among the community from which we want to draw the increased applications for recruitment and there is a force enabling the quota to continue. That will give people confidence that the Bill in its entirety is appropriate and that we as a political party are giving impetus and encouragement to our community to participate in the new Northern Ireland police service.

<P>
I commend amendments Nos. 13 and 14 to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I hesitated for a moment, Mr. Malins, because I had the impression that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone wanted to speak.

<P>
We have given careful thought to amendments Nos. 13 and 14. They would permit the 50:50 recruitment arrangement to be retained beyond 10 years, subject to review by the Secretary of State on a decennial rather than triennial basis. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Down said, the Patten model envisaged the quota mechanism operating for 10 years and forecast a significant increase in the proportion of Catholics in the police force from the current 8 per cent. to between 29 and 33 per cent. within that period. However, Patten also said that 50:50 recruitment should endure for at least 10 years. Accordingly, and because we are anxious to meet Patten's requirements wherever it is sensible to do so, we accept amendment No. 14, which will effectively remove clause 44(5).

<P>
We are persuaded that there is no need to repeal the 50:50 recruitment provision after 10 years, but we believe that the proposal should remain subject to regular review. That regular scrutiny should involve review and renewal every three years by the Secretary of State-the relevant provisions are contained in the Bill. However, we accept that the triennial review process should take account of progress that is made toward the ultimate goal of a representative police service. We have framed amendment No. 252 to reflect that.

<P>
We agree to one of the amendments of the hon. Member for South Down, and our amendment goes a long way towards agreeing with the principle that he supports. I hope that those facts will encourage him not to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I was going to speak earlier, but I thought that I should listen to the Minister first. I am disappointed by the outcome-the Minister immediately capitulated, once again, to the SDLP. I do not understand why that party has such a lack of confidence in its ability to lead the people whom it claims are its electorate.

<P>
The idea that we cannot get the new arrangements for policing accepted within a three-year period, or that we cannot even be sure of the acceptance of a police service in our society within a 10-year period, is frustrating and depressing. So long as the Government pander to the SDLP's lack of self-confidence, people such as the hon. Member for South Down will continue to have a poor mouth approach. The situation is depressing-I can think of no better word to describe it. That approach does nothing for policing or for the future image-if there is such a thing as future image-of the police service, which he had hoped would represent society in what is becoming an increasingly normal environment. We had hoped that terrorism was becoming a bad memory rather than the reality that it has been for the past 30 years. I am disappointed.

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall be brief, Mr. Malins, because the hour is late.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's use of the word ``capitulation'' is rather strong in the circumstances. If we have capitulated at all, it was because we took into account the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down and the view of the Patten report, which used the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at least for the ten years of the model.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sentiment encouraged us to agree to the amendment. We will maintain the three-year reviews. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone knows that the hon. Member for South Down thinks that that would be an appropriate period in which to carry out the reviews-he said as much earlier. Our approach involves, not capitulation, but an attempt to find a working arrangement that will deliver the Patten objectives in a sensible manner.

<P>
It is late, and I do not want to lock horns with the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone at this hour. In the circumstances, he might have used a better word than ``capitulation''.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I was disappointed by the contribution of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Rather than capitulating, I thought that the Minister was won over by the lucidity of my arguments and the persistence with which they have been discussed during preceding months by the SDLP and many other groups in Northern Ireland.

<P>
The other remarks of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone were abusive and totally unacceptable. Such remarks are a poor substitute for logic and argument, and deserve to be treated as such. If he earnestly wants to have a police service that is supported by both communities-he expressed that view many months ago and on occasion this evening-his comments this evening did nothing to help that cause. The argument that politicians, such as myself, should stand up in our constituency and say, ``I want all of you to join the police service,'' would have no effect whatsoever unless the conditions in the police service attract people independently and encourage them to serve their community by enrolling.

<P>
The argument that intimidation is the sole or partial cause that prevents members of the nationalists community from joining the RUC is a fallacy. That becomes clear when one examines the fall-off in recruitment between the initiation of the RUC and the commencement of violence in 1969, when similar problems applied. The hon. Gentleman's point is not the only, or even a major, factor in this regard. In this context, we need to tackle the relevant ethos and exclusiveness-in previous years, the idea was that the RUC was a Protestant force for a Protestant people, but we are trying to redress the situation.

<P>
I am glad that the Minister agreed to amendment No. 14, and I noted his comments on amendment No. 252. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
