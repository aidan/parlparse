                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to be here this morning. I had a look at the profile of
Conservative Members because during the evidence stage I noticed that a
number of lawyers were present. I have discovered that every
Conservative Member of the Committee is a lawyer of some sort.
<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> Well, I must go back to my office
and check my research. I would not want to offend anyone in that way. I
will go back and make sure that those responsible are suitably
admonished. I am assuming that everybody else is a lawyer. That led me
to question whether there was a collective noun for a group of
lawyers—a fee, a charge or an expense of lawyers. Perhaps the
hon. Member for Northampton North can help us with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us get on with debating the amendments in the group before us. I
started considering the issue of DNA when the Bill was first proposed.
I approached with an open mind the question whether DNA data should be
kept for three or six years because I accepted that a degree of balance
was required in terms of what might be necessary in the future. As I
considered the issue, I discovered that there are many misconceptions
about what data are held, where they are held, who holds them, and what
the terms “database” and “samples” mean.
There is a great deal of confusion about that, even among some of the
expert witnesses from whom we heard. The purpose of amendment 14, which
would change the title of the clause, is to highlight that even in
relation to the Crime and Security Act 2010, which was debated only 18
months ago, there is a misconception in some people’s minds
about what exactly we are dealing with. The Bill states that we should
destroy the DNA profiles, which gives the impression that they are
something of substance or something physical, rather than an electronic
piece of
data.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People
also have misconceptions about what the police have access to. It is
the terminology that we use that opens people up to the misconception
that the police have access to information that can show whether
someone is male or female, whom they may be related to or even possibly
their country of origin. All those mistakes appear to come from the
misconception that the database holds intimate information that can be
accessed and used for purposes other than that for which it was
obtained in the first place. Amendment 14 highlights that
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
confusion has bedevilled the debate, even regarding the 2010 Act. The
use of the word “destruction” in the clause title
suggests something physical rather than electronic data, as I have
said. We need to be clear about what the clause means when it refers to
the destruction of material—whether it relates to the
information on the database or to physical samples. It is clear from
the evidence we have heard that some people are very confused about
that. They confuse profiles with samples and even detailed structures
of DNA, which is after all the blueprint of everyone in this
room.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People
are right to be precious about such information because it is very
intimate, and we have a duty to protect people from any intrusion into
information that is extremely personal. But we also have a duty to make
sure when we discuss these matters that we are in full possession of
the facts and that we understand exactly what we are dealing with
before we remove data from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 172<a class="bkMark" name="Column172">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the database in a way that could seriously restrict the ability of the
police to solve crime and protect the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
part of my education on this subject, I went to visit the Forensic
Science Service for it to take me through the process, so that I could
understand exactly what we are talking about. The science of extracting
DNA data from samples was new to me. I shall briefly describe the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
sample is taken, let us say from a scrape from the inside of
someone’s cheek, using a swab. The swab is then submitted to the
forensic science laboratory for DNA analysis. First, several reagents
are ready to remove the DNA, and it is processed to extract DNA from
the additional cellular material. It is then processed in batches. The
issue of batches is very important, and we will come to that under
several clauses as we debate the Bill. The batches are processed to
generate a DNA profile from each swab submitted. The DNA profile is a
string of numbers, according to the size of the different strands, and
it is the string of numbers that is loaded on to the DNA
database.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
one part of the process a machine effectively measures the size of each
strand of DNA—like taking a photograph of the different strands
passing through the machine at different speeds—to generate the
string of numbers that make up the DNA profile. Those numbers are
loaded on to the national DNA database, which runs a check over new
profiles, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and crime scene
material overnight to see whether there are any new matches. That is
important, because when we discuss the Bill—many people made
this mistake on Second Reading, even the Secretary of State at
times—people rightly become emotional about the retention of
personal DNA material, the actual physical samples. However, with the
national DNA database we are talking about a series of numbers. Those
numbers can be removed from the database. The problem with the material
held by the Forensic Science Service is that it is difficult to
extract. It cannot be separated from any DNA profiles that we want to
retain—to lose one profile would be to lose them all.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
asked the witnesses what bothered them most about the retention of DNA.
Was it the fact that an organisation held physical properties from DNA
samples, or was it that the DNA information was on a national computer
and was searchable? Their answers were unequivocal: it was both. It was
not just the fact that the DNA profile was on a searchable database, it
was the fact that somebody held that personal piece of information
elsewhere. That leads to a problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Forensic Science Service in Lambeth road has a small machine that
processes the DNA in batches of about 20. The Forensic Science Service
has a much bigger machine that does them in batches of about 90, of
which about 80 are the samples actually being extracted, the others
being controls. Once those machines have produced the information, it
is stuck there. We can get rid of the whole batch, but it is not
possible to get rid of one part of the batch. So we need to be clear
what we are doing when we talk about the destruction of DNA profiles.
The impression is given that we are destroying everything, but we are
not. Under the clause, the DNA profile is removed from the DNA
database.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
asked the Forensic Science Service the cost of carrying out the process
individually. For the machine that does 20, the cost would increase
approximately fivefold. It was unable to provide an exact figure, and I
do not want to put it on the spot. For the process that takes place in
Birmingham, the cost would increase many times, and it is not
practical. The machines are not constructed to do just one DNA profile
regularly, although that can be done when the police are dealing with a
serious crime and need to process the data
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was also shocked that some of the witnesses were not fully conversant
with the details. I should have thought that someone advocating this
major change would have bothered to ask the Forensic Science Service or
another forensic body about the process. When Isabella Sankey of
Liberty was asked about it, she spoke of people who, although
they<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“might

information.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is completely and utterly wrong. It could not be more wrong. If the
police had access to the numbers, that would not tell them anything.
The Minister is shaking his head, and perhaps he will ask me to explain
if he does not understand something.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
DNA database has a string of numbers, and I understand that the police
do not necessarily have access to those numbers—all they know is
that there is a match—and if they did, the numbers would not
provide the information. I spoke to a scientist at the Forensic Science
Service who had been there for many years, and we looked at a more
detailed graph than would be on the national database. He said that he
could not tell much from the graph, which just showed spikes instead of
a string of numbers such as a set of lottery numbers. To suggest that
the police have access to such information is completely wrong, and to
have this debate on the basis of that is bound to influence how people
will react to the discussion. Does the Minister want to
intervene?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000043">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Separate clauses deal with samples, but again, we
are slipping into confusing samples with the electronic data. The hon.
Gentleman is quite right, we will be destroying samples, but discussion
of that will come up under other clauses. The issue that we are talking
about is the removal of the ability to search the national DNA
database.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is possible to remove single strands of information about one
individual from that database, but it is not possible to remove the
single piece of information that has produced the string of numbers
from the batches held by forensic science services. Going back further,
it is possible to destroy the samples from which the DNA strand was
extracted. The process is complicated, but we need to understand
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Minister responds, can he also confirm that it is not possible to
destroy the information held in the batches at forensic science service
providers, such as the Forensic Science Service, and that the personal
details they extract will remain on their systems? I accept that it
will be possible to remove the personal details, so that records cannot
be linked to what is on the national database. However, the point of
principle, according to those who gave evidence to us, is that, even 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 175<a class="bkMark" name="Column175">&#160;</a>
                           </div>so, that personal information remains in the possession of an
organisation, which they believe should not be the case. That
highlights the complexity of the issue, and our suggested step of
removing that information from the national database does not
necessarily satisfy all the complaints that people are making about the
retention of DNA
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Can
the Minister comment on whether the Government might have any intention
of requesting that DNA profiles are processed individually, so that
they are not stuck on those batches at forensic
science services in future? Have the Government looked into that? Have
the Government estimated what the costs might be, and are they included
in the £2.9 million on-costs resulting from the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Does
the Minister agree that the use of the word “destroyed”
in the clause gives the wrong impression of the process involved in
meeting the Bill’s requirements and does not accurately account
for the fact that DNA data will be retained by forensic science
services laboratories? I do not intend to speak to amendment 15, which
relates better to clause 2. I can raise the matters that relate to that
amendment in a stand part debate, because they refer to samples rather
than to DNA profiles.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000056">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be guided by you, Mr Streeter, but the
questions that are raised by amendment 15 are not relevant to clause 1.
I can make those points in a stand part debate rather than in this
debate on amendment 14. If the Minister wishes, I shall discuss
amendment 15, but I shall deal with amendments 16 to 18 for the
present.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
clause 3, people who are arrested for a qualifying offence will have
their DNA retained for a period of three years, as set out in
subsection (6); we have tabled other amendments to suggest a period of
six years. The Select Committee on Home Affairs investigated what
should be the threshold for taking and retaining DNA and fingerprint
data in its report on the national DNA database in March 2010. It
concluded that the threshold should be arrest, and that arrest should
be a very high threshold for qualification. It was concerned about
tiers of innocence—that people who were convicted of a minor
crime were treated differently from those convicted of a serious crime,
and that people who were arrested, but not convicted, for a violent or
sexual assault might have their DNA retained. There were differences in
the thresholds for people having their biometric details, fingerprints
and so on retained. The Committee felt that such a situation was not
acceptable. It felt that someone’s being arrested and taken to a
police station should be the threshold for retaining DNA.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000059">&#160;</a>

right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford
(Yvette Cooper) intervened on the Secretary of State on Second Reading,
asking her to confirm that there were cases in which innocent people
might have their data retained. The Secretary of State indicated that
it would be possible for chief officers to make such applications, but
the circumstances in which that would apply were not made clear. We are
concerned that innocent people may be subject to some sort of public
hearing in relation to the retention of their
DNA.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the context of the Secretary of State’s response to my right
hon. Friend, to whom would the chief officer apply? Do the Government
intend to prescribe every circumstance in which the chief officer
should do so, outside issues relating to national security? How far
will that go? If physical samples are to be included under the measure,
will the Minister clarify which ones? There is no reference to a case
where someone is convicted but continues to protest their innocence.
What happens to physical samples in those cases? There is a likelihood
that in an appeal on such cases, new evidence may come forward, which
would mean that samples need to be re-examined. Will the Minister say
what consideration has been given to the retention of samples in cases
where further proceedings may be necessary? I would be grateful for
clarification on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendments 37 and 38, is it the intention to allow the commissioner for
the retention and use of biometric material to deal with matters that
are not related to national security? Clause 20 deals with the position
of the commissioner. It clearly states that he has a role in relation
to national security. I refer to the earlier reply from the Secretary
of State. Again, it would be helpful if we could have some
clarification on what she was referring to when she said that it will
be open to the chief officer to apply for the material of innocent
people to be retained. In those circumstances, will the chief officer
apply to the commissioner or the magistrate or the DNA strategy board
to ask to retain the DNA?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Which
crimes will the Secretary of State prescribe where people are arrested
but not charged or cautioned? If it is her intention to prescribe
outside of national security, we would want to see the Secretary of
State prescribe cases such as serious sexual assaults and attempted
rapes, where there is often no conviction. The nature of those crimes
means that they often do not go to court, because the victims often
feel intimidated and disinclined to pursue the case. That prescription
would ensure that those who have been involved in those crimes are
recorded and their DNA retained for future reference. There are a
number of cases where that has led to people being convicted, which we
may return to in the debates on later
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
38 is a probing amendment—as most of them are—on the role
of the biometric commissioner. Will the commissioner have a
responsibility outside of national security, or are they just
restricted to national security? The Committee must forgive me if I
have missed it in the Bill, but I am not clear what the role of the
commissioner for the retention and use of biometric material is in
regard to crimes other than those related to national security. Again,
the amendment comes from the response by the Secretary of State, in
which she indicated that chief officers would be able to apply to
someone to retain the data of someone who has not been convicted or
charged with a crime. Will the Minister clarify the role of the
commissioner on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
27 would amend clause 8, which deals with penalty notices. We know that
penalty notices can be issued for trivial matters. There are two types
of penalty notice: those that are issued on the spot like a summary
fine, and those for which there is arrest. Bearing in mind that the
Home Affairs Committee recommended in its report that arrest should be
the threshold for the taking of biometric details, the amendment is
intended to obtain clarification from the Government 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>on the position of those who have been issued with penalty notices.
Given that penalty notices can be issued to children as young as 10, we
would not want someone who has committed two minor offences and
received two penalty notices at a very early age to end up on the DNA
database. That is an important point, which was made by the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington on Second Reading. I believe I am right
that, after two trivial offences, the information will be retained. I
shall be grateful for clarification from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000065">&#160;</a>

that it is not necessarily the case that fixed penalty notices are
given to minors for trivial matters? As also applies when people commit
shoplifting and those sorts of offences, it is still open to the police
to offer reprimands and final warnings before even getting on to fixed
penalty notices. That is a third tier of the process that has to be
gone through before a minor is given a fixed penalty

                           </strong> I am sure the hon. Gentleman is right, but the
purpose of the amendment is to find out when the Government intend
penalty notices to be used. Many clauses in the Bill refer to abuses of
process and of power. People might consider it an abuse of process that
someone who is innocent, is arrested in a case of mistaken identity or
has a sample of DNA taken illegally is subject to a speculative search.
The amendments are to enable us to find out where the Government are,
because we would not want—I am sure that the Minister will
respond to this—penalty notices to be abused to obtain
someone’s DNA. These probing amendments were tabled to ascertain
from the Government whether the use of penalty notices might result in
people, particularly young people, being on the DNA database for
trivial
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 1 is probing and relates to people who are given control orders.
Given that there have been recent and controversial changes to the
control orders regime, I would like the Minister to put on record the
Government’s intentions about the retention of the DNA and
fingerprints of people who are or have been under control orders. Under
the regime brought in by the 2010 Act, if someone is put on a control
order and, by definition, has not been convicted of a crime, the DNA
will initially be retained for six years. Once the control order is
lifted, it will be retained for two years, or it will be held until the
end of the control order. The period of retention can also be extended
using the national security
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000068">&#160;</a>

the Bill, I am not clear what will happen and I would be grateful for
the Minister’s clarification. If a person held under a control
order is not convicted of any crime, will their details still be
retained? The national security provisions suggest that the details can
be held for two years—is that correct?—and that that can
then be renewed indefinitely at the request of a chief officer to the
commissioner for the retention and use of biometric material. Will the
Minister clarify
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000069">&#160;</a>

extend the retention period? Will the Secretary of State issue guidance
on that, or will it be subject to guidance from the biometric
commissioner? How will the introduction of terrorism prevention and
investigation measures affect the way people’s
DNA and fingerprints are treated? Will the Minister
provide clarity on that area of policy? Again, this is a probing
amendment to clarify the Government’s position on the retention
of such information belonging to people subject to control

an important evidential tool in prosecuting crimes and bringing
offenders to justice, but, as I think we will debate this morning and
throughout this Committee stage, the use of technology must strike the
right balance between the promotion of the wider public interest,
public safety and the protection of important private life interests.

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the amendments, in many ways the hon. Gentleman is right to seek to set
out the basis for the way in which DNA samples are processed and to
give some further background to that. I welcome the fact that he has
taken sufficient interest to prepare and inform himself by visiting
laboratories and inquiring in that way. On his specific point about
derived information, DNA does contain some of the sensitive information
that I highlighted in my intervention, such as the familial links that
can be made. That is why the Information Commissioner and others have
rightly identified that it is sensitive, and why it is pertinent for a
proportionate regime to be adopted on the retention of such
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman talked about DNA samples and the processing that they go
through to generate a computer profile. He is right to say that DNA
samples are processed by the forensic suppliers in batches and that
they are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 179<a class="bkMark" name="Column179">&#160;</a>
                           </div>destroyed in batches. To do otherwise would greatly increase the cost.
Generally speaking, each batch contains 96 samples and is normally
composed of 82 live and 14 control samples as part of the quality
process. Until that quality process is complete, the 82 live profiles
will not have been satisfactorily derived. It would be inappropriate to
destroy the samples until that process was complete. Once processed,
the profiles can be separated and destroyed individually. The remaining
information is held anonymously by the provider, as provided for by
clause 13(2). On the individual samples, we will debate that issue when
we get to the relevant clauses, which the hon. Gentleman has rightly
identified.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
whether we would consider taking or processing the individual samples,
the hon. Gentleman perhaps misses the point, because the samples that
are taken are processed to derive a computer profile, which is then
stored. We are then separately dealing with those individual samples
and their destruction. In essence, he is simply alluding to the
processing. In its evidence last week, Genewatch UK indicated that it
was not an issue of significant concern. The retention of anonymous
information, which neither the Government nor the Information

15 would require DNA samples to be retained where an individual was
convicted of an offence, pending any further proceedings and,
presumably, the outcome of any appeal. That approach contrasts with the
position in clause 14, which requires that all samples taken under the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act are destroyed within six months. That
shows the interrelationship between clauses 1 and 14. Both this
Government and the last have been advised consistently by the National
DNA Database Strategy Board that, once a profile has been derived
satisfactorily by the forensic science provider, including the carrying
out of the appropriate quality checks, there is no need to retain the
biological sample. I understood that to be a point of agreement between
us about those samples and the provisions in clause
14.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000080">&#160;</a>

of clarification. We are discussing individual samples taken from
people under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which means there
has been an arrest and a DNA sample has been taken. We are not talking
about, for example, crime scene samples, which are not covered by the
retention regime. Crime scene DNA is retained for further
investigation. We are specifically talking about a profile and a DNA
sample that have been taken after an arrest. I hope that that clarifies
why we believe—even the previous Government believed
it—that it is appropriate to regulate the retention of DNA
profiles taken following arrest. There is a cold case database against
which those samples can be compared.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000082">&#160;</a>

clarify a bit more. Imagine a case where several people are arrested,

                           </strong> This is where we reach a separate issue. DNA
is perhaps taken from someone on arrest in relation to an
investigation, and the processing takes place to derive the DNA profile
computer record. There is then the opportunity to perform a speculative
search against the cold case database to pick up any matches. Once the
decision has been taken not to charge an individual—they have
been arrested in relation to an investigation, which has followed
through—they have their DNA profile destroyed, in essence,
following the determination of no further action. In other words, there
has been no decision to charge in that case, at which point the DNA
profile is destroyed, unless there are certain prescribed
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000085">&#160;</a>

is worth highlighting that material is also held on police case files,
in accordance with the code of practice issued under the Criminal

ability to take a further sample under those circumstances; for
example, if there was legal dispute as to whether the profile had been
correctly produced following the arrest and initial sample being given.

Is there a procedure for giving guidance on the retention of samples in
those circumstances, where they might be needed for re-testing? The
Forensic Science Service tells me that it gets weekly requests for such
tests, so this is an issue for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000093">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a question of which samples the service
is talking about. Clearly there is a need to protect crime scene
samples to ensure that, on further investigation or appeal, they can be
checked, that discussions and debates over those issues are properly
heard, and that justice can be done. That is why we are distinguishing
between a profile that is derived following arrest and a crime scene
profile—the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow North
West—and why I have sought to be clear about the distinction
between the two regimes, as well as the operation of the Criminal
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the preservation of crime
scene and other information in the context of justice. We are talking
about the specific avenue of the taking of samples following an arrest
under PACE and the creation of a profile derived from the sample. I
acknowledge that the area is complex, and that we shall get into
further complexity as we progress through this part of the

thought has come into my head. Let us imagine that the suspect is
arrested and the DNA taken. Subsequently, the suspect is not charged,

open. What is the position of the
DNA?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000095">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My understanding is that, if a person has
been arrested, under the Crown Prosecution Service requirements a
charge would have to be brought within the normal period of about six
months in relation to the investigation into the case or there would be
a decision that no further action was to be taken. It is at that point
that the CPS makes its determination of what should happen and whether
the case is to proceed. A determination would then be made by the CPS
whether to
charge.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
only circumstances in which matters might be different is where there
are issues of vulnerability or factors that the Home Secretary spoke
about on Second Reading in respect of crimes of violence or sexual
crimes. A period of retention of three plus two might be available in
those specific circumstances following arrest but not charge, where the
police might be able to apply and seek for that regime to operate. I
will come on to that issue shortly, as the hon. Member for Eltham
referred to it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000097">&#160;</a>

am conscious of the fact that I must refer to several other matters,
although to be clear I must point out that we shall not be destroying
crime scene profiles, so there should not be a problem with cold case
appeals. There is no need to retain individual samples, a point that
was understood in the discussions on the Crime and Security Act, too,
because a fresh sample can be taken if an appeal is required. Such a
discussion took place in debates under the previous Labour Government,
when such matters were considered carefully. To avoid some
circumstances that the hon. Member for Eltham is understandably and
rightly probing, a further sample can be taken so that no miscarriage
of justice may arise. I hope that I have been of assistance to him on
such points, that I have clarified matters and ensured that the
Committee understands
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
16, 17 and 18 highlight what is perhaps a major point of difference
between the Government and the Opposition. As set out in the Crime and
Security Act, Opposition Members believe that it should be possible to
retain an individual’s DNA and fingerprints purely on the basis
that a police officer at a particular moment had reasonable grounds to
believe that an individual had committed a recordable offence, which is
the evidential test to make an arrest. However, the Government consider
that further safeguards are necessary before biometric material and
profiles can be retained. First, it should be necessary for the arrest
to be for a serious offence. Secondly, we think that either the police
or the CPS should believe there is sufficient evidence for there to be
a realistic prospect of conviction—the test for
charging—and a much higher level of evidence. Alternatively,
where it has not been possible to charge an individual with a serious
offence—such as where witnesses have been intimidated—any
decision to retain DNA and fingerprints should be taken by the
independent commissioner for the retention and use of biometric
material, not the
police.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Eltham raised a general point in relation to that. He
will have read the Home Secretary’s comments on Second Reading,
when she indicated that, if the police believe there are sufficient
public protection grounds to justify the retention of material
following an arrest for a qualifying offence that does not lead to a
charge, the Bill should allow them to apply to the biometrics
commissioner for the retention and use of biometric material, who will
decide whether retention of the DNA profile and fingerprints of the
arrested person is justified. That is in essence captured by
subsections (11) and (12) of clause 3, which provide for the
detail of such a scheme to be set out in secondary legislation. As the
Committee heard from Chief Constable Chris Sims last week, we are
working with the police service to ensure that the appropriate
mechanisms and clarity are provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have been very focused on the impact of changes. I am sure that the
hon. Gentleman will come to this point. We look to the past as a good
indicator of the impact of DNA retention and detections. The previous
Government changed the law in 2003 to take material on arrest rather
than charge. Yet, at that time, there were around 36,000 detections
against a database of a much less significant size than now. Whereas,
in 2009-10—with all the changes that the previous Government
made—creating what is effectively indefinite retention and
seeking to ensure that as many DNA profiles are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 183<a class="bkMark" name="Column183">&#160;</a>
                           </div>created as possible—there are 4.8 million profiles on the DNA
database, yet the number of detections is 32,000, so it has gone down
considerably, notwithstanding the significant growth in the database.
We, therefore, believe it is appropriate to look at past evidence. The
previous Government’s approach was seemingly to say, “We
need to retain everything. We need to get as much as possible. This
will detect and solve more crimes.” However, that was not borne
out by the evidence of the number of detections that arose as a
consequence of that policy. That is why I rebut a number of the
criticisms that have been made, such as the point that simply reducing
the number of profiles on the DNA database will automatically lead to a
reduction in detections. The DNA database has grown and grown, but the
detections have gone down and down.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000101">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not doubt that the Minister’s figures
are correct, and that the number of people on the database, as a result
of retaining everyone’s DNA profile, has exponentially increased
out of proportion to the number of detections. However, the debate has
moved on, since the passing of the 2010 Act, to whether the period
should be six years or three years. There is an evidence base for
suggesting six years. The Select Committee concluded that it should be
a minimum of three years, but it could be more. We are not talking
about everybody’s profile any more; we are talking about whether
the profiles should be kept for six years or three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000102">&#160;</a>

have preferred to do—their starting point was to retain
indefinitely. Given the hon. Gentleman’s indication, perhaps he
would have preferred indefinite retention. Would he like to suggest

Evidence produced by the Home Office led to the previous Government

                        <p>The
evidence that was proffered to justify six years is not clear-cut in
the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. When the Information
Commissioner gave evidence to the Committee that considered the Bill
that became the Crime and Security Act 2010, he said that that did not
justify anywhere near six years. I think that he repeated that in
evidence to this Committee last week and said that he was satisfied
with a three-year retention period on the basis of the very evidence
that the hon. Gentleman says supports his view on six
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000107">&#160;</a>

might be right about three years. If he casts his mind back to the time
when the 2010 Act was passed, he will remember that the previous
Government suggested that what was needed was a detailed review of
whether six years was effective and a reconsideration of the length of
time for which profiles were retained. The problem with the Bill is
that we will destroy everything that has been retained for three years,
so we will never be able to carry out that assessment in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000108">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The interesting point in the hon.
Gentleman’s analysis is that for the peak period of offending,
which he would probably accept is in the range of 12 to 19 years, the
previous Government were prepared to adopt a shorter period so that if
someone was not convicted, their DNA would be retained for three years.
There seems to be an agreement on three years, so it is interesting if
the hon. Gentleman is trying to unpick that by saying that the time
should increase again to six years. The hazard rate analysis
highlighted that the largest risk might occur in that range for young
people, yet the previous Government seemed happy to allow three-year
retention in that very
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000109">&#160;</a>

37 and 38 would place in the Bill further details of the circumstances
in which DNA profiles and fingerprints may be retained following
arrest. In particular, amendment 37 would require material to be
retained in all cases of rape and “serious sexual
offences”, although that term is not defined. Amendment 38 would
also remove from the commissioner any role in deciding what material
should be retained, except in cases of national
security.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have dealt with the point about the regime that we wish to adopt. We
are working with ACPO on provisions on the ability to take and retain
DNA profiles from arrest in situations of vulnerability, as well as the
very matters that I have highlighted in connection with the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 185<a class="bkMark" name="Column185">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Home Secretary’s comments and how that was intended to be
addressed by way of secondary legislation. We believe that that is the
appropriate course and that it is right that the commissioner should be
involved in retention in such cases. We also believe that clause 3
strikes the right balance between maintaining the effectiveness of the
DNA and fingerprint databases, and protecting innocent
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
in Scotland, in the generality of cases, if there is no conviction,
biometric material should be retained for only a limited period when
there is sufficient evidence to charge someone with a serious offence.
It is right to refine the Scottish model to meet the needs of public
protection in England and Wales by providing for retention following
arrest in certain limited circumstances. Lowering the bar for
retention, as the amendments to clause 3 would do, would fail to strike
the right balance. That said, I fully accept the need for clarity about
the retention rules in this area, and I note what the hon. Member for
Eltham has said. I undertake to reflect carefully on his comments about
that specific
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to amendment 27, there might be some confusion about clause 8. The
provisions reflect those in section 79 of the Criminal Justice and
Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, which permits the retention of DNA from
those given what is termed in Scotland a fixed penalty notice, which is
the equivalent of a PND—penalty notice for disorder—in
England and Wales. It might help the Committee if I explain that a
little
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Contrary
to the impression given by the hon. Member for Eltham and the
suggestions made by the hon. Member for Gedling during our evidence
sessions last week, we are not creating any new powers to take DNA or
fingerprints. When someone is given a PND on the street without being
arrested, there will be no power to take their biometrics, so there can
be no retention. Again, to clarify the matter, we are talking about
taking a DNA sample following an arrest, and if a penalty notice for
disorder was subsequently issued, the retention period would be two
years, which would reflect the situation in Scotland. I hope that the
hon. Member Eltham accepts that some of the examples and hypotheses
that he highlighted are not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to clarify that a fixed penalty ticket does not constitute
a conviction for the purposes of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman referred
to two convictions and minor offending provisions in the Bill, and my
clear understanding is that they would not be activated because the
matter is treated
separately.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
8 will operate only when an individual has been arrested and taken into
custody. Their biometrics will be taken as part of the normal custody
process, and we believe that when someone is given a penalty notice as
an alternative to a caution or to being charged, it would be
appropriate to retain that individual’s biometrics for a short
fixed period. Under the Crime and Security Act 2010, all arrested
individuals—whether or not they were subsequently given a
penalty notice for disorder—would have had their biometrics
retained for six years. It will be interesting to know whether the hon.
Gentleman is again changing the Opposition’s position. Is he now
saying that that six-year period was wrong in circumstances

fact that the point about perhaps going too far was raised this week
and last week implies that the Opposition are changing their approach.
Part and parcel of our debates in Committee is hearing how the
Opposition telegraph where they stand on certain issues. I know that
scrutiny is a key part of what we do in Bill Committees, but the
Opposition’s position is also relevant. Perhaps they do not have
a position on this issue, but we may gain some clarification during the
course of our
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
let me deal with new clause 1. I remind the Committee that the
Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 includes powers to take, use and retain the
fingerprints and DNA of individuals subject to control orders. As hon.
Members will know, those powers have not been commenced. That was a
direct result of the S. and Marper judgment, which necessitated a
re-examination of the retention regime under the 2008 Act, in much the
same way that we looked at the retention regime under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act
1984.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 1 is essentially an Opposition proposal to reactivate the
retention regime under the Crime and Security Act 2010. Although I note
that the hon. Gentleman said that this was a probing measure to clarify
the Government’s position, we are not minded to accept the new
clause for three reasons, the first of which is that given that the
power to take fingerprints from controlled individuals has never been
commenced, there is no need to have provisions relating to the
retention of such material.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
and more fundamentally, the Government have already announced that they
are repealing control orders legislation and replacing it with
provisions on terrorism prevention and investigation measures. In the
future, there will therefore be no need for provisions relating to the
DNA of those subject to control orders. Thirdly, we are unconvinced
that, in relation to controlled individuals, as with those arrested
under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, the retention provisions in
the 2010 Act, and therefore new clause 1, strike the right balance
between maintaining the effectiveness of the DNA and fingerprint
databases, and protecting the rights of individuals whose material has
been
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
said, I can support the underlying thrust of the new clause. We agree
that there should be provision for the taking and retention of DNA of
individuals subject to terrorism prevention and investigation measures.
Consequently, we are finalising our provisions on this point, and we
will repeal the uncommenced taking powers in the Counter-Terrorism Act
2008 and make provisions for the taking of fingerprints and
non-intimate

                           </strong> The Minister raises a number of points that need
further clarification. I was slightly confused by his opening comment
about the detail that is retained on the DNA database. I specifically
asked the Forensic Science Service whether the police could derive the
sort of information to which the Minister referred from that database.
The answer that came back was, “No, they can’t.”
On further investigation, data and material held by the Forensic
Science Service is retained, but I understand that that information is
not on the national DNA database. We can clarify that and come back to
it later, and perhaps someone will pass the Minister a
note.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister also said that the people who gave evidence did not feel that
the retention of biometric data—albeit anonymously, if they are
removed from the national DNA database—was an issue. However, Dr
Wallace from GeneWatch raised the question of trust with regard to
organisations that hold such information. There will be an issue about
monitoring and regulation of those organisations, particularly if we no
longer have a national Forensic Science Service after it is outsourced
and privatised. I am sure that people will be concerned about how
private companies will organise themselves and retain information. When
I asked Dr Metcalfe specifically about the point, he said that there
were questions about the retention of details by organisations and
information on the searchable national DNA database.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am still slightly confused about one matter. I am sorry if I have
missed something that the Minister said, but I would be grateful if he
could clarify the following point. The commissioner for the use and
retention of biometric material has been referred to by the Minister in
the same terms that the Secretary of State used on Second Reading. We
hear that a chief officer will be able to apply to the commissioner to
retain DNA in certain circumstances, but we still do not know what they
are. I cannot see any reference to that other than that the Secretary
of State may prescribe as she sees fit any specific areas that may be
included. The Minister alluded to an example where the victim may be a
vulnerable individual, but many crimes would fit that
description.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill seems to suggest that the primary function of the commissioner
concerns national security, yet there is just one reference in clause 3
to the commissioner. It is not clear what other crimes or areas of
crime might be considered. I take it that the Government intend to
allow the commissioner to oversee the retention of material outside
matters of national security, but just how far that will go is still
not clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000133">&#160;</a>

would add for clarification that the DNA database contains a numerical
profile, as the hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted, including an XY
chromosome indicator—in other words, an indication of male or
female. That profile can give information on ethnic traits, for
example, although not as explicitly as the genetic sample itself. Such
information is not given to the police as part of the initial match
report, but it will be as part of the evidence to charge and prosecute,
so a distinction may be drawn about when such information is given. We
are talking about sensitive information, which is why we are having
this debate and people such as the Information Commissioner are
involved. That is also why we think that a proportionate regime needs

I was correct that the initial search does not divulge such detail. It
may indicate the presence of an XY chromosome because it is a strand
that reads different sections of the DNA. I am told that, because there

chromosomes—an X and a Y—whereas the alternative would be
two Xs. I am grateful that I am correct that the initial search does

speculative search to be carried out when somebody is arrested. We
tabled the amendment because the view of Chris Sims from the
Association of Chief Police Officers is that everyone arrested should
have a speculative search carried out. However, I cannot see that
requirement anywhere. I can understand why it is ACPO’s wish
that everyone who is arrested should have that initial speculative
search carried out against the national DNA database. Time will move on
and if it is not a requirement, resources will be tight, and the police
will have to make cuts and economies. The concern is that we could slip
into a practice whereby chief officers make their own decisions
locally. They may decide that it is not worth the trouble of
undertaking a DNA search for somebody who is held for a minor offence
overnight and is perhaps in a cell for being drunk and disorderly in a
public place, but has not been charged. However, we know from past
experience that taking DNA in those circumstances has led to the DNA
database showing up a match. One big example of exactly that is Mark
Dixie in the Sally Anne Bowman case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000145">&#160;</a>

are considering the Bill’s being in force for several years and
being the framework within which the police operate. It is not
unreasonable to suggest that practices could change in future. I would
be grateful for the Minister’s comments on that. A speculative
search of people who are arrested should be carried out and I would be
grateful for the Minister’s reassurance that there will be no
opportunity for the police to decide in future that, in some cases, we
should not be doing

innocent, who find themselves in a police station. It is a
“while you’re here” provision, suggesting that

ways. We heard evidence from the Information Commissioner, Liberty and
Justice that they do not believe that it is right to undertake
speculative searches of innocent people. We may or may not agree with
that, but we are talking about people who must be the most innocent:
they have been brought to the police station by mistake and their
samples have been obtained
illegally.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Does
the Minister believe that speculative searches of people arrested in
such circumstances should be carried out? That seems to be inconsistent
with the Bill’s approach. We heard from Information
Commissioner, Liberty and Justice that not only should such things not
happen, but records of arrest should be removed, as I have said. Does
the Minister believe that that approach would be consistent with the
Bill? Is there any prospect of the Government, in a future freedoms
Bill or even in an amendment to this measure, pursuing a further
erosion of information held by the police, including even removing
information about people who are arrested and not charged or
cautioned?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000156">&#160;</a>

amendments would place a duty on the police to carry out speculative
searches of the national fingerprint and DNA databases in all cases
before material is destroyed, except when the arrest is unlawful or
based on mistaken identity. That contrasts with the position in the
Bill, whereby the police have general discretion to search but can
choose not to do so if they do not consider such a search
desirable.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000158">&#160;</a>

I note the hon. Gentleman’s point about the importance of
speculative searches, and we very much agree that a speculative search
against the cold case database can result in detections, it is worth
highlighting the distinction between the legal and practical. In
practice, there is not much, if anything, between the mandatory model
and the model in the Bill, because the process for conducting
speculative searches against the DNA and fingerprint databases is
wholly automated. Once a new DNA profile or set of fingerprints is
loaded on to the database, it is subject to speculative searches. As I
said, in practice, there is not much between us on this, because it
happens as a consequence of automatic
loading.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000159">&#160;</a>

several interesting points that have been made by the hon. Member for

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 192<a class="bkMark" name="Column192">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Opposition position is on a number of points. Is this another change in
the position that was adopted by the previous Government? My
understanding of section 5 of the Crime and Security Act 2010 was that
fingerprints and samples could be checked in such circumstances, so I
do not know whether there has been some movement in their position. It
will be interesting to see whether that is the case, or whether this is
simply a probing amendment, as the hon. Member for Eltham said, and the
Opposition have not actually moved their position at all. It will be
interesting to discern that as we progress further with the Bill.
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be able to tell us when he closes our
mini-debate on this group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to the substantive point, I share the hon. Gentleman’s
view about conducting speculative searches. That is why the Bill, in
providing for them, refines the Scottish model. Practically, there is
not much difference between us on the principle, albeit we believe that
the wording in the Bill is appropriate to deal with the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of the person who may be subjected to unlawful arrest or
arrest based on mistaken identity, obviously, as the hon. Gentleman
will know from new section 63D(2), the Bill specifically addresses
retention and takes account of concern that there should not be ongoing
retention. The subsection states that the DNA profile must be destroyed
if it appears to the responsible chief officer of police that some of
the very circumstances that the hon. Gentleman alluded to may arise. It
is important that that is expressed in the Bill in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is no question of retaining material in the circumstances set out in
new section 63D(2). However, there is obviously allowance for a
speculative search if an arrest takes place, but the question I would
put to the hon. Gentleman is about timing and the complexity that may
arise. It may come to light only subsequently—when the case
actually gets to court—that an arrest was wrongful. That is
often where the evidence is challenged and some of these issues
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
timing issues that the hon. Gentleman is talking about, and the factors
that he seeks to protect following an arrest, will come further down
the track, well after the arrest, well after the loading and creation
of a profile, and well after a speculative search. The key thing is
that there should be no retention in such circumstances, which is
precisely why we have made provision in clause 1 to cover them. For the
reasons that I have given, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be
minded to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000165">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister. The amendment on
speculative searches of people who have been arrested because of
mistaken identity or have had their DNA taken for a process that is not
lawful was intended to highlight the difference of opinion that may
exist among the coalition. Among Liberal Democrat MPs, the position is
clearly that there is a need for a further freedom Bill—a need
to go further; and the suggestion from many of our witnesses was that
some of the clauses in the Bill did not go far enough. A great deal of
the rhetoric about the Bill, particularly from the Deputy Prime
Minister in the lead-up to its publication, suggested that it would
involve root-and-branch change, but the provisions relating to people
who are innocent seem to be inconsistent with that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000166">&#160;</a>

I take on board the points about practicality. I wanted to tease out
the point that there are some inconsistencies in the Bill. Rather than
being a great revising Bill, which contains new rules and tears up

amends something that already exists.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000167">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That may be true, but I am not the one who has
been promoting the Bill as a huge step forward for freedom and liberty.
The way the coalition has talked up and talked about the Bill suggests
that it is some sort of great root-and-branch ripping up of all the
“rotten” laws passed by the previous Government, but it
is nothing of the sort; it is a tinkering Bill, with a bit shifted
here, a bit shifted there and a bit chopped off somewhere else. That is
really what we have.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000169">&#160;</a>

speculative searches, I am sure we are on the same ground. Such
searches have been important in detecting serious crime, and I hope the
Minister will take that on board. However, there is one thing we do not
want the police to do, and my concern is that nothing in the Bill
protects us from it. The hon. Member for Wycombe intervened on the
Minister to suggest that no cost is involved, but there is. The police
must pay the Forensic Science Service for the service it provides, and
they might be looking for economies in the future; it is not impossible
to envisage. That is the concern that we are highlighting, and we would
like reassurance from the Government that we could not slip into a
situation where chief officers take such decisions at local
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000170">&#160;</a>

quite a long debate on clause 1. It raises issues about how we deal
with information and particularly how we describe it. The way
information is described and reported actually influences how people
think about it. At the end of our exchanges, it was clear that what is
provided by the national DNA database is a string of numbers.
Initially, all the police get is an indication of whether there has
been a match on the database when a check has been run overnight.
Further inquiry leads to their finding more information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that we understand those things in the terminology we use.
Bodies such as Liberty say that the police have almost routine access
to personal information. That is incorrect, but such comments have
influenced the debate. The concern is that such discourse may lead
people to feel that the provisions are more intrusive of
people’s private lives than they actually are, that information
is freely bandied around in police stations, which it is not, and that
people need more protection from the way information is used, which is
simply not the case. The

since the Crime and Security Act 2010 and the proposals before us. The
evidence presented when we were in government just over a year ago
clearly set out the case for a retention period of six years. As I have
pointed out, the Home Affairs Committee’s conclusion was that
there should be a minimum of three years. If the Minister checks the
wording of its report, it says “at least” three years; it
does not actually recommend three years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000178">&#160;</a>

clause sets out how DNA will be removed from the database, and the
title of the clause suggests that it is about the destruction of DNA
profiles. As I highlighted earlier, that gives the impression that we
are talking about people’s physical details being retained for
the purposes of DNA, and that is simply not the case. That is why we
tabled an amendment to highlight one of the problems with the way in
which the matter has been debated. People’s DNA profiles are a
very emotive issue; people are quite rightly sensitive about it. At
times, it has led to comment and assumptions about what details are
available and what information people have access to that are not
entirely accurate. That has led people to support positions on altering
the retention of DNA profiles that we may live to regret, in many
instances. I would be interested to hear the Minister’s

everybody’s DNA on the national DNA database for ever and a day.
It may be worth his talking to the hon. Member for Gedling, who I know
is on record saying that that would be disproportionate. There is
clearly an understandable difference in view, but the hon. Member for

hon. Member for Glasgow North West will have seen the regulatory impact
assessment and the costs suggested in that. We have been working hard
with the police service and ACPO to reduce the costs of implementing
the proposals. In the previous Government’s Crime and Security
Act 2010, implementing that proposal had a one-off initial cost of
£50 million, as is stated in the regulatory impact assessment. I
assure the hon. Gentleman that we have been working hard to make

everyone’s DNA should be on a DNA database; let us get that on
the record. There is a point about future costs and how DNA will be
processed. Do the Government intend to continue processing in batches,
so that information is retained, albeit anonymously, by Forensic
Science Service providers? If so, how will that be regulated? People
have concerns about that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000184">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Glasgow North West. I would not wish to impute any
such comments to the hon. Member for Eltham, given what he may say
during the rest of the Committee. Using batches and the magic number
82, which we discussed in the previous debate, is a practical and
cost-effective way for Forensic Science Service providers to process
the DNA and derive a profile that can be loaded on to the national DNA
database. The key point is the destruction of the DNA sample provided
following the creation of that profile. Even if samples are processed
in batches of 82, they will be destroyed at the end, and if the
conditions in the Bill are not satisfied, the profile derived from the
sample will be destroyed. The hon. Member for Eltham has focused on the
processing aspect, but as I said earlier, GeneWatch clearly indicated
that it felt that to be a bit of a red herring. Regulation also comes
from the forensics
regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000185">&#160;</a>

has been interesting to listen to some of the debate on this issue. The
hon. Gentleman seems keen to downplay the sensitivity of the
information retained on the national DNA database, even if there are
familial or ethnic traits or other information that can be derived from
it. I am a little surprised that he appears to make that case, despite
the information provided by the Information Commissioner, who clearly
has concerns about the sensitivity of the information, hence the points
that he has consistently made about the situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This clause refers to proceedings that may follow
an investigation. In his evidence, the Information Commissioner raised
concerns about the retention of data in unresolved cases. When the
Minister responds, can he say what will happen to data where a case is
not resolved but an individual who has been investigated or arrested in
relation to that investigation is no longer a suspect? How will those
data be treated? Will they be kept until the end of the inquiry? Will
they be destroyed as soon as the profile is made? Will the profile be
retained? This issue concerns both samples and the profile, because if
an investigation is ongoing, there may be a need to retain samples.
Should the profile on the database also be retained? What will happen
to an individual in those
circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
touched on the issue of appeals earlier, in relation to amendment 15.
Of course, appeals are potentially ongoing proceedings, following an
investigation. As I mentioned earlier, the Forensic Science Service
told me that it is frequently asked for information on re-testing and
samples by defence counsel. I appreciate that there is a difference
between samples from a crime scene and samples taken from an
individual. I asked about that when I visited the forensic science
people; they said that there is bound to be a cost involved if samples
are disposed of and then re-testing needs to be carried out. They
suggested that there are many situations where re-testing is requested.
I accept that some of those situations may involve re-testing of crime
scene samples, but there are also personal samples taken at the time of
arrest.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Where
the Government are attempting to reduce the data held on individuals to
protect civil liberties, it would be perverse if the rights of
individuals seeking justice through the courts were denied in any way,
and if the unavailability of information interfered in some way with a
court process. Could the Minister say whether the Government have given
any consideration to that? I know he has already indicated that it is
possible to re-test, but if there are a lot of cases where that
happens, there is a further cost involved. Although it is desirable to
dispose of the personal data, there is a large number of personal
samples still being held that will need to be disposed of; again, that
will be an enormous cost, as the Minister knows. There will also be
instances where samples may need to be retained. In every circumstance,
once the profile is obtained and six months have elapsed,

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think the Minister has already answered this question, but for
clarification, when the Bill refers to personal samples being
destroyed, does it refer specifically to personal samples taken at the
time of arrest, and not to samples gathered as evidence or at crime
scenes? I would welcome the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000194">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On that last point, I think that the hon.
Gentleman has correctly reflected the position that I have stated. His
point about re-testing samples is interesting. If he is hearing that
further re-testing is required or a further sample will be needed, that
is in a situation where those samples are already retained. If he is
suggesting that issues exist even where we have a physical sample, the
retention of that original sample does not seem to be the relevant
factor here. Perhaps I have misunderstood
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I genuinely apologise if I have misled the
Minister. I am saying that there are requests for the samples that are
held currently. The concern is that if they are destroyed in future and
proceedings follow on from an investigation, or even from a conviction,
re-testing could be costly and
time-consuming.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000196">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is why I think that the hon.
Gentleman’s final point, on personal samples taken following an
arrest to get a DNA profile, is the relevant one. I suspect that he may
be flagging up the issue of retention of other crime scene information
and evidence, which may be subject to further investigation and
examination so that the facts of a case, and whether an appeal is
appropriate, can be determined.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the broader point at issue in clause 2, it might assist the
Committee if I explain in a little more detail what we mean by the
“conclusion of the investigation” or the
“conclusion of those proceedings”. The hon. Gentleman is
correct that that question was raised by the Information Commissioner
in his written evidence to the Committee. If a person is arrested for
an offence but is not charged with it, for the purposes of this clause
the investigation is concluded when the person from whom the material
was taken is no longer suspected of having committed that offence. That
might be, for example, when another person has been arrested, or once
an alibi has been checked out.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question of whether a person remains under investigation will turn on
the facts of a particular case, however. In many cases, it will be
possible to determine rapidly whether a person committed a particular
offence, but there will be exceptional cases in which a person remains
under suspicion for some time, so the issue will be determined on a
case-by-case basis. DNA evidence may well be crucial in such cases, so
we would be faced with a choice of either retaining the DNA profile for
the duration of the investigation, or taking a fresh sample some time
later when it becomes apparent that further DNA analysis is required.
The law at present would not permit the taking of a second sample in
such rare cases, and in any event we consider that it is less intrusive
to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 198<a class="bkMark" name="Column198">&#160;</a>
                           </div>retain the original DNA profile and fingerprints than to take fresh ones
some months later. The issue hinges on my explanation of the intention
behind clause 2; material may be retained while investigations are
ongoing.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
a person is arrested for an offence and
subsequently charged, the legal proceedings are concluded when the
charges are dropped, when the person is acquitted of the offence or, if
they are found guilty, when they are acquitted on appeal. I hope that
that clarifies the situation that will arise once the charging decision
has been made.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000200">&#160;</a>

the investigation or court proceedings are complete, clause 1 will
require the materials to be deleted unless other provisions in the Bill
permit its retention, for example if a conviction already
existed—that is, if someone had already been convicted of a

investigation. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will recognise that the provision is important and will be minded to
accept its retention in the

the proposal, which came into force in 2007, it was not in possession
of any empirical evidence to suggest that three years was the right
length of time. We seem to have settled on supporting the three years
adopted by Scotland, although that was done when there was no detailed

said in its evidence that there was no evidence base for three years
and that it felt that six years was supported. During the Select
Committee’s consideration of data retention, the Home Office
wrote to it with research into people who had been arrested. Taking
people who had been arrested as a separate group, the evidence
suggested that, in the six-year period after arrest, there was a higher
propensity to be re-arrested among the group than among the general
public. Therefore, the six-year period, which was passed in the Crime
and Security Act 2010, was
recommended.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
that Act was passed, it was accepted that there might be an argument
for three years. The then Ministers—I have discussed this with
one of them—proposed that the approach should be to adopt the
six-year proposal and then ensure that the DNA strategy board carried
out a detailed analysis of how useful information retained for more
than three years, up to six years, had been in the detection of
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000216">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Home Office pointed out that the research, undertaken by Professor
Fraser, did not assess whether any alternative would be effective, nor
could it determine how many serious crimes went undetected, as the
relevant profiles had been deleted, so they were not there to assess
whether they would have been of use. That is a problem with what the
Bill is
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">If
we adopted a six-year proposal, it would be quite feasible for the
Government to come back in several years and say that they had done a
detailed analysis of the retention of DNA for the six-year period and
discovered that there was no benefit to retaining DNA beyond three
years. The problem with the Government’s approach is that that
analysis is not possible. All the relevant information needed to assess
whether the retention of DNA for more than three years and up to six is
a useful tool in the detection and prevention of crime will be deleted
under the Bill.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If,
in future, there are some serious cases in which it was found that the
provisions had allowed for the deletion of DNA belonging to people who
would otherwise have been detected early and prevented from carrying
out a serious crime, we could be back here reconsidering the length of
time for which DNA is retained. The sensible approach, given our
position and accepting that there has to be change, would be to adopt
the six-year period, carry out a detailed review, independently of
Government, and base future decisions on empirical evidence. Once that
information has gone, there is no going back. It has disappeared for
ever, and we could be back considering the matter again and regretting
our
actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000218">&#160;</a>

23 reintroduces proposals in the Crime and Security Act 2010, to which
the Minister referred earlier, that relate to the retention period of
three years for people who are under 18. The other amendments relate to
clause 25 and the destruction of materials that we currently hold. My
point on that is similar to the one that I have just made. Under the
regime set out in the

more than three years, that removes the opportunity for us to adopt an
evidence-based approach to the use of that DNA material. The sensible
approach must be for the six-year rule to be applied and to carry out
that detailed research. After all, ACPO is in
favour of retaining the six-year period, and is asking us to retain it.
It feels that the evidence supports the retention period of six years
and indicated, in the evidence session, that it felt that approximately
1,000 cases would go undetected as a result of the changes proposed in
the Bill. We need to bear in mind the sorts of cases in which the DNA
database has been used for detection. For example, Abdul Azad had a DNA
sample taken for a minor offence. He went on to rape someone five
months later. His DNA would not have been retained under the proposed
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000219">&#160;</a>

to concede that a six-year period may in the long run not be necessary.
It may not add much to the ability of the police to detect and prevent
crime. What I am suggesting is that we need an evidence-based approach,

which we can achieve that is by using the data that we have and have
retained for six years, and by determining whether that is assisting
the police or not. We can then come back to the issue, having proved
beyond any shadow of a doubt that we are not damaging the
police’s ability in any way to detect and prevent crime by
reducing the period to three years. I make the point again that when
the system was introduced in Scotland, there was no evidence base for
choosing three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000223">&#160;</a>

crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000225">&#160;</a>

believe that if we are to move ahead on the basis of what the
Government have proposed, we must satisfy ourselves
that there is an evidence base for it, and at the moment that evidence
does not exist. Professor Fraser, who carried out the review after the
three-year period was introduced in Scotland, was not able to prove
categorically that there was no effect in accepting a three-year
instead of a six-year period. There was no comparison with other
regimes. Therefore, there is a duty on us to carry out that review
before we do something that we may well regret in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000226">&#160;</a>

could not be present for Dr Wallace’s evidence, but I did read

that it involved just two cases. We have more than two cases from the
Forensic Science Service showing that the current regime would have
allowed quite serious

cases where the use of DNA taken from people who have been arrested for

people being identified as the perpetrators of serious, violent sexual
crimes. This takes us back to the issue of balance: where do we draw
the line? We accept that the European Court of Human Rights has
determined that we cannot indiscriminately retain people’s DNA
just because they walked under a blue lamp outside a police station.

came to a conclusion, under the 2010 Act, that the proportionate way to
deal with that was a retention period of six years. ACPO and the Home
Office have produced evidence suggesting that people who have been
arrested have a higher propensity to be re-arrested than other members
of the public, and that that propensity exists within the first six
years after the first arrest. They conclude, therefore, that six years

but if I have been corrected, I stand corrected. The evidence, however,
is not yet there to support a period of three years as opposed to six,
which is the thrust of my argument. The position adopted by the
Government when the 2010 Act was passed was that the six-year period
should remain under review until such time as empirical evidence could
be obtained to determine whether the six-year period was correct, or if
it could be reduced still further. It could have been five years, or
four, or three, as a result of that evidence. We are having this
argument about three or six years merely because

                           </div>the Scottish Parliament adopted the three-year period, and subsequent
reports suggested that that was right. As I have said, however,
Professor Fraser’s report was not conclusive in deciding between
three and six years, so the Home Office, which carried out its own
research, and ACPO, which did the same, decided that the six-year
period was appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000242">&#160;</a>

to evidence given in the run-up to the 2010 Act, ACPO was after a
different period altogether? He is trying to suggest that six years is

Parliament to decide.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000246">&#160;</a>

before Parliament comes to a conclusion, my argument is that it should
have all the evidence before it. There is the opportunity to prove
beyond any shadow of doubt that a retention period of six years is
wrong, but there is also the opportunity to prove that it is right.
Taking the precipitate action, however, of removing all that data and
fixing a period of three years at this time denies Parliament that
opportunity, and it may result in serious crimes. Although they may be
small in number, as has been mentioned, such crimes are very serious.

gave evidence to the Committee, is an extraordinarily impressive
individual. If ACPO says it has concerns, we have a duty to listen. I
am not suggesting for one minute that six years is absolutely right. I
accept that there is a debate to be had, but the thrust of my argument
is that it should be based on a detailed, thorough investigation of the
procedures laid out in the 2010 Act. That has not happened, and we are
denying ourselves the opportunity to do that by taking the step of
imposing three years. In fact, we will never know, because information
will be destroyed as a consequence of the Bill and it will not be there
to carry out that assessment. I suggest to hon. Members that there will
be a future occasion when people will be angry because of an occurrence
resulting from the changes being imposed. Those changes should be based
on evidence, but not the evidence before
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11032978000249">&#160;</a>
