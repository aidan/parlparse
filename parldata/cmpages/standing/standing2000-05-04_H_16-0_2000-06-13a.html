<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have reached the clause 65 stand part debate. I understand that my co-Chairman, Dr. Clark, permitted a wide debate on amendments Nos. 276 and 277, which were disposed of on Thursday afternoon. I also gather that the debate at that time ranged over the subject matter of some of the amendments to clause 66. In view of the wide-ranging debate, I call for short interventions on the amendments tabled to clause 66. Those interventions should concentrate so far as possible on matters not raised in debate on amendment No. 276.

<P>
When we have disposed of the amendments to clause 66, a clause stand part debate may not be necessary.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 68 and 89, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question agreed to.

<P>
Clause 65 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 278, in page 45, line 22, after ``paragraph'', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`3. (Rules for determining whether a gain is a gain on the disposal of a business asset or a non-business asset), after sub-paragraph (5) insert-

<P>
``(6) Where sub-paragraph (2) of this Paragraph applies the person to whom the gain accrues shall be entitled by notice given within a period of two years immediately following the tax year in which the gain accrues to elect as at the date when the asset became or (as the case may be) ceased to be a business asset to have the asset treated as if it had been sold on that day by the person making the disposal and immediately re-acquired by him at its market value at that date and the provisions of sub-paragraph (5) shall mutatis mutandis apply to the two gains for the purposes of paper relief'' and in paragraph'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I bid you good morning, Mr. Cook. The amendment is our only amendment to clause 66 that relates to the debate last week. It simply picks up the issue of apportionment. Frequently, apportionment on a straight time basis for allocating the gains on a straight line across a period of ownership can be unfair. That is especially true in the case of the new definitions of business assets and of whether people owned assets before the changes in the Budget.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): On a point of order,
Mr. Cook. There is a great deal of noise outside the Room. I think that we shall all find it difficult in the early stage of our proceedings to hear hon. Members' remarks. I would like that fact to be recognised.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I concur. [
Interruption.] As hon. Members can hear, new Labour has learned something about stage production. Had they not noticed?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point was implicitly recognised in 1965 and in relation to the 1982 rebasings. The mechanics that the amendment would introduce would allow a taxpayer to elect to have his asset valued at the date on which it changed into a business asset, so that an especially large growth attributable to the time at which it was a business asset would be recognised in the calculation of the gain and relief due. The amendment would provide one answer to the problems that we debated at length last week.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> As the hon. Gentleman explained, the present rules work by apportioning the total gain on a time basis, according to the length of the time that the asset has been a business asset and a non-business asset, and applying the appropriate taper to the respective parts of the gain. Let us suppose that an asset has been held for five years in total, for two years as a non-business asset and for three years as a business asset, prior to its being sold at a gain of £1,000. The gain would be apportioned into a non-business gain of £400 and a business gain of £600. Those gains would be treated as relating to separate assets held for the full period of ownership. The £400 gain would be reduced by five years' worth of non-business taper relief, and the £600 gain would be reduced by five years' worth of business taper relief.

<P>
The amendment would give the person selling the asset the right to elect for a different approach. The market value of the asset at the time that it changed from being a non-business asset to a business asset would need to be determined, and the gains of the respective periods would need to be calculated.

<P>
Apportionment has been given an increased profile as a result of the changes made in clause 66 to relax the rules for a shareholding to qualify as a business asset. Many shareholdings that were not business assets before 6 April 2000 will become business assets from that date. When the shares are eventually sold, the gain will need to be apportioned, and the business and non-business tapers will be applied to the respective parts. Although the amendment is not limited to the change of status at 6 April 2000, in the near future, that is likely to be the principal reason for a change in status.

<P>
I understand why the amendment has been tabled, and in principle it is not without its attractions. However, I cannot recommend it for several reasons. First, determining the market value of the asset at the time that it changes from being a non-business asset, or vice versa, would be a considerable compliance burden for both taxpayers and the Revenue. For quoted shares, people would have no difficulty. They would simply look up the value in the stock exchange list. However, complex and sometimes lengthy negotiations are necessary to establish the market value of unquoted shares, land and other assets.

<P>
Secondly, that difficulty would be compounded if an asset were to make multiple changes between business and non-business status. The wording of the amendment is not sufficiently precise for it to be clear whether multiple valuations are envisaged, but carrying through the principle would suggest so. The time apportionment basis copes with such circumstances much more straightforwardly.

<P>
Thirdly, it is no answer to say that market value needs to be determined only when an election must be made. Any taxpayer would want to compare the outcomes of both approaches before deciding whether to elect for the valuation approach.

<P>
Fourthly, the burden of having to establish the taxable gain under both approaches would add considerably to the complexity of the capital gains tax system for that aspect. Fifthly, under the amendment, the deemed disposal and reacquisition at the time of the change of status would give rise to a gain taxable at that point, rather than at the time of the subsequent actual disposal. That would entail taxing part of the gain in a year that may be some time before the year of disposal. Re-opening and revising the tax due for that year would be difficult under self-assessment. The question would also arise of whether interest should be payable in respect of tax due for that year. Although I accept that ways may be found around that, such as charging all the parts of the gain at the time of the actual disposal, that would not be the effect of the amendment.

<P>
Finally, the time limit of two years within which the election would have to be made would not fit with the time limits for making and amending tax returns under self-assessment.

<P>
If the hon. Gentleman believes that such an election would be appropriate, notwithstanding all the difficulties involved-the same effect could be achieved by selling the assets and reacquiring them soon after 6 April 2000-I cannot accept that. An actual sale and reacquisition would have taxation consequences at the time, which would be taken into account for that year. An election would not have effect until the asset was eventually sold for good, and would then re-open the tax consequences of an earlier year. It is one thing for a person to sell and later to reacquire an asset, but if a person does not, I do not understand why an election should be possible to allow the person to be treated as though he had, especially given the practical difficulties that such an election would create. If the hon. Gentleman will not withdraw the amendment, I shall urge members of the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Before my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs responds, without repeating the detailed debate that we had in our previous sitting, I should like to make some comments in the capacity of an amateur Cassandra.

<P>
The Economic Secretary's response and the tenor of our previous debate clearly suggest a major dawning problem. The apparently clear distinction between business and non-business assets turns out to be anything but clear. Were it clear, assets would be either business assets or not. The whole of this and the preceding debate arises from the fact that assets can move between those categories. Business asset status is metaphysical, and does not inhere in the asset. The Economic Secretary probably does not believe me now, but if she is fortunate enough to remain in her current job for a little while longer, she will believe me later. I prophesy that there will be an industry in finding ways of classifying and reclassifying assets and their relationships to the people who hold them, in and out of business status, and a significant portion of her officials will be occupied in tracking them down. If the current situation obtains for much longer, I regret that successive Finance Bills will try to close off ``loopholes'', which owe their origins to an unfair distinction in the first place.

<P>
We stand at the threshold of a long legislative journey, at the end of which nothing will have been gained, except by accountants in the private sector who will create a good deal of toil and trouble for officials in the public sector. In the light of this and the preceding debate, I hope that the Economic Secretary will consider whether the distinction holds up at all, and whether it will be workable as a long-term proposition. The speech that she just read out was, to the average mind, a model of complexity and unclarity. I suspect that if she were to stand up and make that speech in her constituency on Friday, eyes would stand out on stalks. That is not because it was an inadequate or improper speech but because she has removed herself from the ordinary world, via the business and non-business asset distinction, into a world of complexities and refinements that most people will not understand. That is exactly the kind of world in which the accountancy profession, at its most ingenious, revels. Part of the disadvantage of creating a distinction that is not clear is that the rich-large companies and rich individuals-can always find ways of being a step ahead, perfectly legitimately, of the Economic Secretary's officials, while those who are not rich cannot. Such patterns have evolved under many previous Administrations, of varying colours, who have introduced similar distinctions and suffered the same consequences. A widening gap will open between those who know how to manipulate such extraordinarily complex distinctions and those who do not.

<P>
Paradoxically, as the Revenue, under the Economic Secretary and her successors, seeks to block off successive loopholes, the gap will widen between those who can afford the necessary advice and those who cannot. Merely understanding the way through the thicket-layer upon layer of blocking off of increasingly subtle loophole manufacture-will be a highly expensive activity. Eventually, which is why I say that I am a Cassandra, the Economic Secretary or her successors will abolish the underlying unclear distinction because it will not work. I suspect that the Economic Secretary does not believe that, but she will. It would be good if it dawned on her earlier rather than later-that is an unintentional pun-as, otherwise, although no great and lasting damage will have been done to the British economy, an awful lot of time, trouble and money will have been spent needlessly.

<P>
If this and the preceding debate have done nothing else, they have at least served to alert us to that problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend rightly mentions the underlying philosophical problem. We are addressing the simple position of someone who stays in the same employ and whose shares in the company become business assets. The Economic Secretary's main objection to the approach taken in the amendment was on the issue of market value and unlisted and unquoted companies. I grant that the approach would be dead easy with listed and less easy with unlisted companies, but I think that there are methods by which to address that.

<P>
I began by describing a situation in which someone holds the assets, which become business assets either through this legislation or something else. Unless the various qualifications for business asset taper relief are greatly simplified, people will go in and out of qualification. They may be deputed by the group in which they are employed to work for a subsidiary of which the group does not have control; their shares would not then qualify as business assets. When they leave the subsidiary, their shares become business assets once more.

<P>

</P>

<P>
For 1,000 years, there has been a healthy anglo-saxon view in this country that a tax should be fair. The Paymaster General would be the first person to hold that view. Poeple are in the habit of refusing to pay a tax that is unfair. These measures are unfair because time apportionment ignores any gain that arises. People may find that shares in their company did frightfully well when they qualified as business assets and did not
 do well when they did not. Because of the time apportionment rules, they may not receive business asset relief on most of their gain, and they may feel unhappy and badly done by and refuse to pay the tax. A tax mechanism that will be seen by many people as unfair will prove to be a problem.

<P>
We said last week that we would want to raise matters on Report. I do not want to press the amendment to a Division because it is part of a much bigger issue. However, after the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and myself, the Government should think more deeply about the issue. As the measure is structured, there will be unending problems.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I will respond to a couple of points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, although he said that he would withdraw the amendment. There is nothing metaphysical about the matter and I do not think that it is philosophical. The question is one of definition. There is nothing metaphysical about the distinction between business and non-business assets, which dates from 1998. The same distinction that was made then holds here.

<P>
Everyone benefits from the changes proposed under the Budget; some benefit more than others, but everyone stands to gain. It is worth recapping about the effects of the proposals in the amendment; they would lead to uncertainty, be bureaucratic and involve a lot of valuations. That was acknowledged by those who tabled the amendment. I cannot comment on whether the hon. Member for West Dorset wishes to be Cassandra, Mr. Cook, because that goes beyond the remit of our proceedings. However, I note his views.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised the issue of time apportionment, which produces the same result as the evaluation basis, in that the value of the assets increases uniformly over time. The measure gives a reasonable approximation of value overall, and has the advantage of simplicity and reduced compliance costs, when compared with the evaluation approach. That is why we believe that the clause is better as it stands.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 46, line 3, after ``group'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a Venture Capital Investment Trust'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 292, in page 46, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```Venture Capital Investment Trust'' means an investment trust in respect of which holdings in companies which are not listed on a recognised stock exchange represent more than 50 per cent. by value of the investment trust's investments and for the purposes of this definition ``investment trust'' and ``holding'' shall be construed in accordance with section 842 of the Taxes Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment is specific and focused. Under the current proposals, business asset relief will be available only to employees of quoted trading companies. There are several situations within the venture capital industry in which employees are employees of venture capital trusts. Those employees would be excluded from the benefits of business assets, merely because that industry happens to be structured in that way, and that seems unfair. Our amendments may not address that issue perfectly, but if they raise any other problems, to which the Economic Secretary may refer, that is not the point. The point is that they deal with an issue that needs to be addressed. If our amendments are not the best way of addressing it, we hope that the Government will come up with alternative proposals.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I can see where the amendment is coming from. It seeks to bring the benefit of business assets taper, especially to employees of certain quoted investment companies, provided the companies invest substantially in unlisted companies. Direct investment in unlisted companies would of course attract business assets taper. The hon. Gentleman invited me to find difficulties; I fear that I have found some. The amendment poses difficulties of principle as well as technical difficulties.

<P>
There are three difficulties of principle. First, the primary aim of the business assets taper is to further the productivity agenda, so we would allow business assets taper only for shares in trading companies. That is not to say that other sorts of companies are not useful or that their employees do not work hard, but the productivity gains on which the economy depends are founded on trading companies. Other schemes are available to employees of investment companies, including the new all-employee share plan that the Government have introduced and the other approved schemes introduced by the previous Government.

<P>
Secondly, the amendment seems to suggest an equivalence between the conditions of business assets taper and the definition of a venture capital investment trust. Indirect pooled investment in unlisted companies is not at all the same thing as direct investment. An objective of business assets taper relief is to increase the direct provision of risk capital to early stage entrepreneurial companies by individuals and others within the CGT system. A venture capital investment trust can provide such risk capital, but it is company, not individual, investors that invest and therefore take the risk. Any widespread pooling of investments reduces the risk substantially; taper relief does not apply to companies. Companies that are investment trusts have their own tax incentives, including exemption from capital gains on their investments.

<P>
Thirdly, even if we accepted that indirect investment in unlisted companies was as good as direct investment, the proposal would allow up to half of the value of the venture capital investment trust to go elsewhere. Any equivalence with the business assets taper definition would be lost.

<P>
I shall briefly set out the amendment's technical difficulties. When one goes beneath its surface, it becomes clear that it does not quite achieve the similarity with the Government's proposals on entitlement to business assets taper that those who tabled it may have envisaged. The defects include the fact that the amendment would allow a VCIT to invest in non-trading companies, which could then invest entirely in listed companies. The amendment would allow business asset taper on a shareholding where the whole of the return came ultimately from passive shareholdings in listed companies. It would also allow a VCIT to invest in the unlisted subsidiaries of listed companies and to invest in close companies. We would then see the creation of avoidance systems based on VCITs-which could create the need for much anti-avoidance legislation. It is not clear how the 50 per cent. test would operate. Would it be daily, or over an accounting period? There could be many problems with making it work.

<P>
The key productivity gains could be obtained by direct investment in trading companies. The amendment would not secure those gains, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. If not, I shall urge the Committee to vote against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary will be aware that 3i has raised the issue with the Financial Secretary. The company is not untypical of the industry, and 90 per cent. of its United Kingdom staff are employed by a venture capital trust. I made it clear at the outset that I suspected that, in raising the issue, our amendments would raise other questions. Are the Government willing to tackle the problem in other ways? The Revenue could give special exemptions. It is grossly unfair to exclude one category of people.

<P>
The staff of 3i will not all qualify for the enterprise management incentive. 3i has a large number of staff, who do an important job for the economy, perhaps the most important of all in terms of the massive generation of new businesses and of money for them. I am sure that the Government would not want to exclude them. The Chancellor has made a lot of noise about such people being virtuous and about wanting to encourage them.

<P>
We are happy to withdraw our amendment in principle, on the basis that it is a probing amendment, but we want the comfort of an acknowledgment that the Government will find a way to deal with the problem.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am not sure that I feel able to give the hon. Gentleman the sort of assurances that he seeks. I am happy to say that officials will continue to consider the issue, but I cannot promise that we shall propose any specific way to deal with it.

<P>
The business asset taper promotes productivity, so there are restrictions to trading companies. Investment companies are simply involved in investing. We can promote investment, but productivity is not directly increased as such.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary has raised a question in my mind. Will she give an example of how the gain in productivity arises? As a substantive part of her response to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, I would like her to give a real-world, concrete example of how the scheme delivers the productivity gain that she described.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not sure what the right hon. Gentleman is asking. The scheme is set up to act in that way. There is no dispute among Opposition Members about the fact that the overall thrust of the scheme, and the other initiatives that we have debated on recent clauses, is to encourage companies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I think that I can help. The question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) related to a response that the Economic Secretary gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. She said that the scheme, by which she presumably meant the taper relief on business assets, promoted productivity. My right hon. Friend simply asked what evidence there was for that proposition.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The taper relief is a new dimension, as the right hon. Gentleman is aware. The hard evidence will come over time, and we shall be able to reflect on and consider the outcomes and gains for companies. All the reports and studies that we have had, in terms of promoting business, increasing productivity and engaging senior management in companies, suggest that the provisions will lead to the desired benefits.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): If that is the case, why not have even more taper relief to create even more productivity?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Hon. Members are now trying to return to clause 65, a provision that represents a significant improvement in reducing the effective tax rate to 10 per cent. after four years. The shorter taper for business assets is one of the ways in which we are achieving that. The other way relates to clause 66. The changes to the thresholds have been welcomed in many different quarters. The Confederation of British Industry said that the changes in clause 66
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meet our request that the business asset regime should encourage and reward entrepreneurial investment from all sources, including business angels, owner-managers, key employees and the whole workforce, whether full or part-time.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): Perhaps I can help the Economic Secretary. As I understand it, she is trying to draw a distinction between direct investment by employer-managers and investment by capital investment trusts. How does she justify excluding investment trusts? The import of her comments seems to be that their investments will be less productive. Why does she believe that capital investment trust investments will be less productive for the economy than those made by companies' employees and managers?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Hon. Members were not listening to my earlier comments. I explained the reasons for our belief. We do not believe that, in the circumstances envisaged in the amendment, individuals would be putting their capital at risk by investing. The relationship that we are trying to establish, whereby individuals gain from supporting small, start-up, entrepreneurial businesses, as envisaged in the Bill, would be negated in the absence of an element of risk. Such investment would, in effect, be pooled investment, and would not necessarily be investment in a risky, entrepreneurial activity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> What the Chancellor said, and all the stuff about giving business taper relief to people in respect of the businesses for which they work, is in essence simple. If people own a bit of the business for which they work, they work harder to make the business a success. That is everyone's experience across the spread of business. This may not be the right approach, but the principle is absolutely right. However, the principle seems to apply just as much to a company such as 3i, in that people who work for such businesses work day and night to structure all sorts of complex schemes in order to earn their fees. There is no logic in saying that such people are less worthy than all the people in other sectors who own shares in the business in which they work, who will benefit. An increase in productivity, if it is described in that way, should result across the board in any business in which people are given that incentive.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> My belief is that if we were to extend the business asset taper to include shares in investment companies, people would simply set up companies on an individual or group basis to hold their investments in order to gain access to business asset taper relief on all their investments. That would defeat the purpose of specifying separate tapers for business assets and general investments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Did the Economic Secretary consider introducing a motive test in order to rule out mechanisms that she believes constitute tax avoidance mechanisms as opposed to those involving companies that, like 3i, genuinely contribute to the development and enhancement of business in this country? Has she studied 3i's annual report to understand what it does? I was intrigued to hear her suggest earlier, during exchanges with my hon. Friends the Members for West Dorset and for Arundel and South Downs, that the proposals will result in gains in productivity. If we took her line of argument to its logical conclusion and eliminated tapers altogether, productivity would increase even more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I remind my right hon. Friend that the Economic Secretary can hardly claim that it is impossible to set a motive test, because such a test is used in all three schedules relating to the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that telling point because it underscores the point that I am making. I worry about the thinking behind the schedule. The Economic Secretary, when pressed to give a concrete example of how the mechanism would work, said that we would have to wait for the passage of time. The Government have apparently introduced the measure with no analysis-and with no detailed research, to judge from what the Economic Secretary said about companies such as 3i. I begin to wonder why the Government are acting as they are. The Economic Secretary has been far from convincing in response to straightforward questions put by those on the Conservative Benches.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I assure the Economic Secretary that I have listened carefully to her throughout the debate. I am sorry that, owing to a Select Committee commitment, I could not be in the Committee last week. However, I read the debate on the previous clause and do not want to go over ground already covered. The Economic Secretary, by admitting that she has no concrete evidence for the distinction that she makes, is throwing caution to the winds. In her statement that investment is productive only when it is risky, she goes way beyond what any of us believe as the result of our business experience. The Economic Secretary shakes her head, but a few moments ago she said that there was a distinction to be made between investments made by individuals and those made by venture capital trusts. She regards it as productive when individuals make investments and take risks, but less productive when venture capital trusts have a range of investments that reduces the risk. Surely latter investments can be equally productive, with the benefit of their experience from making a range of investments, trusts may contribute just as much to the economy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to add one general point about the logic of taper relief. The Economic Secretary tried to argue against the proposal made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs on the grounds that the move was part of the productivity agenda. My hon. Friend succeeded where the Economic Secretary failed-in explaining the connection that is intended between the proposal and productivity. It is meant to encourage people to invest more time and effort in their firms, so that those firms are more productive. We understand that part of the argument, but the Economic Secretary has two serious conceptual problems on her hands. The first has a direct practical bearing; if her proposition is true, it is true whether employees' activity is conducted through 3i or another venture capital investment trust. Therefore, if her proposition is right, her argument is defeated.

<P>
The second problem arises from the fact that the Economic Secretary has returned to the risk agenda, as it might be called. The Government appear to be systematically confusing two things, as they did when we discussed the management incentive. The effort that is directed by skilled individuals towards taking nascent companies forward, which is hugely productive for the economy and assists with productivity, is being confused with risk. The Government have celebrated the taking of risk as a means of solving a problem-they spent most of their years in opposition attacking fatcats, but they now want to reward enterprise. The Government differentiate between a fatcat and a worthy entrepreneur on the basis that one does not take risk and the other does. Unfortunately, the taking of risk is not a virtuous activity in itself; it is a sad by-product of the necessities of commercial life. Rewarding risk is therefore conceptually vacuous. There is no point in giving a benefit to risk takers; it should be given to those who are improving the economy, and who are as likely to be members of venture capital investment trusts as to be directly involved in the company.

<P>
Thirdly, the Economic Secretary has beautifully illustrated the justice of the remarks that I made in relation to the previous amendment. Clearly, the real reason why she resists the otherwise impeccable logic of the propositions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is that she is scared-probably rightly-that a huge new realm of loopholes would be opened up if she were to admit the particular species of the rational extension of her proposition. Unfortunately, a huge new realm of loopholes will be opened anyway. People will find means of doing what is rational in the light of the scheme that she set up, even without the benefit or disbenefit of my hon. Friend's amendments.

<P>
The fourth point is more fundamental and relates to the nature of the taper reliefs. The logic of the Government's proposition on taper reliefs, which was never good, has utterly broken down. The Chancellor originally announced that it was a blinding insight into the nature of our economy-instead of allowing for the effects of inflation eroding value, people should be given a huge incentive to be long-term investors, through prolonged periods of taper relief. That is a wholly false proposition. There is no respectable economic basis for holding assets or owning shares for a long period when it is not otherwise rational to do so. That benefits nobody. At the opposite extreme, I accept that some benefit is to be gained from damping speculative activity. Had there been a rational version of taper relief, it might have been in the form of a short-term differential between, on one side, holding shares or a business overnight and, on the other, holding them for a year or some other period.

<P>
Therefore, the Chancellor's original remarks had an underlying logic, although the scheme itself had no economic justification. As I said, however, that scheme has utterly broken down. The Chancellor has undone it to the tune of six years, and told us that that is an advantage. If it is better to have a four-year taper relief than a 10-year taper relief, long-term investment cannot be better than short-term investment. If it were, the Chancellor would be acting against the proposition. Clearly, the Chancellor does not believe that it is advantageous to hold shares or businesses for a long time-he believes that it is advantageous to hold them for a shorter period, as he is now giving a benefit to those who do so. So why is the period material in the first place? What is the purpose of taper relief? Why has it been introduced?

<P>
If the Economic Secretary can provide a rational explanation of the four-year business asset taper relief other than saying that people asked for it because they were cross about its being 10 years, that would be most interesting to hear. We certainly have not heard it yet. This discussion shows that the interaction between the fundamentally flawed logic of taper relief and the fundamentally difficult distinction between business and non-business assets is creating an almighty mess of taxation. If the Economic Secretary and her colleagues persist in such a line of thought, bundles of amendments, schedules and clauses, in Finance Bill after Finance Bill, will be necessary to close off loopholes that have arisen because people are trying to do perfectly sensible things, such as being members of VCITs and looking after the economy. Such activities are in line with what Ministers want to achieve, but do not fit within the schema that they have produced.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Further to the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has made, I would like to ask the Economic Secretary whether she has had sight of a letter dated 23 March, which was sent to the Financial Secretary from 3i. The Financial Secretary went to an industry forum, where points germane to the amendment were put to him and confirmed in writing by the letter. Signed by Liz Hewitt, director of corporate affairs, the letter referred specifically to the point made in the amendment. It read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you would imagine, our share schemes are a crucial part of our reward schemes and in retaining our staff who invest in ambitious, growing businesses in the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That seems to be entirely compliant with the Economic Secretary's line of argument about the tapered arrangements. The company's raison d'etre is to invest, to generate new business, perhaps to extract more worth from existing assets-I think that that is known as increasing productivity-and to do so legitimately. However, the Economic Secretary has rejected the proposition made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, which was that such people should enjoy the benefits in the schedule.

<P>
Whatever our view of tapered tax in the capital gains area may be, 3i welcomes some of the changes. One could almost say that the Economic Secretary had half an ally in it, but one that asked a sensible, searching question. Has she read the letter of 23 March? What was her reaction to it? Did the advice that she received contain any analysis of what companies such as 3i do? If they cannot get their seat at the table, they shall feel that the Government have given them a slap in the face.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Government have made a mess-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I mentioned it when the hon. Gentleman was not present, but I am partially deaf, so I ask all hon. Members to make full use of the resonance of their voice boxes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I will not make full use of my voice box, but I shall speak up a little. I hope that you can hear me now, Mr. Cook. The Government have made a right mess of their attempt to reform capital gains tax. We were given a justification for it, which was that it was being done to improve productivity. The concept of productivity is virtually motherhood and apple pie, and few people know what it means. I hope that those who briefed the Economic Secretary thought about it before they handed her any notes on the subject, and I hope that my raising the matter at the start of my remarks will give them time to slip her a note to answer the question that I am about to ask. Does she mean labour productivity, capital productivity or total factor productivity? That is relevant, as we are talking about an incentive to try to vary the means of capital allocation.

<P>
I have only one other question on productivity. If taper relief is being introduced to increase it, why is four years considered the optimal figure?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not mean to be in any way impertinent, but I do not think that my hon. Friend will receive an answer from the Economic Secretary. Therefore, may I help by saying that I think that the structure of the argument was meant to be that the provision will improve labour productivity, as it will encourage employees in businesses concerned to work harder? The issue is not the introduction of taper relief, but its application on business assets to a firm's employees. That is meant to be part of the productivity agenda.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I will not delay the Committee on the matter, but my hon. Friend has not fully covered the question of the relationship between capital and labour productivity, which is central to forming a judgment on the issue. I would like an answer to the question that I asked a moment ago.

<P>
The inexorable logic of arguing that productivity will be increased by a reduction in the taper from 10 to four years, is that it would be better if it came down to two years or perhaps to zero. If it is not to be brought down to two years or to zero, we need an explanation of why not; is it because productivity peaks at four years-productivity as defined by the Government? Or is it, as I hope the Minister's advisers will bear in mind, that something else is at work-the yield? It may be very costly to reduce the period below four years. If that were the case, the argument on productivity probably does not hold because the optimal yield point may not be the point at which productivity is maximised. We need to know the Government's thinking on that. If that is the Government's intention, they should announce it as a stepping-stone to the abolition of all tapers. They should say that they intend to abolish the tax because it is an impediment to productivity and that taper relief is a rough and ready method. If they did that, they would have an imperfect but wholly logical structure to their argument. If they stick with what they have got, they will just generate a huge number of loopholes in the tax system and intellectually justify what is now a pig's ear of a tax.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I am mindful of your remark at the beginning of the debate, Mr. Cook, that if there were sufficiently wide-ranging discussion on the amendments, there might not be a stand part debate. Seeing how the debate is widening, I thought that it might be appropriate to get my retaliation in first.

<P>
We seem to be arguing about the fundamental logic of the taper period. The Chancellor himself stated originally that he wanted a 10-year taper period and gave plenty of detailed and elaborate justifications for that. He said that a lengthy period was economically and financially sound and good for industry-if not for the entire universe. However, we now see that a period of four years has been set down under clauses 65 and 66. The amendment asks, ``What about two years?'' The Financial Secretary has found that a difficult argument to confront. What is wrong with two years? Indeed, what is wrong with six months, five years or any other period? There seems to be no logic behind the choice. The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) suggested a number of theories, including ones that he might concede are rather fanciful, such as that productivity peaks at four years. There are a number of options, but there must be one commanding reason that has led the Financial Secretary and the Chancellor to decide that the period should be four years. I have been listening and I have not heard what that reason is.

<P>
As a consequence of the change, there is an increasing level of complexity on capital gains tax. I do not pretend to be an expert in that area of taxation, but we now have three parallel regimes running. If one visits an old cathedral with 13th century, 14th century and 15th century architecture, the different styles all give a sense of history and belonging, but that is not the case with the three regimes. To understand them, one has to know Latin for the first, old English for the second and gobbledygook for the third. We have such a mixture that it is almost impossible to understand the intended, never mind the actual, outcomes.

<P>
That brings us back to my original question. If the period were justified by an overwhelming argument based on productivity, national interest, financial control or tax take, we could understand it and accept the complexity. However, it does not seem to have an underlying justification.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset said that the requirement to hold on to shares does not in any self-evident way bring increased prosperity or productivity. I think that he said that there might be a case for some damping mechanism, and we see the need for that. There is certainly a need for a capital gains tax because, without it, people simply translate their income into capital and evade the income tax system. The system must apply in a way that is broadly comprehensible. It is a high level of demand on tax legislation, but it has interlocking and coherent policy objectives and makes it possible for Opposition Members to ask whether such propositions meet the criteria.

<P>
The Treasury has helpfully produced a code by which we should judge taxation. I should like to hear in plain words from the Economy Secretary why she considers that the clause fulfills the Chancellor's objectives, but the amendment does not. That plus on the one side and negative on the other has been missing entirely from anything that she has said so far. I thank you, Mr. Cook, for letting me go on a little. I shall forgo the opportunity to speak in the clause stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Hon. Gentlemen are becoming a tad repetitive; only a small number of points have been made.

<P>
I am not suggesting that 3i is not engaged in something worthy. It is, and I emphasised earlier the many worthy ways in which venture capital companies and others were engaged in supporting such causes. I drew a distinction between trading and investment companies, but that distinction has not been recognised adequately by Opposition Members. In the case of investment, we want to see individuals putting their capital at risk. The proposal is designed to support and reward such action. Several other proposals and schemes also promote venture capital investment and other engagements in the productivity agenda. We have debated such matters recently and some of them are successor schemes to those introduced by the previous Government. There are various ways in which we wish to promote economic activity. The proposal that we are discussing is not supposed to be the sole or even the primary method of doing so. There is a raft of proposals that, together, achieve that objective.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall give way for only a short time because I am trying to answer several points that have been made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understand that. I just want to clarify one of the hon. Lady's points. She said that she wanted to see individuals putting their capital at risk and being rewarded for doing so. But many employees will not be putting capital at risk. They would not have invested the capital, because they would have been given the shares. It cannot be a matter of trying to reward risk-taking capital investment.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Those employees will be leaving their investment in the company for four or more years. That is the point of the scheme. They will be more greatly rewarded by leaving the capital in for a longer period.

<P>
I am aware of the issues surrounding 3i and my response is made in the light of them. I am not disputing that investment improves productivity, but the shareholders are not making a direct investment. It would be open to them, if they wanted to incentivise the work force, to use the all-employee share ownership plan. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said that with a large staff, enterprise management incentives would be insufficient. It is a matter of examining the different complementary schemes that work to promote productivity, risk taking and support for small businesses.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I was asked about pooled investment. More generous taper relief compensates investors for higher-risk direct investment. When risks are pooled, they become lower, so business assets taper is unnecessary in those circumstances.

<P>
I was also asked about the four years criteria and how long assets need to be held. The scheme, as revised in this Budget, provides a greater incentive because there is a quicker taper, as hon. Gentlemen are aware. Tax is reduced the longer an asset is held, which continues to encourage stable and committed investment. We know of new developments in the market for start-up finance-especially for high-risk, high-technology ventures in the new economy-which have argued in favour of a shorter taper. That reflects today's entrepreneurial investment patterns and should encourage investors in small firms with strong growth potential.

<P>
Finally, I remind hon. Members of the CBI's comments on clause 66:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The changes to the threshold are very welcome, and meet our request that the business asset regime should encourage and reward entrepreneurial investment from all sources, including business angels, owner-managers, key employers in the whole workforce, whether full or part-time.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fulsome praise from the CBI. I commend the clause, but not the amendment, to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The position is clear. We understand the Government's logic that business taper relief is for trading companies and, in turn, the people who work for them. The problem is that certain investment companies-venture capital trusts, for example-are both employers and trusts. In the case of 3i many people are involved, and in other circumstances, it is common for employer companies also to be the venture capital trusts.

<P>
It is important to establish whether the securities, which help people to increase business activities, will qualify for business taper. Assets may have been acquired under one of the other schemes, but business taper relief can be important subsequently. Our simple point is that it is unfair, just because the employing companies happen to be VCITs, to exclude their shares from the benefits of business taper relief.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde alluded to the letter to the Financial Secretary, and further correspondence in June repeated the point. It is shabby of the Government to have turned a blind eye to it. We will be happy to withdraw the amendment if they make an effort to tackle the issue, which needs to be tackled in equity. If the Government do not say that they will do so, we will have no choice but to put it to the vote.

<P>
Because the Government think that the issue is too difficult otherwise, they may say to 3i and all the other companies, ``Hard luck-you will have to restructure your employment.'' I would understand that, but the Government's political objective of wooing such people will be turned on its head, so it is a foolish tactic. The problem could easily be dealt with under the motive test, or venture capital investment trusts could qualify only when they had a certain number of employees, although I do not know what it would be. If the Government are not willing to give an inch, we shall have to press the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I want to draw the Economic Secretary's attention to a further notice issued by the CBI. She prayed in aid its words of endorsement to the changes in the capital gains tax regime that underpin the provisions, as though to clothe everything with respectability. Such selective quoting is typical of the way in which the Government try to justify their position. Another press release from the CBI states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since the CBI's Reactions and Proposals to the Finance Bill were published last month, a further point has been brought to our attention in relation to employee shareholdings in listed companies. Listed companies frequently participate in joint ventures for trading purposes, but investment in a joint venture company is not regarded as a qualifying trading activity. This can unfairly prevent employees of the listed company benefiting from business asset taper relief on shareholdings in their employer company.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to encapsulate much of our debate, yet the Economic Secretary chooses to pray in aid a broad-brush endorsement. That shows no attention to basic detail.

<P>
I was grateful for the Economic Secretary's comments on the 3i letter. Will she be kind enough to put the Financial Secretary's reply into the public domain? We ought to know what the exchanges are and how Treasury Ministers have argued the point. I should also be interested to know whether the Economic Secretary has made any response to the CBI, or whether there has been another selective report of Government communication. The CBI will be interested to know what she has to say about the sage point in its press release.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Perhaps I could have a quick go at giving a speech that the Economic Secretary could have made. She could have said, ``We recognise that the measure is rough and ready and imperfect, but we want to make a start to encourage enterprise. CGT has been too high for too long on enterprise and we want to do something about it. We know that we cannot do everything in one go, but intend to reduce the incidence and rate of CGT to the minimum possible without prejudicing the income tax yield.''

<P>
The only reason for keeping CGT at the beginning is that people will switch and come into gains, and thereby avoid income tax. That is the argument that the Inland Revenue has put about for at least a quarter of a century. I am increasingly suspicious of it, but that is a much wider debate that I shall not tax your patience by going into, Mr. Cook.

<P>
Had the Government stated such a position, it would have been perfectly respectable and understandable. They would have given a clear sense of direction if they had said, ``Yes, we want to do more. We want to make further reductions, but that is as much as we can afford this year. We shall consider the matter again and return to it.'' However, the Government have tried to produce a self-contained case for the level and rate as though they had arrived at the perfect structure of CGT-of course, they have not. The CGT system is now highly complicated and unacceptable.

<P>
I regret to say that the changes that we are considering, which in the long run will almost certainly prove inadequate, are part of the third way sop to the enterprise culture. The Government think that they should make an enterprise-friendly gesture and use words that sound good in relation to entrepreneurs and venture capital. They have decided that that is the sort of language with which they would like to be associated. Labour has learned its lines, but it has not learned about the fundamental implications of such changes to the tax system.

<P>
I ask Ministers to consider the issues again, although I am sure that they will not be prepared to budge on the specific points that we have debated today. They should reconsider and think through from first principles the purpose of having a capital gains tax. If they begin to argue that productivity can be improved by reducing CGT, they should give a clear argument as to why a given level of CGT will lead to maximum productivity. We have not heard that argument. The maximum level of productivity would almost certainly be achieved at zero CGT. The Government's attempt to justify the rate and the taper is riddled with intellectual inconsistencies. I strongly advise the Government to get off that territory and to argue, plain and simple, that they want a bit of revenue but that they want to reduce CGT first.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am mindful of the Economic Secretary's efforts to persuade me not to be repetitive, but I am also mindful of the need to ensure that the Treasury's reconsideration of the issues is not plagued by a failure to recognise deficiencies of logic. The new argument made either intentionally or unwittingly by the Economic Secretary in her previous remarks comprehensively fails. She implied that business taper relief was needed to reward risk and that an individual who invests directly in his own business and hence owns a large part of it-as he needs to for his investment to qualify as a business asset-takes a greater risk than an investor who invests in a small part of a much larger enterprise, whose investment qualifies as a non-business asset. That argument, were it true, would be convincing and help to explain why the distinction between business assets and non-business assets has been introduced. However, the argument is untrue in a way that is compelling and, on reflection, the Economic Secretary will have to agree that that is the case.

<P>
I take the case of Mr. A who has a £10 million investment in an internet service provider with an enterprise value of £1,000 million-a highly-rated company with a high degree of risk. By definition, as an investment of £10 million out of £1,000 million, that is a non-business asset holding.

<P>
Mr. B is a £10 million holder in a lowly-rated, low-risk motorcycle courier company with an enterprise value of £20 million. That is a business asset, but where does the risk lie? It lies with Mr. A, although the business asset qualification lies with Mr. B. Therefore, the distinction between business asset and non-business asset is not the same as that between risk taking and non-risk taking or higher risk and lower risk. On the contrary, the reverse of that distinction is often the case. Therefore, the Economic Secretary cannot argue that the business asset test ought not to be met when it is not needed, that is not needed when there is no risk, and that there is no risk for an employee in the circumstances to which the amendment alludes.

<P>
I repeat the request for an explanation of why that distinction has been made; the reason is becoming less clear as the debate progresses.

<B>The Chairman:</B> The discussion on the previous amendments went far beyond the inclusion or definition of a venture capital investment trust. Everyone who wanted to participate in that debate had ample opportunity, but I must give fair warning that from now until the end of the grouping, I shall want comments to relate specifically to the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 279, in page 46, line 6, after ``(ii)'' insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at the time when the shares were acquired the individual was an officer or employee of the company, or of a company having a relevant connection with it, or

<P>
(iii)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendments Nos. 279, 280 and 281 cover broadly the same territory and are meant to help by removing some of the problems associated with shares qualifying for accelerated taper relief as business assets. Amendment No. 279 would overcome the flaw in employee qualification for business relief by taking qualification from the day of acquisition rather than the day of disposal. That would also reduce the anomaly in periods of qualifying and non-qualifying ownership, because the clock would start earlier. Amendments Nos. 280 and 281 essentially repeat amendment No. 279 in a different context.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) will go into a little more detail on amendment No. 151, but, in essence, the amendment is designed to clarify some greyness in the qualification by defining a time period. We shall be brief in speaking to these technical amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I support amendment No. 279. I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who cannot be here this morning as he has other parliamentary duties. He asked me to mention a letter from a constituent, Mr. Perry, which has a bearing on the matter under discussion. The amendment attempts to solve the problem of what happens when someone retires from a company and his position as a holder of business assets changes. Mr. Perry said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>While the inclusion of employees is to be welcomed, it seems that a retired employee ceases to qualify on the day that he or she retires, although that person has possibly devoted many years in contributing to the success of the company.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The proposal has an unintended side effect in that it gives perverse incentives to employees to disinvest their shareholding in order to benefit from the holding of a business asset and the exemption that goes with it, rather than take that asset with them into retirement. I am sure that the Financial Secretary does not intend what amounts to a punishment of someone who retires. I therefore hope that this harmless and anodyne amendment, which would produce substantial benefits for a small minority and maintain the incentive of their commitment to their company, will find favour with the Financial Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We know from a previous debate that the Economic Secretary believes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government's priority is to focus on support for business investment and employee share ownership-[Official Report, Standing Committee H, 8 June 2000; c. 593.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would ensure that the group of employees who qualify for the benefits of the scheme is drawn as fairly as possible, and that employees who deserve to be part of the system are not excluded.

<P>
Amendment No. 151 is designed to achieve clarification and proposes a remedy for the problem. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A company shall be taken to have been a qualifying company by reference to an individual at any time when-

<P>
(a) the company was a trading company  and-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
presumably, that is a condition that applies throughout the period of ownership of the shares-
{**VB4**}
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) one or more of the following conditions was met<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My first question to the Economic Secretary is: when was the condition met? Did it have to be met throughout the time that the shares were owned? Did it have to be met when the shares were acquired, or at some point during the period of ownership? If the answer is that it has to be met throughout the time that the shares were owned, the amendments are needed because that would be too onerous a condition.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) said, should someone who puts money into a scheme as an employee find that, before the full qualifying period of four years is up and he-or she-has the benefit of taper relief, he has retired, that individual is penalised by a system that was designed to encourage employee participation. That might mean that older employees in a business, who were close to retirement, would hesitate before taking advantage of the scheme, and their extra productivity-I use the Economic Secretary's vernacular-as a result of participating in the scheme would be lost.

<P>
Amendment No. 151 tackles the problems affecting a company that started as an unlisted company, but, in the course of its growth-we know how fast some companies develop-becomes listed. That is precisely the point at which an individual who has invested in the business may find that his voting rights fall below 5 per cent. If the 5 per cent. condition applies as a snapshot-perhaps at the start of the investment period-there is no problem; however, if it is applied in the way suggested by the clause's structure, so that the individual has to own 5 per cent. of the shares throughout the four years to qualify for the full relief, there will be a problem.

<P>
Let us suppose that investors invest in more than 5 per cent. of a company when it is unlisted. The company grows and the possibility arises of listing and of their interest being diluted to less than 5 per cent. At that point, individuals may say, ``Well, we know what it would be sensible for the company to do, but the effect on our shareholding and tax position is so adverse that what is better for the company will be much worse for us, as investors. We own the company and we must take account of the tax environment. Although listing would be the best course for the company to take, we are going to say no to that rational next step and to taking on outside investors.''

<P>
The amendment would make the scheme more flexible to ensure that, in four years, which is a long time in the development of some businesses, what makes the best economic sense and makes the most productive use of the company's assets, will continue

</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would ensure that the process is not abruptly called to a halt by the rules applying artificial constraints.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I support my hon. Friends the Members for Arundel and South Downs and for Guildford. The amendment proposes a simple, but important concept and corrects an anomaly whereby two employees or shareholders can be treated differently, even though they hold the same assets or shareholding. For example, someone buying a share up to 10 years ago, when the asset concerned was not a business asset, will have to wait until 2010 for the non-business part of the investment to obtain full taper relief, whereas someone could buy exactly the same asset or share on or after 6 April this year and obtain full taper relief after only four years. That cannot be right. It may be in the interests of the disadvantaged shareholder to sell and reacquire the asset this year in order to start the four-year taper relief. The Government may call that an exercise in tax avoidance that flows naturally from the way they have structured the relief, but I urge the Government to accept the amendments, because they would stop a manifest unfairness and the different treatment of similar people holding the same shares.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> First, I return to amendments Nos. 279 and 280, which would enable people to receive the business asset taper relief on shares in a company after they cease to be employees of the company. That would defeat the whole purpose of the change that we propose. The purpose of extending business asset taper relief to encompass all employee shareholdings in trading companies is to promote productivity by aligning the interests of employees with those of the trading company for which they work. As with the new all-employee share plan that we discussed earlier, the extension of business asset taper relief to employees of trading companies gives them the opportunity to build a community of interest between themselves and the company owners, to make the company successful and help it to grow. Those benefits cannot arise in the case of people who no longer work for the company. Leaving a company on retirement or for any other reason does not alter the fact that the assets were business assets for the time that the person was an employee. The business asset taper will be available for that period. If the company is unlisted, the shares will remain business assets in any event. That is right in those circumstances, because the investment is more risky.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
Allowing people to keep business asset treatment on employees' shares in listed companies for ever would be unfair to those who had never qualified for business asset taper relief on their shares. Why should a person who works for a company for three months receive generous business asset taper relief for holding shares for another four years, while the person who never worked for the company, but holds the shares for a much longer period, receives much less relief? The reward should relate only to the time that the individual actually works for the company. It would be wholly unfair for those who had assets that changed their status from business to non-business for other reasons to be allowed to retain the more generous relief.

<P>
I am not sure whether Opposition Members are aware that the amendment would deny business asset taper to those who acquired shares in listed companies before they became employees. That would not be right.

<P>
I see no case for amendment No. 281. It would allow business asset taper to be available to personal representatives on shares that have been uplifted in value on the ex-employee's death. In other words, the gains that accrued while the individual was an employee of the company are effectively exempted from CGT. What justification is there for allowing business asset taper relief on shares for gains accrued after the taxpayer's death? The amendments would undermine the purpose of the taper relief changes that we are making. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject them.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said that amendment No. 151 was designed to deal with the problem of dilutions, which might arise when a shareholder fails to take up full entitlement to a rights issue or other issue of shares and the overall percentage interest of the shareholder in the company is therefore reduced. The issue could also arise when a company is floated on the stock exchange and an interest of more than 5 per cent. is reduced below that level as a consequence of further shares being issued to shareholders.

<P>
I do not perceive dilutions as a problem that needs to be addressed. It is right in principle that the shareholding that falls below the requisite threshold should fall out of the business asset taper from the time that the threshold test is no longer satisfied. A shareholder who does not subscribe to second stage finance is no longer showing the same commitment to a company as a shareholder who does subscribe. We have removed most potential problems for unlisted shares in that respect as a by-product of the rule that a holding of any size now qualifies for business asset taper. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Guildford realised that. A change of status from unlisted to listed or from holding at least 5 per cent. of voting rights in a listed company to holding a smaller percentage does not mean that the shares lose all the benefits of having been business assets. An apportioned share of the gain would continue to qualify for business assets treatment.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Economic Secretary deal with the case in which a group of investors, who each put in slightly more than 5 per cent., controls the company? As a result of the limitation, when it makes sense for the company to be listed, those investors say that they do not want that to happen, because there would be adverse tax consequences for them. How can it be in a company's best interests that the people who control it deny its development, because the tax system would become punitive for them?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can return to that point in a moment. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the minimum holding period. The amendment would introduce a minimum holding period for listed shares to qualify as business assets, so it would worsen the position of some taxpayers whose shareholdings would have been treated as business assets under the existing rules, but would not be treated as such if the amendment were accepted. Under the taper system, there is no need for time-limited qualifications: the taper already encourages people to hold assets for longer periods.

<P>
In conclusion, the amendment contains some technical defects, so I urge the Committee to reject it. On the hon. Gentleman's specific point, companies will decide whether to list on many different grounds. The loss of the business asset taper for some shareholders is only one factor to be taken into account and is unlikely to affect the commercial decision whether to list. In any case, there is no argument for extending business asset taper to non-employee shareholdings in listed trading companies where there is no substantial-greater than 5 per cent.-stake. Retaining the taper for shareholdings when a trading company becomes listed would be unfair. I have already argued that amendment No. 151 has technical defects and would worsen the position of some taxpayers. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I should like to clarify the effect of amendment No. 151. For the first two years, some people who owned shares for a short period might find it more restrictive. However, someone has to have had a 5 per cent. stake in the company for two rather than four years in order to enjoy full relief. Under the amendment, it therefore becomes a less restrictive condition. After two years, a company might float on the stock market and people's interests might drop below 5 per cent.; if they maintained the investment and bore the risk throughout the four-year period, they would still benefit from the full taper.

<P>
Under the Government regime, however, investors would lose out and suddenly find themselves in a 10-year holding period before they received full taper relief, which seems unfair. It will encourage people to have either large stakes in these companies or no stakes at all. If an investor starts with a 10 per cent. investment and there is a possibility of the company's floating on the stock market with a dilution of more than two to one, the initially attractive incentive is no incentive at all. It will deter people from taking small stakes-perhaps of significantly more than 5 per cent.-because the threat of dilution in the future skews the economic return on the investment.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> My view is that it is wrong in principle for shares held for only two years to continue to qualify for business asset taper. The hon. Gentleman asked earlier about the basis on which apportionment is determined. The test of whether business assets were on-going day by day-though, obviously, not literally-was relevant. A business asset for three years and a non-business asset for two years will both retain the three years benefit on an apportionment basis. That is entirely fair and justifies our position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to further clarify amendment
No. 281, as the Minister may have misunderstood it. Trustees can claim the benefit in retrospect for an individual, but personal representatives cannot. We are not trying to allow the benefit to be claimed when someone is dead, but we are arguing that, if the benefit has not been claimed during a lifetime, personal representatives as well as trustees should be allowed to do so, after sorting out the period during which a business asset had been held.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not aware of the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am prepared to examine whether further consideration of it is required.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary referred to limiting the definition to term of acquisition, which could cause problems unless people who had acquired shares prior to their employment were taken into account. That is a valid point. The drafting of this part of clause 66 is unsatisfactory, and if changing the definition of ``acquisition'' poses additional problems, we shall withdraw the amendment. We may return to outstanding problems on Report.

<P>
I understand the Economic Secretary's point about retirement. The negative aspect of the rules is that when people retire, they will sell the shares in the companies for which they worked. Some injustices-or perceived injustices-may arise if the shares are sold a month or so too late, which could marginally change the tax position. Though I understand the logic, it would be more civilised to permit business assets to continue to qualify when people retire. The Government's definition of the territory is clear and the price paid will be that everyone will sell their business assets when they retire. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 46, line 30, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) For the purposes of this Act a holding company means a company whose business consists wholly or mainly of the holding of shares in one or more companies in which it has a shareholding of 40 per cent. or more.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is the amendment to which the Economic Secretary made prior reference. We are delighted to hear that the Government propose to address the underlying point. Although the meaning of the amendment is clear, we accept subsequent legal advice that it would have problematical knock-on effects elsewhere which would undermine our objectives. In simple language, we believe that staff working in large established groups that may be less than 51 per cent. owned, may shift between wholly owned and 40 per cent. owned companies, and that the current rules would be extremely unfair to them. Technical anomalies arise for employees of joint venture companies and their subsidiaries who will be disqualified if employed by a less than 51 per cent. owned subsidiary.

<P>
The easiest solution is the existing B27 concession, which, following the Reed case, arose in relation to the same problem in existing employee share scheme legislation-and is relevant to approved shares in schedule 9. It would be possible for the Government to craft an amendment to follow the approach of the B27 concession, which adopts the same 40 per cent. floor as in our amendment. Some have argued that 40 per cent. also poses a problem because of participations in large companies and subsidiaries of less than 40 per cent. However, once one goes below 40 per cent., individuals might qualify for more than one parent company. Industry generally agrees that 40 per cent. meets at least the greater part of problems that will arise.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I will speak in support of the general intention behind the amendment, without commenting on its structure. My right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) briefed me, because Westland Helicopters is based in his constituency. It is part of the GKN company, which has interests in many major defence activities. Westland Helicopters is in partnership with Agusta, and GKN has holdings in many defence-related companies here and overseas. That fulfils the Government's long-standing policy of encouraging consolidation of defence-related industries and contractors both nationally and internationally.

<P>
In most such cases, 50-50 partnerships are formed. The current legislation often disqualifies employees of companies in such partnerships. Of GKN's 57,000 employees, 20,000-possibly more-would be disqualified. The Economic Secretary provided a hint of light in the previous debate, and it would be helpful if she could reassure employees of GKN and other large companies in which the principle of partnership, co-operation and joint ventures is now well established that they will not be put at a disadvantage.

<P>
The overarching point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil put to me was that GKN had strictly met the Government's main policy objective. It would appear perverse to the company and its employees if following that policy by entering into joint ventures and partnerships and taking a leading role in consolidating put the employees at a disadvantage.

<P>
We support the amendment and the intention of change, and we hope that the Economic Secretary will respond appropriately.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Quite a few of my constituents work at Westland Helicopters, so they are interested in GKN. My dustbins at home are emptied by Cleanaway, of which GKN owns 50 per cent. It is in partnership with an Australian industrial company on that venture. That is another example of such partnerships from closer to home, but we shall not pursue the business of my dustbins.

<P>
I might have an interest to declare-at any rate, I wish that I had-although the amendments refer to it.

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> For clarity, is the right hon. Gentleman putting it on the record that he wishes that he had an interest to declare, or that he has an interest?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not think that I have an interest, although I wish that I did, so just in case I do or will, let me put the matter beyond doubt and declare an interest now. Rather than weary the Committee with these wretched interests, I hope that my declaration will serve for other amendments in the group.

<P>
Getting back to the issue of GKN, what really worries the employees is the fact that if a company conducts a significant number of its operations through subsidiaries that are joint ventures, those joint ventures are classified as investments, not trading activities. As GKN, in this case, conducts a significant and growing number of its industrial commercial activities through joint ventures, the entire GKN work force may, if they own shares, not qualify for the accelerated taper relief that applies to business assets. That would be ridiculous, because GKN is an extremely important industrial company with almost 60,000 employees. It is right to try to ensure that employee share ownership is suitably rewarded and recognised.

<P>
The point about Westland Helicopters is extremely urgent, because, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove mentioned, GKN is negotiating with Finmeccanica, an equivalent Italian concern that owns Agusta, with the object of placing Agusta into a 50-50 joint partnership with Westland Helicopters in Yeovil and its holdings elsewhere in the west country. The consequence of that may be a further twist in the direction of disqualifying GKN for trading company purposes. In addition, considering the matter from the other end, employees in such joint partnerships may themselves be disqualified from holding shares that qualify as business assets.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that GKN estimates that more than 20,000 employees participate in joint ventures and would, ostensibly, be disqualified? That point is additional to the one that he made about holding companies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes. My figures show that about 16,700 employees are currently involved in joint ventures, but that number is likely to grow if Westland Helicopters participates in the joint venture that I described. Two problems are involved-the status of GKN and that of employees of GKN's joint ventures, whether actual or projected. I should have thought that the Government would be looking for ways to give such employees the ownership status that would accord them accelerated taper relief.

<P>
I hope that we are all pushing in the same direction. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs pointed out a familiar problem. Will employees of a joint venture in which, for example, three companies participate be eligible for shares in all the parent companies? That would be a privilege too far. He referred to an extra statutory concession known as B27, which permits joint venture employees in such circumstances to participate in employee share schemes, especially those of a 50-50 nature, such as that involving Westland Helicopters. The essence of the concession, as I understand it, is that employees must choose in which parent company to participate so that they do not receive double or triple relief. That is a sensible way forward. We specified 40 per cent. in the amendment because elsewhere in the tax code-in the anti-avoidance provisions on matters such as transfer pricing and control of foreign companies-the Government deem that 40 per cent. constitutes control. It would have been a neat bit of symmetry to use the Government's own definition. As they use it when it suits them, perhaps in granting relief they could recognise that same figure of 40 per cent.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said earlier, we are not going to die in that particular ditch. It is open to the Government to tell us a little more about how they intend to avoid the problem, perhaps by using a concession analogous to the existing one for employee share schemes.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The point being made in the amendment is that the joint venture company is likely to be a trading concern, and a substantial shareholding in that concern should be treated as though it were a trading asset for the purposes of deciding whether the investing company is a holding company of a trading group. Amendment No. 297 would broaden the definition of a holding company so that shareholdings of 40 per cent. or less would not, as the right hon. Gentleman said, prevent a holding company from being a holding company of a trading group.

<P>
The amendment is not acceptable, as it has a substantial number of technical deficiencies. I could list them, but I shall not take the Committee's time. None the less, we are not without sympathy with the point being made. The issue has surfaced recently, and has been raised with me by my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale), who has also had contact with GKN. We are considering what we could do. It is not an easy point, and I am not prepared to return, as the right hon. Member for Wells would like, with specific proposals at this stage. The issue is not only the level at which the shareholding should be set. The amendment suggests 40 per cent., but others, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, favour a lower figure. The question also arises of how an amendment could be successfully drafted to fit the structure of existing legislation and achieve the Government's overall policy objectives.

<P>
We shall need to discuss possible solutions with those who are arguing for change. That seems the most sensible way forward. We shall consider the point of principle, and if we are satisfied that it should be met, we shall propose a change in due course.

<P>
I cannot say at this stage exactly what the outcome will be, but we are considering the issue as a matter of urgency. I give the Committee that assurance, and I hope that on that basis the amendment will be withdrawn. We shall consider the matter further.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are glad to hear what the Economic Secretary said. Although GKN is the company that aired the point and that will particularly suffer if the clause is not amended, many other old-economy companies have similar structures. Given the Government's promise to tackle the issue, we shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. I pass across to the Economic Secretary an amendment that I could not table, which would follow the B27 precedent and, we believe, tackle the problem. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his contributions.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendments Nos. 298, 285 and 286 relate to the fact that it is wrong to put companies that have stray preference shares that are listed into the general definition category of quoted companies when the precedent is not to do so. Amendments Nos. 282 and 283 relate to trading companies.

<P>
Amendment No. 285 is an earlier version of amendment No. 298. We would like amendment
No. 298 to supersede amendment No. 285, although the impact of the two would be the same. The issue was brought to the attention of the Paymaster General in correspondence from certain lawyers in May, and it was also raised in a meeting with the Treasury by various accountants, especially Ernst & Young. The Treasury's reaction was that it understood the point, which it regarded as fair, but questioned whether a sufficient number of companies fell into the category to make such an amendment worth while in terms of creating fairness. It took me only two or three days to discover seven such companies-Jenners of Edinburgh, McMullen of Hertfordshire, Robinsons of West Bromwich, Charnos of Derbyshire, Turbo Genset, Sunblush and CGX Energy. For all I know, a larger number of companies may be relevant to the definition, especially if they have preference shares listed on a stock exchange other than that of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We cannot see how including companies that have only small amounts of preference shares quoted would open the door to any form of abuse, or to an extension of the relief beyond what the Government's philosophy is intended to achieve. Indeed, it would be monstrously unjust to exclude those companies by virtue of tightening the definition of listed companies, and including preference shares that have a non-equity, non-economic interest in the company.

<P>
Once it has done its homework, I hope that the Treasury will agree to address the issue. Although the territory concerned may not be as big as that of the GKN issue, I am sure that the Government would want to achieve fairness, and would therefore not ignore the point.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall deal first with amendment No. 298, then amendments Nos. 285 and 286. The effect of the amendments would be to differentiate between various types of listed company. Those that had ordinary shares listed on a recognised stock exchange would be treated as listed, while those that had other categories of shares listed on the exchange, but not ordinary shares, would not.

<P>
Amendment No. 298 contains a definition of ordinary shares for those purposes. The intention is that the ordinary shares should be defined by exclusion. Shares that carry a right to a fixed dividend and no other right to share in the profits would not be part of the ordinary share capital, but all other shares would. A company that had such fixed dividend shares listed, but no other shares, would be treated as unlisted if the amendment were accepted.

<P>
The amendments seem wrong in principle. I cannot see how singling out one category of shares and ignoring the fact that they are listed on the stock exchange is right. Excluding fixed dividend shares would be likely to lead to calls for other categories of shares to be ignored when deciding whether a company is listed or unlisted. Although the division between ordinary share capital and other share capital appears elsewhere in tax legislation, it does not seem relevant here. If a company's unlisted shares were convertible into fixed dividend shares, anyone investing in the unlisted stock would have a guaranteed exit route to securities traded on the main stock exchange. Given such an exit, there is no need for a business assets taper.

<P>
In one case of which we are aware-clearly, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs may have identified further cases-fixed dividend shares were issued to provide capital for a specific purpose. That underlines the point that sources of finance are available to a listed company that were not available to unlisted companies. On the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs in relation to whether it might be unfair to treat a small company as listed if just a small part of its stock is listed, the company has access to stockmarket finance and therefore does not need the benefit of the business assets taper. It is also a question of having a simple rule-it is hard to exercise a rule that is based on the proportion of share capital that is listed and unlisted.

<P>
The main effect of amendments Nos. 282 and 283 would be to widen the definition of a trading company and a trading group and thus widen the range of assets that would qualify for the more generous business assets taper. The Government also seek to widen the coverage of business assets but are going about that very differently. The changes that I set out all seek to improve productivity by encouraging finance to go to a wider range of trading companies, but the Government wish to promote investment in companies and groups that are essentially carrying on a trade. That is where the big entrepreneurial and productivity gains are to be had-although we recognise that there must be some leeway to allow a company an insubstantial amount of non-trading activity, since few companies fall into the absolutely tidy category of being purely trading companies.

<P>
At present, a company must not engage in ``substantial'' non-trading activities if it is to be treated as trading. The meaning of ``substantial'' has to be interpreted on the facts of each case because each one is different, but as a rule of thumb the Inland Revenue takes ``substantial'' to mean 20 per cent. of activity under a reasonable measure. There is nothing magical about the figure of 20 per cent., but we are trying to ensure that target companies are not excluded because of a relatively small amount of non-trading activity.

<P>
The amendments would allow business assets treatment to companies carrying out much larger investment activity. An investment company is defined as one that is wholly or mainly in the business of making investments. ``Wholly'' or ``mainly'' is usually interpreted as more than 50 per cent. So the proposal is that a company that has substantial investment activity could still be treated as a trading company for the purposes of taper relief. That is much too generous and would lead to companies being used to shelter many gains in passive investments. That would be a particular problem with close companies. The costs would be significant and there would not be the same boost to productivity as from direct support to trading companies.

<P>
Interestingly, and conversely, the amendments would impose a significant change on the treatment of trading groups by restricting the circumstances under which shares in the holding company could be treated as business assets. At present, the activities of a group are looked at as one and if the non-trading activities are not substantial in relation to the whole, that group can be treated as a trading group. If the amendment were accepted, the existence in the group of any single investment company, however small it is in relation to the whole group, would disbar it from being a trading group. I am sure that that is not what those who tabled the amendment intended.

<P>
Overall, I believe that the amendments would approach the definition of a trading company or group from too generous a perspective and would allow the trading companies to shelter a considerable amount of investment activity on which business asset taper relief would be available. Accordingly, they would cost money without bringing the return in higher productivity that we seek. I urge the Committee to oppose the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> First, I apologise for forgetting to address amendments Nos. 282 and 283; I shall remedy that in a moment, after I have returned to amendment No. 298.

<P>
The Economic Secretary has misunderstood the nature of listing and preference shares. A company is not listed; its stock is. Preference shares have similar characteristics to debt and it is not uncommon for a smallish company, which may not qualify for a stock exchange listing in respect of its ordinary shares, to have had a tranche of preference shares issued. The companies to which the amendment refers are unlisted. They are small, private companies that are not engaged in any clever cuts activity merely because they have a tranche of preference shares listed.

<P>
As the Economic Secretary will know, a correct definition of unquoted shares is given in the 1984 and 1986 Finance Acts, which makes clear that ordinary shares, not preference shares, are involved. In terms of the Government's objectives and the points that the Minister made this morning-whether we agree with them or not-that is grossly unfair. The Treasury simply did not want to bother with an awkward little problem that the Government thought involved only one or two companies and has excluded companies that have listed only a modest amount of preference shares. We will want to raise that matter further.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. His argument is substantially reinforced by the fact that, elsewhere in the tax code, the category of unquoted companies includes a range of companies that have ordinary shares that are quoted on the alternative investment market. Companies of the type to which my hon. Friend refers, where ordinary shares are unquoted, but whose preference shares are quoted on the stock exchange, have significantly less access to capital markets for raising new capital than companies that elsewhere in the tax code are specifically included in the unquoted category.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for extending my argument. It would now not be possible to go to the market for a 500,000 tranche of preference shares and get them listed. Such situations have arisen mainly for specific reasons. The Economic Secretary referred to having access to capital, but it is highly unlikely that a small company could raise money in such a way in today's market. Times have changed. The Minister's thinking and that of the Treasury is wrong. The clause gives rise to a potential injustice. Given that only a dozen or so companies may be affected, it would be wholly wrong to take a ``can't be bothered'' approach.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 282 and 283 bring me back to the old definition of trading company and trading group. The problem that we are highlighting-on which the Economic Secretary did not comment-is that of assets. A company could have assets that have become significant in value with the passing of time or change of usage. In the context of the company's overall affairs, it could be refused treatment as a trading company when that arose.

<P>
The Revenue's guideline notes were designed to give a definition of substantial, but the Government will be aware that there is some dispute about them. The old definition of ``wholly or mainly'' worked extremely well and was not a cause of the abuse to which the Minister referred. One can live with matters as they stand, but the Government must be aware that they are not satisfactory. If we are not to return to the old definition of ``wholly or mainly'', which most lawyers consider more satisfactory legally, the definition of ``substantial'' must be dealt with.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> On the last point, the generous end up with an over-generous result. We debated other definitions in our earlier sittings, but I shall not test your patience, Mr. Cook, by repeating what was said then. As for preference shares, companies are listed if any shares or securities are listed and, because they are listed, they have access to capital via the stock market.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister is mistaken. The fact that the companies may have an old tranche of preference shares outstanding does not mean that they could go to the stock market in today's world and raise a new tranche of such preference shares. The existence of such companies is an historic accident and it is a mistake to say that the fact that they have preference shares outstanding means that they already have access to stock market financing. They have not.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Preference shares are basically similar to debt. How old is old and where are the boundaries to be drawn? The hon. Gentleman argued for clarity earlier, but he would add a great deal of unclarity to the outcomes for people working within the definitions and to the issues that confront us.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I think that I have made the points clear. We had expected the Government to take a reasonable stance. There is considerable ill feeling towards the proposals from most of the lawyers and accountants to whom I have spoken. If the Government are not willing to offer anything, we will press the amendment and raise the matter on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 284, in page 46, line 40, after ``asset'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where it was acquired on or after 6 April 1998 and disposed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We perceive an anomaly in the new rules for assets acquired between 6 April 1998 and 6 April 2000. It concerns the period of ownership and whether the assets qualify. We propose a solution in the amendment, which would backdate the qualification rules to the introduction of taper relief and ring-fence the new rules to disposals, as envisaged in the Bill, in the current and following tax years. In a sense, the amendment would correct the Chancellor's error of not introducing the rules in the first place from April 1998, which has given a head start of up to two years to business asset holders under the new rules.

<P>
As the Economic Secretary will be aware, clause 65 already dates the holding period from 6 April 1998, so it seemed a sensible tidying-up to have the qualification rules running from the same date.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The purpose of the amendment appears to be to backdate the new definition of a business asset so that the period between 6 April 1998 and 5 April 2000 is counted as a period of business use. However, in trying to achieve that, it appears to prevent shares acquired before 6 April 1998 from being treated as business assets under the new rules. That may be a surprise to the hon. Gentleman-he is nodding and smiling. Whatever the intention behind the amendment, we do not want it in the Bill. It would create no increase in productivity and be of no benefit to the economy; it is illogical and expensive.

<P>
The clause will encourage entrepreneurial investment and employee share ownership and provide the right conditions to boost productive business activity. The amendment would not achieve that because it provides no encouragement for the future, but rewards past activity alone. It is illogical because it suggests that it is unfair to apportion gains between that part of the investment that is attributable to a time when the conditions for the business asset treatment are satisfied and that part that is not. It is perfectly fair and reasonable that an asset that has not been a business asset throughout the relevant period of ownership should be treated less generously than one that has. That is the point of the more generous business asset taper relief.

<P>
To compare the case of a person who acquired an asset when it was not a business asset but that was later converted to one with that of a person who has held the asset throughout as a business asset is to compare apples and pears. Apportionment is right in principle because it treats both parties alike by enabling them both to receive business asset taper for the period in which they hold the shares as a qualifying business asset. Therefore, I do not agree that the clause is in any way unfair. It is fair to give business asset taper relief to those who qualify for such a relief for the time that they so qualify and not for the times that they do not. There is a real benefit to all those who continue to hold business assets.

<P>
This back-dating amendment would be expensive, unless it was really intended to prevent all shares acquired before 6 April 1998 from being treated as business assets under the new rules. It would cost more than £300 million in the next three years. That sort of cost is unjustified for an amendment that is wrong in principle and of no benefit to the economy. It would direct money away from the new enterprise economy, rather than providing further incentives for growth. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We asked for a clarification of this matter because there is a lack of clarity in the Bill. We understand the argument for starting the business relief special treatment from Budget day, and I will not return to previous discussions on that matter. However, clause 65(3) states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For subsections (8) and (9) substitute-

<P>
``(8) The qualifying holding period of an asset for the purposes of this section is-

<P>
(a) in the case of a business asset, the period after 5th April 1998.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The meaning of that may be clear, but it appears to suggest that business asset relief starts at that date. That was the issue to which I was drawing attention through my amendment. If the Government are unwilling to accept a back-dating that we can understand, they should make the starting date clear. I am sure that they will want to do that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The clause changes the term scientific research allowances to research and development and introduces a new definition. We have a simple, straightforward question for the Economic Secretary. Why the change?
 
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The new statutory definition is in two parts. First, it incorporates into statute the definition used for accounting purposes. Secondly, it allows it to be modified or added to in Treasury regulations, which give force to the guidelines published by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The amendment would remove the regulation-making power, leaving the accounting definition as the sole definition for accounting purposes. It is necessary to provide a new definition to make the proposal work, but it is also important that it will not be grey and fuzzy around the edges.

<P>
We are therefore introducing the ability for the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to consult on the detail of the core definition, so that it can be made in such a way as to reflect changes that may occur, but leaves it completely clear at any one time what that definition needs to be. There is a danger that the proposal would not have sufficient precision for tax purposes and would leave the boundary of research and development fuzzy and unclear. I am referring to the next amendment that the hon. Gentleman has tabled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has admitted that she is mentioning the next amendment. She said that the central point of the clause is to give certainty, but then went on to say that there will be consultation and that it contains a power for the Treasury to change the rules. That does not sound like certainty to me. The hon. Lady knows that the existing definition is contained in the Revenue's capital allowances manual and she has just said that the manual can easily be altered to include the new guidelines. Alternatively, the Revenue could issue a statement of practice. That is exactly what is happening in regard to the tonnage tax and, in the circumstances, I am wondering why we need to go through the paraphernalia of a change of definition.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In January 1999, the Inland Revenue published a technical note on the new definition of research and development. It contained draft legislation for a detailed definition of R and D that was suitable for introduction through primary legislation. Respondents to that consultation were generally critical of the approach because of the degree of subjectivity inherent in the definition. That is why we have moved in such a direction.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 67 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``research and development''</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 398, line 14, leave out from ``development'' to end of line 32 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`has the meaning given in paragraph 21 of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 13'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment may bring us closer to the answer to the question that I mentioned briefly under the clause stand part debate. It would insert the current accounting definition of research and development known as accounting practice 13. Paragraph 1(2) of schedule 19 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Research and development'' means activities that fall to be treated as research and development,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which hardly advances us very far. It goes on to state that the Treasury may make regulations and that reference will be made to the guidelines when they have been published. The guidelines that have been published to which the Economic Secretary referred go into great detail and refer to pure research, applied research and development.

<P>
Development is closely defined. It means ``scientific or technical'' knowledge. Paragraph 13 of the guidelines states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Experimental development falls within R and D, but commercial development, including pre-production development and product development is outside.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therein lies the rub of the particular definition. The grand title ``research and development'' gives the impression that the Inland Revenue and the Treasury have been engaged in a bit of spin. It implies that development will be allowable, when it will not be allowed at all. We have the façade that funding relief will be given for research, but not for development, despite the fancy title.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I have explained some of the background to our thinking on the matter, which is to achieve a core definition that will provide a degree of certainty-
