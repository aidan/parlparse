making a point about occasions when the date of an election should be

helpful and supportive to the electorate. That would be the main
reason.</div>

The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>proposal in the new clause is to align the election dates. European
Parliament elections always take place over a four-day period, from the
Thursday to the Sunday, and they have to take place in June. The
specific dates are set by the unanimous decision of member states in
the European Council, so obviously the British Government would play a
role in deciding on the date. Alignment of the dates is
important.</div>

two key points. The date will be set by agreement of the House of

intended to help the electorate as a whole. Nobody would ever do this
lightly. It is an important step. The new clause gives the option to
the House to vote, if required, on the alignment of election
dates.</div>

Woolas:
						</b> New clause 20 and Government amendment No. 245
relate to the desirable objective of bringing local authority services
and health services closer together. It is proposed to establish a
joint needs assessment to ensure that social care services and health
services jointly engage in the assessment of local health needs. The
argument behind the proposal is that we must do that without imposing
extra or excessive bureaucracy in the
system.</div>
					<a name="07030883000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The types of
needs assessment that already take place in some areas consider medium
and long-term health needs. One area may have a particular difficulty
with heart disease, lung disease or some such, and other areas may have
different needs. The new clause allows for local discretion, but, in so
far as it is not devolutionary, it compels health authorities and local
authorities to do the needs assessment together. It will strengthen
earlier clauses on local area agreements by requiring the responsible
local authority and the primary care trust, being the two lead bodies,
to produce such a needs assessment.</div>
					<a name="07030883000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put it on the record, a
&#147;need&#148; means a significant overlap in the impact or
potential impact of the exercise of functions of the primary care trust
and the responsible local authority. Such an area might include social
care provision for older people, which will be substantially affected
by the delivery of both preventive and acute health care primarily by
PCTs.</div>

							<a name="07030883000395"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. We are
talking about the assessment of needs. It is a future assessment, and
in that sense, it is not directly about the delivery of services. We
are trying to address the fact that in some parts of the country, the
PCT undertakes a needs assessment as part of its duties while a local
authority addresses its social care priorities. The new clause is about
joining up, simplifying, getting rid of bureaucracy and all the things
behind the thrust of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07030883000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members might recall
mention during debate in Committee of there being too many targets. It
is quite possible to have one target for a local authority and another,
sometimes contradictory, target for health care. The deputy group
leader of the Local Government Association&#146;s Conservative group,
Councillor Milton from Westminster, often cites the case of Kent, which
discovered apparently contradictory targets on teenage pregnancy for
the local authority and PCT. That is not desirable. Members know of
examples in their constituencies; indeed, we get applause during
after-dinner speeches for pointing out contradictions in the
bureaucracy. The new clause will address that problem. The hon. Member
for Lichfield has a fair point, but the measure deals with needs
assessment.</div>
					<a name="07030883000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned districts. I believe that he represents an area
covered by a district, one that we have heard about during this
debate&#151;Lichfield. We should not forget south-east Staffordshire
and Staffordshire as well. The new clause will address that issue by
requiring that in two-tier local authority areas, the county council
must consult its district councils on the joint needs
assessment.</div>
					<a name="07030883000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Supporting statutory guidance
on the clauses and part 5 of the Bill will make it clear that the local
authority should take into account the joint strategic needs
assessment&#146;s findings in setting targets in the local area
agreement and in preparing the sustainable communities strategy, a
point that I also direct to members of the Committee considering the
Sustainable Communities Bill. I put it on the record because it will be
useful to me in that Committee on Wednesday. The new clause should be
seen as part of the broader provisions in part 5 to strengthen
partnership. That in turn, we hope and intend, will help to deliver
more responsive
care.</div>
					<a name="07030883000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 245 will amend the Bill to ensure that new clause 20
comes into force by means of a commencement order rather than
automatically two months after Royal Assent. That is a practical step
to ensure that PCTs and local authorities have been provided with the
necessary guidance to assist them in meeting the
duty.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07030883000396"></a>
							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): Given that the new
clause refers to the responsible local authority, might there be
circumstances in which a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>number of local authorities need to get together to do a health and
social care assessment? Will the new clause provide for
that?</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000397"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. It
will. It puts the responsibility on the responsible local authority,
which means the local authority responsible for social services. In
that case, the local authority with more than one PCT would be covered.
The responsibility is on the local authority as well as the
PCT.</div>
					<a name="07030883000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not so
much banging heads together as saying, &#147;Make arrangements so
that the needs assessment for your area is covered.&#148; The needs
assessment itself would be for the local authority area and not
necessarily the PCT area, which may be different in those instances
where there is no coterminosity, which as the hon. Gentleman knows, are
fewer now than they used to be due to the joined-up nature of this
Government. I hope that, rather like the provision on joint waste
authorities, that is seen as sensible.</div>
					<a name="07030883000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We backed away&#151;just to
share this information with the Committee&#151;from the requirement
to put this assessment in the community strategy. That would be
unpicking strategies that had already been decided. I expect that they
will be part of that joint strategy. However, we do not want to make it
a tick-box exercise, to use the management jargon; we want to make it
real. On that basis, I commend the new clause to the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07030883000398"></a>
							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I have one brief
point to make. I very much welcome the thrust of this new clause
together with the other parts that strengthen consultation. I hope that
this will enable us&#151;I am sure that the Minister will be able to
confirm it&#151;to look not only at needs of the type that he
referred to in his own comments but, for example, at the increasing
need for capacity in GP surgeries and to make sure that there is clear
involvement of the local authority.</div>
					<a name="07030883000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that happens, I hope that we
can avoid the thoroughly unsatisfactory situation which arose, only
this week, in my constituency. Due to a lack of capacity, a GP surgery
suddenly got the PCT to issue a direction to change its catchment area.
About 1,200 people, some of whom are quite elderly and have been with
that surgery for 50 years, are arbitrarily told that they have to find
another doctor. This is the excellent Bromley Common practice. The PCT
arbitrarily took that decision because of a capacity issue. Neither the
local council nor the local Members of Parliament knew anything about
it until constituents and the local newspapers got on to them. This
measure is welcome if, together with the other provisions that we have
already discussed, it goes some way to preventing that thoroughly
unsatisfactory situation.</div>
					<a name="07030883000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that the ethos
of early consultation and involvement of elected representatives and
patients is built into the system right the way through. I expressed
concerns about the abolition of the patients forums and how effective
LINKs would be in this regard. This is a classic example. This
surgery&#146;s problem arose due to the Mayor of London, about two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>years ago, directing refusal of an application to build a surgery
because the land was green belt. There has been a crying need for an
alternative proposal for that practice, but there has not been a
mechanism to pull everything together. In the end, we get this
arbitrary decision without any form of consultation, which has caused
great distress to a lot of my constituents. I hope that this provision
will provide some means of dealing with such issues and would like
reassurance on that point.</div>
					<a name="07030883000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I tell the Minister while
he is thinking about it&#151;to give him a little more
time&#151;that the Minister for London very much appreciated his Alan
Curbishley
joke?</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000399"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I think that my Parliamentary Private Secretary
appreciated it even less. That is probably why she is not
here.</div>
					<a name="07030883000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for
my puzzlement is that I do not honestly think that this clause
addresses the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I think that the rest of
the Bill makes the situation that he describes less likely. This
provision is not about the delivery of services. It is about the
initial planning phase of a joint assessment of the health needs of the
area. The GP capacity is directly and primarily a matter for the PCT.
The hon. Gentleman will know that GPs stand in an unusual relationship
with PCTs. The joint needs assessment could examine GP capacity as a
need of course, but the PCT must take action to increase or decrease
that capacity. That relates to our debate about the planning of
services and the consultation on that issue. I hesitate to give the
hon. Gentleman a guarantee, because the real world will get in the way
of any such Government guarantee, particularly if a GP retires or other
policies
intervene.</div>

on the spot, but this has been a timely opportunity to put that
particular concern of my constituents on the record. Will he take that
concern&#151;particularly the points about consultation and
planning&#151;back to his colleagues in the Department of

						</b> I am more than happy to endorse the press release
to the local paper in south-east London. The serious point is that the
value of scrutiny has been demonstrated, and whatever policies one puts
in place, they will never be perfect. That raises the paradox of
devolution and equity. We have devolved power to a London level, but if
London disagrees with the decision of a different level, one has
problems. However, returning to the narrow confines of the Government
new clause, in deference to my boss, the Whip, I shall sit

							<a name="07030883000404"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I had wondered whether this sleep-inducing process
of saying &#147;aye&#148; and &#147;no&#148; was going to
continue, thereby allowing new clause 1 to slip in.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>
					<a name="07030883000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is about the
single transferable vote. Clearly, some of my colleagues are dedicated
followers of STV. In fact, some hon. Members in other parties may feel
that my colleagues are obsessed by STV. I hasten to add that I do not
put myself in that category. Yesterday we had an historic vote on the
House of Lords. Today, there is an opportunity for another historic
vote to reform our own voting systems and go for the single
transferable vote for local council elections. Clearly, that particular
solution is the Rolls-Royce of electoral systems to replace the Austin
Allegro that we are currently attempting to drive. The Government might
not want to go for the Rolls-Royce solution, but we have new clause 8
in front of us that would provide them with something in
between&#151;perhaps the Mondeo of electoral
systems.</div>
					<a name="07030883000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us focus
on new clause 1 and the single transferable vote. It is important
because proportionality ensures that each vote has the same worth. Hon.
Members will know, depending on which part of the country they
represent, how the present electoral parliamentary system helps them.
Proportionality in south-west London, an area that I represent, is not
effective, or at least people&#146;s votes are not reflected
effectively in the political representation of Members of Parliament in
that area. Fortunately in south-west London, the Liberal Democrats
benefit from the lack of proportionality in relation to the Westminster
system. The same applies at a local level as well.</div>
					<a name="07030883000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome the fact that
Scotland is pioneering the use of STV for its local elections. In local
elections from 2000 to the last election, voter turnout varied between
29.6 per cent. and a maximum of 40 per cent. Clearly, the turnout was
very low. That is because in many parts of the country how people vote
makes very little difference in terms of who is elected to represent
them on their local council. Hence the need for the single transferable
vote, which, we believe would improve voter turnout. Furthermore, it
would make councils more representative of the communities that they
seek to reflect and their elected representatives would be more
representative of the communities that elect
them.</div>
					<a name="07030883000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view,
more women would get elected under a single transferable vote system
for local elections; currently, only 29 per cent. of local councillors
are women. More members of the black and ethnic minority community
would be elected as well; only 2 per cent. of local councillors are
from that community.
</div>
					<a name="07030883000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am realistic,
however. I recognise that, although the Labour party in Scotland has
conceded that STV is the way forward for local elections, there is no
evidence so far that the Government in Westminster will endorse the
system. If the Minister is not willing to support new clause 1, he has
new clause 8 as an alternative. It is based on the Parliamentary and
Local Elections (Choice of Electoral Systems) Bill introduced by the
hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) and is about
offering options to local councils. Why is that a way forward? We need
a mixture of systems, and that principle has been accepted in London,
where the electoral system chosen is different from any other in the
country. Indeed, a beneficiary of that system is sitting in the
Committee with us.</div>

						</b> It is rare at this stage of a Committee&#146;s
proceedings to have so much excitement. I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington for raising the issue. I hate to
disappoint him yet again&#151;he looks so tragic when I
do.</div>
					<a name="07030883000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every voting
system has its advantages and disadvantages, and hon. Members will have
judged which they believe is best in the interests of democracy. I was
somewhat surprised that the new clause was proposed, however, because
after looking through my papers over the weekend, I came to the House
on Monday only to read <i class="I">The Guardian</i> headline that said,
&#147;Campbell sets Brown tests for Lib-Lab coalition deal&#148;. I
shall not go too far down this path, Mr. Benton, but given
the question before us I think I might be given some licence. For many
Liberal Democrat leaders the big issue&#151;the
deal-breaker&#151;has been PR. Yet in an official
briefing&#151;&#151;although it was later
retracted&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030883000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;journalists were told
proportional representation was &#145;not a deal breaker or a deal
maker&#146;&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07030883000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">although
the Liberal Democrat party previously insisted on it. There clearly has
been some change in policy, which is why I was so pleased to see that
old habits die hard.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I have always been known as a very generous
person and I do not want to intrude on private grief. I think you would
instruct us to stick more closely to the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07030883000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are arguments for and
against the introduction of a PR voting system and it has to be
recognised that we have new PR systems for the devolved
Administrations. The hon. Gentleman is tempting me because of that to
welcome his new clause. Many of us are aware of the benefits of a
first-past-the-post system, such as the direct relationship between the
elected and the elector in a specific geographic area. That is
something that many of us in this House greatly appreciate and
value.</div>

							<a name="07030883000424"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I have barely got into my stride. I will give
way when I have talked about the merits of first past the post. It is
that system that is used to elect councillors and local authorities in
England and Wales. Members of the GLA are elected using the additional
member system. I think that it does help members to represent the
interests of their area when there is that clear relationship between
the elected and the elector and when&#151;this is very
important&#151;the citizen who elects people knows who they are
electing and knows who is representing them. I acknowledge the virtues
of some other voting systems but that is a significant advantage of the
current
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000425"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I understand what the Under-Secretary says in
relation to the link between a constituency or a ward and the
representative, but does she not agree 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>with me that at a ward level, particularly if a ward is represented by
three councillors under an STV system, it is still perfectly possible
to achieve a link between a recognisable small area and representatives
elected under STV?</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000426"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> Lots of things are possible in life but I still
do not think the STV system or the systems described by the hon.
Gentleman give that same accountability, which is also
important.</div>
					<a name="07030883000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, the Government recognise that first past the post is not the
right system in every circumstance. We have a number of different
systems. Mayors in local authorities are elected by the supplementary
vote system. The Scottish Parliament has another system. The Welsh
Assembly and Greater London assembly use the additional member system.
The European Parliament uses the list system. In each of those cases
there was a good reason why those systems were adopted&#151;including
the fact that it was in the Government&#146;s general election
manifesto that those systems would be introduced. There was no such
promise in our last election manifesto.</div>
					<a name="07030883000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think there are any
grounds for changing the system for local government elections. That
system wherein the elector goes into the polling booth and puts a cross
by the name of their preferred candidate, and the candidate who gets
the most votes wins, is very straightforward. The hon. Gentleman
concentrates on the type of voting system, but a clear theme throughout
our deliberations has been the need for strong leadership and strong
governance. In democracy, it is not only the type of voting system that
is important; the quality of leadership is also a test when we make
that assessment.</div>
					<a name="07030883000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman spoke about not wanting to cause too much confusion, but
I found that strange when I re-read the new clause, given that if it
were accepted councils could resolve to change their electoral system
to one of the five types outlined in the new clause. We could end up
with each district council a county area choosing a different electoral
system with which to elect its members. That would be extraordinarily
confusing for the electorate. I do not think you would get clear and
accountable representation in those
circumstances.</div>

he is proposing the new clause and other hon. Members are opposing
it.</div>

consultation on electoral reform in local government, the Local
Government Association concluded that elections for the Scottish

					<a name="07030883000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an ongoing review of the experiences of new voting systems used in
the devolved Administrations. The Government feel that it would be
inappropriate to try to pre-empt the findings of the review by
encouraging the introduction of yet more electoral systems. In view of
the those arguments, I hope that the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington is convinced that the proposed new clauses would not provide
the best way forward and that he will withdraw
them.</div>

interested to hear the Under-Secretary deploy the fact that there might
be an increase of authorities with no overall control as an argument

might command a greater degree of interest, if not support, from the
Government than the previous group of new clauses. New clause 33 and

Democrats on such matters, that he was inclined to pursue the issue. In
fact, he invited us to table written questions to enable him to come
back with further detail on the matter. I assure the Minister that
questions were tabled today. We have not given him much time, but they
were tabled electronically so they will be in the system and he will be
able to see them in a few days, and I am sure that he can respond to
them in writing. The purpose of the written questions was to find out
what discussions have taken place between the Government and local
government&#151;either individual local authorities or local
government representative organisations&#151;on the European charter
of local self-government and the timetable for any future ratification
of the charter.</div>

perhaps unlike those in the previous group, is positive. It would
ensure that something the Government recognise as important is embedded
in domestic legislation so that local government will have the
safeguards that all members of the Committee want it to have to ensure
that it can carry on its business in the way that we feel is
appropriate and very much in the spirit of the Bill. With that, I
conclude my remarks and hope to receive a more positive response from
the Minister on new clause 33 and new schedule 1 than I did on the new
clause relating to
STV.</div>

							<a name="07030883000437"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has tabled the
questions electronically, a modernisation introduced when I was serving
under my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain),
when he was Leader of the
House.</div>
					<a name="07030883000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
signed the European charter of local self-government on 3 June 1997 and
ratified it on 24 April 1998. They did not choose to exercise the right
to reservations to certain provisions allowed by the charter, so all
its provisions have been relevant to local government since August
1998. In the explanatory memorandum that was laid before Parliament
recommending that the United Kingdom ratify the charter the then
Minister for Local Government and Housing, my right hon. Friend the
Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), accepted
that</div>
					<a name="07030883000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subscribing
to the charter strengthens the Government&#146;s partnership with
local government and will enable key domestic policies to be developed
and implemented more
effectively&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07030883000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, we were pleased to ratify the charter on the basis that it
would enshrine</div>
					<a name="07030883000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;basic
principles already reflected in the United Kingdom of local
democracy&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07030883000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time,
we also made clear that any future legislation affecting local
government should further strengthen the degree of compliance with
aspects of the charter and ensure continued compatibility with its
provisions. I am therefore happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman and the
Committee that subsequent reforms to the system of local government in
England and, indeed, those detailed in the Bill adhere to the
provisions in the charter and the spirit in which it was
developed.</div>
					<a name="07030883000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, part 1 of article 10 of the charter sets out that local
authorities shall be entitled to co-operate with other local
authorities to carry out tasks of common interest, a prerogative
granted by giving local authorities the power of well-being under
section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000. Therefore, although we
agree with the reasoning of the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington in tabling the amendments, the Government see no reason to
accept them on the basis that they would add nothing to the recognition
that we have already given to the right to local self-government by
ratifying the charter and adhering to its principles in subsequent
reforms. That is the bad
news.</div>
					<a name="07030883000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Furthermore,
we do not have in our parliamentary system a broad tradition of
incorporating international treaty obligations wholesale into our
domestic legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div>when there is no need to do so. My notes do not say, &#147;Pause for
intervention from Conservative Members regarding human rights
law,&#148; although they ought to. However, in the absence of such an
intervention, I shall answer the question that the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst was going to ask. His predecessor would
certainly have asked
it.</div>
					<a name="07030883000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Hon.
Members may say that the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the
European convention on human rights, a Council of Europe treaty, into
domestic law. However, the 1998 Act is distinct for one significant
reason: it incorporated a human rights legal framework into domestic
law, for the first time requiring domestic law to be interpreted as
compatible with the convention. It provided a system of legal challenge
and redress for UK citizens who were aggrieved about their rights, as
set out in the convention. Its purpose was to bring those home those
rights without the need, as was the case prior to the 1998 Act, for
citizens to resort to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg
for any matter arising in relation to their rights under the
convention. In other words, the Human Rights Act incorporated into
domestic law that which was already domestic law, as covered by the
treaty, and simply meant that one could access the law without having
to go to Strasbourg. The European charter of local self-government
provides no such mechanism of redress or challenge, so there is no case
for incorporating its provisions wholesale into domestic
law.</div>

							<a name="07030883000438"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The Minister may be about to deal with this
matter, but he has left me rather confused. Will he clarify why he
suggested that my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove submit a
written question? Was it so that the Minister could explain that the
matter had already been ratified, everything is hunky-dory and we do
not need to make any
changes?</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000439"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> No, it was to say that the Government agree with
the hon. Member for Hazel Grove and that the purposes, intent and
outcome of the European charter&#151;which is debated and is an
important issue in local government, as the hon. Gentleman
knows&#151;are already in place and in operation and form one of the
tests of new legislation.</div>
					<a name="07030883000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was going to say what the
differences are in respect of the Human Rights Act, but the hon.
Gentleman did not argue that there was a parallel, although others
would. There is no case for incorporating the provisions of the
European charter of local self-government wholesale into domestic law,
because it provides no mechanism for redress or challenge, which is in
stark contrast to the argument that I have just outlined in relation to
the Human Rights
Act.</div>
					<a name="07030883000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if there
were to be some monitoring or enforcement mechanism attached to the
charter, which there is not, the relationship between the two
instruments is different. One protects the rights of individual
citizens and the other ensures that domestic institutional structures
conform with internationally accepted norms. I strongly support the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s views, as anybody who has read my speech to the
Committee of the Regions would understand. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;We all have.&#148;] I am glad to hear
that. I fell asleep reading that speech to myself. Hon. Members may say
that that is true of all my

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000440"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> How much does the Minister think that those in local
government can rely on the assurances contained in the European charter
of local self-government, bearing in mind that local decisions made in
the past couple of years by the people of France and the Netherlands on
the rejection of the European constitution are presently being
undermined by processes in the EU to get round the referendums that
said no to the
constitution?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000442"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The European charter is a treaty and member states
are therefore obliged to comply with both it and the other treaties
that have been mentioned. The proposed constitution is not a treaty.
There is no redress mechanism in the European charter, so including the
charter in UK law wholesale would duplicate pre-existing domestic law
and would be
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="07030883000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
strongly support the principles behind the charter, and I accept the
argument of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington about the
important part that the charter has played in delivering democratic
local governance&#151;and not just in the UK, incidentally. However,
the new clause is unnecessary and it would introduce a confusing
innovation into the expression of our existing legal framework for
democratic local self-government. The Biggleswade villagers of the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire would rise even more in anger at
that. I ask the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington to consider
those remarks.</div>

							<a name="07030883000443"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation and for
his clarification that the charter has been ratified. Given that
incorporation in UK legislation would be inappropriate in practical
terms because of the lack of any redress mechanism or enforcement
powers, the decent thing to do is not to press my arguments. Therefore
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

repeals a number of outmoded or unnecessary provisions concerning
matters which byelaws can currently address in the interests of tidying

byelaws regulating the location of bathing machines and the costumes to

legislation is respected, we must have a means of abolishing outdated
laws. Of course, the schedule will not remove the power to introduce
byelaws consistent with the
law.</div>

Burt:
						</b> Before we come to the debate on the schedule, may I
say on the Opposition&#146;s behalf how much we have appreciated
being chaired by you, Mr. Benton, during these proceedings?
We should be grateful if you also passed on that message to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 629</div>Mr. Chope. In thanking you, we also thank your hard-working
staff and all Officers of the House. I know that in a moment, the
Minister will thank his team and colleagues, both from his own
Department and from the Department of Health. We have all benefited
from their hard work in substantiating the clauses and those other
issues that have been put before us. The conduct of the proceedings and
the way in which both Ministers have dealt with the matters before us
have been entirely conducive to an extremely favourable atmosphere in
the Committee. We have worked hard, got things on the record and said
what we wanted to say, and have done so in the very best of good
humour.</div>
					<a name="07030883000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proceedings
have been enlivened by the occasional champagne moment. May I beg your
indulgence for two seconds, Mr. Benton, and consider the
candidates eligible for giving us the champagne moment of the series?
There are one or two on the Government Benches. The hon. Member for
Bedford deserves one or two mentions for having pushed the odd
amendment under the wire.</div>
					<a name="07030883000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chatham and
Aylesford has kept us in order, and his occasional prompt has been
helpful to us all. The hon. Members for Hazel Grove and for Carshalton
and Wallington have produced their own exceptional moments, not least
this afternoon when yet again they put forward STV&#151;more in hope
than expectation&#151;and gave it a good
run.</div>
					<a name="07030883000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">On my own
Benches, my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, who is sadly not with us
this afternoon, ensured that Shropshire was mentioned as much as
Bedfordshire. He spoke warmly of the powers that might have been lost
in his area with the powers of direction that we discussed during the
early part of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst did a great deal to ensure that Bromley and Chislehurst was
kept well on the map. His extensive knowledge of local government
matters in London and of Pratts Bottom provided great moments for the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07030883000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Running up
very much on the rails is my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield,
Southgate. In moving very creditably the first amendment that I suspect
he has moved to a Committee, he introduced us to the formidable
Mrs. Burrowes. I hope that she will appreciate that by her
endeavours, we have now gone beyond the formidable. We now know that we
can also refer to her as redoubtable, rigorous, exacting, tremendous,
colossal, indomitable and&#151;my personal
favourite&#151;puissant.</div>

play Scrabble for cash, has risen still further in the estimation of
this Committee with news of the pending sixth member of the Burrowes
household. May I ask my hon. Friend what his majority is as he is doing
a valid job in trying to increase it?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 630</div>
					<a name="07030883000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Poole has the honour and distinction of being the very first member of
any Standing Committee to ask a witness their business and to start off
the proceedings of the witness process in Standing Committees in the
House. He will always be remembered for asking the first question in
such a session. It was a moment of history and certainly a champagne
moment.</div>

It is less of a champagne moment than a recurring occasion.</div>
					<a name="07030883000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just before I close my remarks
on the Ministers, I have to say we remember the Under-Secretary
carrying through with grace a number of different clauses, particularly
those relating to parishes. The Minister for Local Government has
carried the bulk of the Bill. His personal good humour and qualities
make it damned difficult to pin anything on him. He is exceptionally
reasonable and knowledgeable in these areas, and has certainly given
the Committee the benefit of his great wisdom and we have enjoyed
working with him and occasionally fighting against
him.</div>

					<a name="07030883000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without doubt,
the first champagne moment was the best: the explosion on to this
Committee of the blond bombshell, who was moved to put Lichfield on the
map because he was so tired of hearing about Shropshire and
Bedfordshire. My hon. Friend told us in great detail about the solid
gold baubles held in Lichfield, in contrast with our Mace downstairs,
which is only silver gilt. As you know, Mr. Benton, it is
not only what you say, but how you say it. The moment that my hon.
Friend brought Lichfield into this Committee will be long remembered.
He therefore has my vote for the champagne moment of the
proceedings.</div>

England?</div>

moment.</div>
					<a name="07030883000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank you very
much for your indulgence, Mr. Benton. I thank all those who
have helped move the Committee proceedings forward. We look forward to
dealing with the Bill on Report in due
course.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000461"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I echo many of the comments made by the official
Opposition spokesman in thanking you, Mr. Benton, and
Mr. Chope, for chairing the Committee so effectively. I
thank your officials for providing the appropriate support and help at
the time when it was needed. I thank the Ministers for their repartee,
which I have enjoyed considerably during our debates, as have my hon.
Friends.</div>
					<a name="07030883000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
have been so many champagne moments that I suspect that the term
&#147;champagne socialist&#148; is about to make a reappearance.
The Opposition have lost a number of major battles, but we have won a
few skirmishes along the way and we will return to a number of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 631</div>issues on Report and, no doubt, in another place when the time comes,
where, after last night&#146;s proceedings in the House, this Bill
will be received in a very rowdy fashion. However, I am sure that those
in another place will enjoy it. I have enjoyed the proceedings and look
forward to many more in this
place.</div>

							<a name="07030883000462"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> If I may, I should like to say from the Back Benches
how much I have enjoyed being a member of the Committee and what a
positive experience it has been. I thank you, Mr. Benton,
and your colleague, Mr. Chope, for helping to maintain the
positive atmosphere from which we have all
benefited.</div>
					<a name="07030883000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
unknown for Government Whips, whatever the Government, to pack
Committees with hon. Members whose key qualification is that they have
no knowledge of, or any interest in, the matters at hand. However, that
has not happened on this occasion. Colleagues in this Committee have a
deep interest in local government and public involvement issues and
they have experience, to boot, which has benefited the scrutiny and
debate that we have enjoyed. Perhaps Government Whips can take this
message to heart and pass it on: this is the way things should be done
in future.</div>
					<a name="07030883000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
learned about towns throughout the land, some of which I had never
heard of before, including some fine names from Manchester way, which I
should like to hear
again.</div>

							<a name="07030883000464"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend. We also heard about Biggles,
the famous constituent of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire,
who I had not come across for some decades&#151;in fact, since I was
a boy&#151;in respect of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views on
European elections. I wondered where he had flown to. Clearly, he
landed in Biggleswade&#151;and there he will stay. Most welcome of
all have been the numerous opportunities to make relevant and highly
deserved references to Bedford, Kempston and
Bedfordshire.</div>
					<a name="07030883000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
also learned that, as a result of the hard work and commitment of a
number of Committee members, they are ready to forego their lunch or
dinner, depending on what part of the country they come
from.</div>
					<a name="07030883000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Above
all, we have benefited from the constructive, co-operative approach of
all Opposition Members. The tone was undoubtedly set by my hon. Friends
the Ministers, who have, by their listening approach, generated that
response, which is welcomed by all hon. Members. Not only have my hon.
Friends rejected a centralising authoritarian tone, they have been
devolutionary and open in their approach. That has had the unexpected
benefit of generating what my neighbour, the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire, famously coined a champagne moment followed by many more.
I have not kept count, but no doubt we shall see the benefits one day.
A sad fact about the conclusion of our proceedings is that there will
be no more. I thank all members of the Committee for what they have
done to make this a worthwhile
experience.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000465"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Benton, for
your chairing of the Committee along with Mr. Chope, and for
allowing me a couple of minutes to reflect on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 632</div>the context in which the Bill now proceeds. As others have said, it has
been a Committee stage of great humour and constructive debate and one
in which people have boasted about the achievements of local
authorities. I have not had to say anything much about
Derbyshire&#146;s achievements. Everyone knows that it was the first
county council to receive a four-star rating and that it has maintained
the position at the top of the tree, which speaks for
itself.</div>
					<a name="07030883000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my capacity
as chair of the all-party group on the community and voluntary sector,
I wish to say a word about the importance of the Bill. For the record,
I also chair the board of trustees of the Community Development
Foundation and I am a member of the Commission on the Future of
Volunteering, as is the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire. During
the past 12 months, the third sector has come of age under legislation.
Before then, we did not have a Minister for the third sector or an
office of the third sector in the Cabinet Office, which works closely
with Ministers at the Department for Communities and Local Government.
We did not even have a Department with &#147;communities&#148; in
its title and that was dedicated to prioritising the values that
communities
embody.</div>
					<a name="07030883000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Twelve months
ago, we did not have the Charities Act 2006. I had the honour of
serving on the Standing Committee that discussed it. The Act brought
about the most radical uprating of charities legislation for 400 years.
It brought in root-and-branch changes to how charities in the voluntary
sector operate. This week, the Charity Commission launched its
consultation on the meaning of public benefit. In the past few weeks,
the Offender Management Bill has produced a great debate about the role
of the voluntary sector in delivering such services. I very much hope
that, following last night&#146;s vote, my suggestion of indirect
elections to another place might be taken up and that the voluntary
sector will be well represented there,
too.</div>
					<a name="07030883000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Bill has
been dynamic and almost revolutionary in its approach to how the
voluntary sector, the third sector, the community sector and social
enterprise feature within the framework of our society. It has
recognised the sector like no other measure before it. It has involved
local area agreements and local strategic partnerships. It has made the
delivery of services something in which the sector will be a real
partner. The development of community strategies will be a major part
of the Bill and we cannot exclude community groups and voluntary sector
groups from that. The Bill has given them a statutory role in
consultation. It has even integrated them into the scrutiny of
health.</div>
					<a name="07030883000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Bill has not been hitting the headlines, it will achieve many of the
aims of the Sustainable Communities Bill that is before the House. We
shall look back on it as a landmark for having liberated that sector
and as a milestone in the development of participative democracy. I
accept that it still has a long way to go, but the voluntary and
community sector has many friends in another place and I am sure that
its role will only be enhanced by the treatment there. I wish the Bill
fair wind in another place. I look forward to it coming back to the
Floor of the House and, one day, we shall look back on it not only as
representing
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div>an entertaining and historic few weeks because of how the Committee
operated, but as a landmark in the history of the voluntary
sector.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000466"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I echo the comments that have been made. I want to
use this opportunity to remind the Committee about the proposals on
unitary consideration and re-emphasise that I have written to all
members of the Committee and you, Mr. Benton, fulfilling my
pledge to give details of the amendment that we intend to introduce on
Report. There was some concern and I accepted that. We have concluded
our discussions with the Local Government Association and that is
reflected in the amendment. I said that I would write to the Committee
and I did so this morning.</div>
					<a name="07030883000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to make a few
observations. First, I echo the regret that the press do not report the
proceedings of Standing Committees as much as they should. Due to the
changes that have been introduced, I know that there is access to our
deliberations through the internet. I believe that Standing Committees
are webcast&#151;I am not sure what that means, but it says it here.
However, I really do think that commentators and parliamentary
reporters should report more because these matters are of importance to
many tens of thousands of councillors around the country.</div>
					<a name="07030883000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Minister for
Local Government, whoever he or she is, and his or her colleagues,
receive much correspondence on these matters in their postbags. I have
been following the <i class="I">Local Government Chronicle</i> and the
<i class="I">Municipal Journal</i>&#151;I do not wish only to pick out the
LGC&#151;and they have not been following our proceedings as closely
as I would
wish.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000467"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> Is it not a comment on the nature of much of our
media that I am sure that the Committee would have been reported on if
we had had lots of personal nasty rows? Instead, we have got on with
the job that Parliament expects and are completely
ignored.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000468"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> That is the dilemma of politics. I was reflecting
on the fact that had the short title of the Bill been &#145;Abolition
of Swimming Gear: Brighton Beach&#146;, it probably would have got
more coverage, if you will pardon the pun. I have been working on that;
perhaps I should not have bothered.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000469"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b>
						 The Committee would do well to
consider the evidence session of the Public Administration Select
Committee today which was looking at that very point, with evidence
taken from mySociety. The problem is not so much the media, but
ourselves. We are in the dark ages in terms of electronically
communicating the affairs of the House and, in particular, Standing
Committees, in a consistent manner. That is why there is a problem of
communication.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000470"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Clearly the hon. Gentleman&#146;s five children
have been informing him of the state of modern technology. I too have
that benefit from youngsters. The problem involves a bit of both, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column634" />Column number: 634</div>believe. I make that point because the law is based on the intent of
Parliament. That is expressed by Members in making legislation as well
as by Government in putting forward proposals. That is
important.</div>
					<a name="07030883000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">My most
sober moment during the Committee&#146;s deliberations was when the
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire returned from his visit and
reminded us that although we may have differences over issues of public
policy, they pale into insignificance compared to the difficulties of
some countries.</div>
					<a name="07030883000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
someone who has been the Whip on three local government Bills as well
as having helped to shape this Bill, my second reflection is that I
strongly believe that there is a significant step-by-step improvement
going on within local government. The independent auditors say so,
although the public do not always say so and that is their right. Their
expectations increase and we have to just accept that. That is the
nature of democratic
politics.</div>
					<a name="07030883000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
government is, however, improving. One of the reasons for that is a
broad consensus across the Local Government Association. I pay tribute
to Sir Jeremy Beecham, David Kemp, Sir Simon Milton and Lord
Bruce-Lockhart who have put into place that consensus. They have built
up a consensus that is not wishy-washy or based on the lowest common
denominator. We work with them across Whitehall and across local
councils, and we tried to shape the White Paper and the Bill in the
context of that consensus. I believe that that has been reflected in
our deliberations.

pm</div>
					<a name="07030883000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North-East Bedfordshire was kind enough to make some flattering
remarks about my good self. I wish that he would stop, because his
remarks do not always help me when I am in the White Hart in Lydgate,
but I am grateful to him none the less. I have always shared the
attitude of others from Greater Manchester that more flies are caught
with honey than with vinegar. That is worth remembering in life as well
as in politics.</div>
					<a name="07030883000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
view, the Bill is mistitled. It is not a Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Bill; it is a local government reform Bill, a
local government involvement in health Bill and a public involvement in
local government and health Bill. It tries to bring together public
services in a new local framework, and I think that that is very
important.</div>
					<a name="07030883000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar
aspirations are embodied in the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is
promoted by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)
and which is being debated in another Committee. That Bill should now
be considered in light of the policy positions and discussions that
have been considered in this Committee, and I look forward to further
debates on it.</div>
					<a name="07030883000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I echo
the thanks that have been expressed to you, Mr. Benton. As
ever, it has been a pleasure to work under your chairmanship. Four or
five years ago, I was appointed as the Whip for the hon. Gentleman who
is our Chairman, and I read advice from the various available
publications on how to conduct the affairs of a Whip. That included
measures that one could take to persuade and cajole&#151;one is not
allowed to say &#147;bribe&#148;, but you know what I mean. I
looked down a list of my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div>flock, at the head of which was your name, Sir, and I thought, &#147;I
don&#146;t think I am in a position, as a new Member, to tell
Mr. Benton what he should and shouldn&#146;t be
doing.&#148; So I informed him what the Whip was and when, and asked
him if he would kindly consider travelling to Westminster to take part
in Divisions, and normally, Sir, you did&#151;and I was very
grateful.</div>
					<a name="07030883000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
name on the list was that of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich
(Mrs. Dunwoody), and the third was that of the right hon.
Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman). At that point I put
in a transfer
request.</div>
					<a name="07030883000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">You bring
huge experience to the Chair, Mr. Benton, and a gentlemanly
approach to our affairs, and your constituents are well served by you,
as are those of Mr. Chope. I first met Mr. Chope
in 1986, when he was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord
Brooke, who was then the Minister with responsibility for universities.
It was he who wisely informed me about the theory of cock-up and
conspiracy&#151;advice which I have carried with me ever since.
Mr. Chope was the Under-Secretary with responsibility for
local government for two years in the 1980s, and has a huge amount of
experience in local government. I know that he was pleased to be asked
to chair the Committee, and I pass my thanks to him through you,
Mr. Benton.</div>
					<a name="07030883000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank the Clerks, who as
ever are professional and patient, and the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, who
have had to put up with a variety of accents from across
England&#151;not least my own&#151;which make life difficult. I
hope hon. Members noticed that I did not pronounce &#147;bathing
costumes&#148; in the way in which it would be pronounced in my part
of the world. I am grateful also to the Doorkeepers. We have had a
small number of Divisions, which reflects the care with which the Bill
was drafted, but the Divisions that took place reflected some important
points of honest difference between the parties.</div>
					<a name="07030883000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank especially the
officials&#151;not only those from my Department, who have worked
diligently on the Bill and on the White Paper for several years and who
have put a huge amount of effort into them. I have seen proof of the
old adage that preparation and planning make life easier. The Committee
might wish to know that some of the officials worked for Mr.
Chope when he was Under-Secretary of State. I can testify from my
experience that the professional reputation of civil servants and
officials is well
founded.</div>
					<a name="07030883000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
have also been helped by officials from the Department of Health, whose
money I am using to pay for the champagne at the reception that we will
be having at a suitable point, and officials from the Cabinet Office.
We have also been served by officials from the Electoral Commission who
have given their
advice.</div>

							<b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): To pick up on the
plaudits to officials, we Back-Benchers ought also to thank the many
organisations that have contributed to the debate and supported us
throughout the process. For me personally, it was the Local Government
Information Unit and the Local Government Association, but other
colleagues have received support from a range of bodies. I just wanted
to put that on record.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000472"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. My experience is
that the amount of briefing, concern and lobbying on local government
far outweighs that in other areas of public policy, for obvious
reasons. What has struck me is the level of professionalism in the
bodies making representations. As my hon. Friend says, they are to be
thanked.</div>
					<a name="07030883000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
Committee members. This Committee stage has been an enlightening
experience. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford rightly said that
care had been taken to ensure that the Committee included Members of
Parliament who know what they are talking about. When my hon. Friend
the Whip suggested that approach, I was somewhat taken aback. I am one
of only a few members of this Committee who have never been a
councillor. I have tallied up the years of experience in local council
represented on the Committee, and it is substantial. It makes Brian
Lara&#146;s scores look rather low. That expertise is across the
range, for which I am grateful to hon.
Members.</div>
					<a name="07030883000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has also
been enlightening. We heard about the family of the hon. Member for
Enfield, Southgate. We congratulate him and look forward to the new
arrival. He is a lawyer, which I do not hold against him. One of the
few things to which I am looking forward in the event that my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister stands down is once again being able to
take the mickey out of lawyers and public schoolboys. During the past
13 years, we have not been allowed to do so&#151;says he, trying to
remember whether the Chancellor has ever been a lawyer. No, he has not,
so we are on safe ground. The point that the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate made about reported crime has had a big impact on thinking in
the Department, and I thank him for it. It shows that raising such
points is worth
while.</div>
					<a name="07030883000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Lichfield came to the aid of the mace of Lichfield. What he did not
know was that I had received advice the previous day from no less a
figure than the head of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives
and Senior Managers. If colleagues want to join a trade union, SOLACE
is not a bad one to remember. I point out that the average tenure of
the chief executive of a local authority has been less than that of a
Minister for Local Government for 15 years. I am not sure whether that
is a good thing or a bad thing; I suspect that it is a bad
thing.</div>
					<a name="07030883000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The head of
SOLACE asked me whether I had looked at the issue of maces, because
when proposing to create unitary councils, one must protect the
traditions and nuances of local councils, including parishes. He
informed me that one of the biggest difficulties in the Banham
proposals considered in the 1990s was that the Government of the day
realised that unless they introduced late amendments to the Bill, they
would be in danger of confiscating all the maces from the councils. I
took his advice. When the hon. Member for Lichfield raised the issue of
the mace, which he did in his usual friendly and jocular fashion, he
was making a serious point. In making changes, one must bring people
along and protect traditions where they do good, not harm. There is an
important philosophy running through this radical Bill, which the
exchange on maces led to.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div>
					<a name="07030883000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Poole has an
Adjournment debate with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government at the end of proceedings tonight on
the local government finance settlement in Poole. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposition, as a true Conservative, is that because
it is rich it should get more money. That has been the argument of the
right for many centuries. The argument to the contrary that we Labour
Members tend to put, is often put with more passion, but rarely with as
much articulateness and
diligence&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000474"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Articulation. I thank my hon. Friend. I should be
grateful if she gave me a glass of water. The hon. Gentleman will be
making his case on behalf of his constituency. It is a pleasure to work
with him in Committee. He always gets to the big point and does not
mess around with the trivial points, and the debates reflect
that.</div>
					<a name="07030883000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Hazel Grove cannot attend. He has apologised for missing this
afternoon&#146;s sitting. He and his colleagues on the Liberal
Democrat Front Bench have, on the whole, put their points fairly and
have, I think, accepted the genuine intentions of the Bill, which is on
the whole devolutionary. They have taken the opportunity, as Liberal
Democrats often do, to read some press releases, which are normally
about the single transferable vote. I refer to that in my notes as the
single transferable speech, because I have heard it many times and it
is always the same. Nevertheless, I suppose that they should be
congratulated on their consistency. I thank them for the way in which
they have approached the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07030883000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is part of the 555 group. There are
three members of that group on this Committee who were elected in
2005.</div>

							<a name="07030883000476"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I said in response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
maiden speech that he was a category A Member of Parliament. He has
shown his diligence in this Committee, as well as his expert knowledge
of local government. I thank him for
that.</div>
					<a name="07030883000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly
thank my Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford,
who, with his Opposition colleagues, has ensured that there has been
sensible time for debate. The noble Lords will, on reading the
proceedings in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, be satisfied that scrutiny has been
given in the right way and with due time, without the need for
confrontation. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the way in which he
and his colleagues have crafted that and I thank all the hon. Members
involved.</div>
					<a name="07030883000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
my hon. Friends, who have brought to the Committee knowledge, not just
of local government, but their many years of experience in their
constituencies and of the voluntary sector. I thank them for that. I
will be scrutinising proposals in Bedford with particular vigilance,
given the views that have been expressed. I look forward to
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07030883000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000477"></a>Mr.
Turner:
						</b> Before the Minister<b class="B"> </b>ends his thanks, I want
to point out that the unique thing about this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>Committee is that we were able to question people prior to our
proceedings. It is right to put on the record our thanks to the
officials who facilitated that unique process, which was useful. That
is a good innovation that will benefit the scrutiny process in the
House.</div>
					
					
					<a name="07030883000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030883000478"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> In echoing that, all Committee members will have
noticed that, when changes are introduced in parliamentary proceedings,
there are those who wish to see rapid, radical change and those who
resist it. However, life has a way of bedding in and my belief is that,
in future, it will be taken as read that it is common sense to
undertake such evidence sessions. In reality, the procedure saved
Committee members time, because we would have been lobbied in any
event. I remember that we were lobbied in our advice surgeries and
around our constituencies about the minimum wage legislation, so I echo
those remarks.</div>
					<a name="07030883000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
particularly thank my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend
the Member for West Ham who, like the Whip, is silenced by the process
that we undertake in Committee deliberations. Not only has she been of
enormous help to me and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State,
but she helped to influence the policy, the debate and the amendments.
We would not have had so many champagne moments without her. I have
always been proud to be a champagne socialist. I have never seen the
point of socialism unless it involves the proposition, &#147;If they
can have it, why can&#146;t we?&#148; I think that the term was
originally intended as an insult to members of the Labour party, but I
never saw it as such myself. However, in light of my confession, I
should like to spend some more of the Department of Health&#146;s
money on champagne for Committee members at a suitable point. The
French vintner Joseph D&#146;Argent said,</div>
					<a name="07030883000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No Government could
survive without champagne.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030883000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">How right he was.</div>
					<a name="07030883000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is very important in
relation to the reconfiguration of public finances and the relationship
not only between central and local government but between central
Government and government services provided locally. Although the
framework that we are adopting in the Bill has not, as my hon. Friend
the Member for High Peak said, been the subject of headlines, the Bill
will have good repercussions far beyond this Committee in the years to
come. I know that it has been welcomed by the Local Government
Association and others.</div>
					<a name="07030883000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank you, Mr.
Benton, and the rest of the Committee, and I look forward to working
with members of the Committee in implementing the legislation in
future.</div>
					<a name="07030883000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">The
Chairman: </b>Before I put the remainder of the proceedings to the
Committee, let me respond on behalf of Mr. Chope and myself
by saying what a great pleasure it has been to have the privilege of
chairing this Committee. I thank the Ministers, Opposition spokespeople
and all members of the Committee for the courtesy and co-operation that
they have extended to Mr. Chope and myself throughout our
proceedings. </div>
					<a name="07030883000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I value,
as always, the assistance provided by the learned Clerks, the Official
Reporters and everybody who has contributed to the smooth running of
this Committee. Just one quick comment of my own on the uniqueness of
the Committee, I think that our experience with the witness
contributions at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>beginning of the proceedings proved very valuable. It was most
interesting. I do not know where things will go to from here, but I
found it very valuable and informative. Thank you all very much
