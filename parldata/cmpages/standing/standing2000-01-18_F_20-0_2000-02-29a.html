</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. There are a considerable number of Government amendments on the amendment paper, most of which are minor, technical amendments. There is a substantial new schedule and two matters of substance, one of which relates to the combined pension forecast, which is a data protection issue. We have tabled amendments to reform and modernise the housing benefit appeal arrangements.
<P>
The notes on clauses and schedules will be in the Room in time for this afternoon's sitting. To the best of my knowledge, barring unforeseen circumstances, which would have to be as serious as the wheel coming off, we do not propose to table any further Government amendments in Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on, I should point out to the Committee that the number of the Government amendment to clause 54 was printed incorrectly as amendment No. 355 on yesterday's amendment paper. The correct number is amendment No. 354, which appears on this morning's amendment paper.
<H4><center>Clause 49</center></H4>
<H4><center>Loss of benefit for breach of community order</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I beg to move amendment No. 329, in page 52, line 25, leave out from `(a)' to `the' in line 26 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a court has determined that an offender has breached'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 344, in page 52, line 25, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`information is laid before a justice of the peace that'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 345, in page 52, line 26, leave out `has failed' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is found guilty by a court of having failed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 346, in page 52, line 29, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`information has been laid'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`offender has been found guilty'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 347, in page 52, line 32, after `then', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the court may order that'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I apologise for not being present at the beginning of the sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): Shocking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is shocked by that; I am shocked too.
<P>
The amendments are to a new and important part of the Bill, which deals with issues such as whether administrative procedures should be used in place of judicial procedures for imposing sanctions on offenders. That is fundamental to our consideration of the clause. I shall set in context our reason for tabling the amendments and say why we feel so strongly about clause 49. At its heart is a principle that we believe the Government should not advance.
<P>
Clause 49 and the other clauses in this part of the Bill provide for benefits to be withdrawn or reduced when an offender is in breach of a community sentence. The trigger is not a decision of the courts, but of the probation service to refer back to the courts a breach of a community service order. The Secretary of State will put in place the appropriate regulations for the administrative sanction.
<P>
The explanatory notes state that in 1998 about 30,000 people were referred back to the courts for breaching community sentences. According to a written answer on 22 February, the figure is 28,500. It has been difficult to obtain more detailed figures, so I hope that the Minister will give us more information. I tried to find out from the Home Office how many of the 30,000 breaches referred back to the courts were subsequently not proven. It would be useful to know how many of those people will have to pay back their benefits so that administrative arrangements can be made and we can know what costs are involved. There are practical considerations as well as matters of principle to be considered, and it would be helpful if the Minister would elucidate them in due course.
<P>
The Home Office is tightening its procedures in respect of breaches, and I understand that in future the number of acceptable absences will be reduced from three to two. Several of the organisations that represent staff in the probation service, including the National Association of Probation Officers and the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, believe that that will result, not in a reduction in breaches, but in an overall increase over time. It would be useful to know whether the Minister intends there to be an on-going evaluation of the impact of the clauses, should they be enacted, in addition to the evaluation of the pilot schemes referred to in the explanatory notes. I hope that the amendments will encourage the Government to reconsider the clauses, which should not be in the Bill.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle) would explain what measures will be used to evaluate the pilot schemes and say how many studies are intended. Will there be control measures to compare what happens in the pilot studies with what happens outside the pilot areas? There should be an objective assessment of whether the tool achieves the changes that we want, or whether, as those in profession believe, the proposal will increase reoffending and non-compliance. We want to know how compliance will be evaluated and how reoffending will be monitored.
<P>
The Association of Chief Officers of Probation, the National Association of Probation Officers and the Penal Affairs Consortium, which represents about 41 different organisations, have made representations to members of the Committee about their concerns. I make no apologies for the fact that at least of two of my amendments were drafted by NAPO. I had a go at trying to draft the first amendment in the group myself; the three amendments taken together would have the same effect, which I shall explain in more detail in a moment.
<P>
In our debate on the amendments, I shall outline my principal anxieties about the clause, which have been expressed by those outside the Committee and which I hope are shared by hon. Members. I reiterate that reducing benefit by administrative means is a non-judicial form of punishment. It removes from the courts their power to deal with breaches of their own orders, which fundamentally undermines our judicial processes and is a breach of the separation of judicial functions from other functions of the state.
<P>
When a breach is proven, it appears that the courts cannot have regard to the benefits sanction that is being imposed; it would be useful to have on the record whether that is the case, as it appears to be the view of some outside the House. Can the courts take into account the sums that have been withdrawn by way of a benefits sanction when they frame their decision about the further sanctions to be imposed on an offender who has breached their order? The benefit is stopped on the basis of a person being found guilty before being proven innocent. That is a fundamental overturning of the ancient and essential principles of our system of justice. We should be clear about whether it is fair and justifiable to amend the law to enable administrative systems to operate in a different way from that of the courts. The proposal only applies to those on benefits. There is no equivalent sanction that will be applied to people in employment. There was no talk of providing a mechanism for an even-handed approach. According to research into the profile of people in this category, the unemployed are unsurprisingly quite prominent, and those most likely to be unemployed are black males. Consequently, it is likely that these measures will hit the ethnic minority population hardest.
<P>
The next major issue is the impact on families. Research reveals that the man—the offender will often make a judgment about how much he needs, and the family will be given only what is left over. Under the Bill, what is left over will be less—another serious cause for concern. Under the amendments, it would not be a matter of administrative convenience in the first instance. The trigger should not be the probation officer filing an information report to the courts to refer a breach of a community service order back to them. The trigger should be a decision by the courts that a proven breach has taken place. That is when this should be one of the potential sanctions that the courts have at their disposal.
<P>
The Government, however, do not argue that case. They believe that it should be an administrative procedure, separate from the courts. The amendments would ensure that the matter is not dealt with in that way. If the Government believe that this sanction will affect and modify offending behaviour for the good, the courts should be able to apply it. They could then weigh up the mitigating circumstances and other considerations to decide on the most effective measures.
<P>
That is the essence of our amendments—to establish whether the courts should decide on the sanction. Overall, our view is—and if there is a clause stand part debate, we shall argue it strongly—that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. If it is to stand part of the Bill, it would be at least partially improved if the amendments were accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) achieved the almost impossible: he made me pleased to see a Liberal Democrat. At one stage in Committee, I thought that I might have to move probing amendments. I readily understand from the hon. Gentleman's interesting speech that he intends to press his amendments to the vote. I shall urge my hon. Friends to resist them and, if necessary, to vote with the Government.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is nevertheless right in one respect: the amendments are fundamental to clause 49. As the Opposition have now established a pattern of dealing with amendments, we intend to devote some time to clause 49, which is the heart of this part of the Bill. The first set of amendments raises one of the three issues that we believe are important—whether the amendments are likely to be judge proof.
<P>
Now that the Human Rights Bill has become law, we live in a slightly different world than before. I had the opportunity of talking to a senior colleague who had responsibility for these matters during the previous Conservative Government. I explained the intentions of the present Government and he expressed mild surprise—not because of the measures, which we fully support, but at the idea that it was possible to realise them. He said that the consistent advice of officials was that it was not possible to achieve these objectives, which would be challengeable. I therefore wish briefly to test the water and ensure that what we are seeking to achieve will pass muster in relation to the European convention on human rights.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Circumstances may not be as easy in Committee now as they were earlier. When the European convention was raised in our debates on the child support provisions, the Under-Secretary said that as lawyers had not alluded to it, there could not be a problem. A couple of weeks ago, however, our proceedings came to a halt because lawyers had not spotted a particular problem with the pension provisions. Frankly, were it not for the eagle eyes of the right hon. Gentleman, the Minister of State (Mr. Rooker), we might have been unable to achieve the Government's objectives because of lawyers' failure to identify a legal problem. I therefore want to set out some important problems for the attention of the Under-Secretary. I am open to persuasion: I shall be happy if the hon. Lady is able to persuade me of her views.
<P>
On Second Reading, some of our contributions offered a different solution to that proposed by the Government. We sought improved enforcement and fewer hearings—solutions to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred when he spoke about the submission of the Association of Chief Officers of Probation. Its submission repeats many of the hon. Gentleman's arguments and it is worth putting a few sentences on record. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For all the above concerns, it is not difficult to foresee possible challenges to the scheme once it is in operation. These might be either because the withdrawal of benefit is triggered by an allegation—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or on the grounds of increasing (rather than decreasing) non-compliance and further offending or, on a broader point, introducing differential sanctions according to offenders' circumstances, with only retrospective involvement from the Courts.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be despicable if sanctions led to more crime, as the hon. Gentleman suggested when he repeated the views of the chief probation officer. That is not an argument either against the Government's proposals or in favour of the amendment. If people are punished when they break the law, the view that it increases the likelihood of reoffending is an extraordinary doctrine. Perhaps we should increase benefits to offer an incentive to people convicted of various offences not to reoffend. That is utterly ridiculous. If people break the law, they must face the consequences. It is not legitimate to argue that people break the law to supplement their income and will continue to do so. If they do so, they should face increasingly greater punishments. After all, with measures such as community service orders, people have been given a second chance: they have been given a chance to put something back into the community. They have to understand that they must put something back if they are prepared to take from society.
<P>
It has been suggested—not by chief officers—that probation officers may be reluctant to lay such allegations before the courts because of the nature of their relationship with their clients. That is despicable. Probation officers' primary duty must be to society, not to their individual clients. Of course, probation officers are concerned about their clients, because they belong to a dedicated, caring profession, which we should admire. They want them to be able to reform their lives, but it would be wrong to suggest that if Parliament were to agree to the Government's proposals probation officers should hold back.
<P>
The Government propose that information should be put before the courts. That formal step begins a prosecution in the magistrates courts. If community service, probation or combination orders have been breached, the Secretary of State or the appointed person gives notification that the information has been put before the courts. The precise details of the process and whether there will be automatic reporting will be established by regulation. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would lift the veil on what those regulations are likely to state. Benefit is automatically reduced for a set period. That reduction will apply to non-contributory income support and jobseeker's allowance, which, I think, is a contributory benefit. Under the Bill, the information is withdrawn, the offender may receive back payments.
<P>
As has been made clear to me by leading counsel, the law on such matters is changing rapidly. The Opposition are always grateful to leading counsel who lend their services to help in the better drafting of amendments. I am indebted to them for the brief that I have received on the European convention on human rights, which puts it in a nutshell. It says that this is a rapidly developing field of law, with a distinctly mad thought process. Arguments that are, on the face of it, barking mad have often found favour. That is not especially reassuring, given that the courts will determine many of those matters.
<P>
The Government have refused to provide the legal advice on the clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) asked the Under-Secretary. My hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) asked the Under-Secretary about that on 18 January, and a written answer appears in Hansard at columns 430W to 431W. The Under-Secretary may think that I am about to castigate her for her refusal to release that information, but I shall only do so mildly, as that written answer is very full and, in many ways, a model response. In it, the Under-Secretary says that there are practically no problems under the provision, on which she has taken legal advice. She discusses article 6 of the convention, which deals with the right to a fair trial and to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred. The Under-Secretary says that obligations under article 6 are complied with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as those affected by this measure will have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal in respect of the decision to withdraw or reduce benefits and the magistrates or the Crown Court will establish the fact of the alleged breach, as now.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 18 January 2000; Vol. 342, c.430W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, as the hon. Gentleman said, article 6 is about more than the right to a fair trial, as it deals with the determination of civil rights and obligations when criminal charges are brought. In such circumstances, people are entitled to a fair, public hearing and should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The hon. Gentleman has a fair point about the effect of that on withdrawing benefit, as clearly that is an administrative, not judicial, decision. We hope that such cases are brought speedily to trial, but if that does not happen injustice will be done to innocent people.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary put our minds at rest about the right to benefit being regarded as a civil right? If it is so regarded, there will be a problem, especially in relation to back payments and other adjustments. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to clear the point up if I put a hypothetical case to her. I do not wish to dwell too heavily on the matter, but spending a little time on this group of amendments may save considerable time and repetition on future amendments.
<P>
Suppose someone who is subject to one of the orders takes out a loan for a car or hire purchase payments. If an allegation is made under the Bill, benefit will be reduced by the specified amount. If, six weeks later, the person proves not to have breached the order, how will that affect his ability to pay for hire purchase or a loan? Will the Government have to pay compensation? Are they sure that the Bill is judge-proof in that regard? The courts, not the Government, will determine the matter, as there will be a determined attempt to challenge the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We need to know whether the receipt of benefits is a civil right. That is why we were so taken by the Under-Secretary's written answer, which goes beyond the normal boundaries of such replies and begins to lay down a new doctrine—the Wallasey doctrine—on benefits. The Under-Secretary says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Benefits are conditional on the fulfilment of responsibilities to society.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 18 January 2000; Vol. 342, c.431W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wholly approve of that, but it is not germane to this group of amendments, so I shall return to it later. However, I hope that we shall have an opportunity to examine in depth what people need to do to fulfil their responsibility to society and so receive benefits. That scrutiny, I believe, should be friendly.
<P>
We must consider a couple of other matters relating to the amendments, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, would fundamentally affect the operation of clause 49. For example, article 8, on privacy, affects the exchange of information. In her written answer the Under-Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although the exchange of information between the Probation Service and the Benefits Agency may raise issues under Article 8, on privacy, the exchange proposed is the minimum necessary to achieve the legitimate aims of matching benefit rights to responsibility.—[Official Report, House of Commons, 18 January 2000; Vol. 342, c.431W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, article 8 raises a problem that goes much further than the Under-Secretary suggests. Article 8 deals with privacy and respect for someone's private and family life. It could come into play if loss of benefit affects the offender's home life or family ties, or if the family suffers because there is no money to take home for a spouse or child. Will the Under-Secretary address that issue which fully justifies my advice and definitely comes into the category of barking mad?
<P>
It is not necessary to go into such detail on other matters, which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam discussed in some depth. He read out probation officers' suggestion that the provision may be discriminatory. We have all received a copy of a letter dated 3 February from the Association of Chief Officers of Probation stating that the proposals assume that all offenders will be treated equally and that there will be no differential impact. The association gives several cases in which that will clearly not be so. First, it says, quite legitimately, that the proposals
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will only apply to offenders receiving income from benefits, and there is no equivalent sanction for those in work.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Controversially, but perhaps truthfully, it goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>black males have higher unemployment rates than white males and are thus going to be over represented in the group of offenders liable to withdrawal of benefit.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It states that loss of benefit will clearly have a significant impact on the rest of the family's income, which is the article 8 point.
<P>
Article 14 now comes into play. Again, the Under-Secretary has been helpful. In considering article 14, she said that the proposals are part of the reform of welfare, whereby the right to benefits and responsibilities to society are closely linked. She said that the Government's
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>concern is not only to achieve better compliance with community sentences, but to reflect the view that it is not fair that offenders who breach community sentences should have the same rights to benefits as those who comply.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have enormous sympathy with that, but, sadly, article 14 goes a little wider and refers to discrimination on such grounds as social origin, property or other status.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam dealt straightforwardly with the other status, as did the chief probation officers in their letter. People of certain social or ethnic origins are statistically more likely to end up on benefit. Such discrimination can arise. It is not only a question of race, but of dealing with people who live in poverty. There is a suggestion, certainly from those who briefed me, that the term ``benefit claimant'' has a status under article 14. The foundation of additional benefit could be the basis of discrimination, so I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond to that point.
<P>
I should like the Under-Secretary to comment on two other matters. The Government rely heavily on article 1 of the first protocol on the protection of property, but the Under-Secretary said that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>does not apply to all Social Security benefits, although contributory Jobseeker's Allowance may be regarded as a ``possession''—[Official Report, House of Commons, 18 January 2000; Vol. 342, c.431W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, we must ensure that people are entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions under the first protocol. They must not be deprived of them except in the public interest, subject to conditions provided by law. That is essentially what the Under-Secretary wants to do, but we know that the court applies a test of fair balance and proportionality. The test is whether it is in the public interest to confiscate property.
<P>
There is much case law on such matters. As a non-lawyer, I am grateful for the advice that I have received. I shall not go into the details, but I shall mention two cases by name: X v. Netherlands in 1971 and Muller v. Austria in 1975. They are directly relevant because it was found that contributory benefits were property, which is what the Under-Secretary said about jobseeker's allowance, but it was suggested that non-contributory benefits might also be property. If that is so, the caveat that the Under-Secretary entered when responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Havant is writ even larger.
<P>
Finally, I turn to double jeopardy, which was hinted at, but not quite explained by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. Article 4 of the seventh protocol bans being punished twice for an offence. Under the Bill, the offender will suffer a penalty for a breach of community order, as he does under current legislation, and an additional penalty in the loss of benefit. The hon. Lady's point about article 7 not applying retrospectively does not stand up against the ban on double jeopardy in article 4 of the seventh protocol. Will she put our minds at rest about that?
<P>
I am sorry to have taken slightly longer than I intended. We would have tabled probing amendments, had not the hon. Gentleman fortuitously tabled his. We support the Government, but we want the two Houses of Parliament to decide such matters, as we do not see the point in enacting a Bill that will be rapidly deconstructed by courts applying the Human Rights Act 1998. If the hon. Lady persuades us that the provision is judge-proof, we will join her in not supporting the Liberal Democrat amendments. However, if she does not persuade us of that, there may well be merit in the words of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and we should not dismiss him out of hand. It sticks in my craw to say that: life can be hard at times.
<P>
The hon. Lady has the power to put our minds at rest by dismissing my concerns, but she can only do so by taking us into her confidence on the European convention on human rights. I readily accept that she is not keen on releasing legal advice, as past events in Committee have shown. However, she lifted a good quarter of the veil in her written answer, so she may as well go the rest of the way and give the curtain a good tug.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Is it stretching credulity too far to suggest that the unamended clause amounts to tax on poverty? It provides an incentive for the poor to become richer by loading on them a penalty that is not available to better-off people who are not on benefit. It does that by taking away people's right not to be subject to a penalty before the judicial process has been concluded. Withdrawal of benefit will apply before cases have been heard and concluded by magistrates.
<P>
The desire to fence off people on benefit and subject them to a different set of rights from those enjoyed by the general population has a long history. One might say that a system of lesser eligibility has escaped from an earlier part of the Bill into the clause. In both cases, the Benthamite process and thinking in this clause is the same. In the previous century, it was legally possible to remove the voting rights of people seeking medical assistance who were regarded as being on benefit.
<P>
We may be skirting round that attitude by applying a penalty to people on benefit which, of course, cannot be applied to those who are not on benefit. Therefore, we are on dangerous ground and must be careful.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, I understand the raw, political motive for such an approach. Many people are aware of disruption on housing estates caused by those who, quite properly, become subject to community service orders. However, they continue to make a thorough nuisance of themselves, much to the annoyance of their neighbours, who, through their taxes and contributions, are supporting the life style of those inflicting misery on them.
<P>
I entirely understand the political motive for addressing the issue. However, there is also a philosophical motive that appears in the Green and White Papers, which mention a new contract for welfare. People in receipt of benefit have obligations placed on them by the community. In some respects, that is no different from the existing system. Jobseeker's allowance is paid on the condition of certain undertakings, such as agreeing to look for work and being available for and actively seeking work.
<P>
There is no new departure there, although we are moving slightly beyond that into fresh territory with an expectation of behaviour that is not directly—
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> Connected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I thank the hon. Lady. There is an expectation of behaviour that is not directly connected to the payment of benefit.
<P>
As a condition of payment, a lone parent in receipt of income support is required not to cohabit. However, that is not a moral requirement resulting from disapproval of cohabitation outside marriage, but a practical requirement ensuring that the proper amount of benefit is paid and that the taxpayer is not defrauded. Therefore, the expectation of behaviour is directly connected to the payment of benefit.
<P>
Under the clause, the expectation of behaviour is not directly connected to the payment of benefit. Indeed, the behaviour that has given rise to the problem may be entirely unconnected to the payment of benefit. We are therefore moving beyond the principles of the current system and should be careful of the ground on which we tread. I shall certainly be interested to hear what the Minister says about why benefit should be withdrawn before magistrates have concluded whether a community service order has been breached.
<P>
I was expecting my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) to explain why I should support the clause and reject the amendments. However, to be fair, he did not do that. He may speak again and persuade me, but for the moment I remain nervous of any procedure that allows a punishment to be inflicted without judicial process.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Janet Dean </B>(Burton): The probation service has expressed anxieties about how the clause will work in practice. I seek reassurance from my hon. Friend on two matters: first, that sufficient warning should be given to those who are given community sentences or probation orders that there could be an impact on their benefit if they fail to keep to the orders; and secondly, that the impact of the pilots will be carefully assessed. I have in mind particularly the effect on the families of offenders, an issue raised in the letter from the Association of Chief Officers of Probation. There should be no discrimination against ethnic minorities and the measure should not increase re-offending. I hope that the pilots will be carefully monitored, because if the proposals do not act as an incentive to co-operate as they should, they could have a detrimental effect. I hope that the Minister will reassure me on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): It is a delight to welcome the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) to our debate. She is obviously worried about the matter and the fact that she has felt compelled to intervene should cause the Government some concern.
<P>
I think the matter is a fuss about nothing. The Government's action is absolutely right; there will be a tremendous cheer for what they are doing in the housing estates, where people are fed up with those who seem to have no idea that society is made not just by rights but by duties. People may, through no fault of their own, be on benefit and rely on state assistance, but if they are in breach of a community service or probation order it is absurd that they can string things out, go to a court of law and break those orders and yet carry on being supported by society. Punishments are imposed by society because people have committed an offence. People listening to our debate will think that we are barking mad to worry about the issue. I know that the Government—
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry that my hon. Friend, whom I have hitherto admired, and who was a great champion of sound sense and the silent majority, is showing a hint of wetness in his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I entirely understand the force of my hon. Friend's arguments and his desire to punish those whose behaviour causes misery to their neighbours. Does he agree that it is entirely proper to establish that a community order has been breached? The clause as drafted contains a defective mechanism in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The point is serious, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) will forgive me for teasing him. I want to carry on the excellent work of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar in trying to obtain a full explanation from the Government.
<P>
I was one who warned the Government of the likely consequences of adopting the European convention on human rights. Sadly, although they will receive no support from society as a whole, lawyers will pick through this proposal and try to undo it. The convention makes their work much easier. My hon. Friend has done a notable service to the Committee; because of the Pepper v Hart case and because the Minister's words can be considered closely by the courts in determining such matters, his reply to the debate could be most interesting.
<P>
To be fair to my hon. Friends and to the hon. Member for Burton, it is important to tie the Minister down closely on the various articles in the convention and to get a full reply, which I may have to go further than the answer she has already given and to which my hon. Friend alluded in the House on 18 January at column 430W.
<P>
Let us consider the proceedings. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said, information will be laid before the court that a community service or probation order has been broken and the Secretary of State's officials will be notified that the information has been laid. It will be interesting to know how that will be done. The benefit will be automatically reduced for a set period, and that is what worries people. If it is subsequently found that the probation order has not been broken in the way that is alleged in the information laid before the court, the offender receives back payment. All that is clear, as far as it goes but, as my hon. Friend said, it gives various opportunities for people to pray in aid the European convention on human rights.
<P>
I shall go through the articles one by one; the Government have a pretty cast-iron case and I want to help them. They are not likely to be in breach of article 7, which states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one which was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are in the clear on that one because of the Minister's answer that a breach of article 7—no punishment without law—does not arise even if it is regarded as criminal in nature because it will apply only to those given community sentences after the Bill has become law.
<P>
The Government may have more difficulty with article 6, the right to a fair trial. The convention states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the determination of his civil rights and obligation or of any criminal charge against him . . . he is entitled to a fair and public hearing . . . and everyone . . . should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend for New Forest, West were worried because the benefit is taken away automatically. There is no form of trial, therefore the presumption of innocence does not apply. It will save a lot of public money and a lot of anguish if the Government give a convincing account now of how they will meet the inevitable challenge. If we, and the lawyers advising us can spot it, so will other people. They will ask the Government for a convincing explanation in a court of law of whether they have broken article 6, which I admit may prove, as it often does, that the law is an ass.
<P>
There are two really worthwhile objectives. The Government's view, which is set out in the Green Paper, ``New Ambitions for our Country: A New Contract for Welfare'' is that the Government and the individual have certain duties. Everyone supports that concept and everybody believes that in the case we are discussing the individual is not carrying out his duties. The Government are in the clear in one respect but there is a seemingly innocuous and sensible provision in the convention—that in the determination of civil rights and obligations a person is entitled to a fair hearing. No one could argue with either proposition, but unfortunately people will use the convention to drive a coach and horses through the eminently sensible ideas that the Government are trying to implement.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not see how the Government, when they are taken to a court of law, will be able to overcome the problem. People will simply say, ``Look, it is clearly laid out in the convention that you should not lose your rights until there is a proper trial.'' Does the Government's answer of 18 January address that point?
<P>
I have no doubt that that will form the core of the Minister's reply. The parliamentary answer states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The obligations under Article 6 of the Convention (the right to a fair trial) are complied with as those affected by this measure will have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal in respect of a decision to withdraw or reduce benefits and a magistrates or Crown Court will establish the facts of the alleged breach.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that that will be the Minister's defence today: ``do not worry, I, the Minister, can, by an administrative act, take the benefit away without there being a trial; hitherto people enjoyed a right to a trial, but do not worry because there will be a right of appeal.''
<P>
That brings us back to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar: no defence at all is provided because between the withdrawal of benefit and the right of appeal, a person may have suffered financial loss. As my hon. Friends made clear, someone's hire purchase payments might have been interrupted and his whole life thrown into confusion. People certainly will argue that point, which surely causes the Government some difficulty. In order to get around the problem, I hope that the Minister will make it clear that determining whether benefit should be withdrawn—I believe that the Government are perfectly entitled to do so—will require some sort of administrative trial of the available evidence. If so, it could substantially lengthen procedures and cost a lot of money. I do not want to propose such a procedure for the Government, but I am trying to find a way around the article 6 conundrum.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman is looking for a way out of the conundrum and my amendments were tabled to achieve that. They would restore the presumption of innocence and allow the courts to assess whether an order had been breached. If the amendment were accepted, the measure would be in the Bill and could be exercised by the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The hon. Gentleman has tabled his amendments, he has spoken to them and the Minister must reply. I am worried about building into the Bill a procedure that could unduly lengthen proceedings or provide a back-door route to defeating the Government's intentions. When everything goes before the courts, it often makes procedures too long, too costly and too difficult to prove. Someone waiting to return to court to establish whether a probation order has been broken continues to live on benefit, as the Government are likely to argue.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is perfectly entitled to make his point, which I perfectly understand, about the European convention on human rights. The Government have, of course, adopted the convention and built it into our law, but those who live by the convention must die by the convention. During our long 18 years in power, we never adopted the convention, despite Lord Lester continually arguing in another place that we should do so. We resisted it.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that the Government adopted the European convention, as written and drafted by British lawyers. The principles were in existence, usable and applicable before they were introduced into UK law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is entirely true. Many people were proud of the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights during the late 1940s and early 1950s, which was a response to the appalling and horrendous abuses of human rights during the second world war. However, it was never envisaged that the court would be used to attack the eminently sensible proposals of a democratically elected Government. The hon. Lady is right, but many of us have become increasingly concerned over the years about the propensity of this court to intervene in the domestic affairs and legal procedures of member states that signed up to it.
<P>
The hon. Lady makes a fair debating point. We helped to set up this court, and we abided by its provisions for a number of years, but the Government have gone one step further. By incorporating the convention in our law, it will be even easier for people to appeal to the convention through our own courts Hitherto, one had to conduct a lengthy and costly trial in Europe; now, any judge can consider the matter from day one. Indeed, people will try to challenge the provisions that we are debating today, and the hon. Member for Burton has already raised some relevant points in that regard.
<P>
Article 6 poses a problem, but even if the convention is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar put it, barking mad in many respects, I cannot believe that the Government will have many problems with article 14, which deals with discrimination on grounds such as social origin, property or other status. However, I am convinced that some will try to challenge the Government on article 14. They will say that, because some social origins are statistically more likely than others to produce people who end up on benefit, there is discrimination under that heading. In my view, the point is absurd, but that is the legal advice that we have received. I have no doubt that people will make that point, and I hope that the Government will have a good answer to it.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar has said, challenges will also be made in respect of article 4 of the seventh protocol and the banning of double punishment for the same offence. Again, in my view, the provision does not constitute double punishment, but the point is arguable and it will be put before the courts. I hope that the Under-Secretary will treat this debate seriously and reassure those of us who want her point of view to prevail that she has a cast iron case that will stand up in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I do not want to speak for long, because I, too, want to hear the Under-Secretary's explanation of the workings of the provision. In general, I agree with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West about the link between behaviour and benefits, although I may be at variance with his view in one respect, which I shall come to in a moment. However, it is important to recognise that the Government are probably aiming to do the right thing. Some people are becoming rather tired with those on benefits who cause problems on their estates. That is a social problem that must be tackled beyond today's deliberations.
<P>
I am concerned that we are entering a new legal area. Often, the alternative form of punishment is prison, so we are talking about a serious matter. There is a strong link between behaviour and the punishment that people receive. Community service is often regarded as a relatively light sentence, but some of those who are sentenced to it are serious criminals.
<P>
For purposes other than the consideration of the Bill, I looked closely at the running of the probation and community service, and some would make a strong case for splitting it up. Probation officers will probably be responsible for taking cases to court, but I presume that they will rely on the opinions and words of someone else. A probation officer will not necessarily be persuaded to take a case to court by his direct involvement in it. [Interruption.] That is my understanding of the matter, but I note that the Under-Secretary is looking uncomfortable, and she may want to correct me.
<P>
The matter would then go to court, and I presume that someone who had breached the community service order would be punished further. That would not be decided by the probation officer, but, presumably, by the courts. That seems inconsistent. I understand the Government's intention, but I wonder whether we are creating an inconsistency in law. If the court were to decide that the benefit should be withdrawn, would it not be neater for it to decide what further punishment might befall the person appearing before it? I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) I am not a lawyer, although I admire his ability and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar to dissect EU law and the various challenges that might be made under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The European convention on human rights is not EU law. The hon. Lady should not confuse the two.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Lady is right to upbraid me for my inaccurate use of language. It is not European law, it is extraterrestrial law, which applies in the United Kingdom. That has unfortunate consequences—[Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Given the nature of some of the decisions, it is clearly an extraterrestrial law.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Extraterritorial.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I shall engage my brain in a moment. I am grateful for the observation made by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West. What I did not mean to say was more accurate than what I should have said, which gives me pleasure.
<P>
I am slightly amused because the Government are about to find themselves in the same position as Conservative Governments found themselves in for 18 years. Honourable, right and proper intentions of British domestic law are likely to be turned over by other laws, which we must obey, but which we never thought would have the consequences that they currently have.
<P>
It is right and proper for the Government to want to proceed on the basis outlined in the Bill. One of the problems in British society is that there are few penalties and punishments to which certain social groups adhere and accord respect. Those of us who pick up the bill for such anti-social behaviour are frustrated because, in many cases, those who commit such acts expect to live off the rest of us, in terms of receiving benefits, but do nothing in return. However badly some of those people behave, there seems to be nothing that can be done about it.
<P>
I am delighted by the ratcheting up effect of introducing legislation to deal with persistent offenders who have been taken to court, found guilty of an offence and subjected to a community service order—people who have behaved badly and been given punishment, but who behave badly again by breaking the community service order or equivalent restriction. The rest of us are still expected to say, ``There, there, dear, carry on receiving your benefits and living off the taxpayer. Your living standards shouldn't be affected. We don't mind if you behave badly, and are a scourge on your estate, while all your neighbours go out to work, pay their taxes and do the decent thing; they don't vandalise cars or any of the things that you consider to be all in a day's non-work.'' Why should we tolerate that? It is infuriating that a certain element in our society believes that there is no punishment that they should feel obliged to respect, or which should apply to them. I am glad that the Government are adopting a tougher approach. However, many Labour Members, if they had been in Parliament during the 18 years before this Government took office, would have said how wrong it was if the previous Conservative Government had tried to introduce a variety of tougher penalties. I am glad that there is a greater consensus on the need to deal severely with people whose anti-social behaviour is abusive. It is heartbreaking to read the letters of constituents who live primarily, although not exclusively, on council estates, where social problems are greater. Their lives are made a misery by local tearaways, but they do not have the choice of moving away. Council houses in Bromsgrove are impossible to get hold of because there are so few of them. It does not matter that mum goes out to work all day and dad goes out to work all night to keep the roof over their heads if they cannot sleep when they get home because the next-door neighbour is a nuisance. There should be penalties to make neighbours behave properly.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is right and proper that the Government should introduce tougher punishments. One of the best ways of doing that is to attack people's income. Louts believe that they can ignore the law without the fear of their income being affected. That is galling not only to people who are directly affected by their behaviour, but to those who are picking up the bill without anyone saying: ``Enough is enough.''
<P>
I applaud the Government for proceeding on that basis. However, I smile wryly when I think that they may end up like previous Conservative Governments, whose reasonable and right intentions were prevented from taking full effect because the terms of the European convention on human rights meant that their policy was not legal. What advice has the Under-Secretary received to suggest that she can put a stop to that? Former Conservative Ministers were asked whether their new regulations were watertight under British and European law. Even with the best brains in the civil service to consider the consequences of a Bill, right and proper intentions were prevented from taking full effect on numerous and frustrating occasions because other people, who left a democratic deficit in their wake, told us that we could not proceed.
<P>
The tougher measures that the Conservatives introduced to deal with asylum seekers encountered a problem in the domestic courts. No doubt, the Labour Government wish that our asylum legislation had been successful, because more asylum seekers are now flooding in. However, the primary thrust to stop the Government this time will probably come from Europe, which will be extremely frustrating. This is a democratically elected Labour Government. Labour Members are proud of their success at the general election; they are only too fond of telling us that their majority of 179 gives them a democratic mandate and that they are the masters now. Galling as that might be, I accept that the Labour Government have the right to do as they think fit during the period for which they are elected—albeit no longer. What I find so obnoxious and infuriating is that, despite their intentions and their democratic mandate, it is likely that the provisions will be referred for a judgment under the European convention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not want to appear to disagree with my hon. Friend, but it is not just a question of being Labour, Conservative or Liberal; it is a question of the right of the Commons in conjunction with the other place to determine the law of the land. That is what is at stake. I happen to believe that the rights of the Commons are greater than the collective rights of individual political parties.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope we are not getting into a discussion about the convention. Hon. Members should stick to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Yes, Mr. O'Brien. However, my hon. Friend is right. Even if I disagreed with the Government's intention, I would not refute their right to pursue that course, but I strongly object to the likely prospect of the Government's proposals being made the subject of a challenge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> On the question of a challenge, it would be interesting to hear the Under-Secretary say what the Government's position would be in the event of a successful challenge. It is open to the Government not to remedy the procedure under the Human Rights Act and to insist on the will of the Commons.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> It would very exciting if the Under-Secretary were to say that the Government would be willing to proceed in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West raised an interesting point, to which I hope the Under-Secretary will reply, but as I understand it, under the convention, that right is not open to the Government.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friends have greater knowledge of the law than I do, so I shall let them make their own points rather than answering them. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would oblige us with a specific answer to that point and say whether the Government would proceed on such a basis or whether the European convention would take precedent.
<P>
Our concern is about how much homework the Government have done to be secure that their stated intentions are deliverable. Considering the matters to which my hon. Friends have referred, it seems that, without being subject to any further trial or judicial process, the docking of benefit could be challenged under the convention. We all know why the convention says that it is wrong to do wicked things to people without due process of law being applied. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, when the convention was drawn up, most of Europe fell behind the iron curtain and terrible and wicked things did happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> And continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> As my hon. Friend says, they continue to do so. All hon. Members would want to do their utmost to put a stop to such things happening to citizens of other countries. What is infuriating is that such a simple statement—one of the pillars of the convention—should now be used to put a stop to a wholly democratic country trying to bring order and reasonableness to its state benefit provisions. That cannot be right or fair, but it could become reality. Under the previous Conservative Government, we saw how reasonable measures, which we thought were straightforward, could be challenged on certain grounds. As my hon. Friends said, that may be the most obvious ground for challenge, but there may be other grounds. Those other grounds may be more partial, but they could take account of the social spectrum of those on benefit. The other parts of the convention could be used to claim discrimination because of the racial origins of many of those to whom it could apply.
<P>
Although it is not a racist provision, a skewed sample of people who were not representative of the British population might find themselves falling foul of the Government's intentions. Again, it cannot be right that the Government's democratic mandate should be turned over in that way. It would not be fair or proper. The provision must at least take account of the fact that we live in a society that expects a lot from the state. Many people live off the state for their entire lives and a great many more expect an income from the state for at least a time. That expectation is deemed to be much more of a right than it used to be.
<P>
That seems to be a right irrespective of any responsibility. The Prime Minister is fond of the catch phrase ``rights and responsibilities'', but the expectation that a decent standard of living should be provided for all citizens should go hand in hand with the expectation of behaviour and responsibility. We must try to balance people's expectations against their rights and responsibilities. We cannot continue to allow people to have such huge expectations of the state without showing a sense of responsibility to it and to those who provide their income. We should do whatever we can to redress that balance. 
<P>
I wish the Government well in their determination to put that provision in a form that cannot be challenged by the European court. We look forward with interest to the Minister reassuring us that she and her civil servants can find a way forward that is waterproof.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friends and I congratulate the Government on trying to force responsibility on those who, until now, have been largely irresponsible. However, I also share their concern about the European convention on human rights. I was cheered when the European Court made judgments such as the Barber judgment on pensions, because I felt certain that it would take a lot longer for United Kingdom law to bring into effect the equal rights for pensioners that resulted from the Barber case.
<P>
Nevertheless, some extraordinarily perverse judgments have been made by the court. Indeed, the Government are now suffering because of one on the winter heating allowance, due to the difficulty of discovering the names of those gentlemen aged between 60 and 65 to whom they would otherwise not expect to pay the allowance. The Government's intention, laudable though it may have been, has been distorted by that judgment. The problem that the official Opposition have identified is that the Government have the same potential for making perverse decisions. I have sympathy with the arguments of the hon. Member for Burton and of probation officers. They are highlighting the grounds for discrimination cases that will inevitably be brought to the courts, and which will subvert the Government's objectives.
<P>
My hon. Friends have discussed people in breach of their community service orders who receive benefits and are not working, and those who are in breach and are working. I am no lawyer, but it does not take much imagination to work out that there is a basis for discrimination. The proposal provides lawyers with many opportunities to argue their cases.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
 It is rare for pensioners to breach community service orders, but if they did so their state pensions might be reduced.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Lady would have been unaware of the fact that we intended the pilot to apply to those aged 18 to 59.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am hugely relieved. I am grateful for the information; pensioners and pension funds were beginning to express concern that they would be asked to make up the difference. I will be delighted to have received that information from the Under-Secretary.
<P>
Hardship payments will be available to those on benefit. The payments might be made as vouchers, but the docked benefits would be replaced. Questions might be asked about the vouchers were fair, which would be—dare I suggest it?—similar to the issue of vouchers for asylum seekers. The Labour party has debated that difficulty. One can envisage a logical argument being advanced about what is hardship and about what vouchers will be provided.
<P>
Probation officers tell me that benefits may be docked at different rates, resulting in more discrimination. Local standards on the level of benefit to dock might vary. I would be happy for the Under-Secretary to intervene and reassure me about that; I am sure that she will be able to do so.
<P>
Probation officers also commented on the many people with difficult addictions, such as drugs, gambling and alcohol. I would like to be able to exclude the mentally ill from the category, but many of them live in hostels and some are subject to community service orders. If they breach the orders, the probation officers rightly ask who will pay the hostel. The issue might again become one of discrimination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Secretary of State has said that the Bill is compliant, and the Under-Secretary will give the reasons for that. It might be discovered, following a court decision, that it is not. I suggest that the Committee should judge the clause and the amendments on whether they are just, rather than on whether they are compliant. The court cannot strike down the law, and the remedy against a court decision is the will of the House to override it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that guidance but I suspect, given the contributions from my other hon. Friends, that there is a legal argument regarding that point. I would be happy to hear what the Under-Secretary had to say on the subject. As I said, I suspect that we have opened up a minefield by bringing the convention into UK law. It is now much easier for people to take human rights cases to the British courts. Until now, the cost and length of time involved in taking a case to the European Court was a deterrent against pursuing such cases.
<P>
I revert to the difficulty that people in hostels may have. If their benefits are reduced, how will the hostels many of which are charities or are paid for by social services—be recompensed if rent cannot be paid? The prevention officers have highlighted problems and I am sure that we will find many more as we consider the Bill. It is our duty to find such problems and the Minister agrees that she expects to answer many such questions. There are many routes of appeal under the European convention on human rights, but we have managed to identify a few that are based on discrimination rather than on any other aspect of the court process. We must investigate as many of the difficulties that we can perceive in the clauses to minimise the number of routes to appeal under the convention. That is as much for the benefit of the Government as for that of anyone else.
<P>
As many such problems as possible must be discussed and clarified so that there is a proper record in Hansard when Government lawyers defend relevant cases in the British courts. Of course, everyone recognises that what is written in Hansard is, theoretically, not necessarily taken into account in legal decisions. Without wishing to cast aspersions on the courts, I believe that they would wish to know the intentions expressed when the legislation was discussed. Having defined a number of aspects that we already see as potential difficulties in routes for complaints under the European convention, I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have had an interesting debate, although it has been somewhat confused in places. I hope that I can explain our approach while reassuring hon. Members that the statement made under section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is not included in the Bill lightly. It is there after a rigorous investigation and after having received legal advice from departmental lawyers throughout the Government. The inclusion of the section 19 statement should not be seen as something that happens in every Bill, as there is an entire process behind it. As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, I have refused to publish the legal advice, for obvious reasons. However, in response to hon. Members' point, I have tried to be as open as I can about the Government's thinking on these matters, to demonstrate why the Bill and these clauses comply with the European convention on human rights. We cannot and would not want to prevent individuals or lawyers from testing that, but that does not mean that we do not have rigorous defences to any challenges that might be made.
<P>
From some of the comments that have been made in Committee, pessimistic in tone as they were, one might imagine that there is no conditionality in the benefit system at present. Judging by some of the contributions that have been made, one might imagine that conditionality in the benefit system was already illegal, yet it has been a feature of the system since its creation. Rights to benefits have never been unconditional. It is not new to ask people to carry out desirable actions before benefits are paid to them. The hon. Member for New Forest, West mentioned a few conditions, the most well known of which is probably the condition that one must be available for and actively seeking work to qualify for JSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Under-Secretary is correct, but she is seeking to take that principle a significant step forward. Most of the conditions relate to the receipt of benefit and the requirement to satisfy certain conditions in order to qualify. Some relate to educational qualifications, doing a particular type of work, doing homework or regular attendance, but the clause takes that further and lays down a condition that is not relevant to the benefit. The Under-Secretary should recognise that, even though I believe that the Government are doing the right thing.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> This is about rights and responsibilities and the Government's new contract for welfare. We do not believe that receipt of benefits should be unconditional. We do not have a problem saying that the receipt of benefits is a contract between the individual and the state, and that benefits should not be seen as being available unconditionally, regardless of the individual's behaviour.
<P>
I do not believe that conditionality would be opposed. Many of the discussions that we have had to date on this subject have assumed that the benefit sanction is a punishment, which should be administered by the court, but our firm belief is that it is not a punishment and that the changes do not affect the court system. The court will continue to consider what punishments are appropriate if an individual breaches a community sentence. This measure is an additional benefit conditionality. When the punishment is determined by the court, it will be made clear to the individual that if he or she—mainly he—breaches the community sentence, benefit sanctions will operate. If the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is right to say that the Home Office is tightening up the way in which community sentences are administered so as to reduce from three to two the number of unacceptable breaches that may occur before a breach is officially established, then, after the first breach, it will be the duty of the probation service to write to the individual and say: ``One more breach and the benefit sanction that you were warned about when your community sentence was passed will be enforced.''
<P>
We will not put the scheme into effect nationwide without running trials to prove our belief that the measure will act as a deterrent against the breach of community orders. That is the idea behind the pilot schemes. However, there is no point doing that if the individual is not warned about the consequences of behaviour that continues to breach community punishments, especially as community orders are often handed out as an alternative to prison sentences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an interesting point, but the court might accuse the Under-Secretary of engaging in semantics by saying that it is not a punishment. The note from the Library puts it well. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Receipt of . . . benefits has always been conditional upon claimants satisfying certain conditions, but these have tended to be linked to conditions of entitlement rather than behavioural conditions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Lady is referring to behaviour. The courts might consider that to be a departure.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Far be it from me to suggest that lawyers engage in semantics. I say merely that it is an extension of benefit conditionality, not a punishment. Sanctions are already in place in the benefit system. The sanctions on JSA for those who deliberately leave employment can stretch up to 26 weeks. Sanctions in one pilot scheme will be extended in April, and will become conditional for people to attend an interview about their employment prospects and their employability when they receive any of the benefits involved in that scheme, The general view is that benefit rights come with responsibilities. It is another example of our extending rights and responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that the courts will therefore have no power to have regard to the reduction of benefit?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that when someone on JSA under 25 years old fails to attend their new deal gateway work place or fails to attend a training course, the courts should decide what the benefit sanction should be? Of course not. The benefit system has always included the ability to sanction people in certain circumstances. This is no different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Lady says that there is no difference. However, the trigger is the court decision to impose a community service order. The courts should therefore still have jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> No, that is not the trigger. The trigger is the established facts—for instance, when the probation service notifies the court that an individual has, by choice, breached a community sentence order. Shortly, the breach will be that the individual has had two unacceptable absences from whatever community sentence was imposed by the court. Such sentences are often imposed as an alternative to prison, and a breach of those conditions caused by not attending will trigger the benefit sanction.
<P>
We envisage that, after the second unacceptable breach, the probation service will have a duty to notify the Benefits Agency and the court that that breach has occurred. We believe that, under the pilot scheme, the sanction should be four weeks. It will be put in place quickly. However, that is completely separate to the court system, under which the individual is called before the court and, in the light of the individual's behaviour the court decides what to do about the community sentence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked how many offenders who are given community sentences were sentenced for a breach. In other words, he wants to know how many times the probation service gets it wrong. Of the 28,500 proceedings for breach of community sentence in 1998, which are the most recent figures available, as many as 28,100 were found to have breached the conditions of the sentence.
<P>
In general, it is not hard to establish whether a breach has occurred. It is fairly easy to establish as a fact whether someone has twice not turned up for unacceptable reasons or has behaved violently or abusively. It is rare, as the hon. Gentleman can see from the figures, that people are unreasonably accused of breaching their community service. The benefits sanction will be imposed before a case goes to court, but in the few cases in which it is found that there has been no breach, the benefits sanction and any moneys that have been stopped for breach of community sentence will be restored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I asked the Under-Secretary specifically about other adjustments. Would a person who was found to be innocent be compensated for loans or HP payments?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> If the court decides that an offender has not breached an order, benefit will be restored and arrears will be paid for the period of the sanction, which will be four weeks. As with employment sanctions, compensation will not be paid, but the Benefits Agency will quickly restore benefit. Compensation will only be available if the offender's losses are a result of maladministration.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Burton asked whether sufficient warning would be given. As I said, when handing down a sentence, the court will make it clear that a benefits sanction will apply if there is a breach. After a first unacceptable non-attendance, the probation service will write to and no doubt see the individual involved and warn him explicitly that another unacceptable lack of attendance will invoke the four-week benefits sanction. I hope she accepts that that is sufficient warning. We will be testing in the pilots to see whether that will have the appropriate effect in deterring a breach of a community order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On a matter of fact, did the hon. Lady say that when magistrates hand down a community service order, they will automatically inform people that they may lose their benefits if the order is breached?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes, that is the intention. The sanction is to act as an effective deterrent. Clearly it cannot be a deterrent if a large number of people are ignorant of it. We are not introducing the sanction for the sake of it. We want to pilot the scheme so that we can prove that it will be an effective deterrent. It is important that the consequences for benefit entitlement of a breach of a community sentence are laid fairly and squarely before the individual when the sentence is handed out and when it is first breached. We will be looking closely at how that works in the pilot schemes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry to come back again, but has the Magistrates Association commented on the sanction, or is it waiting until the pilot schemes are over?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I cannot answer that question off the top of my head, but I shall furnish the hon. Lady with an appropriate reply.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Burton also raised the issue of evaluating the pilot schemes. It is important that we do that, not for the sake of it, but because we believe that the sanction will be effective. However, we shall not introduce the sanction if the pilots prove that it has no effect, or that it is detrimental. We shall evaluate it in the usual rigorous way and collect the relevant statistics. The evaluation, which will be made by independent external researchers, is being planned. The exercise will be wide ranging, and will consider the practical contacts between the parties involved—the Benefits Agency, the probation service, magistrates and benefits officers. It will also consider the views of offenders, and any impact on their behaviour, including the effect on compliance with community sentences, re-offending, job seeking, benefit claiming and participation in training programmes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned control areas. There will be only three or four pilots. Those parts of the country not included in the pilot phase will provide us with any number of controls to study. The intention is not to act in an underhand way—the evaluation will be rigorous and proper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): The purpose behind the evaluation is to work out whether the measure would act as a deterrent. However, the question is really whether the Under-Secretary, in evaluating the pilot areas, will simply assess whether the deterrent effect has been successful or whether she will also consider evidence that the withdrawal of benefit has created social and criminal problems. How will the two factors be evaluated?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The evaluation will take account of all the factors. The hon. Gentleman continues to assume that people who have already been before the courts because of their behaviour will break the law even more if they are denied benefit. Out of 130,000 people given community sentences—often as an alternative to prison—30,000 breached the sentences. We owe it to the rest of society to try to ensure that they do not think that community sentences are a soft option, and that they can opt in and out of them when they feel like it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> If the plan is to make community service orders a non-soft option, why is the Under-Secretary not giving the power to the courts? She is trying to treat the issue separately as a way of avoiding obligations under the European convention.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That is not what I said, and the hon. Gentleman should not put words into my mouth. Community sentences should not be an optional extra. The Home Office has already studied ways of tightening up the way in which community sentences are administered because there are breaches—30,000 of 130,000 community sentences have been breached. Hon. Members should not be proud of the figures; as a society we should be seeking to reduce them. The idea of benefit conditionality is to provide what we believe—and what the pilots will prove—to be an effective extra deterrent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Under-Secretary assure me that, if the pilots produce evidence that those who breach orders and lose benefit are tempted into further crime, she will not abandon the powers, but will look to ensure that such people are vigorously punished?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We are not talking about reducing re-offending rates among prisoners by 100 per cent. Those who turn to crime while subject to community sentences, or after release from prison, will be subject—as always—to the full rigours of the law. That issue is separate to the one that we are debating. We are attempting to establish an extra deterrent, which we hope will send to people subject to community sentences a message that society is not prepared unconditionally to give them benefit, whatever their subsequent behaviour. That is the simple idea that we are establishing, and which we hope the pilots will prove.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There was a great deal of discussion—which I suspect could continue for hours—of the European convention on human rights and about the articles of which Opposition Members thought that our proposals might be in breach. As I said, we are confident that the measures before us are compliant. If we were not, the Secretary of State would not have made the statement under section 19 of the 1998 Act. I have given parliamentary answers to questions on particular articles, and I do not intend to go into to much more detail, as I would begin to publish our legal advice in bits and bobs. I hope, however, that I shall be able to give some reassurance to hon. Members on them.
<P>
There has been a great deal of talk about the measure discriminating against ethnic minorities because they are more likely to be unemployed. In case hon. Members had not realised, I should remind them that we intend the benefits sanction, both in the pilots and subsequently in the entire country if it proves to have a deterrent effect, to apply to income support, jobseeker's allowance and the training allowances, which are the equivalent of JSA and apply when people are on particular employment courses. We do not intend at this stage to include benefits such as housing or council tax benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In an earlier intervention on the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), the Under-Secretary told us that the pilots would apply only to people aged from 18 to 59. If the Government proceed to roll the scheme out nationwide, will they review the age limit and consider increasing it?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We are not intending to switch the basis on which the pilots are conducted when we extend them, assuming that they make a case for extension, although we do not want to forfeit our right to do so. However, I do not envisage that we will extend the pilots either to those below 18 or over 59. We do not even envisage the sanction being more than four weeks—we assume that that will be appropriate. The powers allow us to extend it if there is overwhelming evidence that it would be useful to do so. In advance—inasmuch as we can know in advance—our intentions are as I have stated.
<P>
I stick with what I said about article 6. If an individual in whose name a breach notification is sent denies that he has had two unacceptable breaches, he will be able to go to the court to say so. He will also be able to appeal against the benefit sanction through the appeals service—the usual procedure that applies to all benefit sanctions. Given that right of appeal, we believe that article 6 is not breached.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> While that procedure is going through, will his entitlement be stopped?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> His entitlement and the four-week sanction will take effect, as all other sanctions in the benefits system take effect from when they are imposed. If an appeal upheld his view, all that money would be reimbursed. That is the case with all other appeals in the benefits system. The benefit is stopped, but if the appeals process finds in favour of the claimant, it is restored, and all arrears are paid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us more about the matters that are likely to come before such an administrative appeal. What issues will be explored during the appeal? Will the court, in its turn, be able to deal with the same issues when it considers the referral of a breach, or will it be more constrained? Will such matters be dealt with in the detail of the regulations? If so, it would be useful to get some sense of what can and cannot be included. Surely, matters will be brought before such an appeal process that are different to those involved in any other appeal in the benefits system.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is not for me to pronounce in advance on matters about which individual claimants may feel that it is right to appeal. The only issue to which a benefit sanction could apply is a breach of the community sentence. That is a matter for the courts to decide. I presume that appeals will concern matters of fact, such as a case of mistaken identity, or a notice that has been applied to the wrong person. However, I cannot speculate further on that in advance of the regulations.
<P>
Article 7, which stipulates that there should be no punishment without law, is not relevant to the measure, which involves not punishment, but entitlement to benefits. I have answered parliamentary questions about the subject. As for the idea that the measure discriminates against ethnic minorities because they are more likely to be unemployed, this is a benefit measure that will affect only those who are on benefits. The position of ethnic minorities is therefore no different to that of other people. Different treatment of those who are in breach of their sentences and receive state benefits has the defensible and legitimate aim of ensuring that rights to benefit are conditional on fulfilment of responsibilities, and is therefore in the public interest.
<P>
Article 8, which was seen by Opposition Members as a potential hurdle, does not guarantee a right to benefits from the state. Most benefits are not regarded as possessions under article 1 of the first protocol. We accept that we may face legal challenges, but believe that the proposals will stand up to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Those were not my concerns; I was concerned about the justice of the measure, and the Minister has persuaded me about that. However, it would assist the Committee if she would answer a hypothetical question about the challenges that she mentioned. If a successful challenge were to be mounted on the grounds that she has just dismissed, would she be minded to adopt the fast-track procedure that is laid down in the Human Rights Act 1998, or would she advise the House to leave the law unamended?

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> You would not expect me to answer a hypothetical question, Mr. O'Brien. However, I will say that the court can strike down primary legislation under the 1998 Act. It is then up to the Government whether, or how, to amend legislation to reflect that decision. That is all that the hon. Gentleman will get out of me on that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Returning to the point that the Minister made just before she gave way to my hon. Friend, was she saying that in order to comply with X v. Netherlands and Muller v. Austria, only non-contributory benefits will be struck down under the Government's proposals?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That is a technical matter. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman, because I do not want to meander around it and say something that may be wrongly construed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Heaven forbid that that should happen, but the Under-Secretary has already meandered slightly in that her written answer made a comparison with the jobseeker's allowance, which is contributory and, therefore, could be regarded as a possession. She has taken that little trip down the river and perhaps she will paddle back.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The intention, which is defensible under the European convention on human rights, is to include income support, both forms of jobseeker's allowance and training allowances.
<P>
I was meandering to the point that I wanted to emphasise for the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. Only the courts will consider the facts of an alleged breach. The benefit appeal tribunal will consider only matters of fact, such as identity and the appropriate rate of benefit stoppage. There will be no crossover or dual activity between the court and the appeal system.
<P>
Article 14 is the final article about which Opposition Members were worried.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> There are also two protocols—the seventh protocol and the first protocol.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I dealt with protocol 1 when discussing possessions.
<P>
Article 14 deals with prohibition of discrimination. The policy changes are part of our reform of the welfare state on the basis of a contract between the citizen and the state and between rights and responsibilities. We want to align rights more closely to benefits and particular responsibilities.
<P>
We want not only to achieve better compliance with community sentences but to reflect the view that it is not fair that offenders who breach community sentences should have the same rights to benefits as those who comply with them. We should always bear in mind the fact that people who do not comply hold the remedy in their hands. All they have to do, be they black or white and wherever they live, is to comply with the terms of their community sentences. If they do not breach their community sentences, they will not be subject to any sanction on their benefits.
<P>
We believe that the measure does not breach article 14 because of unjustified different treatment of those on benefits compared with others. Any different treatment that may arise will be justified because its objective is in the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This debate has been useful in putting on the record various aspects of the way in which the clause will work, and we are grateful to the Minister for her full response. However, I made it clear when moving the amendment that it was not a probing amendment, and I want briefly to pick up one or two of the threads of the debate and the Minister's response.
<P>
The provision is predicated on a presumption of a breach taking place, and that presumption is being used as the trigger for withdrawing benefit. That is the basis on which the Minister is arguing that the measure is separate from the courts—
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that a probation officer might erroneously presume, without evidence, that someone has breached a community service order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am saying that that seems to have occurred in at least 400 cases in which the courts decided that sentences should not be given.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Out of 28,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister says out of 28,000, but if the provision were on the statute book today, 400 people would have had their benefits withdrawn unfairly and incorrectly. A presumption would have been made, ahead of the courts' assessment of the circumstances, that benefits should be removed.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman also admit that . . . under the Bill, had the errors in those 400 cases been discovered in court, all the arrears would be returned to the individuals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary also acknowledge, given the response that she gave to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, that the knock-on consequence of additional indebtedness that may result from a failure to honour loan repayments is not taken into account?
<P>
The focus is not on those whom the courts hold to have breached an order, but on the small number of people—according to statistics—whom the courts decide are not in breach.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I remind my hon. Friend that in its evidence, Association of Chief Officers of Probation expressed its deep concern that additional punishment would be imposed on the basis of allegations. My hon. Friend has, therefore, made a good point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. However, the Under-Secretary will protest that this is not a punishment, and that it is about sending a signal to offenders that they must not breach their orders. She has rightly told us that the courts will warn people about that in the first instance.
<P>
However, there is a presumption that, through administrative procedures—through the decision of a probation officer, not a court—someone could have their benefit withdrawn or reduced for a period of at least four weeks, or up to 26 weeks under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I should be happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I said in response to the hon. Gentleman's questions that we intended to limit the benefits action to four weeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> When the Under-Secretary reads the Official Report of these proceedings, she will notice that I talked about four weeks, but then said that the Bill gives the Minister the power to apply the sanction for 26 weeks. That is all I said. I did not say that the Government were planning to do that. The Under-Secretary is quite right in saying what she has just said. However, I would be grateful if she would reflect on what I actually said, rather than on what she thinks I said. [Interruption.] I felt that that needed to be put as delicately as possible.
<P>
I shall move on from that contrary point to others that are equally contrary but need to be stated. The amendment would put in place a much fairer arrangement, whereby an offender who may have breached an order would at least have the benefit enjoyed by all other alleged offenders of the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. All that we ask is for that to be established; for that reason we have tabled these amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall be brief. The Under-Secretary has gone a long way towards allaying our fears. However, if she sticks to the mantra that this is not a punishment, merely a condition, it will not be judge-proof. Furthermore, when she decides to write to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, she may be able to answer some of the points raised in relation to article 14. The general point of whether a contributory benefit is a possession has many implications for the effectiveness of the measure. We look forward to the written response to that question.
<P>
In conclusion, I turn to the worries expressed by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. Four hundred people out of a little under 30,000 represents about 1 per cent. One would get better odds of obtaining justice before a Taliban court. It does not seem that a great wrong is about to be righted. The Minister has said that she will restrict the measure to four weeks, and on that basis 30 per cent. of community service orders being breached is completely unacceptable. The amendment is an important way to reduce that figure significantly. We apologise for spending so much time on it. I hope that the Under-Secretary understands that we simply wanted to explore the question of the European convention on human rights. We do not intend to spend so long on the remaining clauses, with the possible exception of one set of amendments.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This simple amendment builds on the Government's proposal and fits in well with a breach of any of the conditions. I do not regard it as particularly draconian. It fits in with the Minister's view that most of the conditions are easy to determine: one either turns up or does not turn up; one either engages in violence or does not engage in violence; one either refuses to do the order or does not refuse to do it. Therefore, in many ways the amendment is belt and braces.
<P>
Why should these offenders be different from others who are in receipt of benefits? The answer goes back to what the Under-Secretary said on the previous set of amendments. We could repeat many of the arguments, but I have no intention of doing that. She said that it was not a punishment but a condition. On the next set of amendments I shall spend a little time trying to extract from the Under-Secretary what the new conditions are.
<P>
If a person is in receipt of benefit, why should we, you, Mr. O'Brien, or the Under-Secretary have to shell out money so that that person can defy a lawful order of the court? It cannot be put any better than that. I am not in the business of funding people who break the law. The amendment says, and I shall restrict it for the moment to community service orders, ``You are not on the same level as anybody receiving benefit. You have been given a sentence by the court. It is an alternative to prison. It is not something light; it is something onerous. It is a way for you to pay your debt to society and make a recompense to it or to an individual for the wrong that you have done. We accept that during that period you will be on benefit, and in many ways we are making a contribution towards you. You are therefore doubly obligated to ensure that you turn up, do not engage in violence, obey lawful instructions and serve your time. If you don't, we are not going to pay for you.'' Under the amendment, the provision would apply where a person failed to comply with any condition. It would eliminate grey areas and establish the matter in black and white. It would require people to turn up, and would establish what would happen if they did not.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was right to say that there is no point in being bashful. It should be made crystal clear to those who are sentenced to community orders that they will lose benefits for, say, a month, if they step out of line. I do not know whether she meant that the matter should be dealt with by the judge or the magistrate, but it should not be dealt with outside that forum.
<P>
To some extent, the amendment is a probing amendment, and the Under-Secretary went some way towards answering the questions that it raises during the previous sitting. The provision should be unambiguous, and the amendment would establish in black and white the principle ``two slips and it's cut''.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendment No. 159 would have no effect on the clause, which provides for benefit sanctions to be imposed at the point at which an offender is referred to court for breach of a community sentence. The probation service refers to court those offenders who have failed to comply with the requirements of their community sentence without good reason, and I hope I can reassure the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar on the behaviour in question.
<P>
The national standards for the supervision of offenders in the community set out the requirements for the supervision and conduct of offenders and the procedures on non-compliance. At the first appointment with an offender, the supervising officer must provide him with an oral and written explanation of what is expected of him during the period of supervision. That will include notifying changes of address, attending when required and arriving on time for an appointment or work. The offender will also be told about, and given a copy of instructions on, the standards of behaviour required. Those instructions prohibit, for example, violent or aggressive behaviour; conduct or language likely to offend probation staff, others under supervision or members of the public; and wilful or persistent non-co-operation or other behaviour designed to frustrate the purpose of the offender's or others' orders.
<P>
In the event of a serious failure to comply, such as violence towards a supervising officer, the probation service may initiate breach proceedings at any stage in the order. Currently, national standards require offenders to be returned to court no later than on a third unacceptable failure to comply. However, as we have said, new standards will come into force in April that will require breach proceedings to commence no later than on the second such failure.
<P>
Where breach action is not taken after a first unacceptable failure to comply, the offender is formally warned of the likely consequences of any further unacceptable behaviour. It would be acceptable to miss an appointment so that, say, a job interview or a medical appointment might be attended, provided that prior notice were given and verification subsequently provided. It would be unacceptable to forget to attend confirmed appointments, or be unable to attend, because of alcohol or drug abuse. Indeed, it would also be unacceptable to attend under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
<P>
The amendment would have no effect on the measure that links the described compliance with community sentences to the receipt of certain social security benefits. I hope that I have explained to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar the type of behaviour that would constitute a breach, and reassured him in respect of his probing amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Under-Secretary has been her customary helpful self. Thanks to one of her earlier speeches, my original speech was shortened by about 10 minutes. The Government's general approach is welcome and, in many ways, they are already doing what I am seeking to achieve. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
