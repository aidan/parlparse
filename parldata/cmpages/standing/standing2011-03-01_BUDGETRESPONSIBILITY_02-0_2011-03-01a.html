                           </span> May I add to the plaudits that
we heard this morning with regards to your benevolent chairmanship, Dr

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
comment on amendments 12 and 13, tabled by my hon. Friends the Members
for Bristol East and for Nottingham East. Amendment 12 places a duty on
the Office for Budget Responsibility to examine and report on the
impact of Treasury policy on the duties of the Secretary of State under
section 2 of the Child Poverty Act 2010. I wholly concur with my hon.
Friend the Member for Nottingham East, who moved the amendment. He said
that if we are serious about making 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 42<a class="bkMark" name="Column42">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a difference in society then there can be no better cause than the
eradication of child poverty. To do that we must ensure that the
targets and ultimate goal in the 2010 Act are met. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Bristol East reminded us earlier, the current Government
have yet to publish a national child poverty strategy, so there is
nothing in place at the moment to ensure that the requirements of the
Act are implemented. What would be better than a duty placed on the OBR
to ensure that that happens?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Nottingham East so eloquently stated, it is
important that we move away from the mindset of structures, processes
and inputs that sometimes become the dominant force in much of what we
do towards a culture of outcomes and putting people first. I say that
in a non-partisan fashion as we can all be guilty of that, regardless
of party politics. The important thing is to recognise it so that we
make the changes to bring about the difference. On the basis of my
positive outlook and reasoned argument, I am sure that the Minister
will now discard her shackles, denounce her fetish and accept the
amendments as tabled—or perhaps not.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Seriously,
child poverty is a scandal. I recently met John Dickie, the head of the
Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland. I was shocked to learn that
despite the country’s undoubted wealth, a staggering one in four
of our children live in poverty. The latest official statistics suggest
that recent progress in reducing child poverty has stalled. I fear that
with the Government’s deficit reduction measures, that situation
will only get
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have little doubt that we all agree with the objective of eliminating
child poverty by 2020. That is vital to the well-being of the country
and a true mark of a decent and civilised society. Why not give that
objective the credibility that it deserves and place it firmly within
the remit of the OBR?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 13
places a duty on the OBR to examine and report on the impartiality of
the local government finance settlement in England. This is an
important amendment due to the highly partisan nature of this issue,
regardless, to be fair, of which Government are in power. With the
abolition in England of the Audit Commission, which is a great mistake
by this Government, there is now a significant gap in the independent,
authoritative and impartial assessment of local government finance in
England. That contrasts sharply with the situation in Scotland in which
the Accounts Commission is highly regarded by both local and national
Government and works well. With the abolition of the Audit Commission
in England, it makes sense to place a duty on the OBR to conduct an

local authorities of England spend billions of pounds each year,
despite the best efforts of the Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government to slash their budgets by 56%. Unlike many colleagues
in this room, I have never had the privilege or honour of serving as a
member of a local authority—some colleagues present have acted
as leaders of councils and conveners. I would not, however, wish to be
a councillor in the coming financial year, because incredibly difficult
and painful decisions have to be made. I am sorry to dissent from the
remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston, but the level of
pain will be much worse under this Government than it would have been
under a Labour Government, because of the Secretary of State’s

is interesting that the well-known hard-left newspaper, <em>The
Times</em>, which is owned by the Marxist revolutionary, Rupert Murdoch,
made it clear a few weeks ago, just before Christmas, that the 10 local
authorities in England that suffered the most brutal cuts were all
Labour-controlled councils in the midlands or the north of England,
while the councils that had the best settlement—indeed, one or
two received a rise in their funding settlement—were all under
Liberal and Conservative control in the south of
England.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000038">&#160;</a>

larger cuts inflicted on them than Liberal and Tory councils, but if we
look back over history, we will see that those councils were starved of
money. Certainly, my own council—Leeds city council—had
by far the lowest settlement of any of the metropolitan councils when
it was under a Tory-Liberal administration. Neighbouring
administrations as close as Wakefield and, of course, Manchester had
almost double the settlement per head of
Leeds.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000039">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Secretary of State has many words for it.
There is a fascinating debate to be had about funding settlements for
local authorities over the past 30 or 40 years. I believe that it would
be within the bounds of the debate to say that we had exactly the same
problems in the 1980s, when urban, northern councils were starved of
funding. The motivation behind some of those decisions in the 1980s was
political, on the part of the Secretaries of State for the Environment,
as they were known at the time—before a fancy new title came
along. In the 1990s and the early part of the past decade, under a
Labour Government, a rebalancing of the deficit that those local
authorities had suffered from was absolutely right. I can assure the
hon. Gentleman that retribution and revenge were not behind the actions
of Mr Prescott—now Lord Prescott—and others on the
funding settlement, which is not the case with the Secretary of State
for Communities and Local
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moving
on to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Newton Abbot—the
role of the OBR—I was lucky enough to go on an exchange
programme organised by the British-American Parliamentary Group in
September last year. Its work will be familiar, and many Government
Members will have the opportunity to go to the United States on that
useful exchange programme, which is funded by the State Department and
the Foreign Office. I was there with the hon. Member for Bristol West
who, unfortunately, does not seem to have been able to join us yet in
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
had an opportunity to meet with the US Congress and to get a better
understanding of the role of the Congressional Budget Office and the
other scrutiny mechanisms. They have quite a wide remit, in terms of
what they look at in the States, both in the federal set-up and at the
state level. It is correct, as my hon. Friends the Members for
Nottingham East and for Bristol East have said and tried to achieve in
their amendments, to widen the scope of the OBR’s remit
somewhat, but not dramatically. It is probably fair to say that the
local authorities in England spend more collectively than almost any
other Department, except perhaps for the national health service and
the Ministry of Defence—I seek clarification from the Minister
if I have got that
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000044">&#160;</a>

because something works in the US, it will not necessarily work here. I
am not sure how child poverty, important as it is, and local government
can be picked out as the two prime examples. Taking his argument to its
logical conclusion, we should be taking on a number of other things,
but we then get to the point where we are dealing not only with the
Treasury but with a number of other Departments and the situation

is absolutely right for local authorities, given what a huge part of
the Budget they take from the central Government. Local authorities can
also raise their own revenue. One of the key aspects of the OBR is
looking at the financial stability of public institutions, and I can
think of no better example of a public institution with revenue-raising
abilities but an uncertain financial future than the local authorities.
Also useful, as the carefully worded amendment 13 makes clear, is the
fact that such scrutiny would take some of the rhetoric and debate out
of the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Something
I learned from my visit to the US is that individual states are
basically going bankrupt, because they are spending more money than
they are bringing in from their various revenue streams, whether from
federal funding or what they raise through taxation. There is a strong
suspicion—I stick purely to England for the purposes of the
amendment—that many local authorities are in grave danger of
going bankrupt in the next 12 to 24 months. We see local authority
after local authority having to make painful decisions. Even the
smallest local authorities and Conservative councils are having to lay
off huge numbers of staff. It is right to have an independent body to
scrutinise fiscal policies at local authority level and determine,
first, whether they are able to deliver services, and secondly, whether
their projections for expenditure match those for income. I struggle to
understand why the Minister does not think a body can be independent
and take that scrutiny role. If she could clarify what she meant I
would be happy to take another

the work on local authorities, financial sustainability would be looked
at. I am deeply sorry if that is not the

giving way and I am grateful for that answer. We could look at the
settlement that has just happened in the Leeds metropolitan council.
The Audit Commission identified a huge amount of money being wasted in
the purchasing of stationery and so on, simply because council
employees purchased it willy-nilly from a catalogue. If it had been
added to the bulk order, a 70% discount would have been available. The

truly independent OBR would look at the settlement being given and the
structures in place and probably agree that the settlement was
reasonable. The recent amendment to the Leeds budget to save 10% on the
stationery budget to keep the leisure centres open was voted down, but
I am sure that the OBR, with its full independence, would consider that

                           </span> I should like to speak to
amendment 8 and briefly to amendment 12. It is important to examine
sustainability as broadly as possible, without being so broad that it
is outwith the realms of what the Office for Budgetary Responsibility
will do. If we concentrate narrowly on deficit and financial issues,
other issues are, in my view at least, ignored. Much has been made at
various times—we have touched on this briefly—about the
intergenerational issue and intergenerational fairness.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A frequent
argument for reducing the deficit as fast as possible is
intergenerational fairness, but there are other aspects of such
fairness. One is whether more intergenerational unfairness will arise
if people do not have jobs and there is no economic growth. We know
that long-term unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, has a
marked effect on people’s entire future life, and an impact on
such things as social inequality. All parties seem to believe that that
is an important issue, and have sometimes spoken about it passionately.
We must look seriously at how to achieve such fairness. Just using the
words is not enough. My argument on sustainability is that we must look
seriously at a range of issues. Amendment 8 would clarify
sustainability, and provide a definition that would allow us to take
into account a range of matters, including economic growth and
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
12 involves part of the whole issue of intergenerational fairness. If
we are serious about tackling social inequality, as well as family
poverty and particularly child poverty, which is one aspect of that, we
must ensure that we measure and take account of whether we are
achieving what we say we are achieving. Much criticism has been
levelled, particularly at the previous Government, for measuring too
much and having too many targets, but if we do not measure, how will we
ever know whether we have achieved what we want to

able to suggest some—to measure and assess the obligations under
the Child Poverty Act 2010 than by giving the task to the OBR, but, at
the moment, it seems that there is a gap and that that will not be
looked at in as much detail as it

lunch. I shall briefly run through the amendments in turn to address
the issues that have been raised, but I would say to Opposition Members
that they cannot have it all ways. We are about to come on to clause 5,
which deals with the key principles on which the OBR will
run—basically, they are objectivity, transparency and
impartiality—which I believe we would all agree are critical.
However, the amendments are starting to prescribe what the OBR should
do, in spite of the desire to which the hon. Member for Edinburgh East
just referred for it to be completely independent. It cannot be
completely independent if it is being told what to do in the kind of
detail contained in amendments 12 and 13. I shall come to them in a
little more detail in a

multitude of different dimensions. That was debated in the other place.
I want to reassure members of the Committee that the Government intend
to amend the charter to require the OBR to set out how it will approach
sustainability in each of its reports. Hopefully, we can maintain the
OBR’s independence but encourage it to be clear about
sustainability and how it considers

Government policy only—it is not there to look at different
scenarios. Its expertise is in fiscal forecasting. At this stage, it
does not have expertise in distributional analysis, for example, so he
is getting slightly ahead of what it is doing at present. What is
critical is that it is entirely independent and able to do the analysis

examples for inclusion in the covenant report. He made it absolutely
clear that a report could be fully independent even if Parliament laid

the purpose of the OBR is to take a process—the forecasting of

independent body separate from the

always had a problem with the figures’ lack of credibility. We
would get to each Budget and the figures would be presented in the Red

Bill sets up an Office for Budget Responsibility, which means that that
forecasting is done by an entirely independent group of people. Of
course, it needs to work with the Treasury—it is trying to
assess the impact of Treasury policies contained in a Budget—but
the point is that it is doing that independently. That is why I do not
think it is right for us already to be telling the OBR that it needs to
do explicit, additional
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000078">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> For my benefit, will the Minister clarify that
point? I think she is saying that she is somewhat reluctant explicitly
to give additional powers. Suppose that the wording of the amendment
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East stated that the
office “may also examine” child poverty or local
authorities, rather than “shall also examine”. Would the
Minister be content that that was a suitable form of words that made it
clear that the option was there while also guaranteeing the
independence for the body to make its own
decision?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000084">&#160;</a>

enables the Office for Budget Responsibility to fulfil its duties

to my original comments, although I am conscious that I must make
progress and respond to the points raised by other amendments. We must
allow the OBR to have its independence, and the Bill sets out
the context and the duties that it will have. The key to
success—the critical point—is that it will have the
independence to get on and do its job as it sees fit. The Treasury
Committee, quite rightly, flags up the issue of independence as key. If
we get to the position where the OBR is not seen as independent, that
will fundamentally undermine its ability to deliver what we want, which
is credible forecasting that people agree is
robust.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000086">&#160;</a>

Member for Elmet and Rothwell, my concern—which I suspect is
shared by my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham East and for
Bristol East—is that if we do not indicate in some sort of
formal manner that the OBR may choose to examine these or other issues,
a future Government who are more callous than the Minister may cut the
funding off at the knees. The Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government did that to the Audit Commission because he does not
like its policies. If we do not write down that the OBR has the power
to look at child poverty, local authorities or other areas, is there
not a danger that a future Government might claim that it has
overstepped its remit?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000087">&#160;</a>

in the Bill and the charter that the OBR can fulfil its duty in the way
that it sees fit. I would be concerned if, at some point in the very,
very distant future—we hope—the hon. Gentleman’s
Government were ever to change and challenge that. That is why we
decided that it is important to have parliamentary scrutiny to ensure
that any modification of the charter goes through a resolution and is
approved by the House of Commons.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
accept what the hon. Gentleman is saying. The Bill makes it clear that
the OBR is independent and needs to be impartial, and that it has to
remain objective at all times. We have set it up to enable it to do
that. However, I think that we will come to some additional amendments

suggest that it would get embroiled in making political decisions about
the child poverty targets? Surely it is a simple matter. We have the
Child Poverty Act 2010 and there are four different tests set out in
that. That is clear and requires empirical analysis as to whether the
target has been met. I do not understand why that would compromise
impartiality or

                        <p>That

                        <p class="tabbed">My
other point is a fundamental point of principle. Including amendments
12 and 13, which pick up specific policy areas, and saying that the
Office for Budget Responsibility must look at them, is by definition
starting to compromise its independence in carrying out its job
pursuant to what we are setting out in the Bill. I know that the
Opposition do not agree with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
with many good ideas from Conservative and Conservative-led
Governments, I worry that the Opposition will seek to tamper and
interfere—in their eyes, try to make better—and undermine
what is a very strong idea to set up an independent Office for Budget
Responsibility to provide independent forecasts. For too long, this
country had a Government who did not produce independent forecasts and
did not therefore have a credible fiscal policy, but were able to try
to mask the fact that they were taking our economy from being
prosperous to being fundamentally weakened with a structural deficit.
We now have to spend time addressing that deficit with some very
difficult
choices.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was interested to hear the debate on child poverty and local government
finance. We know that one of the determinants of child poverty is
whether families have jobs, and I merely note that Opposition Members
left government with unemployment higher than when they came
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I also note
that their former Chief Secretary to the Treasury left a message for
his successor that said that there was no money left. That is a very
difficult thing for Opposition Members to keep hearing, but the reality
is, even if the shadow Chancellor denies that Britain was left in a
financial mess, it actually was. There is no getting away from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
Opposition Members are to be taken seriously on the economy, they need
to start to outline their alternative. Their refusenik approach to
policy so far has been evidenced today in their bleeding-hearts
response to what is going on in Government policy. Well, Government
policy is in direct response to the utter mess in which the Opposition
left our public finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000097">&#160;</a>

observation is that if the Opposition want to be credible, they will at
least have the guts to admit what they were planning to do, which was
to start cutting public expenditure in April. In fact, they were going
to cut it by about £2 billion less. If they want to be taken
seriously, perhaps at some point during the next three weeks they will
set out where their cuts would be made. At the moment, we have not had
a penny from them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000098">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us
briefly discuss amendment 9, which would require the OBR to produce
sustainability and accuracy reports twice each year. There are good
reasons for keeping both reports on an annual basis. On the accuracy
report, sufficient new out-turn data must be available to merit a new
assessment of forecast accuracy, and a second report in a year would
benefit from very little new data with which to analyse
accuracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
sustainability report will have the broad scope that we have said it
needs. The OBR has set out the range of issues that it intends to
consider, including changes to the uprating of pension benefits and to
the public sector work force. Such changes will require substantial
work, which will take time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An annual
reporting requirement provides the OBR with the necessary time to
produce the analysis, whereas with a biannual report there would be a
risk of its not having sufficient time for such rigorous analysis.
Because 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 53<a class="bkMark" name="Column53">&#160;</a>
                           </div>we want the OBR to be independent, however, there is nothing to stop it
producing additional analysis on a more frequent basis, should it wish
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
amendment 10 goes in the wrong direction, because it would require the
OBR’s sustainability report to focus only on the next five
years. The OBR has said that it intends the report to include long-term
analysis on the sustainability of the public finances, which will
include projections over the next 40 years to allow a full analysis of
long-term trends. That is consistent with the sustainability analysis
produced by other international forecasting councils. We do not want to
accept an amendment that, far from allowing that, would prescriptively
curtail it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 11
would give the OBR an explicit role in informing public debate, but the
OBR has been designed to produce a broad range of reports that are
accessible to everyone. It is required to act transparently to ensure
that all its work, assumptions and methodology are set out. We in this
House have already spent a lot of time debating OBR reports. I note
that the Opposition have become fond of cherry-picking various
statistics from such reports, so they are clearly ones that people will
use and scrutinise.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A careful
balance must be struck between the OBR’s publishing and
disseminating the most credible analysis possible, and its having an
advocacy role that might result in its being brought into political
debates. The last thing we want to do is risk its impartiality and
hence its credibility. The OBR will be a force for good only if it is
deemed credible, and the Treasury Committee
agrees:<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
OBR’s contribution to public understanding should not be
confused with self promotion. This commentary function should be one of
informing public debate through disseminating better understanding of
fiscal policy and long-term economic trends, identifying possible risks
in the structure of the economy and provision of
data.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
spirit of the amendment is already achieved through the OBR remit.
Through producing the best possible fiscal analysis, and doing so in a
transparent manner, the OBR will promote a wider public understanding
of sustainability
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendments 12 and 13, the OBR has been explicitly established to
examine a report on the sustainability of the public finances, but,
subject to that statutory duty, it is afforded complete discretion in
doing so. To ensure that it is credible, it must operate objectively,
transparently and impartially. Both amendments seek to give the OBR
responsibility. Amendment 12 proposes doing so in measuring child
poverty, which would significantly and inappropriately expand its
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The OBR has
an expertise in macro-economic and fiscal analysis, not in examining
the distributional effects of Government policy. That would require a

hard work to come up with the argument that we cannot assess the impact
of Treasury policy on child poverty because that would jeopardise the
independence of the Office for Budget Responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000124">&#160;</a>

Member for Putney is a talented Minister who will go a long way in the
years ahead, but that argument was not her finest hour. Perhaps she
read on in her notes and got to the point where it said that the issue
was outside the remit of the OBR and she tried to avoid saying it. But
she did say it eventually.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
why she was logically trying to avoid saying that child poverty would
be outside the remit of the OBR was that it implies, at a certain
level—I am sure this is not true—that she does not regard
child poverty as part of responsible budgeting and responsible public
financial
stewardship.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000126">&#160;</a>

pity if the hon. Lady takes that view. For all the points she makes
that the OBR does not have the expertise to look at these issues, I am
not sure that that is necessarily the case. It is a pretty broad-minded
and well skilled organisation. As I said before, if we are to start
looking at this concept of responsibility we have to start thinking
about outcomes; otherwise we are merely bean-counting and measuring
inputs. I had thought that her Administration were against that sort of
approach in public policy management, but perhaps I am
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000127">&#160;</a>

would be perfectly reasonable to set out in the Bill that the OBR
should have this responsibility. That would in no way jeopardise its
impartiality or independence. The fact that the Minister eventually had
to resort to the arguments that it would risk the fundamentals of the
OBR to do so and would be inappropriate for the OBR to have this duty

real reason why the Government do not want this provision to be

and the spending review and the impact of that on children and

and they want to brush under the carpet the fact that this Child
Poverty Act and these targets are in existence? Obviously if we had
this provision in the Bill it would force them to do
something about child
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000129">&#160;</a>

commencement of the Child Poverty Act, which is around 25 March, a

                           </div>is that the Government may well trigger the provisions in the Bill that
provide that fiscal circumstances mean that they cannot meet those
targets as they pile on the VAT, cut tax credits and education
maintenance allowances and so on and so forth. This is the direction of
policy that the Government are taking. Whatever those policy objectives
may be, let us have somebody independently assess their impact so that
people do not have to take our word for it as politicians. We want to
have someone else to do it. The whole construct of this arrangement is
in part about having an independent body audit the things that the
Government want to be audited and assessed, but anybody else’s
opinion about what should be audited or assessed, well that is outside
the remit of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000130">&#160;</a>

argument that the Minister took about 20 minutes to make.
The Minister said that it would jeopardise the independence of the
Office for Budget to have it looking at child poverty, whereas the hon.
Lady has said that it is the wrong measure and not the right
organisation to do that. The Minister eventually came round to saying
that. If that is what they believe, that is the Minister’s
judgment. She takes a different definition of responsibility than we
would. We are looking at responsibility in terms of the things that
matter to our constituents. If she were to talk to the people out in
her or my constituency and ask them what a responsible budget is, they
would want to know what the impact is on the ground on the lives,
living standards and so on of real people. That is simply the point I
am trying to make through this set of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000132">&#160;</a>

criteria set out by

the Minister did not want to address that particular commitment. At no
point did she say, “Yes, we stand by that commitment, but we are
finding a different vehicle through which to adhere to it.” She
did not say, “Actually, because of the coalition and the Liberal
Democrats, things are different. What we said before the election no
longer counts.” That is sometimes what the Government say when
they change their mind on various things. We therefore almost had a
stealthy U-turn by conspicuous logic, rather than it being stated
verbally. By ignoring the issue, she simply implied that it was no
longer relevant. That is a great pity. We will probably have to return
to the matter at a later date in the consideration of the

this day and age. It is certainly a mystery to most of the country. I
thought that the notion of trying to create a vehicle to assess local
budget responsibility and the impartiality of the settlement would be
something we could engage with the Government on, given that they had
shown through their words and policy documents an interest in that.
However, obviously, that is not the case. As I say, we will have to
find another opportunity to look at those particular
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000136">&#160;</a>

Minister says that a review of local government resources is coming up

vehicles for assessing the transparent and objective criteria used for
a local government financial settlement, because they will not be
creating an independent body in statute, such as the Audit Commission
or the Office for Budget Responsibility. She may well have a number of
her cronies in mind that she wants to appoint to that resources review,
but the Localism Bill certainly does not touch on these issues.

the local government settlement.” We have to hope that it will
at some point regard those things as issues that matter. I hope that

                           </strong> Clause 4 is one of the central provisions in the
Bill. We have already debated the limits of subsection (1), but the
clause also sets out the consequential reporting arrangements that the
Office for Budget Responsibility must make in respect of its duties. We
have discussed, to a certain extent, the fact that there are several
occasions on which reports must be prepared on fiscal and economic
forecasting. There is, however, the anomaly of having twice-yearly
reports on fiscal and economic forecasting and the fiscal mandate, but
only on one occasion each year would the Office for Budget
Responsibility
make<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“an
assessment of the accuracy of fiscal and economic forecasts prepared by
it”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000357">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Does
the Minister think that there is any problem with a corporate body such
as the OBR assessing the accuracy of its own forecasts? In clause
4(4)(a), there is a provision that, every year, a navel-gazing
operation will take place, and, presumably, a document will be
published that says something in the order of, “Yes. We looked
at these figures and published our assessment of them, and our
assessment was good and accurate. By saying that, therefore, we comply
with the provisions in the
Bill.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to give the impression that I am somehow sceptical of the
necessity of every line in the Bill, but one sometimes gets a sense
that it is slightly flabby legislation and that there are several
provisions that are padding the legislation out to make it look
slightly grander and more important than it perhaps is. Asking an
organisation formally to review its own work annually seems slightly
circuitous. Perhaps the Minister feels that that is an especially
worthwhile exercise. It may be what, in modern management parlance,
they call a 360° review. It is a horrible process for anyone in
management where everyone around them is asked how well they are doing,
but maybe it is something that Ministers should do more frequently. But
for the OBR this is its fate—the measure is now in the Bill.
However, never let it be said by a Minister in this Committee that we
cannot have a measure in the Bill because it is extraneous, unnecessary
or not part of the legislation. There are plenty of examples in the
Bill of measures that go slightly beyond necessity.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">By and large,
we feel that there is merit in creating a body to provide this analysis
and assessment. We also feel that the duties of the OBR and the issues
that it should take into account are fairly uncontroversial, other than
the unnecessarily narrow definition of “sustainability”
that Ministers seem to be imposing through the drafting of the Bill. As
I say, however, by and large we think that there are important
provisions in the Bill and we understand where the Government are
coming from on this
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000168">&#160;</a>

clause is central to the Bill as it establishes that the OBR

                        </p>
                        <p>First,
for the record, I want to raise a problem with the clause because
“sustainability” is a highly contested term. Our debate
on the amendments to the clause revealed the contestable nature of the
idea of “sustainability” in relation to the public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will give
an example to show the Committee why I think this idea of
“sustainability” might be problematic and why we need to
be clear about it. The financial services sector commissioned a number
of academic reports prior to the 2008 financial crash that demonstrated
that collaterised debt obligations and credit default swaps promoted
economic stability. Some academics in various economic departments
around the world found that those financial instruments were
effectively promoting financial stability because of their dispersal of
risk. Of course, we all know what happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000175">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Obviously the hon. Lady is aware that the shadow
Chancellor was City Minister when much of this failure of regulation
took place. Does she think that he was one of the people who read those
reports and was taken in by them?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The shadow Chancellor has played a great role in
the economic history of this country from the mid-1990s and through the
crash. I suppose that the Minister is asking me to account for why the
previous Government did not take regulatory action to disallow the
financial instruments that I have just mentioned. The implication of
her point is that when the shadow Chancellor was City Minister, he
ought to have acted in some regulatory manner to prevent those
instruments from being used. Knowing what we know now, we can all go
back, pick over history and say, “Perhaps such a Minister should
have regulated there,” or, “Perhaps such an Opposition
should not have called for light-touch regulation,” as the
Conservative party did. Throughout my living memory, the Conservative
party has been calling for light-touch regulation of the City of
London, and it did so all the way through its time in opposition. I
would happily discuss at length with the Minister the point at which
she thinks the former City Minister should have regulated, and at what
point she called in Parliament for that very regulation, but I fear
that such a discussion might test your patience, Dr McCrea. The
question is important, however, and I wish that we had more
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000177">&#160;</a>

sustainability of the public finances and how she expects the OBR to do
so. Our debates on clause 4 have actually been about the job that we
expect the OBR to do. Sustainability is not a concept that can be
easily understood or defined straightforwardly. Will the Minister give

                           </strong> First, I shall to pick up on the
Minister’s earlier question about regulation. As she will
recall, after Northern Rock collapsed in 2008, her own boss spoke in
the City—I suspect it was at a fundraising bash, because the
Tories held many of those. He said, “You want less regulation
and we”—the Tories—“will deliver
it.” Labour Members will not take a lecture on a light-touch
regulatory approach from Conservative Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I agree with
my hon. Friend about the wishy-washy, unclear and not very substantive
approach on some of the wording in the clause. There is, of course, a
Lib Dem in the Treasury team, so given the Minister’s precise
mind, such a wishy-washy phrase that does not mean anything at all must
have come from the pen of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury rather
than her.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The specific
issue that I would like the Minister to clarify is whether the OBR will
have the funding and ability to carry out studies into the devolved
Administrations throughout the United Kingdom. At the moment, Scottish
Ministers—when they have not given away the powers—have
the ability to set business rates within Scotland and to vary income
tax at the basic rate by up to 3p in the pound. Those revenue-raising
powers are significant, and Scotland receives a not inconsiderable
block grant from the UK Government. From next Monday, the Committee of
the whole House will consider the Scotland Bill, so I look forward
hearing to the hon. Members for Witham and for Bury North championing
the causes of further devolution and handing powers to the Scottish
Parliament then. We know that they fully support those things and agree
with their Prime Minister that the Scottish Parliament is a great
institution. Without wishing to prejudge their excellent contributions
on the issue of greater fiscal powers for Scotland, it is clear that,
in future, the Scottish Parliament will have greater revenue raising
powers. It has been suggested that it might even raise up to 50% of its
income stream from its own people through its powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You, Dr
McCrea, and your colleagues in Northern Ireland have successfully
articulated the concerns of the people there about the current funding
settlement. I am aware of particular concerns about the
Treasury’s failure to guarantee the security of Northern Ireland
under the ludicrously small settlement. It would be entirely
appropriate for the OBR to investigate not only whether the
Administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have the
correct funding settlements to carry out their duties, but whether they
have sustainable funding settlements—to use the wishy-washy term
of the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the OBR be able to carry out a thorough, independent investigation into
the sustainability of the devolved Administrations? If so, to echo the
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South, over what
period does the Minister think that the sustainability should be
examined? Is it the period of a 
<div class="columnNumber">

settlement, or over the lifetime of a UK
Parliament?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000184">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> Clause 4 sets out the main duty for the OBR, so
it is obviously a key clause. That main duty is to examine and report
on the sustainability of the public finances. I will respond to some of
the points made the hon. Member for Wirral South shortly, but given the
range of dimensions to sustainability, the OBR will be required to
clarify its focus in each report and to set out how it has approached
the question of
sustainability.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill requires four specific pieces of analysis. First, the OBR will
have a duty to prepare fiscal and economic forecasts on at least two
occasions for each financial year. Those are expected to act as the
official forecasts for the Budget and for the autumn. Handing over the
duty to produce those forecasts represents a major step forward for the
credibility of the UK’s economic and fiscal forecasts and
policies. That has been recognised widely, from the CBI to the
International Monetary Fund. That said, it is consistent with the
Treasury Committee’s report that this and future Governments
retain the right to disagree with the OBR’s forecasts. If such a
situation arose, the Chancellor would provide reasons to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
alongside the forecasts, the OBR must produce an assessment of the
extent to which the fiscal mandate has been, or is likely to be,
achieved. It will make an independent assessment of the probability of
the Government achieving their mandate, which will add further
credibility to the Government’s fiscal policy. Thirdly, the OBR
will, at least once for every financial year, prepare an assessment of
the accuracy of the fiscal and economic forecasts it prepared
previously. The purpose of that duty is to require the OBR to review
its previous forecasts, which will allow it to consider any possible
forecasting errors within its models and judgments, thus potentially
strengthening its forecasting
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
fourth and final specific duty is to produce, at least once for each
financial year, an analysis of the sustainability of the public
finances. We intend that that analysis will promote wider understanding
of medium and long-term fiscal pressures, both within the Government
and more widely. For each report produced under the clause, the OBR is
required to explain the factors that it took into account when
preparing the report, including the main assumptions and
risks.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Beyond
its statutory duties, the OBR will have complete discretion to
determine its wider work programme. The hon. Member for Dunfermline and
West Fife asked how the OBR will work with the devolved
Administrations. It can work with them if there is a decision to
analyse any relevant issues that are consistent with the OBR’s
remit. For example, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the Scotland Bill, and
once the Calman report is implemented, the OBR will be the forecasting
authority for Scottish tax receipts, which I am sure he will be pleased
to hear. The OBR can choose to do whatever work it wants, subject to
its statutory duty, so if it decided to analyse the economy in Scotland
or
Wales—<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000189">&#160;</a>

clarification. Will she also tell us whether the time over which the

                           </strong> As I said earlier, one reason why we did not
want to accept the Opposition amendment to make the forecasts cover a
five-year period is that we want to see sustainability over the medium
and longer term. In fact, the OBR has said that it wants to look over a
time period of 40 years, so one aspect of its work is a long-term
forward look at the sustainability of public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, the OBR has complete discretion. That means that although
the Government, parliamentary Committees and any other body can ask it
to carry out a specific piece of work, it is for the OBR alone to
determine its wider work
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the OBR’s ability to look at sustainability and the use of
experts, and its independence, which was raised by the hon. Member for
Nottingham East, there will be non-executive directors as part of the
broader OBR governance structure. On a day-to-day basis, they will
ensure its independence and provide a fresh input into how it is
working, including on the relevance of its
forecasts.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the Treasury previously did the forecasts that will now be carried out
by the independent OBR, it also used to assess whether its forecasts
were accurate and published a report on that once a year. We propose to
align that assessment of accuracy with what the OBR will do, and given
that both the forecasting and the assessment of that forecasting used
to be done by the Treasury, we will put both in the
OBR.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
review of the OBR will be strengthened on a day-to-day basis by
non-executive directors and by the fact that the members of the Budget
Responsibility Committee will be experts. Everybody in this House would
agree that Robert Chote, as chair of the OBR and the Budget
Responsibility Committee, is well respected in the area. The OBR
intends to establish an advisory committee of experts to support its
work. Transparent analysis and the publication of its assessment of the
accuracy of its forecasting, which is part of what it plans to do, is a
key feedback loop to ensure that it improves its forecasting over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
as I have said, the non-executive directors will commission an entirely
independent review of the independent OBR every five years. Those
measures mean that there are clear and effective safeguards in place to
ensure that the OBR’s forecasting is analysed internally year on
year and also externally. The ongoing scrutiny of OBR reports not only
in Parliament, but by outside commentators, will also form part of the
overall process of looking at how accurately the OBR is able to
forecast.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000198">&#160;</a>

clearly have their own ideas—the Office for Budget
Responsibility may feel that it needs more non-executive directors. The
Bill gives the OBR the flexibility to recruit further non-executive
directors. The advertisements for the positions will go out later this
year. We hope that people will be in post by the end of the year. At
that stage, we will have a full Office for Budget Responsibility group

                           </strong> Amendment 14 is consequential upon amendment 15,
so we do not need to discuss it in any detail. The amendments reiterate
some of the points that my colleagues and I made earlier and that we
will address in substantially more detail when we consider how the
office will be set up under schedule 1 and how it will be run on a
day-to-day basis. This is about whether the relationship between the
Office for Budget Responsibility and the Treasury and Government will
be truly independent and about how we can ensure the greatest possible
transparency in the office’s activities and accountability for
what it does and how it goes about doing it. In other words, we are
considering how the office can fulfil the requirement under subsection
2 that it must perform its duty under clause 4 “objectively,
transparently and impartially”. I have already flagged up my
concern about the relationship between the Treasury and the OBR in
comments on earlier amendments that were rejected by the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has, as we would expect, said that there is nothing to worry about,
that the Treasury has no problem with the OBR doing the job that it has
been set up to do and that if the OBR criticises or challenges the
Government, or even makes them look incompetent and
foolish—perish the thought—the Minister, her boss the
Chancellor and everyone in the Government from the Prime Minister down
would be perfectly happy with the state of affairs and happy
for the OBR to challenge, criticise and embarrass the Government in
that way and would never reach a stage where they think that a spanner
needs to be thrown into the OBR’s works. I am sure that the
Minister will forgive those of us in the Opposition who are perhaps a
little more, not cynical, but sceptical about how the
Government’s undoubtedly good and honourable intentions will end
up working in the cold world of realpolitik. We therefore seek to put
some additional checks and balances into the Bill, and amendment 15 is
one of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
think that it would be proper and appropriate for the office to publish
details of any contact that it has with Treasury Ministers and
officials. In the wider political context, there has been a lot of
debate about whether Members of Parliament should publish details of
all their meetings with lobby and campaign
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000215">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Although the OBR will move into a separate
building, so it will not be anywhere in the Treasury, Robert Chote and
his team are still in the Treasury at the moment. To help me understand
the proposal, if I were to pass Mr Chote in the
corridor—he might be on his way to a meeting—and I said
hello to him, and the hon. Lady wants us to publish full details of all
contacts, is she saying that that contact should be published by the
OBR? That would be the meaning of “all
contact”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000216">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> Obviously, we are looking towards the time when
the OBR will be based in another building. The reason why it is
important that it is based in another building is distance. We are also
looking at other suggestions, such as the idea that staff from the
Treasury should not be seconded. The amendment would reinforce the idea
of a certain formality in the relations between the OBR and the
Treasury. Obviously, it could get into the realms of ridiculousness. If
the Minister, as she says, met Robert Chote by the water machine, said
hello and perhaps discussed what was on “EastEnders” the
night before, we would not expect that to be documented and published,
although I am sure that it would be fascinating to know what their
conversation consisted of. We are talking about formal contact and
meetings to get some idea of how much influence the Treasury seeks to
exert.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I was
saying, people have floated proposals seeking to get to the bottom of
the influence of lobbyists, campaign groups and commercial
organisations on MPs, saying that the details of all our meetings with
such groups should be published. For example, if I were to meet the
Child Poverty Action Group or one of the organisations that has lobbied
on child poverty, that should be a matter of public record. Other
people have countered that by saying that if the requirement was that
meetings on the parliamentary estate should be made public, anyone
seeking to hide something would simply meet off the parliamentary
estate, or they would meet over a quiet drink in an informal setting. I
appreciate that it is not the easiest thing in the world to record, but
it is a starting
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
principle of a formal distance and the idea that there should be no
informal or behind-the-scenes efforts to influence the OBR’s
work are important. One could imagine a scenario where, if the
relationship becomes tenser, people from the Treasury might make phone
calls to the OBR saying, “We aren’t happy with what you
are doing,” and try to bang people’s heads together. We
want to avoid that situation, which is why we are suggesting that there
should be a formal record of
contact.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000219">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady makes some valid points. She hit
the nail on the head, when I asked her to be clear on exactly what
contacts she envisaged as needing to be reported. Her amendment refers
to publishing full details of all contact. It was helpful for her to
clarify that it referred to formal contact and meetings. No doubt, she
will welcome the fact that the OBR already publishes a log of
substantive contact with Ministers, special advisers and private
offices during the forecasting process. In fact, that is its decision;
it can publish information relating to its contact with Ministers and
officials in the way that it wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000220">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is in line with the Government’s objective to ensure
that the OBR operates transparently. Clause 5(2) enshrines that and
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        </p>
                        <p>We
agree that there needs to be some transparency on contact with
Ministers, special advisers and private officers. That is what the OBR
will publish. In the run-up to the Budget, when the OBR is scrutinising
the impact of the Chancellor’s policy provisions, details of
those meetings can be commercially sensitive if released and might harm
the formulation of Department and Government policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Publishing
all details would place the OBR under an unreasonable burden, but I can
assure her that, like all public bodies, the OBR is required to operate
under the Freedom of Information Act. Alongside that, it has the
standard approach of looking at exemptions. When the hon.
Lady’s party was in office, practice was developed on how to
strike the balance between transparency for the public and the need for
any Government to go through a process of discussing policy without
prejudicing that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
November 2010, the OBR published a log of all substantive contacts with
Ministers, special advisers and private office staff, during the
forecasting process shortly after the economic and fiscal outlook. The
issue is therefore covered in the Bill, which is why I do not support
the amendment, although I welcome the spirit in which it was tabled. I
assure the hon. Lady that substantive contact will be published by the
OBR, although, because it is independent, it will be its decision to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000224">&#160;</a>

deciding how it works, what it does and how it performs its duties.

                        <p>The
Minister said that the OBR is perfectly capable of making its own
decisions and deciding its own work load, and that it ought to be left
to make those decisions. She made that point very strongly when she
said that it should not be our job to tell the office that it ought to
be looking at local government finance, child poverty or
whatever.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the one
hand, the Minister has said, “Leave the OBR alone; it knows what
it is doing.” On the other hand, the Government now seem to want
to tell the office at what time it should prepare forecasts,
assessments or analysis. Surely, if the experts are in the office doing
the work on a day-to-day basis, and have already been told under clause
4 that they should prepare forecasts twice a year and make an
assessment of the accuracy of the forecast once a year, there is
already a degree of prescription from the Government as to how often
they should do things. It seems to be going slightly too far in
subsection (1) to state that further guidance should be issued about
the timing of<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

assessment or analysis”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is why we feel
that there should be a caveat, or a safeguard provision, which says
that if we accept that the Government are telling the office at what
time it should prepare forecasts, that should not preclude the OBR
exercising a degree of independence if it wants to do anything else at
other times of the year. That is just a caveat to the provision. I
would not have thought that the Government would have a problem
including that as a safeguard, but I look forward to hearing what the
Minister has to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000235">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that I can clarify the situation for the
hon. Lady. Clearly, we want to ensure that the guidance helps the OBR
in clarifying its duty and how it will work in practice. It is also
worth pointing out that when the Chancellor comes to produce the
Budget, he will rely on the OBR to produce the context for his fiscal
policy decisions. The OBR’s forecasts will, therefore, be a very
important part of the Budget, so it is important that that aspect of
what it does is produced in a co-ordinated manner. Otherwise, we could
end up with a Chancellor having to take decisions without independent
analysis from the OBR. The public and Parliament could end up with no
forecast alongside the Budget that the Chancellor presented to
Parliament. We want to ensure that the

			Column number: 68<a class="bkMark" name="Column68">&#160;</a>
                           </div>OBR fulfils its core executive function, which is to produce the
official forecast, and to do so when Parliament and the public need to
see it. Part of that is the OBR’s analysis of the likelihood
that the Government will meet their fiscal
mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a need for the OBR to co-ordinate with the Treasury regarding the
timing of that analysis, which means that the OBR forecasts are the
most relevant for the Chancellor’s policy decisions. However,
that does not undermine the OBR’s ability to act independently
of Ministers. How it approaches that forecast—its judgment and
methodology—remains at the complete discretion of the OBR, and
clause 6 makes that clear. Clause 6 is also very clear that the charter
cannot include guidance on how the OBR should produce its forecasts.
Apart from that, subject to fulfilling its own executive functions, the
OBR can provide additional analysis to its own publication timetable,
as stated in paragraph 4.21 on page 14 of the charter for budget
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other than
the example that I have just set out, the OBR can publish at a time of
its choosing its assessment of the accuracy of its fiscal and economic
forecasts, which it will do at least once a year. The analysis that it
will make of the sustainability of public forecasts will also be done
at least once a year along with any other analysis consistent with its
duty to examine and report on the sustainability of the public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The charter
for budget responsibility sets out that relationship and the timing of
the particular official forecasts that the Chancellor and Parliament
need. It also sets out that the Chancellor will provide
“reasonable advance notice” ahead of any forecast
publication date, so there is some co-ordination; it is set out in the
charter how that will work.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000239">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am slightly confused as to why there is a need
for the provision in subsection (1). It would seem a matter of common
sense that if the Chancellor has given the OBR reasonable notice of
things that are likely to appear on the political calendar, which is a
sensible way to conduct the relationship between the organisations, the
OBR—if it takes its role seriously, as I am sure it
will—will get to work and start doing the analysis and
assessments that are required. I am not sure what would be gained by
additional guidance about the timing in the charter. I am not sure what
sort of wording would appear in the charter that would be useful,
especially as if the charter is revised, it would have to be laid
before Parliament. In such a case, there would obviously be a
significant time delay before anything in the guidance would become
binding.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000241">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady advances one argument that can be
made. If we had not put in a safeguard to ensure that the OBR did not
have to produce official forecasts to coincide with core fiscal updates
to Parliament by the Chancellor and to feed into that policy-making
process with its independent assessment of the impact of policies on
the financial situation and the long-term sustainability of public
finances, I suspect that the Opposition would quite rightly have wanted
to table an amendment to say that we should have such a safeguard.

need for the OBR and its role in aiding robust scrutiny of the public

guidance on how the Office for Budget Responsibility performs its duty,
particularly in relation to clause 5, will take? That clause seems to
be dealing with a similar issue—how the main duty is to be

duties are to be performed. Presumably, the charter and the guidance

important that it is not, but we need clarity about where the dividing
line is. In its duty under clause 4(3) it will prepare “fiscal
and economic forecasts” and assess<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000248">&#160;</a>

particular, the wording “is likely to be achieved” strays
into the territory of expressing an opinion. That opinion might be
based on data and facts rather than political ideology, but it would
certainly lead the office into that sort of territory. If it produces

whether it will stray into political territory.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000249">&#160;</a>

that the Government proposed a rise in income tax of 1p in the pound.
The Office for Budget Responsibility would play a role in considering
the impact that that would have on the sustainability of the public
finances. In considering that, would the office be able to pass
judgment on or assess the impact of a 2p rise in income tax, or of the
impact of no rise? If one is looking at the impact of a rise in income
tax in the context of the sustainability of the public finances, it
would seem

income tax rise. If the rise in income tax were to be offset by cutting
VAT, various scenarios and combinations of rises in direct taxation and
cuts in indirect taxation might be considered, or one might look at the
alternative, namely whether there should be rises in indirect taxation
and cuts in direct taxation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000251">&#160;</a>

the face of it appears to be a perfectly reasonable period of time; I
do not object to the principle of four weeks’ notice. However,
the Minister will be aware that a series of events over the next 12
months will eat up quite a lot of the House’s sitting time, and
that Ministers may not always be available. I am not sure whether the
Minister is one of the 200 MPs who has had an invitation to the royal
wedding. I certainly have not, and I am not sure whether any other
Opposition Members have. The hon. Member for Bristol West shakes his

know whether any of the royal household’s Chamberlains or

another, but obviously Ministers may be distracted in the build-up to
the wedding. The House will not be sitting. I understand that some hon.
Members have their own wedding plans. They are to be congratulated on

and I am sure that Members will be out and about in Bristol, Chippenham

idea of having 28 days is to allow Ministers and Members
pre-consultation with interested bodies, it is reasonable to suggest
that the Government may struggle to have genuine

and (4) of clause 4. The Chancellor will commission the OBR to produce
its fiscal and economic forecasts on a particular date, to ensure that
the forecasts are produced in line with the Government’s
timetable for the Budget and autumn forecast; that requires
considerable co-ordination across Departments. Other work will be
produced by the OBR, at times determined solely by the OBR, with
release dates set out in advance to ensure
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Equally,
the charter must not provide guidance on the methods that the OBR may
use in producing its forecasts, assessments and analysis. That
provision is vital, because it ensures that the OBR has complete
discretion over the methods that it uses, and that the Budget
Responsibility Committee has complete freedom to determine how best to
produce its independent forecasts, assessments and
analysis.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
if the Treasury wished to modify the guidance to the OBR in the
charter, a draft of the modified guidance would need to be published at
least 28 days before the modified charter is laid before the House for
consideration. That addresses one of the questions raised by the hon.
Member for Dunfermline and West Fife. That 28-day timeline is
consistent with the 28-day procedure for statutory instruments, and, as
I just stressed, it is a minimum amount of time. There would be the
potential to lay an instrument earlier if, as he pointed out, there
were mitigating circumstances. Taking all those things together in the
clause means that there should always be time for appropriate
parliamentary scrutiny of the
charter.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Bristol East had concerns about how the OBR will
undertake its assessment of whether the Government are meeting their
fiscal mandate, and how it will judge sustainability. It is for the OBR
to undertake such analysis, and it will assess the likelihood of the
Government’s meeting the fiscal mandate that they set out for
themselves in the charter. Alongside that, part of the Bill and the
guidance in the charter sets out that the OBR has to be very
transparent about how 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>it approached that analysis, the risks that it took into account, and
its assumptions and methodology. Its assessment will set out whether
the Government are on track to meet their fiscal mandate—the
fiscal objectives that they set themselves—and there will be
transparency so that people can look at how the assessment was carried
out and take a decision on whether it could be improved, and its
shortcomings. It is clearly more challenging for any forecasting
organisation to do its job in times of uncertainty than in times of
incremental economic
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000264">&#160;</a>

back to my comments on whether the OBR should look at different
policies—this was raised by the hon. Member for Bristol
East—we do not think that it should be in the business of
looking at alternative policy scenarios. It should simply provide
forecasts that are based on the policies that the Government are
pursuing and have announced in the Budget. If it starts to stray into
analysis of alternative policy scenarios, it inevitably risks
undermining its independence, impartiality and
objectivity.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000267">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate entirely what the Minister is
saying, which is why I raised the issue. It would be wrong if the OBR
were to see its job as passing a verdict on anything that might be
kicking around in the political sphere as a possible move that the
Government could take. However, there is a difference between that and
using comparisons with other possible scenarios to pass judgment on
what the Government are actually
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
is why I used the example of the Government looking at a 1p rise in
income tax; it would be difficult to assess the impact of that on the
sustainability of public finances without the charts that are normally
produced in such circumstances and which have always been produced by
Robert Chote in his former role at the IFS, looking at how much would
be raised by a 2p rise and how much by a 3p rise. I want some assurance
that the OBR’s remit could enable it to cast its net slightly
broader than just looking at exactly what the Government have done and
to make comparisons with other things that the Government might have
considered when they made their
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To be clear, the Office for Budget
Responsibility will not do that. It will not look at alternative policy
scenarios, because its role is to provide an independent forecast of
the economic and fiscal policy decisions of the Government, with the
economic forecasts going out into

in relation to income tax decisions. That would take the OBR into a
sphere where it could be embroiled in a political debate about income
tax policy, which is absolutely not what we want for the OBR. We want
it to look at the policy decisions of the Government, to model them, to
give its assessment on forecasting for the economy and public finances;
and, alongside that, to say whether it believes the Government are
likely to meet the fiscal mandate and objective they set themselves in
the light of the policy decisions taken and the expected trajectory of
the

Christmas, when, as she will recall, no fewer than five Conservative
MPs independently asked what assessment she and her colleagues had made

that obviously the Government must have considered the graduate tax and
discounted it when they were deciding on the hike in tuition fees that

kind of stuck to his principles and abstained. Surely if the Government

reasonable that the OBR would take a look at that policy area? I
understand what the Minister said about going off at a tangent and
doing some blue-sky or original thinking, but if it is a policy,
whether a graduate tax or an income tax rise, that the Government have
admitted they have considered but discounted, does she not think the

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The

blow-by-blow analysis of how the Budget was being pulled together. It
would not be in anybody’s interests for all that to be put into

                           </strong> We come back to my original comments. First,
apart from performing core executive functions of fiscal and economic
forecasting, it is up to the OBR to decide what other forecasting to do
and how and when to publish it. My response is much the same as it was
to the hon. Member for Bristol East: I think that it would be against
the spirit of what we are trying to achieve in setting up the OBR to
put alternative policy scenarios into a post-Budget analysis, because
it would inevitably end in the OBR being pulled into a debate about
what the right policy was. We do not think that that is the
OBR’s role. It is right for Parliament to debate different
policies, as we did on tuition fees, but that is the role for us as
Members of Parliament elected by our constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000279">&#160;</a>

important that the OBR not only is independent but is seen to be
independent. We need only witness how the Opposition reacted to what
they felt was the inappropriate timing of a publication. I reassure
Members that there was no Government involvement, but it shows how
important and sensitive the issue is. That is one reason for the set-up
of the clauses in the Bill and the charter supporting it, and it is why
it is so important not just for the OBR to be independent but for it to
be seen to be independent. We can already see that it will always be a
concern, so we must put it beyond doubt. That is what we are trying to
do by saying that we do not think that the OBR should analyse
alternative policy scenarios. With that, I support the

the Minister give us an estimate of the budget that will be available
to the OBR? It would be useful to know what it will cost the taxpayer.
On the concept and notion of the words “efficiently” and
“cost-effectively”, the Bill is laden with a number of
ill-defined adverbs—in fact, I sometimes wonder whether we
should have an office for adverb definition. The Treasury might
consider establishing that unit at some point. Such adverbs litter the
legislation, yet there is no firm interpretation clause to define them.
I hope that the Minister can tell us why the OBR is necessary, how it
will be enforced, measured and audited, and how much it will
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000289">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Sometimes I wonder whether Liberal Democrats
have much say in the Treasury and on economic policy. We often see the
Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chief Secretary sitting on the
Liberal Democrat Benches rather than behind his boss; he is never
confident enough to be there for Treasury questions or statements.
However, when I see a statement such as that in clause 7, which means
absolutely nothing to anybody and is complete waffle, I have confidence
that Liberal Democrats have a real role in drawing up legislation. It
is almost embarrassing for the House to have such a phrase in a

from the fact that it says it will “aim” rather than
“will”, the clause does not give a single measure or

for the Office for Budget Responsibility is now set as part of the
spending review. We have set a budget for the whole of the spending
review period, so it will not be something that we come back to over
the course of that period. Part of that is about ensuring that the OBR
knows it is independent. The risk outlined by the hon. Members for
Nottingham East and for Dunfermline and West Fife, that the OBR could
be penalised for producing awkward reports and have its budget cut, has
been tackled by giving the OBR a spending review settlement for the
whole period. That settlement provides an annual budget of £1.75
million and Robert Chote, the chair of the OBR, agrees that such a deal
provides the OBR with adequate resources. We are confident that the
clause provides for the OBR to act in a way that is cost-effective and
efficient. Furthermore, alongside the spending review settlement it
will have the budget over the course of this Parliament to get on with
the work that it needs to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000310">&#160;</a>

correctly, the Minister is suggesting that future Bills that set up a
new body, from the Department of Health for example, will not contain
that magical, wonderful sentence. Is she saying that the OBR and the
NAO need to behave in a cost-efficient manner and therefore that has
been written down, but if other Departments do not do that, the
impression is that the Treasury does not care much if the Department of
Health does not run its bodies in a cost-efficient manner? Surely we
should either have that sentence as a matter of course in every Bill
concerning public bodies, or not at all.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000311">&#160;</a>

in the business of getting rid of as many ineffective public bodies as
we can—he talked about what he called the quango cull. We are,
of course, talking about a new body that has an important role to play.
In the context of this new body—we do not aim to set one up
every day of the week, which arguably is a change from the previous
Government—we have inserted this clause because, as he
recognises, perhaps never more than now, it is incredibly important to
ensure that the Government is run in a cost-efficient and
cost-effective way. As I said, the other reason the provision is in the
Bill is because a core aspect of how the OBR needs to work is its
independence. The provision is the quid pro quo for the OBR having the

discretion.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000312">&#160;</a>

cost-effective—there is no doubt about that—but would the
clause not be even more effective and useful if it simply omitted the
words “aim to”, so that it stated that the office
“must” carry out its functions efficiently and
cost-effectively? I worry that the wording might give the body a bit of
wriggle room because it will be able to say, “Well, we
aren’t very efficient, but we aim to be.” That is my
worry. I am happy with the wording in this Bill, but in future perhaps

assure him that the form of words we have used in no way lets
organisations off the hook. In fact, there is a legal reasonability
test in the way it is phrased. We are passing a Bill that will become
law, and the clause will ensure that the measure can work. However, he
is absolutely right that we have to demand value for money. He will be
pleased to hear that one of the things we are doing in the Treasury is
not just looking at the Government’s policies in terms of value
for money, but making sure that we have better tools in place to gather
core financial data that will help us do that over the coming
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000314">&#160;</a>

mirrors, as the hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting. If he is
interested in the concept of reasonableness in the context of the law
courts, I advise him that I am absolutely certain that the House of
Commons Library has entire books both on how over the years the concept
of reasonableness has become enshrined within the framework of our
legal system, and on the value of giving some flexibility to enable a
judgment to be made on what is reasonable, based on the merits of a

heads down to the Library, he will be able to read all about

poor drafting of the Bill. I can see why we would want the Office for
Budget Responsibility to publish the reports, lay them before
Parliament and send copies to the Treasury, but I am not convinced that
a separate clause in the Bill is necessary to make that happen. I feel
as though we should have a fourth point: it should be published in hard
copy, perhaps on A4 paper, and published in English; perhaps they
should use an envelope and the appropriate postage to send it to the
Treasury; and perhaps it could be posted in a timely fashion. There is
a point at which describing such process-ology in the Bill gives me
cause to suspect that at some point the Chancellor was told,
“Maybe this is a one or two-clause

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
one of the more pertinent points of the clause—if there is a
pertinent point—relates to laying the reports before Parliament.
It is necessary to establish beyond doubt the independence of the OBR.
We could ensure that all parties have receipt of these reports, have
notice of them, an opportunity to read them simultaneously and that the
Treasury does not receive a report ahead of Opposition parties.
Clearly, there are many occasions when royal commissions and other
inquiries will give their findings to Ministers many days in advance so
that they can cogitate and assess their contents. They usually give
Opposition parties an hour or half an hour’s notice before
publishing a matter before Parliament. Will the Minister at least
assure us that Ministers will receive OBR reports at the same time as
Opposition parties? That will mean beyond any shadow of a doubt that it
is a non-party, non-biased Office for Budget
Responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000323">&#160;</a>

Friend has made many of the pertinent points that I wished to make. I
was never a great student when I was at school. I suffered from bad
habits. When I had better things to do, such as playing football or
computer games in the evening, I would leave my homework to the last
minute. When I was in the playground before my homework was due, I went
through the exercise of trying to stuff out as far as possible my
500-word essay. I must confess that I think the
Chancellor—having gone to Klosters on his break, or perhaps he
was on a yacht with Lord Mandelson and Mr Rothschild—did not
give the Bill much thought. He sat at the back of the Cabinet room, and
just before he was due to hand it in to the civil servants, he came up
with two or three clauses to try to pad out what is a fairly sparse
document. As the hon. Member for Bury North so ably articulated, less
is sometimes better. In this case, it would have been
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am slightly surprised by the order in which the distribution of reports
is listed. If there had to be an order, I would have suggested
“lay before Parliament" first. There is a good debate to be had
about whether it should be the Treasury next or the public, but the key
thing is that the provision to “lay it before Parliament”
should have been first. Further to the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Nottingham East, could the Minister explain why Parliament
was not given sovereignty in terms of the order in which the OBR should
present its reports? Is it purely grammatical and stylistic to make it
flow downwards and look better or was there some reasoning behind
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000325">&#160;</a>

I am baffled. I sat in this room less than a month ago when we debated
the military covenant report, which obviously was about a report being
published. It did not have a subsection (a) which stated that the
report must be published. Surely it is a given. It is an example of bad
drafting and civil servants doing their homework at lunchtime just
before the afternoon lesson. It is a badly drafted document. It is not
necessary to write “publish the report” if that was the
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000328">&#160;</a>

is entirely right. I am seeking to protect the sovereignty of
Parliament by ensuring that copies are not doled out to the Press
Gallery but are laid in the House of Commons prior to being released
anywhere else. Bizarrely, given the structure of the clause, making it
available publicly does not seem to have made it into the list of
actions that the Government make. If we are to have this totally
spurious clause, I hope that the Minister can give me a guarantee that
the reports will be made more publicly available. I agree with my hon.
Friend the Member for Nottingham East that we should not get into
whether it is on the internet, in hard copies and available from HMSO
or wherever else. Will the Minister give an undertaking that there will
be a publicly available version of the
reports?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000330">&#160;</a>

that the OBR publishes each of the reports required under clause 4 and
publication will allow every interested party to access the forecasts,
analyses and assessments of the OBR. That is the key element of the
OBR’s transparency. As we have just heard, it is clearly set out
in clause 8 that the OBR must lay its report before Parliament, not the
Treasury. In fact the Treasury will be sent a copy of the report. That
is a further example of how we have tried to strike the right balance
by making sure that although the OBR produces official forecasts that
the Treasury uses, it is nevertheless independent of the Treasury and
that is why a copy of those reports will be sent to the
Treasury.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000331">&#160;</a>

about timing, for the autumn forecast, the OBR shared its final report
with the Treasury in line with how the Office for National Statistics
would generally operate in terms of pre-release access. So the Treasury
got 24 hours’ notice but that is no different from the way
public statistics are often put into the public domain. It is entirely
consistent with that overall approach, which I hope will provide some
reassurance that there is no special arrangement for this report over
other reports that people like the ONS would
release.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000332">&#160;</a>

sensitivity for statistical releases and so on, and the need for policy
makers to be able to have some advance notice, but that argument does
not apply to the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose whole core and
being is its independence. Can the Minister see that from the
Opposition perspective, which she will probably have in the full career
ahead of her, it might be good practice when Parliament receives such
documents for Opposition parties, and even Liberal Democrat spokesmen
when relevant, to receive them simultaneously with Ministers. There is
no justification for not doing that, is

five minutes ago, was under the clear impression that Parliament would
receive the information before the Treasury. Even the Minister’s
loyal supporters believe that her position is not the right one. Will
she not reflect on the fact that the OBR is very different from the
ONS. There are no market statistics, and this is another example of her
civil servants not having done their homework before turning up here
today. Will she reflect carefully on this important issue of
parliamentary
sovereignty?<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000335">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can be clear. This is a Bill that, having been
through the other place, Ministers are now taking through the House of
Commons. I think the comments about officials are slightly superfluous
in that

simply do not agree with the points made by Opposition Members. There
is a long-standing process for releasing a range of sensitive and
public material into the public domain. In many respects it has served
this country well in enabling Governments to give a response when
statistics come into the public domain, and I think that is why the
Office for National Statistics has approached its role in

                           </div>that way. That is why we believe that it is sensible for the OBR also to
approach its new role in that way. I appreciate that some hon. Members
may not agree, but we must agree to disagree.<a class="bkMark" name="11030212000341">&#160;</a>
