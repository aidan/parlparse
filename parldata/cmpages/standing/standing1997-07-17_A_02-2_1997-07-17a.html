<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Before dinner, I was in the throes of explaining the inadequacies of some of the calculations in the schedule that which have contributed to what the schedule calls the
<P>
``Quantification of a privatisation windfall''. In particular, paragraph 2(1) states that the estimate of the value in profit-making terms of the disposal made 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on the occasion of a company's flotation is the amount produced by multiplying the average annual profit for the company's initial period by the applicable price-to-earnings ratio.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is one of the central problems with the schedule. Both halves of the equation that is used to come to that calculation, which leads to the estimate of the windfall tax that the utilities will pay, are severely inadequate.
<P>
As I was saying immediately before dinner, the annual profit for the company's initial period is an inherently arbitrary figure. It can take no account of the difference between a company's performance when it was nationalised and after it has been privatised. It would be extraordinary if the profit did not increase, simply because of the different pressures on a company that operates in a private sector environment and with private sector management. We have seen across every sphere of British industry since the previous Government implemented the privatisation programme that those industries that were so often the worst run have, in a relatively short time, become some of the best run. One of the problems with the idea of profits in the initial period is that they can take no account of that phenomenon--the problem is not that they do not take account of it, but that they cannot take account of it. A value has to have been placed on a company at the time of privatisation, but it would have been impossible sensibly to predict how much better that company would do in the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is it not ironic that the value of such companies have been diminished at the date of privatisation--I do not accept that their value was diminished, but that is what Labour Members are claiming--because the Labour party posed the ever-present threat of renationalising those companies? The Labour party added to the risk inherent in holding investments because it could have come along at some point and confiscated those assets. Indeed, the windfall tax is a confiscation of such assets and a partial renationalisation of such companies, even though the Government are allowing them to remain in private hands. If one accepts that there was diminution in the value of those companies at the date of privatisation, which I do not, then it is the Labour party itself that has caused that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My point is very much germane to the argument that was being developed about the need for a time series to establish a reasonable level of profitability. Does my hon. Friend recall that, in relation to trustee investment legislation, and in order to make a prudent investment, it is necessary for a company to have shown a degree of stability and to have been able to pay a dividend on its share capital over a period of years? Does that not emphasise the fact that, in its initial stages, a public company that has been freshly launched as a result of a privatisation issue is surrounded by an element of risk, and it is necessary to build up to a stable position and give reasonably high returns while that position is being reached?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Both my hon. Friends have made excellent points. The valuation at privatisation clearly had to reflect two things. First, the valuation reflected the history of the companies when they were in the state sector. Unsurprisingly, the Government's proposals admit that those companies instantly became much more profitable in the private sector, which in itself is a tribute to the process of privatisation. Of course, that was opposed root and branch by Labour Members throughout the period.
<P>
Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described another factor that was artificially depressing the price of assets and the potential of all those companies when they were in the state sector. He described precisely how, even with the prospect of privatisation, there was the further prospect, at every subsequent general election, of an incoming Labour Government renationalising the assets and no doubt doing a disservice to the new shareholders. As my hon. Friend rightly said, we have a version of that now. After many years, there is a Labour Government again, and the first thing they try to do--no doubt the first thing they will do--is to damage the value of those companies by introducing confiscatory tax. That is not as bad as renationalisation, which previous versions of the Labour party would have introduced, but it is still damaging and it ensures that the calculations in the schedule that are used to try to establish excess profits must be artificial.
<P>
Such a valuation is only half the equation that the schedule uses to try to establish the amount of excess profit that can be subject to a windfall tax. The other half is what the schedule describes as the ``applicable price-to-earnings ratio''. We have seen several times that that is, to use the Paymaster General's term, perfectly simple. Indeed, he advocated the benefits of simplicity.
<P>
I put it to him that, in this case, it is simplicity to the point of idiocy to try to create a single applicable PE ratio for several companies across a wide range of sectors in different industries. At best, it must be very rough and, as it turns out, it is a completely arbitrary calculation. The Inland Revenue's notes on the Finance Bill explain that the relevant PE ratio is set at nine. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This figure approximates to the lowest average sectoral price-to-earnings ratio of the companies liable to the tax.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is about one stage up from sticking one's finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing. It is an average sectoral PE ratio for companies in different sectors--I suppose that one can define them as being in a utilities sector--and in different types of businesses. There are different degrees of competition--some have no competition at all, others have competition in their own sector. For example, there are, and always have been, two completely different classes of water company. To try to establish a single figure to make that calculation cannot be fair to all the companies that the Government are trying to tax.
<P>
Furthermore, we have seen the wide range of different industries in clause 2. Earlier, we discussed whether the Bill was a de jure hybrid Bill--which it is clearly not--or a de facto hybrid Bill. The clause that announces all the different definitions of companies--which the Government have had to use to avoid making it a hybrid Bill--makes it clear to anyone reading it honestly that it is simply not possible fairly to produce a single PE ratio for all those companies that can be regarded as an adequate base on which to make the calculation.
<P>
I invite the Government to assess the matter impartially and to ask themselves whether they are treating the companies fairly and are seen to be doing so. Many of them work in central areas of the British economy; they are not only important in themselves, but provide important services to a wide range of other industries, on whose future the prosperity and jobs of millions of people in this country depend. It is vital that those companies believe that they are being treated fairly--visibly so--by the Government. I contend that the schedule is clearly inadequate in that it treats in them unfairly.
<P>
There are other important incoherencies in the schedule. Paragraph 6 makes clear that the initial period on which the calculations are based is arbitrary. The Paymaster General has explained that the four-year period which is used for the majority of the companies is related to the price cap that was put on them. But the game is given away by paragraph 6(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where the initial period of a company privatised by means of a flotation would...include any time on or after 1 April 1997, sub-paragraph (1) shall not apply and the initial period of that company shall be taken, instead, to be the period which--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) begins with the day on which the time of its flotation falls; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) ends with the end of the last financial year of the company to end before 1 April 1997.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No doubt that is administratively convenient, but it gives the game away that the four-year period, which can apply to all early privatisations, is not regarded as a central part of the calculation. The Government are prepared to introduce for any company which happened to have been privatised fewer than four years before 1 April 1997 an arbitrary cut-off date which may or may not give a realistic view of the company's long-term profitability, let alone its long-term capital needs. Those are two illustrations of the unfairness of the tax.
<P>
Reference has been made to the fact that Labour Members are rather cross that we are opposing the tax. Perhaps they feel that the Opposition should not have the right to oppose it. I simply point out that perfectly sensible, reputable, non-political expert bodies have made the same points as Opposition Members. As I understand it, the Paymaster General has assured us that the proposed windfall tax will be creditable for United States tax purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I have not said that. I hate to say it, but the hon. Gentleman has been absent in mind--the matter is for the US tax authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely interesting answer. I have listened carefully. I may have misunderstood, but I got the impression that the Paymaster General held talks with the US tax authorities and, though perhaps not legally reassured, hoped that the windfall tax would be creditable for tax purposes in the United States. Is he now saying that that is not the case?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> For the benefit of any doubters--clearly, the hon. Gentleman is present, but absent; he hears, but does not understand--I should make it clear that I did not say anything such as that. Even the hon. Member for Daventry, who speaks for Opposition, was clear on the matter. I said that that question is for the American authorities. We have had discussions and we do not expect any retaliatory measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I find that interesting. Retaliatory measures will not be needed because the measure will not help the companies concerned--it will clearly deter long-term inward investment into this country. The windfall tax raises the issue of international tax problems. The Paymaster General is clearly not completely reassured about there being no retaliatory measures. I am more than happy for him to clarify the matter all evening, but each time he does so he makes the situation slightly more damaging for the companies concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am trying to make the matter clearer for the hon. Gentleman, which is a difficult job. We had a constructive exchange about inward investment, but it seems that he did not hear it. Inward investment continues, the stock market is up and a company has on the table a bid of $5&#183;2 billion for one of our companies, Energy Group. What does that show other than the continuing will and commitment of overseas investors, Americans in particular, to invest in our utilities?
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> What is shows is that there was a bid on the table. Every time that we tease a little more elucidation out of the Paymaster General, it becomes more and more clear that he is admitting that in international terms he is making some of our industries slightly less desirable. I hope that he is right about the absence of retaliatory action because if he is not, he will be causing even more damage to our industries internationally than he already has done domestically. Every time he clarifies the situation he makes it less promising for the companies concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We should ask the Paymaster General whether the Government have taken legal advice on whether, for US purposes, the tax will be regarded as a creditable tax. It would not be responsible for the Government to introduce such a tax without having taken legal advice, albeit US legal advice, because this is an important issue for companies operating in this country which are owned abroad. I am sure that the Government have taken legal advice, and it would be interesting and illuminating for the Committee if we could hear whether that advice is that the windfall tax will be creditable for US double tax relief purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will let the Paymaster General answer that question later if he wishes to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson </b><i>rose</i>--<p>
<p><b>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Paymaster General answers that question, I ask members of the Committee to speak a little more clearly. I find it difficult to follow their words and I believe that Hansard is also having some difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to intervene on his own speech. I am in a position in which I found myself earlier this evening. The position is clear. The answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is that that is a matter for the American tax authorities, not for us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extraordinary answer. If the Paymaster General is saying that he has not taken legal advice and he is hoping that the American tax authorities will not do anything that will damage British industry, that is a pretty negligent approach from the Treasury Front Bench to a matter that is of central importance to some of the most vital industries in this country. I am sure that he will return to that point later.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation has also made it clear that it regards as unfair and arbitrary the taxation imposed by this schedule. It said before the Budget that it thinks that the windfall tax is retrospective and arbitrary and agrees with the criticisms that others have made, but if such a tax were to be introduced, it should be on the accounting operating profits of the regulated businesses over the period since privatisation, not, as we discussed previously, both the regulated and unregulated businesses. The institute made a series of other, technical points about extraordinary items. It is clear from the thrust of its criticism that the tax tries to include as much profit in the overall tax take as it possibly can, not through any sense of fairness to the companies concerned, still less of fairness to their customers or shareholders, simply to increase the Governments coffers as much as possible.
<P>
The thrust of those criticisms is--slightly oddly, because most Conservative Members accept that of the 17 tax rises in the Budget, this was the one that was well flagged--that despite the fact that the Government had so many years to cobble together this tax, it is still deficient in many ways. It fails to meet the criticisms of Conservative Members and of many experts in taxation. The more that the Paymaster General blusters and says, ``I will clarify things; it is terrible that we are being opposed in this way'', the more he exposes the fact that for all the work Opposition did in opposition, the tax is still inadequate. They have not thought it through: it is messy, muddled and unfair. That is why the schedule should be defeated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is fair to say that some of us remain confused by the method of calculation of the windfall tax. It is not difficult to understand why so many companies--we have all received representations from them--feel that the tax is unjust, unfair and iniquitous. Can the Paymaster General and the Government generally guarantee that the formula adopted to calculate this iniquitous tax will not impact on other areas? As we have sought to prove this evening, this is simply one more demonstration of the carelessness with which the Government proceed--carelessness in overall thinking and in the manner in which the Bill has been drafted.
<P>
I draw the Paymaster General's attention to our numerous concerns. We are worried about whether the tax will influence inward investment. Six major utilities are held by foreign companies. How will pension funds be dealt with? How will the tax impact on investment in infrastructure, research and development? Do Labour Members genuinely believe that there will be no impact whatever? At present we have to assume that that is what they believe, but we must make them realise that it will have a very serious impact.
<P>
We share the concern of Labour Members about getting the unemployed back to work. However, will this expensive gimmick end up creating real jobs? Labour Members say that they want the money to fund a welfare-to-work programme, but that programme is about creating phoney--because subsidised--jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> I should like to refer again to Graham Hawker, who stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If such a tax is introduced, I cannot think of a better way to spend it''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
meaning the welfare-to-work programme. Would the hon. Gentleman care to comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Graham Hawker did indeed say those words, but he did so after recognising the inevitability of having to face this highly punitive, iniquitous, unfair and highly discriminatory tax. If the hon. Member for Halton had bothered to read all of Hyder's submission, he would know that the company was gravely concerned about the impact of the tax. Unlike the Government, the Hyder company believes in honouring its promises. It believes that all agreements with consumers must be met. Labour Members do not often recognise it, but the truth is that the company knows that the money must come from somewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Labour party fails to honour truths and promises. I suggest that the windfall tax is indeed a promise to the public--made clear in the party's manifesto--and that it is being implemented tonight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of the Labour party's promises. That provides me with the opportunity to remind him that the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), now Prime Minister, constantly told the public--in the election campaign and before it--that there would be no extra taxes other than those contained in the Labour party manifesto. Yet in one afternoon on 2 July, 17 new taxes were introduced and, with the exception of the windfall tax, it is almost impossible to find reference to any of them in the Labour party's manifesto. Indeed, when we debate later clauses the Opposition look forward to exposing Labour Members for the hideous way in which they have broken promises left, right and centre.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): I want to raise a point that was discussed a short time ago in the House but which was not answered satisfactorily. How many of the 22 taxes that the hon. Gentleman's Government introduced during the previous Parliament were mentioned in the Conservative party's manifesto for the 1992 election?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should remind members of the Committee that the debate is ranging far wider than the schedule. It would be helpful to all if Mr. Woodward would return to his speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am sadly grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton. Your ruling gives me considerable cause for sadness because I should have liked the opportunity to set the record straight. However, I understand why Labour Members do not appreciate straight records.
<P>
This is a careless tax because, at its heart, it will hit the consumer and those who work for the relevant companies. When one reads the schedule one becomes painfully aware of the fact that the Labour party has looked with considerable detail at a formula for taxing the companies--that much is not in doubt. There is no question about the fact that the Labour party is the best-trained machine anywhere on the globe for working out how to tax. However, it is no good at understanding how to create the wealth that provides the taxation for creating real jobs.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I hesitate to repeat previous arguments, but neither the hon. Gentleman nor any of his colleagues have been able to grasp one simple fact, namely, that the three main regulated industries said that the arguments that the hon. Gentleman posed--and which he keeps on reiterating--about the consumer paying the price are totally erroneous. They have said--and this fact has been quoted in the Financial Times during the previous months and even before the general election, especially by Ian Byatt--that the costs will not be passed on to the consumer. Did the hon. Gentleman read those comments and would he like to comment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Lady obviously looks forward to the prospect of a little bear-baiting, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to share with members of the Committee--and especially with the hon. Lady--a press release from Thames Water. I shall very much enjoy reading it to the Committee, especially because it is at her invitation.
<P>
On 3 July, Thames Water examined the consequences of the windfall tax. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are pleased that The Chancellor confirmed the tax will be a one-off and that the net has been spread widely.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Like many other companies, it shares the Opposition's views--it wants to find ways to help people to get back to work. It estimates that its tax will be somewhere in the region of &#163;230 million. It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although the formula adopted by The Chancellor does seem to disadvantage water companies as a group, we note that the distribution of the tax within our sector acknowledges the handicap Thames was given at the time of flotation, when we had no cash injection and a relatively high flotation value compared to profits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far, so good for the hon. Member for Rochdale. But, the company goes on to say that &#163;230 million is a very large sum, adding:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although current investment programmes are likely to be maintained,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--and the hon. Lady may wish to take notes on this--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``there inevitably will be an impact on our business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Lady wish to intervene on that point, or is she taking notes?
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I think that my brain capacity is large enough to listen to the whole of the quote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> We Conservatives have to be sure of these things.
<P>
The Press release goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We shall borrow to pay the tax and so in the short term customers' bills will not be affected. However, the medium term regulatory implications for investment and pricing will eventually need to be discussed with OFWAT.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I will give way in a moment because it is always a pleasure to engage in socratic dialogue with the hon. Member for Rochdale--[Interruption.] We will keep it socratic. Members on the Government Benches are obviously getting very excited at the prospect of hearing more of the Thames Water press release. 
<P>
Crucially, what the hon. Member for Rochdale must recognise is that those who have built that highly successful business do want to see people in jobs and wish the Government's welfare-to-work programme well. We all wish it well, even if we are sceptical and do not believe that it will create real jobs. To take just one individual off the unemployment register would be something to welcome, but the reality is that we cannot take &#163;230 million from a company and not expect it to impact on investment, research and development, jobs or consumer bills. The press release demonstrates that Thames can get by in the short-term by borrowing. But, just as Labour Governments have shown time after time, one can go on borrowing, but sooner or later it has to be paid back or people have to be laid off.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman. In previous contributions in the House, the hon. Gentleman has, in the pursuit of economic literacy, tried to educate me on the terms of the regulatory regimes of the water industry. Perhaps I can ask his indulgence for some clarification now, given how honourable he is. First, as I understand it--and I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would care to pay attention to me as he addressed so much of his contribution to my good self--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not know whether the hon. Lady was in the Room earlier when I suggested that interventions should be relatively brief and should not be speeches. If she would bring her remarks to a close, the Honourable Gentleman, who has the Floor, will be able to respond.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I will bear that in mind, Mrs. Winterton, and will stop the humour and get to the point. The point is that if you know so much about people like Ian Byatt--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not me.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Winterton. If the hon. Gentleman is so keen an analyst, he will perhaps have considered that the Director General of Water Services, Ian Byatt, has great knowledge of all the capital, the dividends, the investment, the international investment and the non-core business of companies as august as Thames Water. He has taken all that into consideration in consulting City of London analysts but still believes that the tax will have no impact on customers. He is so confident of Thames Water's financial position, given its five-year write-off of the green dividend, that he intends to drive down prices over the next five years in negotiating the pricing formula.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I have managed to make notes on almost all the hon. Lady's intervention, but will she phrase her question more precisely because I am at something of a loss without my analyst?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> If Mr. Byatt--and I am sure the hon. Lady would want to include Professor Stephen Littlechild and the other regulators--has such detailed knowledge and such a grasp of the facts and figures, how is it that the Labour party has singularly failed in the Bill to regulate those industries which are subject to an additional windfall tax? Does not the regulator bear some blame for not having got his sums right, with the result that we need an additional tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I would be more than happy to give way to the hon. Member for Rochdale again, but I suspect that hon. Members may want me to make progress.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Rochdale cannot answer a question in an intervention; she can only ask one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodford:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton, for asserting some control over Labour Members, who are a little incontinent in their habits.
<P>
The tax reveals good old Labour interventionist thinking. Labour Members have seen an opportunity and, as the opportunists that they are and have always been, they have seized it. I am concerned that, in prosecuting the formula, they have taken no account of the effect that it will have on the national picture for ordinary people up and down the country.
<P>
I should now declare an interest. After leaving university, my first job was with the National Consumer Council, which was established by a Labour Government to help consumers. It is fitting, therefore, for a Labour Government to pay close attention to the NCC's words. The NCC has considered the consequences of the Bill and has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The costs of the windfall tax must not be passed on to consumers . . . If this were the case, the costs would fall proportionately most heavily on those on low incomes.''  One of my real concerns about the calculation of the formula is that, although the Government have spent numerous hours working out how to tax companies--albeit in a way that is unjust and iniquitous--I believe that they have spent little time calculating how the formula will impact on the consumer.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): In view of the hon. Gentleman's concern about low-income consumers, will he comment on the fact that average bills received by Thames Water customers have increased by more than 80 per cent. since privatisation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Lady makes an interesting observation. We must examine what has happened with the water companies, which is very simple. The companies have had to invest in infrastructure and jobs and in putting right a water system which for too long was in the hands of the state--in the hands of people who did not understand the importance of investment, infrastructure, research and development. Countless water companies up and down the country have made significant investment in water quality.
<P>
Those billions of pounds could never have been found from the public purse or from taxation--at least, certainly not under a Conservative Government, although a Labour Government may feel differently about taxing. A responsible Government could never have provided the necessary degree of investment in intrastructure to supply Britain with water for the 21st century. Crucially, throughout the country, we have seen the quality of rivers up, the quality of our beaches up and the quality of water up. The hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) might prefer it if we had sub-quality water or if the Government still held those water companies in their hands. After all, that was Labour party policy for years. Labour Members voted against privatisation time after time. The truth is that it has brought enormous benefits to the consumer.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I give way, I know not to whom because I seem to have excited so many Members on the Government Benches that, if I do not, there may be a riot.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is for the hon. Gentleman to decide to whom he wishes to give way. It is not for me to choose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Dudley, North.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. Would he like me to read out the other part of the National Consumer Council document from which he read? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Utility customers should not end up paying twice. They have already provided companies with excess profits because the original price controls were too loose''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to the price controls imposed by the Conservative Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend would like to comment on the complete incoherence of those of the Government Benches. From two Labour Members we hear that the regulators are appallingly loose, clearly do not know their jobs, and have done nothing other than to allow prices to rise by 80 per cent. The hon. Member for Rochdale, however, has many connections with, and know a lot about, the water industry. In past lives she and I worked with and for the water industry. She uses Ian Byatt--the very regulator whom her hon. Friends are so keen to brand incompetent--as the basis for her defence of the tax. Either she is right or her hon. Friends are right--they cannot all be right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford makes an interesting point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton</b><i> rose</i>--<p>
<p><b>Mr. Woodward:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for alowing me to make another interesting point, which might clear up our difficulties. The hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands quoted the average price rise for the Thames Water Authority. Is my hon. Friend aware that the Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries--one of the independent watchdogs for the water industry--produced figures that showed that, in the seven years since privatisation, the average measured bill rise for Thames Water Authority's water and sewerage companies was 30 per cent. in real terms. The centre found:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The main reason for these increases has been the need to fund the large investment programme of environmental and other improvements driven by European Union Directives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report highlights a wide variation in average bills among water companies. Despite the variation--30 per cent. here, 80 per cent. there and a wide variation elsewhere--all will be clobbered by the same completely arbitrary P rate.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Once again, I must tell the Committee that interventions must be precisely that. They must not be speeches in their own right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his important intervention because it allows me to make a crucial point to which I am sure Labour Members will again not wish to respond. If they are so concerned about the level of water bills, perhaps they will tell the public which environmental measures they would not have wanted to be introduced by the water companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I want to drag him reluctantly from his script back to the subject of investment. He claimed earlier that infrastructure would be adversely affected. Thames Water's investment programme has fallen by one third since privatisation and in my constituency Southern Water has told me it will take 20 years to rectify the problem of lead in pipes in many places in Hove and Portslade. That does not suggest that privatisation has worked in terms of investment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the hon. Member for Witney rises to his feet, may I remind the Committee that we are debating schedule 1 which covers the quantification of a privatisation windfall? It would be helpful if we could return to that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> That obviously leaves me in some difficulty in replying to the hon. Gentleman in detail, but I am more than happy to reply briefly, if that is permissible, Mrs. Winterton. It is clear that, if a company is taxed and money is taken away from it, there will be less money for investment or for jobs; if there is not to be less money for investment or for jobs, there must be an increase in consumer bills. The money must come from somewhere. The hon. Member for Rochdale shakes her head; I shall have to invite her back to my school of economic literacy and explain that what goes up must come down. If someone is taxed, the money must be found to pay the tax.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) referred to investment by Thames Water and Southern Water. If those companies are taxed and the hon. Gentleman believes that there is already not enough money for investment, there will be even less as a result of the tax.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> In the continuing educational dialogue, will the hon. Gentleman tell me whether he wishes to educate me further on his great knowledge of the difference between regulation and the regulator? Perhaps he agrees that the regulator exists to ensure that the Government's policy on regulation is implemented and that the details in the Bill on the pricing formula and the intrinsic powers of the regulator are not in the regulator's hands. It is for the regulator to police the provisions of the Act, but it is for the Government to define the measures that he must police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Lady has made a telling point, which shows that she has used her dictionary and understands the difference between a regulator and a regulation. Perhaps we can take her to our homework club later on and help her out.
<P>
The question that the Government must answer, and to which the Paymaster General may like to respond, is what steps will they take to ensure that the regulators will not allow the windfall tax to be passed on to consumers as an allowable cost. The National Consumer Council raised that crucial point in its very valid press release, to which the hon. Gentleman has already referred--although I am unsure whether he and I are quoting from the same document; I shall allow him to be confused. The press release says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The regulators should not allow the windfall tax to be passed on as an allowable cost to consumers; and ensure that companies' financing of the windfall tax does not have an adverse affect on their investment or quality of service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In relation to the formula that we are discussing, will the Paymaster General say what steps the Government will take to ensure that the regulators do not allow the windfall tax to be passed on? Or will he say that, unfortunately, he is unable--as the hon. Member for Rochdale would obviously like--to take those steps with regard to the regulator to ensure that the cost is not passed on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My concern about the schedule goes back to the point made by the hon. Member for Hove. As the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which is serviced by Southern Water, my concern is that the cost imposed by the schedule on Southern Water may jeopardise the &#163;53 million sewarage plant that that company proposes to build in my constituency--the first time that we will have had secondary treatment of sewage in the area, which is currently pumped, untreated, straight into the sea. The schedule could jeopardise that whole project.
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to my hon. Friend's point about how the regulations have changed to ensure that the schedule does not jeopardise that &#163;53 million capital spending project in my constituency and, more important, Southern Water's planned &#163;1 billion spending project in the area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I would want also to ask the Paymaster General what steps the Government will take to ensure that the companies' financing of the windfall tax does not have an adverse effect on their investment or quality of service. The hon. Member for Hove voiced his concerns about infrastructure and Southern Water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> The point that I was making, which the hon. Members for Witney and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton seem to have missed, was that those promses by Southern Water have been outstanding for some time and the windfall tax should make no difference to them because it relates to excess profits since privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a telling point about Labour party instincts. Labour Members have on their new Labour clothes, interesting, and well designed by the couturier Mandelson, but they tell us clearly that although they do not mind dividends, they do not like them being paid to shareholders, so their immediate instincts are to talk about the unfairness of dividends and to tax them at any opportunity.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford said, the schedule is unjust and creates uncertainty. It is clear from the Government's high-handed treatment of companies such as Hyder, that, even if we make representations about the unfairness, the iniquity and the uncertainty of the windfall tax, we shall be paid no regard whatever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend can once and for all nail a lie that has been going around all evening. If some &#163;100 million, &#163;200 million or &#163;300 million is taken out of a utility company, it is bound to have one of three effects. It will either increase consumers' bills, cut reinvestment or reduce dividends, in which case, the company will be more liable to takeover. Money cannot be taken out in the form of a windfall tax without one of those three things happening.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All the matters that are being debated in such a knockabout fashion across the Room should have been discussed earlier. Once again, I wish to bring the Committee back to the schedule that we are supposed to be debating tonight and ask hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to restrain themselves on the width of their words and the debate in which they are taking part. Mr Woodward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Winterton. The schedule--[Interruption.] I am sorry that Labour Members find their schedule amusing. We find it amusing for different reasons, but consumers throughout the country will not find it so amusing when their bills increase as a result of the Government's formula. The provision is inherently flawed. It is unfair on the companies; it is unfair on the selection of companies. We have discussed at length the example of Hyder, which is a good example because it reveals clearly that, when a company becomes successful, Labour Members see an opportunity to tax and--hey!--there they go cracking the pot and taking the gold. That is the reason for the formula; that is the calculation behind the schedule.
<P>
The truth is that the Government invented the windfall tax to fund a group of policies that they could implement immediately--to hit the ground running. Thus, the initiative of the welfare-to-work programme and the need for an emergency Budget were created. The formula is about trying to find a way in which to fund a Labour party spending commitment. Clearly, the proposal was in the Labour manifesto; the problem is that the Labour party did not work out the consequences of the windfall tax when this wonderful, hey-presto idea was dreamt up. It is clever because the general public, especially if they make an attempt to read the schedule and the Bill, will not realise that they are the people who will pay.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General tell us--indeed, will he pay attention--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is intervening in the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward). Perhaps he would like to ask him a question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mrs. Winterton. I am wondering whether the Paymaster General, through my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, can tell the Committee whether the Government came up with the figure of &#163;5.2 billion first and then built on it the plethora of rules and regulations to get back to the companies that would be paying that &#163;5.2 billion or whether the sum emerged as a consequence of the formula.
<P>
There are too many balancing figures. From where did the figure of 23 per cent. come? Where did the figure nine come from--apart from a spurious average of PE ratios across different sectors? I should like to know, through my hon. Friend, whether the Paymaster General can confirm which came first--the 23 per cent., the figure nine or the &#163;5.2 billion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The answer to that important intervention is that the figures came from Mystic Meg. Obviously, the Government have no idea of what the real figures and the real costs to the companies will be. One of the most telling ways in which we can gauge that is to examine how the measure will, yet again, hit pension funds. The Budget will go down not only as a careless Budget but as a savage attack on pensioners and pension funds. The Government have robbed them by removing the advance corporation tax credit. They are now robbing them again because, of course, many pension funds invest in those utilities. The formula that has been used does not take proper account of the impact on consumers.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In summary, it is nonsense to suggest that the formula is fair and that it will help companies. They will comply, but, frankly, they will have no choice when the Bill is enacted other than to do so, as Thames Water and Hyder have made perfectly clear. However, it is not clear from the formula whether there is any guarantee that the tax will not impact on prices, investment or jobs in those utilities in the short, medium or long term.
<P>
The formula will allow a quick smash and grab on the utilities. It will create real burdens on companies such as Hyder which will have to borrow &#163;280 million to pay for that smash-and-grab raid. The formula demonstrates in spades that Labour did not think about how the companies would pay for its promises to the electorate when it produced its magical windfall tax.
<P>
Labour remains interventionist, and it remains careless. This is a tax on the few--a few companies. However, the formula will ultimately reveal that it is not a tax on the few, but a tax on consumers throughout the country--a tax on the many.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I begin with three small points--indeed, I shall make a rather short speech. First, I owe it to the Committee to apologise to the hon. Members for Eastwood and for Rochdale. It is perhaps a sign of my advancing years--albeit, when I first met them I was the Minister responsible for the statutory youth service among other things--that I inaccurately said that they were general secretaries of the National Union of Students; they were, of course, presidents of it. Unless my arithmetic has failed as well, I recall that no fewer than five hon. Members--
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Six.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept the Lady's correction. I shall ask her later which hon. Member I had forgotton. Six former presidents of the National Union of Students are now hon. Members. Some of us who might well have observed, either at great or small distance, union affairs, may think that they formed the dignified part of the constitution; the general secretary discharging the efficient part. If I had inadvertently extended any discourtesy to the hon. Members for Eastwood and for Rochdale, I withdraw it. I am pleased that they are here and, indeed, that they are taking a lively part in the Committees proceedings.
<P>
The second point that I should like to make follows on from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Witney on the utilities. I promise not to take the Committee down memory lane, but it was either in this Room or within a few feet of it that I spoke at great length in Committee debates on the previous Act with which I was involved which was guillotined--the Water Act 1989.
<P>
I can confirm my hon. Friend's understanding: the purpose of that Act was to free up resources to improve the infrastructure in water and the management of water facilities. It was understood at the time that very large sums--tens of billions of pounds--needed to be brought into the water industry to rectify a long period of neglect and that that would have consequential effect of prices. Therefore, it is not surprising that water utilities have increased their prices, although it is questionable whether those increases would have been greater if they had stayed in the public sector and an attempt had been made to sustain a similar investment programme. I remind the Committee that the prices of most utilities have dropped since privatisation--if not in cash terms, certainly in real terms.
<P>
I add a gloss to a matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. He said that companies faced with the charge set out in the schedule would have no choice but to comply with it. That clearly is the case. Indeed, if I were a board chairman faced with such a situation, I would be anxious, in terms of the impact on the share price, not to make more of meal of it than I decently could, because I should not wish unnecessarily to alarm people. However, there is another avenue that may yet be an indirect risk for the Government.
<P>
As I mentioned earlier, for reasons known to the Committee I do not have any interest in privatised utilities. However, it would be open to any shareholder who felt that the board was being unduly supine or negative to test in the courts whether the board was fulfilling its fiduciary duty to the shareholders and the company by failing to test in the courts some of the anomalies in the Bill identified by my Friends. I cannot say whether that will happen.
<P>
In certain respects--perhaps the Paymaster General will join me in this--it would be for the benefit of all if the matter was tested in the courts, objectively and outside the political debate. It would then be clear whether boards were entitled to sit under that lash without attempting to resist it. Clearly it is for them in the first instance, but it is open to shareholders at least to test the decisions of boards made on their behalf.
<P>
I have not a long speech to make, but I shall recall one or two points from earlier discussions. First, it must be incontestable, because it is almost a matter of definition, that the windfall tax differentiates between companies according to whether or not they are privatised. I mean whether or not they have gone through a certain privatisation process, not necessarily whether all their acitivities are within the regulated sector.We have debated that matter at length.
<P>
Secondly, it seems pretty clear that the new tax is related to United Kingdom equities, which, as we debated at length, does not affect those who benefit from the privatisation of overseas equities. By definition, therefore, we are not sweeping up all the fat cats--alleged fat cats--[Interruption.] I am using the Government's rhetoric in my characteristic way to build support for my argument.
<P>
Beyond that, it is arguable that the tax structure that has been selected discriminates between taxes on so-called windfall profits and taxes on other kinds of profit, which are normally charged to corporation tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spoke with a great deal of knowledge about that.
<P>
The effect, which may not be intended, is to create many problems in the interpretation and implementation of double tax agreements, agreements by which the Treasury rightly sets great store. There are more than 100 of them, and I would hate to be the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the Paymaster General or a Treasury official if those agreements had to be renegotiated. The difficulty is that the tax is not rolled up into a surcharge in corporation tax. That may be for political reasons; it may be drafting or contingent reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the representations made by the Institute of Taxation, which raised a similar issue. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For non-resident shareholders of companies subject to the windfall tax, capital gains on UK shares will not generally be subject to taxation in the UK, particularly under the terms of applicable double taxation treaties. By imposing the windfall tax on the corporation itself, the UK Government is effectively taxing shareholder gains in breach of its double taxation agreement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the tax is in breach of the whole range of double-tax agreements, and that could well jeopardise our standing in international trade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am indeed grateful to my hon. Friend, who is a formidable practitioner in these matters, for raising that. I am sure that the Paymaster General will have heard what my hon. Friend said and will want to respond to it. I am not too clear about the mechanism whereby the measure could be tested, but it seems unfortunate that the matter was ever raised. It would be unwise of the Paymaster General to take the thing too lightly because my experience of international litigation is that it is extremely expensive and may lead to embarrassments for Her Majesty's Government.
<P>
I accept that it was arguable that the tax had a rather strange structure which created problems in regard to double tax. However, the domestic impact, in practice, of the tax differentiates the various tax liabilities on the various companies without confining itself to the conduct of regulated business, and thus sweeps in a range of other matters that may or may not be contingent on the tax. It is not clear that that differentiation--which is set out or implemented by the schedule; as we all know, the legislation is tailored on the basis of categories and then linked back to the companies because there are legal difficulties in doing it the other way round--can be clearly related to any notional index of alleged fat-cattery, profits or anything else. The level of the tax is a contingent matter and has much to do with the convenience of finding a legal method of defining a framework of liability.
<P>
It is fairly certain from our earlier debates that the people who will be hit are not related to those who may or may not have benefited from the initial privatisation process. It has been said several times that some privatisations took place 13 years ago, while other privatisations are much more recent, but that the turnover in the share register, even among the population in general, has been so great that one cannot relate today's tax to notional gain in the previous decade.
<P>
My final point is that however the Government present it, this cannot be a cost-free exercise. During the election campaign, I was struck by an assertion made by my Labour opponent--although it did not win him the election. I noted it at the time because I found it so impudent that I felt I should store it up for future reference. I asked him at a joint election meeting whether he could assure me that the proposed windfall tax--of which, at that stage, the Committee and ourselves had no details--would have no impact on consumers or taxpayers in regard to an offset against other taxes, shareholders or investment. He told me straight--and I accept that it was his view--that there was to be no such impact. It is in no sense plausible to say that one can levy a tax that raises &#163;5 billion without affecting somebody in the process. Who it is, how much it is, how it is differentiated, how it is paid over time and how it can be overtaken by other factors are all matters of judgement, but simply to say, ``It really does not matter, it is all in the past, nothing will happen from it,'' seems to me a strange notion of economics.
<P>
As I said earlier, I think that the burden will inevitably be carried by companies' long-term investment programmes and will also affect their implementation of additional measures that are in the public interest--over and above the minimum requirements of the regulator--to which they might otherwise have subscribed. The tax is being levied in pursuit of what may be a laudable aim--the aim of getting young people back to work--the proposal is based on a shaky relationship between a one-off tax, which we shall explore in a moment, and a welfare-to-work programme which I do not believe can be discharged within the four-year period prescribed in the Red Book.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the programme has to continue beyond that time because it has not met the Government's objectives, some hard decisions will have to be taken. I predict that the Government will introduce a new Finance Bill, saying, ``Let's have another sort of tax.'' That tax might be called an energies tax, a utilities tax or a windfall tax mark II--new windfall. The Government will have to go through the process all over again to last for the next quinquennium--hopefully for them, implausibly for us.
<P>
The anomalies of the tax are great that it is impossible to make it absolutely fair on all who will pay it. The tax is over and above existing corporation tax; it is over and above regulation, which is the right way of securing social objectives; and I want no part of it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I could put a slightly different spin on the debate and address some comments to the Paymaster General, as we have heard some unsatisfactory claims that the American tax authorities are hunky-dory about the arrangement.
<P>
Let us consider some figures to contrast what happens in the United Kingdom with what happens on the continent. The average household electricity bill in this country is about &#163;317, whereas in France it is equivalent to &#163;366, in Italy it is &#163;360 and in Germany it is &#163;394.
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will say what consultations the Government have had with authorities on the continent. Is the windfall tax based on any similar experiences on the continent? If not, will the Government be advising Mr. Jospin's new Government on how to elicit similarly large sums of money from the poor, unwilling privatised companies in France? [Hon. Members: ``To meet the Maastricht criteria.''] Indeed, as my hon. Friends rightly say, to meet the Maastricht criteria.
<P>
What amazes me is that this evening we have not heard a word of praise from the Government Benches for the achievements of the utility companies that are now in a position to stump up such inordinately large amounts of money. We have heard nothing about the success of the electricity companies in reducing the cost of domestic bills by more than 10 per cent. in real terms since 1990. We have heard nothing about the fact that generation costs have fallen by a third since privatisation, saving the generating industry &#163;2,300 million per annum. That has come about as a result of greater productivity and switching to cheaper, cleaner sources of energy such as gas, which has brought concomitant environmental advantages.
<P>
We have heard nothing about the electricity industry's &#163;1.9 billion investment into its services last year. We have heard nothing about the fact that standing charges have fallen in real terms. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, the standing charge imposed by Seeboard, which was &#163;43.36 in 1991, is now just &#163;17. Those are great achievements, which have brought in more revenue for all the companies.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I wonder whether the hon. Member could bring his remarks back to the schedule that we are debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Mrs. Winterton. I was giving some background--an important art of the debate that has been absent this evening. Labour Members have countless stories about how the utility companies have brought great benefits to their constituencies, but have been rather shy in telling them. 
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has ably demonstrated, our argument is that no proper regard has been paid to the consequences of the tax on our relations with overseas investors. What will happen if the bid for Energy Group does not go through? Will the Government say, ``That is an example of how overseas investors have lost confidence in investing in this country because of the windfall tax, whose cold, stark negative effects on the investor and the consumer in this country we now see in great detail''?
<P>
No regard has been paid to the job of the regulator. No regard has been paid to the fact in the year 2000, when the electricity distribution companies will renegotiate their prices, a key element in that renegotiation will be the debts levels of those companies. Virtually every regional electricity company that takes a hit from the windfall tax will have to pay it out of borrowings. My regional electricity company, Seeboard, will have to increase its gearing to more than 160 per cent. That is a key element in the pricing formula that will be considered by the regulator in the year 2000. That must lead to higher prices for the consumer; there is no other solution.
<P>
Earlier, the Paymaster General queried my views on tax in a rather strange question about the relationship between higher profits and higher tax. Actually, I think that we were agreeing. The point is, however, that the windfall tax is not a standard tax. Most of those companies that will have to pay the windfall tax have already stumped up normal standard corporation tax this year and in previous years. The windfall tax will clobber them on a one-off, arbitrary basis; it is not a standard tax.
<P>
We now know all the implications of that. It will not qualify investors in America for release, it will breach the mutual tax agreements on which my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has so ably elaborated. It is an extra tax on companies, most of which already pay large quantities of corporation tax to the exchequer. Those which do not pay large quantities of corporation tax to the Exchequer do not do so because, as I mentioned earlier, they are committed to large investment programmes.
<P>
Labour Members referred frequently to articles in the Financial Times. In the Financial Times today, we read about another example of further investment made by a water company--this time Wessex Water, which is investing an extra &#163;28 million above and beyond what is required by the regulator to install two new treatment plants at its coastal sewage works.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is a good lesson for all new Members to remember that, rather than be as self-indulgent as they have been this evening, they must ensure that their speeches refer to the schedule that we are supposed to be debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for the degree of indulgence that you have allowed me, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It concerns me that the rough-and-ready method by which the schedule calculates the level of tax to be borne by the water industry, in particular, rides roughshod over &#163;100 million here and &#163;300 million here.
<P>
In Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, we are debating with Southern Water, which will be subject to hundreds of millions of pounds of the windfall tax because of the rough-and-ready formula, the minutiae of a &#163;10 million difference between the cost of one particular treatment scheme that is has in mind and another which the local district council would like. One is proposing enhanced primary treatment; the other would like secondary or tertiary treatment. The difference in price is about &#163;10 million, which would not even fall within the margin of error of the schedule's calculations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already advised the Committee twice tonight that interventions should be brief. I have been very flexible and allowed members of the Committee--especially new Members on both sides--to be rather indulgent. I do not intend to be quite so indulgent in future, and I hope that members of the Committee will remember that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton, and I repeat our thanks for your indulgence. However the issue is wide-ranging, and I think that the points that I have been trying to make relate to the fact that many different things are going on in the many different utility companies, all of which will hit by the broad-brush windfall tax.
<P>
We have cited examples of certain companies that have done things beyond and above their regulatory requirements; they will be clobbered with the same sledgehammer of the windfall tax. The obvious consequences of that will include pricing--certainly after the year 2000 for the electricity companies.
<P>
The Labour Government are trying to convince us that the windfall tax is part of their fair tax policy because they genuinely believe that the utility companies were undersold and that there are fat-cat figures sitting on mattresses under which there are great pots of gold, that the British public were sold a pup and that their assets were sold cheaply. If that were so, surely the obvious conclusion would be not to try to hijack this money,--especially not for the Government's latest politically correct soundbite scheme, the welfare-to-work-project--but to redirect it back to the consumers.
<P>
Consumers represent the vast majority of people in this country who, in the eyes of the Labour party, were legged over. If they were to return the money to the consumer it would mean between &#163;250 and &#163;300 a year to the average household, based on &#163;500 billion-worth of windfall tax. There are precedents for it: we heard earlier how National Grid resulted in a special dividend of &#163;50 to every consumer, deducted from their bills. There are many easy ways of doing it. If the Government are not prepared to do that, will they at least guarantee that pensioners, who the Labour party tell us are among the most vulnerable people, will not suffer if the result of the windfall tax is an increase in costs, as we have strongly argued will be the case?
<P>
The Government have not given such guarantees because they are interested not in the consumer but in a dogmatic, politically motivated smash-and-grab raid on what they have identified as public enemy No. 1. That is at the heart of their argument, which is why we continue to reject the precept of the windfall tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Schedule 1 is the meat of the windfall tax argument because it will implement the tax. It sets out in considerable detail, as I might have to do in this intervention, how the Government will implement the tax.
<P>
I shall start with a few general remarks and then go on to the specific points. The difference between a windfall profits tax and a windfall gains tax has been a common misnomer in the Committee. The windfall profits tax which were instituted on the banks in the early 1970s was mentioned this evening. But the Government propose a windfall gains tax, which is an entirely different kettle of fish. It will tax capital, not income. 
<P>
That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was absolutely right to point out to the Paymaster General the difficulties involved in the double taxation agreements. As I understand it, those agreements allow for taxation of the capital of shareholders in the domicile in which they reside. Thus there are likely to be problems with American shareholders because the Government are attempting to tax their gains in this country, whereas the double taxation agreements provide for them to be taxed in America. If my assertion is correct, that is a serious shortfall which the Government have omitted to consider carefully. I hope that the Paymaster General will give further guidance in his summing up, because it is a serious matter.
<P>
The tax reveals at least two of Adam Smith's dictums on a bad tax. It is arbitrary in its effect: it takes a particular class of companies privatised by the previous Government and attempts to tax them because the Government believe that the previous Government sold off those companies too cheaply. That is absolute rubbish; we took proper advice from some of the best companies in the City on each and every one of those privatisations. The price at which a company can be sold is a perception; it is all too easy with hindsight to say, ``Well, of course, it could have been higher,'' when one sees the gain in the weeks and months after privatisation. Of course, if one pitches the price too high, one risks leaving it all with the underwriters. That is precisely what we did not want to do time after time, otherwise we would have ended up not selling the final privatisations because the underwriters would have refused to underwrite. Thus the tax is arbitrary in its effect.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is also arbitrary because it affects a particular class of shareholders and a particular class of consumers now, not when the windfall gains were made. After all, the gains were made largely by those people who stagged the issue at the time of privatisation or sold fairly soon after. The really crafty and canny investors saw the present Government coming and sold their shares long before the perceived effects of a Labour Government were felt.
<P>
Secondly, the windfall tax displays Adam Smith's dictum on a bad tax because it discriminates against a particular class of taxpayer. It seems entirely wrong that one should select certain of the companies that we privatised and ignore others which have been equally profitable--one thinks of Amersham International, AEI, Britoil, British Petroleum and National Freight Corporation, from whose shares, if one had held them from privatisation, one would have made a considerable amount of money.
<P>
A much better principle of taxation is to be fair across the board. I cannot understand why the Labour party did not simply increase the rate of corporation tax. It would have been much simpler to implement, much fairer to all investors and company managers and better that the arbitrary scheme that we have now.
<P>
Schedule 1 is long and complicated, but several aspects of it should be aired because they have not been debated so far. I shall try to deal with those now.
<P>
First, the Government have chosen a rate of 23 per cent., which seems an odd rate to choose. It is worth noting that, largely as a result of the Budget, we now have nine rates of common basic taxes. That takes us back to the pre-Nigel Lawson simplification scheme. All that the current situation will do for the calculation of the windfall tax formula and for other measures in the Budget is provide more work for tax practitioners. It will certainly make next year's completion of formulae and self-assessment by the taxpayer extremely complicated. I suspect that the average taxpayer will have great difficulty in completing his self-assessment--not that the windfall tax applies to that, but it is worth making the general point. The tax schedules that the taxpayer must fill in next year will be mammothly complicated and he will certainly need a computer to work them out.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Yes, indeed, Mr Clifton-Brown, you must stop. You know as well as I do that I am expecting you to speak on schedule 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Yes, Mrs. Winterton, I was attempting to do that. I was commenting on the arbitrary rate of 23 per cent., as outlined in the schedule.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is in clause 1, whereas we are debating schedule 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Winterton, but the total tax yield is greatly affected by the formula in paragraph 2(2) of schedule 1. One has to read that formula along with the rate of tax to work out the overall yield. It is the overall yield, of course, that will be applied to the new welfare-to-work scheme.
<P>
Moving on rapidly to a question that has already been raised, why do we have a formula that applies one uniform price-earnings ratio? It would have been much fairer if the formula had had a different price-earnings ratio for different classes of utilities. The logic of that is that one would then have had a lower rate of windfall tax than 23 per cent. to get the same tax take. That would have been much fairer than applying an overall, uniform and completely arbitrary method.
<P>
A number of other points need discussing. I note that the windfall gains tax formula is to be applied to the strike price at which the institutions bought shares in individual utilities, but, as we all know, many shares were sold to individuals when the utilities were privatised. Indeed, it was the specific aim of the then Government that as many individuals as possible should buy shares. So, under the schedule, the Inland Revenue will have to examine cash accounts carefully. They will have to be modified because, for a number of reasons which I shall elucidate in a moment, the bottom-line figure that appears in the cash account is not the basis on which the gain will be calculated.
<P>
The calculation will be difficult for the companies: they will have to look closely at each successive tranche of shares to see whether they were issued at the institutional strike price or at that for private individuals. That is complicated still further because some shares that were issued to private individuals may have been granted on the basis of sequential offerings. A company may not have received the money for such shares all at once. It might have received a third in the first year, a third in the second year and a third in the third year--all of that is set out in the schedule, Mrs. Winterton, before you call me to order--so such a company may not have gained all the proceeds from a particular share issue in a particular year. That is a further complication that we must consider.
<P>
Another complication--this is also set out in the schedule--is that in some privatisations, British Telecom for example, individuals were able to opt either for a discount in the share price or, if the shares were held for three years, for bonus shares. Somewhere along the line, accountants will have to do an enormous amount of devilling on each share issue to discover the correct basis on which to levy the windfall tax. Far from being simple to operate, as has been claimed by the Paymaster General throughout this evening, the tax will be extremely complicated to administer.
<P>
A further problem is contained in the schedule in that windfall gains are to be calculated on current cash accounts. But as we all know, accounting conventions have been modified continuously. There is no doubt that each utility will have used different accounting conventions and methods to produce its accounts. The share value is based on the City's analysis of the shares for a particular year, but it may be that to comply with the schedule a utility will have to re-do its accounts.
<P>
I am not sufficiently expert to know by what quantum that difference might be, but it could be quite considerable in some cases. I do not know yet whether the companies--or, indeed, the Government--have taken into account the difficulties that I have mentioned. What do the Government think about these matters?
<P>
Paragraph 7(1) deals with demergers. Earlier, I touched on the issue of whether companies will want to separate their trading activities from their regulated activities. I had not realised that the Government, quite rightly, have set a cut-off date--2 July 1997--for a demerger to have taken effect. But companies that have made a substantial profit from trading will now think carefully when dealing with this particular formula about demerging their activities in future. The effect of that will be that efficient companies that have profitable trading activities will be tempted to demerge. Companies that have made a mess of their trading activities, and where such activities are dragging down the whole company's performance, including the regulated performance, will have difficulty in demerging the subsidiaries. The regulated activities, on which the customer depends for efficient reinvestment and the price of his utility bills, will therefore suffer.
<P>
The operation of the schedule is ingenious because the tax has not been operated before. I hope, however, that this is a one-off tax and that we shall not be debating it again in another guise and in relation to other companies--bad habits can all too easily be repeated.
<P>
There is no doubt--I would ask the Government to come back to these words in Hansard in three years time--that once the Government have put the detail of the schedule into operation, consumers will find that, no matter what the Government say, their bills will rise as a result of the windfall tax. I warn the Government that that will happen. If that does not happen, the level of reinvestment will fall and all the benefits that the consumer has gained will be lost. I have opened many new sewage works and new water works, and I know that new accounting methods have been introduced in Swindon in the electricity companies. Huge improvements have been made in such companies since privatisation, and I want that to continue in the interests of the consumer, but it will not do so now that the Government have produced the windfall tax.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call anyone else, I ask hon. Members on the Government Back Benches not to talk so loudly. It is extremely distracting and discourteous to those who are speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friends have asked some penetrating questions during the schedule stand part debate. I look forward to a correspondingly full and detailed reply from the Paymaster General. I, too, have some questions to add.
<P>
During earlier deliberations on an Opposition amendment, we debated the incidence of the tax on the companies concerned. We have now moved on to the schedule stand part debate and I can go a little wider and press the point about whether we are taxing genuine windfalls--and only windfalls--in the schedule.
<P>
The tax has its name by virtue of clause 1--we are debating a tax that is to be called the windfall tax. We are, therefore, entitled to assume that it taxes only windfall gains. It has, however, been established today that the companies that are the victims of this tax also have extraneous activities, which do not necessarily have anything to do with their core activities. In some cases, they do. Very often, companies have gone into associated operations, such as waste management and disposal, in the case of water companies. In other cases, however, their activities have diversified considerably from their main regulated activities.
<P>
Furthermore, many of the operations in which companies now engage through subsidiary companies, associated companies and partnerships with other companies are new and post-privatisation. Yet, the formula in the schedule starts with the privatisation valuation and compares it to a notional valuation, which is calculated in accordance with the schedule. Many of the activities about which I am talking, however, did not exist and the assets had not been created at the time of the flotation. It cannot therefore be right to regard the profits that arose from those activities as windfall gains.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In reply to an earlier debate, the Paymaster General did not deny that profits earned in that way through diversified activities would be subjected to the windfall tax. He confirmed that such profits would be subject to the windfall tax. However, those profits are not made through regulated activities but in the commercial, competitive marketplace--outside the core activities.
<P>
It is the Opposition's contention that such profits are not windfall profits. If the Paymaster General disputes that, we would be grateful for his explanation of why our argument is invalid. That argument has been advanced by many of my hon. Friends--as well as myself--in this and earlier debates. In the absence of a specific refutation or contradiction by the Government we are entitled to continue to assert that we are not dealing with a windfall tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Would it not have been better to have calculated the tax differently, instead of using the formula in schedule 1 for subsequent years after privatisation? If the Government wanted to determine the correct value, would it not have been better to have taken into account the four years prior to privatisation as a means of providing a more accurate method of calculating the value on the specified date?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a sound point and I hope that the Paymaster General, who will have heard the intervention, will respond to that too, for it builds on my argument.
<P>
The formula in the schedule will lead to unfairness because the tax is being applied to profits which, according to the Government's own formula, are not excessive. The Paymaster General's reply to our earlier debate was brief, inadequate and failed to address these points. The Committee has a right to a fuller explanation of why our arguments are invalid if indeed they are. If they are not invalid, what do the Government intend to do about it?
<P>
Does the Paymaster General agree that the declared profits of each company on which the tax is to be calculated contains contributions from non-regulated competitive activities which, if they were to be carried on by other competitors, would not be subject to the windfall tax? We want a specific answer to that question. If the answer is yes, we are talking not about a windfall tax but about a super corporation tax levy. To the extent that it is not a proper windfall tax, it creates manifest unfairnesses between companies that are to be subjected to the tax and others operating in the commercial marketplace. It also creates unfairnesses within those sectors--one company against another. Some companies have successfully diversified and others have failed to do so.
<P>
I have not had to consult my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry's mother about the issue, but I am sure that she would tell me that one company's share price can vary considerably with another's, even in the same sector, in accordance with the success or otherwise of diversification. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is nodding; he may have had a chance to discuss it with his mother on the telephone. We are dealing not simply with privatised utilities, but with British diversified companies. They are successful, expanding and varied, but they are all being squeezed into the same formula, which pretends that all the profits that they have made since privatisation are windfall profits.
<P>
One of my hon. Friends also alluded to the connection between the windfall tax and the double taxation agreement, particularly the one with the United States. I should like to change gear for a moment and ask a few questions on that subject. Double taxation agreements are complicated--they are almost a subject in themselves--but they are important. The United Kingdom has signed many of those agreements, which is right because we are an international investor and trader or we are nothing. We are beneficiaries of a double taxation system in that it prevents, by definition, double taxation and encourages the flow of capital, goods and investments worldwide. The Treasury is the repository of those double taxation agreements, which are also worked out with the Foreign Office. They are painfully negotiated and sometimes renegotiated with an expanding number of countries. It would obviously be extremely serious if the Government were to do anything, deliberately or by mistake, in their legislation which in any way put at risk existing or future double taxation agreements, because retaliation is possible. If we act in defiance of the wishes of other countries and they retaliate, the entire system could unravel.
<P>
I should like an assurance from the Paymaster General that he has consulted other countries that may be affected and received an assurance that nothing in the Bill breaches or threatens double taxation agreements. One of my hon. Friends has already asked whether that tax is allowable as a credit in the hands of overseas shareholders, particularly those from the United States. It is not good enough for the Government simply to say that that is a matter for foreign Governments. It is not: it is also a matter for us for the reasons that I have explained. The integrity of the double taxation system is of extreme importance to us and it is essential that we do not say, ``We have not thought about that. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's hope no one notices.'' That is an irresponsible attitude.
<P>
Perhaps I can give a more specific example of a possible danger. For non-resident shareholders, capital gains on United Kingdom shares are not generally subject to taxation in the United Kingdom. In the schedule the Government are imposing a windfall tax not on the shareholders, who may be resident elsewhere, but on the companies themselves, so we have an effective capital gains tax on the companies, which would be unrelieved in the hands of non-resident shareholders under the terms of the double taxation agreements. I hope that the Government have found a way round that or have at least discussed it with the tax authorities, particularly in the United States, to ensure that no breach is threatened of any double taxation agreements. We need to know what advice the Government have taken and what, if any, risk exists to those important agreements.
<P>
There is another reason for--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My right hon. Friend touched on an important point that I, too, have raised. If we are to encourage international trade, it is essential that the double taxation agreements work, that they are seen to work, and that both parties uphold all the obligations under them. It would be very serious if the windfall tax were to threaten that arrangement.
<P>
<B>Mr Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon Friend obviously has some experience of the matter. I cannot overemphasise the difficulty of negotiating many such agreements. I alluded earlier to my travels to south America. On two of my visits I attempted to persuade foreign Governments--or, more specifically, the relevant Parliaments--to ratify a double taxation agreement. That is not always easy, because Parliaments naturally take a somewhat nationalistic view and do not necessarily like the idea of foreign residents--or their own residents--being relieved of taxation because of the incidence of British taxation. Although the Executive arm of those Governments is often highly co-operative and despite the fact that we have good relations with the tax authorities in many of those countries--their equivalent of the Inland Revenue--it is often extremely difficult to clear the final political hurdle and to persuade the country to ratify the agreement.
<P>
I remember that we had an especially difficult time in Colombia, where the President was keen on an agreement--he was anxious to promote the flow of investment into Colombia and he wanted to encourage Colombian companies to come here--but the Colombian Parliament took a rather more restrictive view. That very much emphasises my hon. Friend's view. Anything that we do that might jeopardise such agreements and cause foreign Governments or their Parliaments to say that the British Government were blundering ahead and putting at risk existing double taxation agreements would be serious and could cause the entire system to unravel very much to the detriment of our country. Titanically large flows of investments into and out of the country are involved. I therefore agree with my hon. Friend's argument.
<P>
We should clarify the status of the levy or tax. I put it that way because when the proposal was being planned by the Labour party it was fond of calling it a levy, which sounds much more friendly than a tax. Taxes are often nasty and we know that the Labour party opposes--or opposed--such things. The Labour party called the proposal a levy. However, a levy is in some respects rather like an expense. An expense, in a company's accounts, is not a tax; it is deducted from trading profit before the calculation of tax.
<P>
If that proposal were carried through into normal accounting arrangements the situation would become very distorted. For example, it would distort the profit-before-tax figures, which are used by the City and analysts to compare the performance of one company or sector with another. The proposal is a tax, and it is important to admit that fact. Companies account on that basis in their published accounts and in their reports to shareholders. A steer from the Government about the tax's status is therefore important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my right hon. Friend again, but it is critical to establish whether this is a windfall profits tax or a windfall gains tax. In my view it is a windfall gains tax--it will come off the balance sheet, rather than off the net profit of the company, and it will affect the capital value of the company rather than the net profit. It will thereby weaken the balance sheet of those companies.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is right; we know that that will be the effect of the tax, but it is important that the Government should come clean about that and assert from their Front Bench that that is so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Before I give way to my hon. Friend, I should say that we know that if there is any ambiguity in legislation, reference can be made to what is said in the House and in Standing Committee. I believe that the relevant legal case was Pepper v. Hart; even as an accountant, not a lawyer--and a pretty rusty accountant at that--I recollect the importance of that case. What is said by way of clarification here could affect future court proceedings, and for that reason alone we need clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My right hon. Friend raises an important point about the categorisation of the windfall levy. Whether it fits into a profit and loss account as a tax charge or an expenditure will have important consequences for how it is seen by analysts in the City of London. It will be up to accountants and auditors to determine where it fits, but can the Paymaster General tell us whether the Government have had discussions with the accountancy profession to determine where the item should sit in profit and loss accounts? That is vital to the future values of the companies concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point relating to statements of standard accounting practice, which are issued from time to time and take such matters very much into account. He has emphasised the importance of the relationship between pre-tax and post-tax profit. We need to clarify exactly where the levy, tax or charge will come off the profit and loss account. It is important for the Government to consult accountancy bodies and to make their own view clear. My hon. Friend is right that the point will finally be a matter of accounting convention, but the accounting profession may need to be clear about the Government's view.
<P>
Another matter that I wish to raise is the treatment of extraordinary items in company accounts. The schedule refers to reported profit or the profit of companies. We all know that companies frequently include extraordinary items in their reported profit. Those can vary from company to company according to each one's accounting practices and can be distorting in that a year's reported profit can be much influenced by the incidence of a particular extraordinary item in that year's account. We need to know whether the profit referred to in the schedule is to include extraordinary items or whether they are to be excluded. We need certainty on that, and some clarification, if the tax is to work in practice.
<P>
I want also to mention the schedule's effect on share prices. The main effect of levying the tax--at least in the short term--is to hit company share prices. Some Government supporters are fond of saying that that does not matter because the stock market has gone up, as though what may be a short-term rally undermines the point that the share price of relevant companies has, relatively, been hit very hard.
<P>
That is in turn proved by those Government spokesmen who have said that the market had already discounted the effect of the tax before the Finance Bill was published so that very little happened to share prices in the immediate aftermath. Of course, saying that the market had already discounted it is an admission that the tax had had an effect on share prices. And that reduction was felt not only by individual shareholders but by pension funds, which are the main holders of the affected shares. The point has been made several times by Conservative Members that the share price reduction is serious because it affects pension funds directly.
<P>
We heard a good deal in Committee two days ago about how ACT credit changes are not too serious for pension funds. It was argued that, although the long-term income flow into pension funds has been reduced, that does not matter because actuaries will take into account not the earnings flow but the capital values of the shares in those pension funds. Labour Members tried to get off the hook created by the ACT tax credit reduction by saying that pension funds will be assessed on different bases. They even hinted that the actuaries profession will be told to take a different and fresh look at the way in which pension funds are valued.
<P>
If that is the case and actuaries are to be more influenced by the prices of shares held by pension funds, a problem associated with the windfall tax will become immediately apparent. The windfall tax has reduced the capital value of shares associated with it. A separate point, made by a number of my hon. Friends, is that the present generation of shareholders hit by the windfall tax has a tenuous or incidental connection with those people who held shares when the supposed excessive profits were supposed to have been made. Most of the fat cats--the people who stagged the original share flotations--sold within days of the privatisations--certainly within a few months. Almost all of them had sold their shares and taken their profits within a year. The people, institutions and pension funds that have been hit by the reduction in share prices in the companies affected are a different generation of shareholders. They are innocent of the charge that they are fat cats who made a killing--if, indeed, that is what happened--at the time of the original privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Would my right hon. Friend care to comment on the perverse fact that a Budget and Finance Bill that were meant to promote long-term investment will, as a result of schedule 1, have the opposite effect? The lesson any sensible investor will learn from the windfall tax is that, if the Government ever privatise anything, it will be most sensible to stag the shares and get out quickly because in five years' time the Government will raid the share value of any profitable company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a shrewd and penetrating point. One of the charades of the Budget statement was its description of the Budget as a Budget for the long term. That was just a slogan. As my hon. Friend accurately points out, the effect of the windfall tax will be to persuade people to take a more short-term view of investment. People who took the short-term view--who got in and out in a matter of months--are exempt from the windfall tax. The people who are being hit are those such as the unfortunate mother of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry who, on her modest pension, was a founding shareholder in some British companies. She has loyally held her shares all this time only to find her loyalty clobbered by a Government who call her a fat cat--a rude thing to call my hon. Friend, let alone his mother. Will my hon. Friend send his mother a copy of the Official Report so that she can see that she is not a fat cat according to us?
<P>
I want to build on what my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford said and say a little more about the effect of the schedule on investment. It is indisputable that the money to pay the windfall tax--which is to be paid in two instalments--cannot be used to finance investment spending. That is too obvious to need emphasising. From that, however, it follows that companies that collectively pay that &#163;5.2 billion will have to rely on outside sources of funding to keep up their investment programmes. They will not be able to rely on their retained and existing profits to fund investment programmes that they and we regard as essential.
<P>
Should the cost of borrowing that money rise, it is tautological to say that that will mean higher prices, because the regulator must take into account that higher cost of borrowing in assessing the price formula. Alternatively--or, perhaps, in addition--there will be a reduction in investment. The argument so far is clear and irrefutable. A rise in the cost of borrowing will mean higher prices, possibly accompanied by lower investment.
<P>
The Budget raised the cost of borrowing by failing to dampen down the consumer boom--which the Chancellor agreed we were experiencing--by catching not only companies directly but individuals indirectly by raising indirect taxes, which is an inflationary measure. By weakening his inflation target, the right hon. Gentleman has contributed to inevitable tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of England, Since the election, we have experienced three interest rate rises. All those factors add up to higher borrowing costs for the utilities.
<P>
In addition, another factor is occasioned directly by the operation of the schedule. There is a risk that those companies will be weakened by the windfall tax: by the payment of those large sums of money, their balance sheets will necessarily be weaker than before. The market will reassess the credit risk of those companies. Instead of being solid utilities with comparatively strong balance sheets, they will be weakened. Inevitably that will affect the perception of those companies by the market. To the extent that the companies are higher credit risks, the cost of their borrowing will increase.
<P>
A further risk to those compnies is that they will suffer another windfall tax. If the Government consider that those companies continue to perform too well, they may return to take another slice of windfall tax in a few years' time. That could severely damage those companies' reputations in the eyes of lenders.
<P>
All those factors--the effects of the Budget and the weakened monetary stance; the fact that the utilities' balance sheets will be weakened by the transferral of the amount needed for the tax; and the possibility of another windfall tax--will raise the cost of borrowing for those companies. We have shown that companies will rely more on borrowing to fund investment and that the tax will weaken investment and raise prices. Labour Members have denied the assertion by some of my hon. Friends that the effect of the tax and the schedule will be higher charges and prices for the ordinary consumer. Will the Paymaster General give us assurances on the matter? If the hon. Gentleman disputes what I said, will he give an assurance that he will instruct the regulators under no circumstances to permit any reduction in investment or increase in prices? If what he says is true and the tax will have no adverse effects, surely he can give such an assurance, although before he does so too confidently, I refer him to the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Budget day:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is my judgement that the tax can be paid without any impact on prices, investment, or the quality of service to customers...''--[Official Report, 2nd July 1997; Vol. 297, c. 314.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That falls a long way short of a pledge; the right hon. Gentleman was merely voicing his opinion. My opinion is that the tax will indeed have an effect on prices and investment, and I explained in my earlier remarks how that logically follows from the effect of the tax and the schedule on the companies involved. So I look forward to the Paymaster General giving the assurance that the Chancellor failed to give on Budget day.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Your authority in our proceedings, Mrs. Winterton, is total, and it seems that your latitude has, at times, been similarly far-reaching. We are still discussing schedule 1 and we have a lot of ground still to cover, so the focus of my remarks will be narrow. The Opposition, on the other hand, have invited us to give advice to Lionel Jospin about his problems with the public sector borrowing requirement; they have invited us, as they usually do, to take advice from Adam Smith, and, as far as I could understand what the right hon. Member for Wells was saying, they have invited us to enter in collaborative arrangements with the Colombian Parliament. I could not see the relevance of any of those suggestions at that point in our proceedings, so I compliment the hon. Members for Ashford, for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Cotswold on the three points of substance that they raised. I want to deal with those three points.
<P>
First, it is important to deal with the issue of double taxation, which was raised in good faith by Opposition Members, although there was an element of scaremongering. Let me assure hon. Members that the measure is not in breach of any double taxation agreement. We have had discussions with American authorities and are satisfied on that point. Like them, we attach great importance to our double taxation agreements. We are an international trading country, dependent on those links and on our adherence to the standards established between ourselves and other countries.
<P>
It seems to me that there is a deliberate attempt to confuse companies with shareholders. We are taxing companies, not shareholders. Opposition Members may draw from that certain consequences--that is up to them--but the tax is imposed on the company, not on the shareholder.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Paymaster General will recall that my right hon. Friend and I spoke about the extent of those agreements, of which there are more than 100 affecting the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman referred to his discussions with American authorities. In fairness, that was the point raised by my hon. Friends because of the importance of Britain's nexus of investments with the United States. However, bearing in mind that there are other and diverse agreements, will he give similar assurance that negotiations have been undertaken with other countries, both larger ones, such as Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, and some smaller nations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that the windfall tax does not breach existing double taxation agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General has missed the point. The reason why the Chartered Institute of Taxation is so concerned about the windfall tax breaching our array of double taxation agreements is that it taxes the capital gain made on the increase in value of a company. It is not a capital gain arising within a company, albeit that the Government are taxing the company. Because of the way in which schedule 1 is drafted, the windfall tax taxes the increase in value of the company during those four years. It is effectively a capital gains tax on a company's increase in value. The double tax treaties specifically state that a capital gain will be taxed, not in the jurisdiction in which the gain arises, but only in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder resides. Some shares in the utilities are owned in the United States and the windfall tax will tax the increase in value of the shares. It is clear in my view and, more importantly, that of the Chartered Institute of Taxation that the tax is in breach of the US-UK double taxation agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> To be fair, the hon. Gentleman has made his points. He has threatened legal action, which he will undertake personally, against the central authority of the British Government. He has threatened that the Institute of Chartered Accountants--that most conservative of all bodies--will launch itself against the legislative processes in the Bill. We tremble at the prospect, but we wish him well. Let litigation commence on the claim that we are in breach of any double taxation agreement. I do not believe that we are and I think that we can now pass to other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Paymaster General makes a good joke, but I suggest that litigation may be instituted not by the Chartered Institute of Taxation or my hon. Friend, by litigious American shareholders and there are no more litigious people in the world. He may have been assured by one set of American lawyers or American Government lawyers that the Bill does not breach the agreement, but with all good intent I can only suggest that the smile will be on the other side of his face if he finds the British Government embroiled with angry Americans in a hugely expensive and long legal action in the American courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and the admonition that came with it. He speaks with great authority; perhaps he was in the tobacco industry in a previous incarnation. We are satisfied that the provision is not in breach of double taxation agreements.
<P>
A valid point was made concerning the impact of the tax on profit and loss and where it would be accounted for on the balance sheet. We are happy to discuss such matters with companies or their accountants.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred to extraordinary items which might be frequent. He is, as he admitted, a bit rusty on such matters. Extraordinary items are extremely rare, but exceptional items are more common. Perhaps he was referring to exceptional items. There is no other way of imposing the windfall tax if we want to be objective and sensible; it will be imposed at the bottom line after any extraordinary or, more likely, exceptional items.
<P>
Insofar as I could understand what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was saying about prior year adjustments, he must know as a distinguished member of his institution that prior year adjustments are hated by the profession. If any company is tempted by his comments or has any furtive thoughts of its own to try to get a prior year adjustment affecting the period in respect of which it will be taxed on windfall profits in the four-year period, we would resist that. No such prior year adjustment would be permitted in assessing the tax. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was not alluding to any tax avoidance. My point was that a genuine injustice may arise if a fundamental error occurred in the accounts and an adjustment was made in a subsequent year. That is not an infrequent occurrence in the accountancy profession. Such an adjustment could be quite large and there is no provision in the schedule to allow a just and reasonable adjustment to the windfall tax bill that the company would have received. It would have been overtaxed merely because of an error in its earlier accounts. Such errors often occur--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman intervene more briefly in future, which will probably be more effective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I take the point and stress again that we will not accept any such prior adjustments.
<P>
I turn now to the hon. Member for Cotswold, who had done his homework better than most, despite the alleged lack of time. He picked on the flotation price that we are attaching to the shares. He had not quite done all his homework as he did not push it to the logical conclusion. If, instead of the institutional price--the main price that affected most of the shares--we had taken one of the lower prices for certain categories of shareholders to which the then Government thought it appropriate to give a discount, the benefit to the company would have been diminished. The benefit would be diminished; the gain would have been greater had the issue price been less. If he thinks through the logic of that he will see that taking the institutional price was the fairest and most decent thing that we could do for the company.
<P>
That brings me logically to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Ashford which were echoed by all Opposition Members. He raised the whole basis of the tax: the price earnings ratio, the period and the tax rate that we chose. While Opposition Members can continue to drone on about how arbitrary, unfair, pernicious, vindictive, injudicious and everything else they think the tax is, there is one simple question: what would they want us to do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is why they were kicked out of office in so spectacular a fashion and why we now have this small enclave, represented so worthily here tonight from the south of England, and no representatives from the once great national party in Wales or Scotland. Those are the fruits of doing nothing. We gave a manifesto pledge. Do Opposition Members suggest, if you will excuse a slight digression, Mrs. Winterton, that we should break all our promises, like they did? We promised to have a windfall tax. We said what we would do with it and we are now delivering our promise. That is why we were voted in and why the Government are wholly behind the proposed measures.
<P>
The price-earnings ratio is low; the tax rate is low. We could use the capital gains tax rates if the hon. Member for Ashford wanted that. We could use the price-earnings rate for each individual sector if he wanted that. We could come out with an average listing for utilities in the Financial Times, as was suggested in an earlier amendment, which would give Government windfall tax takings of &#163;17 billion. Instead of that, we have taken a tax that is perceived by the market to be reasonable, is described in the newspapers as modest and which everyone, except the Opposition, has now accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to the Paymaster General for giving way. This is a small point which may have been a slip on his part. But as he and I are both proud to be midlands Members, I should like to correct his remark that all Opposition members of the Committee represent constituencies in the south of England. In fact, his constituency is slightly to the south of mine.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We are grateful for that. The fact remains, however, that that once great national party has no Members in Wales or Scotland. That is a sad reflection on it and its continued opposition to this justified, necessary and accepted tax reveals its total lack of rapport and contact with the British electorate.
<P>
It is not for me to delay the Committee further. We have much ground to cover. I have dealt with all the specific points that were raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The Paymaster General has made a fanciful claim that he has dealt with all the points. Unfortunately, his memory at this somewhat late hour is lacking. One of the most important questions that we asked him was what steps the Government would take to ensure that the regulators would not allow the windfall tax to be passed on as an allowable cost to consumers. That point was made, not only by me, but by other hon. Members, particularly by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. We asked for a simple assurance which the Paymaster General might now give in a simple yes or no answer. Will the Government ensure that the windfall tax will not be passed on now or in future as an allowable cost to consumers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I intended to come precisely to that point, which involves the outcome of our discussions with the regulator, at which I was present. I was not, of course, at the discussions with the relevant companies. I reiterate the view that was expressed by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on Budget day and which was discussed with me beforehand. It was, uncharacteristically, omitted from the statement by the right hon. Member for Wells. It was after our consultations with the regulators that my right hon. Friend formed the judgment that there would be no impact on investment levels, the price cap or customer services. That remains our judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr Woodward:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr Robinson:</B> No. I have finished.

Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Administration of the windfall tax etc</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) The tax shall apply only to companies privatised on or before 2nd July 1997.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with the administration of the windfall tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and I tabled the amendment because we want an assurance from the Government that the tax is genuinely a one off. The Labour Government have said on several occasions that they do not intend to use the relevant clauses or schedules again to levy a further tax, but we should like that to be written into the Bill. We have all heard before of one-off taxes. The most famous example was income tax, which was introduced to help fund the Napoleonic war, then repealed--presumably in good faith, although we do not know about that--only to be reintroduced at the start of the last century. It has remained with us ever since. I am afraid that all Governments throughout history have had an itch to tax and they often find that emergency or one-off measures tend to become a permanent part of the fiscal landscape. Almost all modern taxes started off as exceptional measures, and may originally have been designed as one-off taxes for specific purposes and hypothecated to fund a war, to remove a debt or to do something identified as important at the time. If a tax works in practice and, particularly if the incidence of the tax is rather obscure, it can be returned to.
<P>
We have already noticed in this short debate that Labour Members have vigorously defended both the theory and the practice of the windfall tax. One could almost say that they are getting rather fond of it. That is a slightly sinister development, because they may feel tempted--perhaps later in this Parliament--to return to this form of taxation to take more money out of the same companies or to take a different amount out of a new cohort of companies towards which they have developed a feeling of hostility.
<P>
We want there to be no doubt about the Government's intentions for the Bill. One can imagine circumstances in which, in the view of Labour Members, a regulator fails to do his duty and in which some companies continue to make excess profits. We have heard various assertions on what are held to be the current views of the regulators, but who can say whether they will do their duty? In a few years time the Government may be short of money as all Governments tend to be and they may face a widening deficit and new pressures on public expenditure. Therefore, they may return to the windfall tax.
<P>
There is another reason for our putting beyond doubt that the windfall tax will be a one-off tax. Unless there is no doubt about that, the effect on future privatisations could be bad. New Labour has a number of new privatisations in its sights. It is considering privatising the London Underground and the air traffic control system, despite the reassurances made before the election that that had been ruled out. Channel 4 is also thought to be a possible candidate for privatisation. There is almost nothing--[Interruption.] I am glad that the hon. Member for Rochdale finds that amusing. If she believes that the privatisation of Channel 4 has been ruled out, I would be fascinated to hear her assert it, but would be unwise of her to do so. She should check with Labour party headquarters before she assumes that Channel 4 is not to be privatised. Conservative Members have heard that that option is definitely being considered.
<P>
I agree that privatisation is very much a moving subject within the Labour party. Labour has moved from its adamant and outright opposition a few years ago to all privatisations to the point where it can now hardly contain its enthusiasm for the retention of existing privatisations, which have been a great success, and for possible future ones.
<P>
Privatisation is on the agenda, but any threat of a windfall tax will be damaging in exactly the same way as it was to the privatisation of Railtrack. One of the reasons--and Conservative Members have alluded to this--why the Railtrack privatisation was at a lower price than it would have been was the threat posed by the Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Is my right hon. Friend aware that table 4.9 in the Red Book proves that the Labour party is still intent on considerable privatisations over the next four years, when they will raise some &#163;4 billion from privatisations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is very interesting. Clearly, my little list is somewhat inadequate and there are other assets that the Government want to put into the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If I may point the way to where those assets might be, the Government are looking at considerable sales of assets in the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is clearly well briefed on these matters. We have heard that even the royal palaces are not exempt from such scrutiny. I think that it was the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), unhappily not a member of the Committee, who was dilating on the importance of reducing the number of royal palaces in public ownership. I do not believe that he was referring to the one in which we sit at the minute, but he was certainly advocating the sale of at least some of them.
<P>
The market for royal palaces is highly illiquid. Therefore, it is unlikely that any sale that is attempted could be discharged easily or quickly. It is at least possible that an excess profit could be made, according to the Labour party view. If so, along would come the Treasury advocating a windfall tax on the shareholders or on the company taking over the assets.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold has drawn our attention not simply to the desirability of the privatisation programme but to its essential nature, given that it is already written into the Red Book, without it, therefore, the entire national finances are in jeopardy. That reinforces the need to put beyond doubt the Government's intentions with regard to a future windfall tax.
<P>
For all those reasons I urge the Government to accept my modest and helpful amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The tax shall apply only to companies privatised on or before 2nd July 1997.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would exclude all the companies on the list--added to by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold--that the Government are clearly intent on privatising as a central part of their future economic programme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I wish to add my support to the amendment. The Government should also affirm their assent to it, because they have declared in the House that they intend this to be the only time that they use this type of tax. By supporting the amendment, they would show that they were true to that intention. This is my first contribution to the Committee stage of the Finance Bill. It is also my first contribution to the Finance Bill process as a new Member. In fact it is my first recorded contribution, as in a former life I assisted my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) when they were members of the Committee considering Finance Bills introduced by the previous Government, albeit they were not introducing a windfall tax. My assistance was not of great support and succour to my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends because I am not a tax specialist but an economist. However, I learned a little about tax through reading Hansard reports of debates. I have also listened to debates on and affirmation of tax principles. Words and phrases such as ``level playing field'' seeemed to recur frequently. We have not yet heard such phrases too often in this Committee, but I am sure that we shall do so in due course.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Other principles such as the general opposition to retrospection have been mentioned. It could be argued that the tax goes against that principle because it is retrospective. However, the amendment relates to another principle, which is often discussed in Finance Bill Committees: the need for certainty and stability in the tax system. The amendment should be accepted because it would enable companies that will be taxed under the provision and companies that might be privatised by the Government in future to know where they stand.
<P>
I can reveal the source of the idea of a windfall tax. I was at college at the same time as the Chancellor's adviser, Mr. Edward Balls, who is known to Members of Parliament. I used the same micro-economic textbooks as Mr. Balls in my first year. A favoured textbook was written by an economist called Koutsoyiannis. In her analysis of different taxes and their effect on industry, she recommended the windfall tax because, as a one-off tax, it did not change the behaviour of companies in terms of profits, employment of staff and allocation of resources. Economists are keen on assumptions--ceteris paribus and so on. The assumption was that the tax would be a one-off measure. If a windfall tax was in danger of being repeated, it would contradict micro-economists' assumptions that such a tax would not change companies' behaviour.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman's study of economics reveal whether the hypothesis that he is considering had any merit? Is it true that windfall taxes do not affect companies' behaviour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that interesting question. My course was in micro-economic theory, which is very good at not considering the practical world. That is not to say that the windfall tax is not problematic. The windfall tax will affect companies' cash flow and ability to invest. The point of the theory is that such a tax will not affect companies' future behaviour because it is a one-off tax.
<P>
<B>Mr.Woodward:</B> Since the hon. Gentleman studied at the same time as the Chancellor's adviser, can he clarify whether Mr. Balls belongs to the school of theoretical rather than of practical study? Does he understand concepts only in the abstract, and not the way in which they affect the real world and the utilities, which will be screwed rotten by the tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that kind intervention. I am not here to explain Mr. Edward Balls's studies. However, I know that he went on to study with Mr. Donald Hay, a renowned industrial economist at Jesus college, Oxford, whose course included practical and theoretical aspects.
<P>
The importance of the amendment is that it relates not only to companies which must face the tax now, but to future companies.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells spoke about possible future privatisations that the Government may be considering--for example, air traffic control, London Underground and the Post Office, as well as the various other assets mentioned by the hon. Member for Ashford. It would be in the Government's interest to accept the amendment, because a clear statement that they will not apply windfall tax to companies that might be privatised in future would increase the potential yield from those privatisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a constructive speech. Does he also agree that such an assurance would be of immense value in the prospectus for future privatisation proposals? Members of the Committee have already drawn attention to the absence of such a provision--or even of a reservation--in the Railtrack prospectus. If we can have it in black and white now, it would go into every future prospectus and potential subscribers would know exactly where they were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman has anticipated my next comment. I was about to say that if the Government decide to oppose the amendment, which, from every point of view, is constructive, I hope that they will, at the very least, assure us that they will give a guarantee in any future prospectus that no such tax will apply to revenues and capital gains made by a future privatised company.
<P>
The amendment is about constructive opposition, about assisting the Government as they plan future public finances. Privatisation proceeds have been built into the Red Book, and they must realise that signals are extremely important in economics. The Government have found them important in politics both before and since the general election. I was pleased that they borrowed a Liberal Democrat economic policy as their first measure in government when they gave independence to the central bank. During the election campaign, the Liberal Democrats were the only party to propose that because we believed that it would send the right signals to private agents in the economy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I ask the hon. Gentleman not to stray too far from the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Of course, Mrs. Winterton. I was merely making the point that signals to the expectations of companies are most important in economics, and that the parallel of the amendment giving signals about future taxation proposals is in many respects equivalent to the Government's giving independence to the Bank of England. We hope that they will be minded to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I will be brief. The main Opposition party has not had a happy strike rate with its amendments. The other day, not one of its amendments to part I of the Bill had legs.
<P>
Let me take the Committee back to clause 1(1).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I just say that the hon. Gentleman cannot take the Committee back. We are debating amendment No. 14, and the hon. Gentleman must keep his remarks entirely to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Thank you for that kindness, Mrs. Winterton. I was simply going to point out that clause 1 is drafted in the past tense: it states that the tax will apply to companies privatised before 2 July 1997. Perhaps I should attend the after-school classes that the hon. Member for Witney--or was it the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham?--are to attend. Subsection (1) of clause 1 is written in the past tense, therefore amendment No. 14 to clause 3 is completely redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Member for Dudley, North seems to have difficulty remembering which of us is offering economics classes. I am sure that any of us would be happy to assist him in any way that he wishes so as to educate him in basic economic literacy.
<P>
I was delighted that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) chose to support the amendment. That is a sign of sensible, level-headed thinking--even if the hon. Gentleman did spend a lot of time studying endogenous growth theory, a practice which, as we know, can produce dangerous effects when taken out of the theoretical text book and applied to the practical world.
<P>
This is a crucial amendment which matters for one simple reason: it would give the Government an opportunity to reassure the markets. The hon. Member for Dudley, North does not understand the impact that a threatened windfall tax, which is soon to be a reality, has on a market that does not trust a Labour Government to keep their hands off profits and companies.
<P>
The Opposition are always keen to provide the Government with opportunities to make things clear. The Paymaster General now has the opportunity to enshrine in the Bill an amendment that makes it crystal clear to everyone that the provision is not an opportunity to take advantage of soon-to-be-privatised companies. The Labour party is clearly considering a number of future privatisations--the hon. Member for Rochdale seems to be in a state of confusion; perhaps it is the late hour of the night; perhaps it is surprise at having won her seat--and there seems to be some disagreement about which these should be. Not surprisingly, some members of the Labour party are very unhappy about the recent conversion to the merits of privatisation. But the reality, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said earlier, is that London Underground, air traffic control, various health services and other companies will be the subject of consideration by the Labour party unless the Paymaster General takes this opportunity to correct our assumptions. I take it from the hon. Gentleman's silence that he does not wish to correct our impression that certain areas of the health service will be privatised, although before and during the general election members of the Labour party terrified the British public with claims that the Conservative party might have the audacity to think of such things.
<P>
The amendment is crucial in creating certainty; the Financial Secretary spoke at length about the importance of certainty so that people can plan. We invite the Government to provide such certainty, but they will oppose the amendment because they are terrified that they will have to find another pot of gold to fund their spending programmes and to continue subsidising schemes for young unemployed people.
<P>
We are voicing the concern expressed in representations from companies that may be privatised, which are worried that the Labour Government will fix them in their sights and prepare for another smash-and-grab raid on them.
<P>
The amendment provides an excellent opportunity for the party of opportunity and opportunism. On other occasions, a Labour Government would want to take advantage of it. The Government's problem is that, if they support the amendment, it will deprive them of opportunities in future to pursue their secret agenda. When they privatise they will seek a new windfall tax. They will claim that it is not a windfall tax, just as they claim that theirs is not the Labour party but the new Labour party. There will be a new windfall tax.
<P>
If hon. Members decide not to support the amendment--
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Stringer </B>(Manchester, Blackley): If the Government are selling something--we have heard that a review is taking place of sales in different Departments--or even privatising something, would it not be easier for us to sell it at the right price?
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman talking about selling something ``at the right price''. How would the Labour party deduce such a right price? Such a right price will be seriously affected by the consequences of the windfall tax, because any company which comes on to the market as a result of a future privatisation will attract a great deal of scepticism from the markets--and a discount. It will attract a discount for an obvious reason: so long as there is a Labour Government, there will be a fear that any company to be privatised in the future will also be subject to a new windfall tax. That would terrify institutional investors, terrify pension funds thinking of putting money into that privatisation and terrify foreign investors--and how right they would be.
<P>
We have handed over to this Government an economic inheritance of extraordinary proportions, which includes attracting more inward investment and foreign investment than any other European country. Labour Members may shake their heads or jeer, because they do not like to recognise the successes of the past 18 years. They have been told by the Minister without Portfolio, that they must not recognise the successes of the past 18 years. Indeed, I am told that seminars are being organised to blacken the reputation of the past 18 years.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I point out to the hon. Gentleman that we are debating amendment No. 14, so will he bring his remarks back to it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I will indeed bring my remarks back to the amendment, Mrs. Winterton. I am grateful to you for reminding me that references to the Minister without Portfolio are not directly relevant to the amendment.
<P>
It is terribly important that the new Labour Government provide certainty. The markets have had certainty from the Conservative Government, which is why share prices are at record levels, why unemployment is falling--[Interruption.] why inward investment remains so high and why Britain is doing so well. If the hon. Member for Delyn has an intervention, I am happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Hanson </B>(Delyn): Black Wednesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman says ``black Wednesday''--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that black Wednesday has anything to do with amendment No. 14.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Perhaps it was a slit of the throat, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
The final point that I wish to make--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy:</B> The hon. Gentleman has another 12 minutes to go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is all very well for hon. Members to say that somebody will have to speak to this, but we can be sure that it will not be somebody from the Labour Benches. Have they at any point properly scrutinised the amendment? No. Have they at any point considered the importance of the amendment? No. Do they realise the importance of certainty to the markets? No.
<P>
The problem is that Labour Members do not understand the importance of the market. They believe that they can create right prices. I recommend the Paymaster General and his Government to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the amendment. We want to assist them. The Government should accept the amendment, enshrine it in the Bill and give us the certainty, give the markets the certainty, give London Underground, air traffic control, Channel 4, and any of the Government's possible future privatisations, the certainty that a future windfall tax will not be extracted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I should like to cover one or two of the specific examples of privatisation that would be particularly helped by the clause. I should also like to make some general and genuinely helpful remarks pointing out the range of options available to the Government as a result of the amendment and suggest which would be the most useful course for them to follow in their own interests as well as those of the country which the Opposition have at heart. We are pleased to be joined by the Liberal representative, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton; it shows that all the Opposition parties are trying to approach the amendment in a particularly constructive spirit.
<P>
The first example where a potential privatisation is clearly on the cards and which would therefore be helped by the certainty introduced by the amendment is Channel 4. Like many of my hon. Friends I was interested to see Labour Members scoffing at the very prospect of Channel 4 being privatised. I too have read reports that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has privately, although never to my knowledge publicly, ruled this out. Labour Members should study the reply that I received from the Treasury to a written question about how much money the Government thought they would raise if they privatised Channel 4. I was half expecting an answer along the lines that the possibility had been ruled out by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and that the question did not arise, and was therefore intrigued to be informed that the amount of money raised by the sale of Channel 4 would depend on the method of sale. That seemed to be an extremely long way from ruling out such a sale and gave rise to two possibilities: either the Treasury does not speak to the Secretary of State in his old or new guise with its new unwieldy title, or he is attempting to bounce the Treasury into one particular privatisation policy, or the Treasury is trying to bounce him into not ruling out in public what he wants apparently to rule out in private.
<P>
The Treasury answer that I received was significant in another way and directly related to the certainty that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells is trying to introduce. The Treasury is right to say that the amount raised by a potential privatisation of Channel 4 would depend on the method of sale. One of the key elements that would be introduced into that method would be some knowledge of whether a windfall tax would be imposed on any proceeds. That is particularly relevant in the case of Channel 4 because effectively it is already paying a surplus profits tax. The formula by which Channel 4's taxation and the ITV companies' payments are calculated, and have been calculated since the 1990 Broadcasting Act, depends on a degree of cross-subsidy. It was originally introduced so that if, when Channel 4 started selling advertising independently, it failed to sell much advertising, the ITV companies would support it.
<P>
As it turns out, Channel 4 has been a big commercial success and has in effect been subsidising some of the ITV companies. It has become a prime candidate for privatisation. It would therefore be in the Government's interests to make it clear whether they would be prepared to rule out a windfall tax so that they could realise the full value of Channel 4 if and when they come to privatise it.
<P>
The other example that I invite the Committee to consider is London Underground. Clearly, London Underground could be privatised in different ways.
<P>
It could be privatised in the same way as the railways, with a track authority and a number of operating companies covering the different lines. Alternatively, the Government may search for another way of privatising it, possibly by dividing up the sections of the underground so that individual companies own both the track and the operating companies. Either way, natural monopolies will be created and they will need economic regulation in the same way as other utilities.
<P>
Members on both sides of the Committee agree that natural monopolies need continuing economic regulation unless and until genuine competition can be introduced. It is hard to envisage genuine competition in a service such as the London Underground. We must assume that, for as far ahead as the eye can see, it will require economic regulation. Therefore, it is the sort of Company that will be vulnerable to a windfall tax.
<P>
The London Underground would be a major privatisation. The Government would have to decide whether to put in subsidy and determine whether some lines are more economic than others. That means that there would be an enormous amount of uncertainty over any attempt to privatise the underground. As with other privatisations, it is important that certainty is introduced.
<P>
The Goverment can oppose the amendment and, thereby, introduce greater uncertainty into future privatisations, or they can support it. In that way, they would help the companies and themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geofffrey Robinson:</B> This has been another interesting debate. I welcome the debut contribution of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. He had been missing from our proceedings, and I hope that he will not absent himself again for such a long period. I am not sure how my good friend Mr. Edward Balls came into the debate, nor am I sure how many other things came under our consideration.
<P>
We do not accept the amendment, because it is unnecessary. We have made it clear that the windfall tax will be a one-off tax on the companies clearly defined in the Bill, levied at the rate that we have defined in the Bill and on the basis defined in the Bill. That is all that needs to be said. The companies concerned have publicly and repeatedly received assurances from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, who is with us, and myself that the windfall tax will be a one-off. I have nothing further to add. That is why we shall resist the amendment and stand by the Bill which meets all its concerns.
