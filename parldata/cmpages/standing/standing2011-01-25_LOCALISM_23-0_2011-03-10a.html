                           </span> The clause
creates a new arrangement within the Greater London authority by making
the mayoral strategies subject to an assembly vote and enabling the
assembly, by a two-thirds majority, to override the Mayor’s
strategy. On the face of it, that might seem a curious proposition. Why
two thirds; would not a simple majority be sufficient? To understand
the logic, we have to go back into history, and I hope the Committee
will not be too upset if I make a short historical diversion. On
Tuesday, I threatened to make a very long speech, and while the matter
needs to be covered, I shall try to keep my speech as concise as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
the mid-1960s, with the creation of the Greater London council and the
larger, more powerful London borough councils, we saw a change in the
governance of London that, unfortunately, never really bedded down
satisfactorily. From the outset, there was tension between the
GLC—the strategic body—and the more powerful London
borough councils that were flexing their muscles. That tension existed
whether or not there were political differences between the GLC and the
boroughs, or whether they were from the same party. I well remember
rows between a Conservative GLC and Conservative boroughs, and between
a Labour GLC and Labour
boroughs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
conflicts, which continued for about 20 years, undermined the
credibility of the governance of London. Although they were not the
cause of it, they nevertheless made it easier for the Conservative
Government in the 1980s, irritated by the constant pinpricks coming
from County hall, to abolish the GLC. We all—even the
Conservative party—now recognise that that was a serious
mistake. It was the ultimate act of centralisation. It was a case of
central Government saying, “We don’t like what is going
on at local level beneath us, and we are going to abolish the
body.” That was an untenable proposition from a party that
advocates localism, so I hope that a lesson has been
learned.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not wish to rub people’s noses in this, but we had the task
in the late 1990s of restoring city-wide governance to London. I found
that activity intensely stimulating. It occupied three years of my
ministerial life, and I gave great thought to the sort of structure
that needed to be put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
had two overriding objectives. First, we wanted to restore a
democratic, city-wide body that would be able to look after the
interests of London as a whole. It was widely accepted that a number of
services, such as transport, policing, environmental oversight and
economic development, could not be provided on the basis of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 919<a class="bkMark" name="Column919">&#160;</a>
                           </div>32 different strategies from 32 different boroughs, with the
City corporation providing a 33rd. As well as providing overall
strategic leadership, however, we wanted to avoid a return to the
tensions and conflicts between the London-wide tier of governance and
the boroughs that had marred the ’60s, ’70s and
’80s.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Putting
those two thoughts together, we opted for a directly elected Mayor to
give strategic leadership and a clear democratic mandate. However, we
also wanted to limit the new Greater London assembly’s remit to
a relatively small number of strategic functions and to avoid the GLA
treading on the boroughs’ toes on local service delivery, which
is best dealt with locally. That was the basic thinking behind the
GLA’s structure, and it gave effect to the principle of
subsidiarity, which was increasingly in vogue, as I hope remains the
case. We sought to retain at city-wide level only those
responsibilities that must be handled London-wide and to ensure that
local service delivery was devolved.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other key
decision about the structure reflected the need for a Mayor who would
enjoy one of the largest democratic mandates in Europe—I was
advised at the time that only the Presidents of France and Portugal
would have larger personal mandates—to have appropriate
executive powers. If the decisions of a Mayor who had been elected by
millions of Londoners could have been overturned by a simple majority
vote in the assembly, it would have seriously undermined the
Mayor’s effectiveness and undoubtedly irritated the London
electorate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The structure
we devised envisaged a powerful Mayor—albeit that his or her
powers were limited to specific strategic issues—who was able to
give leadership to London. To ensure that the Mayor’s powers
were not untrammelled, checks and balance were of course fundamental,
so we gave the assembly the power to override the Mayor’s
budget, but only if it could achieve a two-thirds majority.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We came to
that conclusion after taking advice from many other countries,
including the United States and European countries that operated
mayoral systems. One of the strongest pieces of advice that we received
was that it was essential that there should be a budget and that it
should never be possible for deadlock to arise because the Mayor and
the assembly were in conflict, meaning that no budget was set. A number
of American cities told us frankly alarming stories of how long periods
of deadlock had elapsed between the mayor and the council, as it is
generally called in the States. The two-thirds majority was a mechanism
to ensure that if the assembly was able to meet that high hurdle, it
could substitute its budget for the Mayor’s, but that otherwise
the Mayor’s would prevail. The mechanism was designed to ensure
that there would always be a budget and that there would never be
deadlock, and it seems to have worked pretty well.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The assembly
was to be elected on a proportional system to prevent the
Mayor’s proposals from being overturned by a simple partisan
vote, which might have happened if a different party from the
Mayor’s had just 50% of GLA members. That was another reason why
the two-thirds majority commended itself to us.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The system
has been in place for a decade and appears to have worked reasonably
well. The Mayor has had to moderate excessive budget aspirations in the
past because of the assembly’s power to substitute its budget
for his, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 920<a class="bkMark" name="Column920">&#160;</a>
                           </div>if it secures a two-thirds majority. At the same time, the Mayor has
been able to give effective strategic leadership to London. Over the
past decade, there have been radical developments in transport policy
and policing—the introduction of neighbourhood
policing—and our city has, against the odds, won the competition
to host the 2012 Olympic games. All those achievements, and several
others, would have been unlikely without an effective Mayor and an
effective GLA.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
structures that we put in place in 1998 were opposed by the
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, albeit for different reasons. The
Conservatives opposed the creation of a city-wide authority until it
became a reality, while the Liberal Democrats opposed the creation of a
mayoral system of government; they did not like the idea of the Mayor.
Despite such opposition to the structure, the arrangements have
generally worked well, and I am delighted that those parties now
recognise that they are appropriate for London. As the Under-Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst, said on Tuesday, we now see the process of the
development of a model that has come to greater maturity as a result of
the experience of the past 10
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
said that, I am the first to concede that any model of governance might
benefit from some tweaks and reforms. I welcome the principle in the
clause that the Mayor can be overruled by the assembly if it musters a
two-thirds majority, and that that power should extend to not only the
budget, but the Mayor’s strategies. If I am critical of any
elements in the 1998 structure of the GLA, it is the degree to which
the assembly felt under-powered. Yes, it had an important scrutiny role
and could override the Mayor’s budget with a two-thirds majority
but, without greater involvement in the process of governance, several
assembly members found their role rather limited. I am comfortable with
the proposals that have led to the provision for the assembly to be
empowered to override the Mayor’s strategies, as well as his
budget, on a two-thirds majority.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The changes
that the Bill will make to the GLA structure might open the door to
damaging and destabilising influences in the longer term, which might
undermine the structure of London governance. We need to be very
careful to avoid shifting the balance of power in London, and indeed
within the GLA, in ways that might seriously damage the effectiveness
of our capital city’s
governance.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to highlight three concerns. The first is the risk of transferring
too many powers to the GLA and thus destabilising the balance between
the GLA and the boroughs that was correctly set in 1998, with a
structure that gives strategic powers to the GLA but all service
delivery to the boroughs. As I have said, the overlap of, and lack of
proper distinction between, those two elements were a cause of friction
in the 1960s, which is why I am cautious about the proposals to extend
the powers of the Mayor. I should probably have spoken about that on
Tuesday evening, when we dealt with the clause that will transfer the
Homes and Community Agency’s responsibilities to the Mayor.
However, I sensed that the Committee would not have welcomed a long
speech at that point, so I thought it best to touch on the matter this
morning. I hope that you will not rule my remarks out of order, in
making my remarks, Mr Amess.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 921<a class="bkMark" name="Column921">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">My key point
is that housing was always a flashpoint between the boroughs and the
Mayor. It was a main and serious cause of the conflict in the
’60s, ’70s and ’80s—not between the
boroughs and the Mayor, but between the boroughs and the GLC. With the
GLA being given substantial housing powers, there is a risk that the
balance will tilt in favour of the GLA and against the boroughs, which
are housing authorities. There is now an overlap, and the Mayor has a
substantial degree of control over the boroughs, including on resource
allocation. That is not going to be easy, and I see scope for conflicts
and disagreements between the boroughs and the Mayor in years ahead. It
is important that we do not allow that to take us back to the
unproductive conflict that existed under the old structure of the GLC
and the London boroughs. I issue a warning that that point must be
considered carefully. I am not opposed in principle to the Mayor having
a greater strategic function on housing, but how that is operated might
trample on individual boroughs, so that should be kept under
watch.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second concern is that the extension of the power of the assembly to
overturn the Mayor’s decisions not only on the budget, but on
his strategies, might—I do not want to overstate
this—subtly change the balance of power between the Mayor and
the assembly to the disadvantage of effective government in London. I
do not begrudge the assembly a bit more of the action, as I have said.
I fear, however, that the changes in the Bill might open the door to
the kind of horse-trading that there is in other cities across the
world—something that we were warned about when we were taking
evidence on the creation of the Greater London authority. If we have a
situation in which the Mayor chooses to buy off sectional or local
interests through allocation of resources to an area in exchange for a
vote on a critical decision, perhaps on a mayoral strategy, we begin to
open up the scope for pork-barrel politics of a sort that we have,
mercifully, kept out of London—we do not wish to bring back it
back.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000051">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision risks creating such a situation; I put it no stronger than
that. I am not saying that the provision is the wrong thing to do, but
we should keep a close watch on what happens. If there is an indication
that the assembly is flexing its muscles in ways that lead to deals
between individual assembly members, or groups of members, and the
Mayor to further other objectives, rather than to get the best
strategies in place for London, we will need to reflect further on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My third
concern is the remit of the Mayor’s powers. I have already
stressed that we did not want to create a situation in which the Mayor
began to get into detailed service delivery responsibilities and lost
the strategic emphasis, as it was very much our perception that that
strategic emphasis was the correct role for the Mayor of London. Under
the change, there is a risk that there will be mayoral aspirations to
acquire more and more powers and services. Those might relate to
housing, to which I have already referred. It may be all right, but
there is a risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is not
the end of the road, however, because mayors have a tendency to be
ambitious for their cities. That is fine, but if such ambition involves
trying to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 922<a class="bkMark" name="Column922">&#160;</a>
                           </div>aggregate more and more powers and functions, we will see a shift away
from the proper division of powers, under which the Mayor is limited to
strategic responsibilities and the boroughs are charged with day-to-day
service delivery. To illustrate my point, I shall highlight an issue
that has been talked about, but that has not so far emerged, to do with
the royal parks. I want to press Ministers for a bit of an explanation
of what is going on. The parks are run by an agency for which the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport is responsible. I have an
interest, because Greenwich park is one of them. It is extremely well
run, and we have a good relationship with the Royal Parks Agency, which
has regular consultation meetings with stakeholders in Greenwich. The
system works very well.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was
alarmed, therefore, when I heard a proposal to transfer the royal parks
to the Mayor of London. I am partly alarmed on the principle that if
something is not bust, we shouldn’t change it, which seems to
apply very much in this case. I am also worried about the Mayor rather
enjoying having what might be regarded as glamorous projects—the
royal parks are certainly glamorous—and getting into service
delivery, as used to happen with the old GLC. In those days, a variety
of entertainments and art and sporting activities were run by the GLC.
Under the new model, the parks should not be run by the Mayor of
London; they should be for the boroughs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not know
where the Government got this idea of transferring the royal parks. I
can see no great logic behind it; I see a dangerous trend if it is
implemented. I hope that the Government will take stock of the matter,
because I hear from the Ministers’ colleagues in DCMS that they
intend to transfer the parks to the Mayor of London, but they do not
have any legislative opportunities for doing so. It has been suggested
to me that an amendment to the Bill might be tabled to effect that. I
do not see such an amendment in the offing, but Ministers may like to
tell us whether that is the case. If it is suggested that an amendment
be made in the Lords, I hope their lordships will consider carefully
the issues that I have raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My concern is
not just about doing something simply for the sake of change, which,
unfortunately, is one of the hallmarks of the new Government, who have
a “year zero” tendency to believe that everything has to
change. It is also about creating an imbalance between the GLA and the
boroughs. For reasons that I have already spelled out, I am not opposed
in principle to the changes made by the clause, but I am a little
worried about the direction of travel, and the risk that the changes
now being made could undermine the fundamentally sound principles on
which the mayoralty of London and the GLA have to date been
based.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would agree with a good deal
of the right hon. Gentleman’s analysis, but not with everything

company. The fact that there are inevitably tensions, which are
sometimes constructive and sometimes less so, between the two levels of
government in London is well documented. Perhaps I ought to warn the
Committee that my public law dissertation, which I did at the London
School of Economics in 1973, was about the tensions implicit in the old
GLC’s legal settlement, but I will not go through

in the Herbert commission; I am sure that the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington, will have been interested in that. I am grateful
to the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich for saying that,
with certain caveats, he supports the proposal. I hope that we can make
sure that a copy of his speech is sent to and read by his
party’s current candidate for Mayor of London, who is also the
previous Mayor. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman may be more
measured in his analysis of what the role and remit of a Mayor should
be than the previous Mayor
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
extension of the assembly’s ability to reject the mayoral
strategy, which comes at the end of a process that is well set
out—I will not go into that, unless the Committee wishes me
to—seems logical. That was not in the original 1998 proposal,
but I am a pragmatist. We all learn with experience. I advocated such
an extension when amendments were made to the GLA Bill in 2007, so I
have been pretty consistent. It may be that—I will put it as
neutrally as this—at that time, the degree of maturity and
experience of the then Government did not permit them to adopt the
extension, but I have always felt that there was a case for it, and it
is
logical.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
practical terms, the two-thirds majority rule has generally worked well
in relation to budgets. It has always seemed logical that we should not
have a different system for the strategies that drive the spending
priorities and for the supply, in terms of the budget. In our eight
years on the assembly, my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and
Fleetwood and I were very conscious of the frustrations that all
members of the assembly felt about the limited leverage that they had,
so I am glad that the proposal has support. It is sensible and rational
and puts everything on a consistent basis; that is the key
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the point about the balance between the GLA and the
boroughs. As somebody who served on the boroughs, the old GLC and then
the assembly, I have lived with the balance, and I am conscious of the
need to maintain that. That is one of the areas—this is slightly
tongue in cheek—where perhaps the first Mayor was sometimes a
little more aggressive than the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich in his desire to extend the Mayor’s powers. It is
interesting that Mayor Johnson has been much more restrained in the use
of the powers that he has. Perhaps that says more about the way that
individual Mayors—they are all big personalities— tend to
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000063">&#160;</a>

the Mayor and the boroughs. I understand the point the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made about previous clauses, but on

                           </div>housing, a number of his party colleagues have advanced the argument
that the London housing market, although it is not homogenous, is
certainly not one that respects borough boundaries. They argued that
there was a logic to a more strategic housing vision that could be
linked to the Mayor’s economic and spatial planning
responsibilities. That is what we are picking up in these
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
199 rebalances the internal arrangements of the GLA. As we referred to
in another context, there is merit that, in a more mature and settled
system. I had some discussions on the issue in New York, when I was in
opposition, and I reflected on my thinking on the subject. I came to
similar conclusions to the right hon. Gentleman on how one ensures that
a genuinely strategic view is taken. I understand the point, which was
also raised by others in our original debate on the subject. Nothing in
the clause increases the risk of factional trade-offs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000065">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Gentleman’s fault—he was not advising the
previous Mayor of London—but my hon. Friend the Member for
Lancaster and Fleetwood and I could point out that the only serious,
obvious and blatant example of pork-barrel politics being indulged in
for factional advantage was when the previous Mayor did a deal with the
Green group in the assembly to get his two-thirds majority, so that he
could get his blocking third on the budget. It has happened once, so it
is right to raise the issue, but it was a single instance, and it does
not seem to have happened thereafter. We hope that it will not
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I accept entirely the Minister’s point
that the arrangements have not proved a problem with the budget, but we
are talking about only the budget, which has been the nuclear option,
so both sides have tended to approach the matter in a responsible way.
With the extension to the strategies, one will be dealing with a lot
more instances where there will be the temptation to try to buy, or
prevent the formation of, a majority that could endanger the strategy.
That is why I issued the warning. I am not against the clause in
principle, but the scope for slightly unwelcome practices of the kind
that I mentioned may be increased. I would welcome his views on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000067">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Where a mature attitude is adopted, that need not
be the case. It is perhaps indicative more of the personalities and
attitudes of the politicians concerned that Mayor Livingstone thought
it appropriate to buy the Green party’s support for his budget
by giving the money to oppose one of his strategies—the Thames
Gateway bridge. Not many politicians will get themselves into that
situation, so we should not read too much into it, although we should
always be alert to the issue, as the right hon. Gentleman says.
Broadly, assembly members have behaved in a responsible fashion, as
have Mayors. We can ensure that that is done. After all, if there were
to be cases of abuse of that kind, the electorate ultimately have the
ability to demand a price from members who behave in that fashion; that
can be dealt with.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000068">&#160;</a>

that Mayors are ambitious. I think that the right hon. Gentleman and I

constructive and channelled. Leaders of councils can be ambitious

                           </div>too, and certainly leaders of the old GLC and London County Council were
second to none in their ambitions. Going back to my 1973 piece of work,
there has always been a tendency for London Governments to centralise a
little. With that caveat, we can deal with the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000069">&#160;</a>

right hon. Gentleman asked about the royal parks, and I am happy to set
out the position, although interestingly it is an issue that was first
raised by the previous Labour Mayor, who had an interest in taking on
board the royal parks. It is not, in fact, a partisan point in any way.
He is right that hon. Friends the Ministers in DCMS accepted, in a
statement on 18 January, that they had the ambition of devolving the
royal parks. We have, however, taken the view that that should happen
by consensus. We have not included proposals in the Bill, because it
has become apparent that the boroughs—of all parties—that
have the parks have an alternative view to the Mayor, and indeed his
predecessor, on how that might be achieved. We are seeking to
facilitate discussions between the Mayor and the boroughs, because if a
long-term decision is taken, it is best that it be taken on the basis
of a consensus. I hope that that reassures the right hon.

date;(b) the prospect, in the
circumstances known to the market at the valuation date, of any other
such planning permission being granted in the future;
and(c) the value attributable
to development on the relevant land by itself or together with other
land for which planning permission could reasonably have been expected
to be granted where the assumptions mentioned in subsection (3) are
made (“appropriate alternative
development”).(2) In
determining the value attributable to appropriate alternative
development for the purpose of subsection (1)(c) account shall be taken
of—(a) any planning
permission for appropriate alternative development which could
reasonably have been expected to be granted on an application
considered on the valuation date where the assumptions mentioned in
subsection (3) are made;

referred to in subsections (1) and (2) are that the circumstances at
the date of determination of the application are the same as exist at
the valuation date except
that—(a) the statutory
project had been cancelled on whichever of the following dates shall
apply—(i) the date of
first publication of notice of the making of the compulsory purchase
order as required under the Acquisition of Land Act
1981;(ii) the date of first

Committee when I say that it is a pleasure to have reached the last day
of this Public Bill Committee. As it has been my first ever Public Bill

issues surrounding it and the processes of this House. As a new Member,
I thank you for your patience and guidance, and I also pass on my
thanks to the Clerks and the various officials who have supported us in
our deliberations. That said, I have also realised that I must have
been a very inefficient new Member before this Committee sat, because I
have absolutely no idea what I did on Tuesdays and Thursdays before the
Committee, or what I will do on those days in future. I hope that the

ideas.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 11, in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Bradford East, would, in short, introduce a community right of appeal.
It has become clear as we have considered the Bill that the
Government’s intention is, quite properly, to devolve planning
powers to local communities. Central to this very radical reform is the
intention to give neighbourhoods far more power to determine the shape
of the places where people in the neighbourhood live. That is, of
course, a welcome move, but there is a missing piece of the puzzle, and
that is a community right of appeal. When decisions are taken that are
not in line with the local development plan, and that are therefore

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is not a view peculiar to me and my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford
East. I remind the Committee of the words in Liberal Democrat and
Conservative documents from May last year. The Liberal
Democrats’ manifesto
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We

                        <p>The
Conservatives’ policy paper “Open Source Planning”
stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“we
will make the system symmetrical by allowing appeals against local
planning decisions from local residents, as well as from
developers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
do not profess to be an expert in coalition negotiations, but I would
have thought that one of the first things that my right hon. and hon.
Friends would have done 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 931<a class="bkMark" name="Column931">&#160;</a>
                           </div>when they met in those hectic days after the general election was to
list the things that they agreed with. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Hazel Grove was party to the negotiations, perhaps he could shed some
light on whether that was the process. In any event, listing the issues
with which both coalition parties agreed on what should form a
programme of government would have been a sensible departure point.
Clearly, had that been the departure point, a limited community right
of appeal, which I will talk about, would have been in the coalition
agreement. However, it is quite clear that in the Cabinet Office
rooms—I was going to say cigarette smoke-filled rooms, but I
suspect they are more Perrier-filled rooms—things do not quite
work that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
our many debates, we know that planning reform is key to the
Government’s agenda on localism. It is my view—I hope to
convince the Committee and the House in due course—that a
community right of appeal would sit well with the other rights that are
being devolved to local communities and neighbourhoods by the Bill. The
current situation is quite clear. At the moment, only applicants for
planning permission may appeal, with no restriction on the grounds of
the appeal, to the Secretary of State when a local authority refuses
permission. The community and its representatives have no such right of
redress. Those issues have been raised with Ministers by other Members
of the House. In an answer to a question from my colleague, my hon.
Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell), my right hon. Friend
the Member for Tunbridge Wells
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Government’s reforms to the planning system seek to avoid the
need for appeals to the Planning Inspectorate by all parties. Planning
permission should be secured by consistency with plans rather than by
development control.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 29

480W.]<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think
we all welcome that intention. There is no doubt that my right hon.
Friend gets it exactly right: that should be the Government’s
aim. Unfortunately the Bill leaves us short of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposed system of neighbourhood planning and neighbourhood development
orders will present several challenges, as has been discussed.
Crucially, the system will be voluntary. While Ministers expect between
20% and 60% of the country to move to the new system, we need to do
more to drive up the take-up for the Bill’s measures. Key among
that would be putting in place a system of checks and balances. A
community right of appeal against planning applications submitted under
the current regime could be a key element in pushing local
neighbourhoods to fulfil the Government’s
desire.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, we have to guard against vexatious appeals and appeals driven
by commercial interest, which is why in new clause 11 I have tried to
set a high threshold for the issues that could trigger an appeal and
the bodies that would be able to appeal. A community right of appeal as
defined in the new clause could be triggered only where a decision to
grant a planning permission is not in line with an already adopted
plan, or where the local authority itself has a particular interest in
the application and so could be construed as conflicted in its ability
properly to determine the application. There are many controversial
planning issues, such as one in my constituency regarding an
incinerator and energy from waste recovery facility, which the local
authority is pursuing. It has been rejected by the local
authority’s planning committee, but there is a clear interest in

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 932<a class="bkMark" name="Column932">&#160;</a>
                           </div>getting it through. The new clause would set a high bar regarding who
would be able to appeal, limiting the right to a number of
representative
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to be
absolutely clear. As the Bill is drafted, developers will still be able
to submit planning applications that are contrary to a local or
neighbourhood plan, as well as appeal against any refusal based on the
provisions of that plan. The changes put forward in the Bill may reduce
the chance of appeals being successful where neighbourhood plans are in
place, but we should not lull ourselves into a false sense of security
and think that the Bill, as it stands, will eliminate appeals in the
planning
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed,
over the past 10 years, appeals have become a more prominent part of
the planning system. It is estimated that over 8,000 planning
applications were deemed to have significantly cut across agreed
development plans. That is a tiny part of the 6 million applications in
the period, but those 8,000 cases are likely to have had a more
significant impact on local communities, because they go outside agreed
plans and are therefore controversial enough to be referred to the
Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Right
hon. and hon. Members might be thinking that there is a different way
of levelling the playing field. Indeed, there is; we could remove the
developers’ right of appeal. The Conservative party’s
quality of life policy group, in their publication “Blueprint
for a Green Economy”<em>, </em>suggested that exactly that course
of action could be taken to remove the disparity between the rights of
the applicant, the developer and the community. However, the Bill does
not do that. I ask Ministers to reflect on which avenue they would
prefer to take to equalise the rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not only does
the Bill not prevent applications and appeals that are outside the
neighbourhood planning framework, but it does not prevent local
authorities granting permission for applications that are outside the
frameworks, provided that they can prove that there are
“material considerations” that are significant enough to
cause them to override the neighbourhood development plan. In such
circumstances, the community, which had come together in the now
infamous Dog and Gun to prepare its neighbourhood
plan—[<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span> “Dog and
Duck.”] It is clearly not infamous enough. The community could
be overruled by its local authority and would then have no right of
appeal. That is against the spirit of what the Government are trying to
achieve. New clause 11 would help to redress that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Community
rights of appeal exist in other countries. In Ireland, 8%—almost
one in 10—of all planning applications were appealed against in
2008. Ireland has a community right of appeal, and the split in that 8%
was roughly 50-50. New Zealand has an established right of public
appeal against the grant of planning consent, and it acts as an
incentive for developers and planning authorities to focus their
efforts on plan making and pre-application discussion. Australians also
enjoy a community right of appeal. In none of those countries has a
community right of appeal been an impediment to economic growth.
Indeed, by forcing developers and communities to work together, it has
acted as an incentive for properly managed economic growth and properly
discussed community
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Too
often, local planning can be characterised by large developers
railroading unpopular proposals through the planning system, using
their unrestricted right of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 933<a class="bkMark" name="Column933">&#160;</a>
                           </div>appeal to wear down local opposition and intimidate local authorities. A
community right of appeal could be a useful additional weapon in the
arsenal of local councillors and local communities in redressing those
tactics. A community right of appeal should be seen as a vital part of
the overall localism agenda—a part that is necessary to ensure
that the reforms in this landmark Bill reach their full
potential.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
decisions are taken that are not in line with an agreed development
plan, and that can therefore be considered to be against the wishes of
the local community, representatives should be able to question those
decisions through an appeals process. That is my view, and it is the
contention of new clause 11.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

response that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, gave

that he does not mind if I paraphrase slightly—that the Localism

welcome the fact that the Government have signalled their intention to
leave the door open for further reforms to the planning system, but
that is not as good as getting it right first time. As the Minister
knows from his long years of service in local and regional government,
planning legislation changes infrequently. Thirteen years passed
between the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 and the
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. The House may not get the
chance to take this issue forward, and deliver on the coalition
parties’ election pledges, for some considerable time.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000123">&#160;</a>

contention, and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East,
that new clause 11 will deliver on those pre-election promises made by
Government Members. I am hugely grateful for the support of a number of
external organisations in helping to develop the clause and research
the issue. We believe that new clause 11 would help to underpin the
Government’s commitment to localism, and that it would be an
added incentive for developers and communities to work together through
the neighbourhood planning process that the Bill will deliver. I
believe that community right of appeal will be a more efficient and
effective method of resolving controversial planning cases, and more in
keeping with established planning practices. It will right an imbalance
in the system, which will deliver real power and real control to local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000124">&#160;</a>

deprived us late on Tuesday of his history lecture, but he gave us a
potted version today. I was astonished to see his conversion to an
instinctive conservatism, which I had, in the past, doubted would take
place; I thought of him as radical. When he said that we should not
change things if they are not broken, it recalled the words of the
third Marquess of Salisbury, who said, “Change? Change?
Aren’t things bad enough already?” I have never thought

because the hon. Member for Bradford East, as we know, was initially
noted for his wisdom and his sage-like remarks in Committee. That gave
way to a certain rebellion, and I am reliably informed that he woke up
in Shanghai a few days later, so I have learned to be wary of the power
of my hon. Friend the Member for North Herefordshire. Perhaps my hon.
Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay may bear in mind the
further absence today of the hon. Member for Bradford East.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000127">&#160;</a>

before us three disparate new clauses, and I will address them in
detail. They are a rather curious set, in that my hon. Friend the
Member for St Austell and Newquay invites me to remove the one piece of
agreement that I have with the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich. It is the only clause where the right hon. Gentleman has
congratulated me on resisting a third-party right to appeal, which he
did on the Floor of the House. It is rather churlish of my hon. Friend
the Member for St Austell and Newquay to dissent at this late stage,
when we have reached a happy conclusion to our discussions in
Committee. I will say more about the detail of that new clause, but I
think it is appropriate to talk about the other two new clauses as
well. Am I right in saying so, Mr

                           </strong> I will happily do that, Mr Amess. My hon. Friend
the Member for St Austell and Newquay is absolutely right that when we
were in opposition, we considered, in our reforms to the planning
system, whether it was right to establish a third-party right of
appeal. At the time, however, there was not the degree of progress in
devolving power to neighbourhoods that the Bill proposes. We want
communities to have much greater ability to use plans to shape their
future. We want to move away from a reliance on the appeals mechanism
for resolving such matters; my hon. Friend is absolutely right about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question then arises: do we allow no departure, under any
circumstances, from an adopted local plan, including a neighbourhood
plan? Discussions that we have had with parties representing a wide
range of interests suggest that it is important to have a degree of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 935<a class="bkMark" name="Column935">&#160;</a>
                           </div>flexibility, so that if there are exceptional circumstances that were
not captured in the plan, it is not necessary to disapprove, or be
obliged not to approve, an application that enjoys a degree of consent.
It is right to have that limited degree of discretion. However, it is
obvious from our discussions, from the Bill, if adopted, and certainly
from the national planning framework that the importance and the
centrality of the plan are very much enhanced. People’s ability
to set out their aspirations in the plan is captured in those
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
next question is: if there are to be exceptional departures from the
plan, who should decide whether that is in the community’s
interest? We have a choice between an unelected body—the
Planning Inspectorate based in Bristol—or elected local
councillors. It is consistent with the type of approach that we want
that that power should be vested in local democratically elected and
accountable people. They have access to members of the community. They
represent the community. They can make a more sensitive judgment than
would be possible if the matter were contracted to a third
party.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have safeguards in place to ensure that the interests of the community
cannot be ridden roughshod over. First, there is the importance of the
plan. Secondly, there is the fact that any decision to depart from the
plan must be in limited circumstances and can be taken only by
representatives of the community in the planning committee. My hon.
Friend the Member for St Austell 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>and Newquay mentioned developers being in a position to influence, but
developers are not represented on planning committees in the way that
residents are, so the ability of elected representatives to determine
the outcome is
entrenched.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is necessary to reflect on the need to make the planning system more
plan-based and less subject to the appeals mechanism, so that it is
more fit for purpose, less costly and more accessible. I would regret
my hon. Friend’s new clause resulting in extra cost, delay and
uncertainty in applications, when part of the point of pre-loading
things into plans is the ability to reduce some of that uncertainty and
delay.<a class="bkMark" name="11031054000134">&#160;</a>
