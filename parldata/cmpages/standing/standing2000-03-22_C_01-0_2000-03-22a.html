<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Truswell </B>(Pudsey): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Licensing (Young Persons) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I am delighted that once again you are presiding over a Bill on this matter, as you did in June 1998 when the Bill's predecessor was in Committee. Unfortunately, because of a lack of parliamentary time it was only a chinwag and the Bill did not make progress. I hope that that will not be so in this case. I am optimistic about the prospects, as we had an excellent debate on Second Reading, with contributions from both sides of the House.

<P>
Those who spoke on Second Reading and members of this Committee and of the Committee in June 1998 are aware of the tragic circumstances that led to my attempting to close the loophole in the Licensing Act 1964. When the circumstances are so traumatic and so solemn, it is tempting to reflect them with a weight of words; I shall ignore that temptation and proceed as quickly as possible with my contribution to the debate. The expeditious enactment of the Bill, rather than expansive pronouncements on it, would be the greatest memorial to David Knowles and the greatest comfort to his parents, if comfort in such circumstances is ever possible.

<P>
The purpose of my Bill is clear. David Knowles died when he ran on to the Stanningley bypass after drinking four cans of lager. Those who sold him the lager could not be prosecuted because of a loophole in the law, which holds that as they were not servants of the licence holder they, like tens of thousands of staff employed in supermarkets and off licence chains, were not subject to the law on selling alcohol to minors.

<P>
My Bill will do more than merely close a huge loophole: it will make all those working in off licence premises subject to the law. It will end the two-tier system of those who are subject to the law and those who are not. It will renovate and repair the Licensing Act 1964, which was surely intended to make all sales of alcohol to people under the age of 18 illegal.

<P>
On Second Reading, I referred to my empathy with Sisyphus, a character from Greek mythology, who was consigned by the gods perpetually to roll a rock up the side of a mountain, only to see it fall from his grasp as it reached the top and drop all the way down to the bottom. I hope that that will not happen today and, as I said, the Second Reading debate gives me confidence in that hope.

<P>
The Second Reading debate prompted me to remember a character from Roman mythology called Atalanta. If my hon. Frined the Member for Elmet (Mr. Burgon) is listening, I am referring to the character from Roman mythology and not to the Italian Serie A football team in which he takes an interest. Atalanta was an accomplished runner and hunter; the only time that she was beaten in a race was when the gods bestowed on her opponent a handful of golden apples, which he scattered at either side of the course, thereby diverting her from her true course.

<P>
On Second Reading, right hon. and hon. Members scattered golden apples right, left and centre and it is tempting to pick some of them up in Committee. Hon. Members from all parties raised various cogent issues, including test purchasing, proxy purchasing, amending the age limit, introducing identity cards, regulating internet trade, extending responsibilities under the 1964 Act to parent companies, making declamatory statements emphasising the responsibility of licence holders and the introduction of a graded scale of penalties for those found guilty under the 1964 Act.

<P>
I am delighted that the Bill acted as a catalyst for such a wide-ranging debate. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will say, as he did on Second Reading, that we shall have an opportunity to rehearse all those matters in detail on the Floor of the House in due course. However, if I remember my chemistry correctly, a catalyst promotes a reaction but remains unchanged, and I hope that that will be the fate of the Bill.

<P>
Each of the issues raised on Second Reading commanded varying degrees of sympathy, but I fear that they might be like Atalanta's apples: if I were tempted to pick up too many of them, I could be diverted from my real objective of closing the gigantic loophole in the 1964 Act, which was so tragically highlighted by the death of David Knowles. However, I shall stoop to pick up one of those golden apples, because the issue is entirely consistent with the overall thrust of the Bill. Obviously, that will be an issue for more detailed debate at a later stage.

<P>
I should like to thank all hon. Members who are here today. I hope that these debates will be as illuminating and constructive as those that we witnessed on Second Reading.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Licensing (Young Persons) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesday at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence proceedings on the Bill, I remind hon. Members that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendment that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>

<H4><center>Amendment of Part XII of the Licensing Act 1964</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Truswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) A person shall be guilty of an offence if, in licensed premises, he buys or attempts to buy intoxicating liquor on behalf of a person under eighteen.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 2, in page 2, line 10, after ``subsection'' insert ``(1A) or''.
<P>
No. 3, in page 2, line 12, leave out ``Subsection (1) of this section has'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subsections (1) and (1A) of this section have'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 4, in page 2, line 14, after ``169C(1)'' insert ``and (1A)''.
<P>
No. 5, in clause 2, page 3, line 39, leave out ``substituted ``sections'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`substituted ``subsection (1A) of section 169C, and sections'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Truswell:</B> I have already said why I tabled this amendment. I hope that it will find favour with the Committee. Under the amendment, a short but potent new subsection would be introduced into section 169C of the Licensing Act 1964. I tabled the amendment because of the helpful comments made on Second Reading, especially by Opposition Members, although there was no disagreement between the parties.

<P>
The issue of proxy purchasing was raised by the hon. Members for Meriden (Mrs Spelman), for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) and for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride). A proxy purchase occurs if an adult goes into licensed premises ``on behalf of''-those are the key words-a person under the age of 18 to buy alcohol, takes it outside and gives it to the young person. I seriously considered including a provision on proxy purchasing at the outset, but decided not to do so because I wanted the Bill to be clearly focused. However, given the cogent arguments adduced on Second Reading by the hon. Members to whom I have referred, I thought that it would be appropriate, at least for the purposes of debate, to table the amendment.

<P>
I had some reservations about introducing such a provision given the worry that there might be scenarios in which those who were not intended to fall within the ambit of the clause would be caught out-for example, if a parent went into off licence premises, bought a bottle a wine, took it home, opened it during a family meal and gave some to a child under the age of 18. I am confident that that is not a problem for two reasons.

<P>
First, the amendment refers to purchasing ``on behalf of'' a young person, which is important. The young person has commissioned the adult to make the purchase, so the adult is acting as the young person's clearly defined agent. In the example that I cited earlier, that would not be the case, because the parent was buying the alcohol, taking it home and sharing it with the young person.

<P>
Secondly, we have the experience in Scotland. Since the passage of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, proxy purchasing has been an offence, and I have been unable to identify any problems that have arisen over the 24 ensuing years. Those two reasons-the wording of the amendment and the experience of similar legislation in Scotland-convince me that we can move forward with confidence, without catching people whom the Bill is not intended to catch.

<P>
Several hon. Members spoke about the experience of proxy purchasing in their areas. Mine is no different: the police in my constituency regard proxy purchasing as a growing problem. Indeed, it is a problem at the very off licence from which David Knowles purchased alcohol on the fateful night of his death. I shall not go into further detail, but I believe that the amendment on proxy purchasing is entirely consistent with the thrust of my Bill, which it extends and improves. I hope that it will find favour with members of the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Let me first reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)-we can all rejoice in calling him our hon. Friend in the context of this Committee, because we are at one on the objectives that he has so eloquently and clearly set out-that I have no problem with the intentions of the amendment. I have a couple of questions about it. We should not pass legislation, however well intentioned, on the nod. It is the legal niceties that created the problem that ended with a real-world tragedy.

<P>
Extending the concept of proxy purchasing from what is already proscribed to proxy purchasing in the bar where a young person is bought a drink in conditions that are not proscribed under the existing Licensing Acts creates a more difficult burden of proof in two respects. One is the age and identity of the person and the other is where the purchase takes place. It may not be possible to answer definitively now, but further clarification from my hon. Friend and perhaps from the Minister would be helpful.
 
<P>
If a group of young people, one or more of whom are over 18, enter a bar for a social evening, they are likely to know the ages of others in the group. They may prefer not to ask, but people should ask about ages in licensed premises. The licensee should be able to take an overview and request ID or ask the young person whether he is sure about his age. I hope that one of the by-products of the Bill will be to encourage the use of identity and proof-of-age cards. We debated that on Second Reading and I shall not return to it now. If there is a proxy purchase in those circumstances, it is more difficult for the licensee to make an input because the young person could be elsewhere. It is also arguably more difficult for the potential purchaser as the agent-I do not use the term in the narrow legal sense-to be quite so certain of the situation.

<P>
A defence is set out in the provisions. There is a protection if the person has no reason to know that the purchaser is under 18. Perhaps my hon. Friend will confirm that that defence is extended to cover the new subsection, but that may be more difficult to ensure once one takes the issue out of the bar and the narrow social group found there.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am more worried that people will argue that they knew nothing about this person, or that they had never had any trouble from that quarter in the past and that they did not make inquiries because they thought it was for the father of the house and not for the son, or whatever. We could have some embarrassing situations where clearly there is something wrong. It could even lead-we hope not-to the kinds of tragedy that happend in my hon. Friend's constituency. We could then discredit the clause if one could not trace it through and be satisfied about the young person's age. There is a risk that the potential purchaser on behalf of a young person might get caught even though he had taken what he thought were reasonable precautions. Conversely, it might suit him not to take those precautions and to be slipshod about it and to argue that he could not know because the circumstances were different from a purchase in a bar for consumption in that bar.

<P>
I am also concerned about the place of purchase. The amendment refers to purchases in licensed premises, so it must essentially relate to purchases for off consumption. The on licence is already covered in the clause. That brings us back, albeit briefly and perhaps not conclusively at this stage, to what are purchases in licensed premises. We had a lot of discussion on Second Reading about internet purchases. It is clear that there is a purchase and that there is a licensee. By definition, even if the internet is in cyberspace, there must be a legal point at which that purchase takes place.

<P>
I am not clear whether the amendment captures internet purchases by young people so it would be helpful to have some elucidation. They would perhaps be deemed to have taken place at the licensed premises from which the goods were consigned. We are moving into a world where young people are more mobile and their social relationships-certainly judging from the experience of my family-are pretty wide and pretty fluid. There will be different kinds of understanding of the age and character of the people involved. Technically the modes of delivery are also widening.

<P>
I certainly do not wish to oppose the amendment. My hon. Friend is right to seek to expand the point of purchase from the on licence to the off licence and to deal with proxy purchasing which worried many hon. Members of all parties. I am anxious that he should give some response to those concerns to make sure that the Bill works in the way that we would all intend.

<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I thank the hon. Member for Pudsey for stooping to pick up one of the golden apples that I laid down for him. I suspect that some of the golden apples laid out that day were catalysed not by his Bill but by one that was lower down the Order Paper.

<P>
The amendment will be welcomed by our constituents and by the licensed trade. So often when this happens it is known about in the neighbourhood and in the parades of shops where it takes place. I have a constituency case where a reputable licensee is infuriated that he prevents this practice, yet further down the parade a less scrupulous retail outlet is making that service available to the great chagrin of residents in the surrounding estates. The implementation of the amendment would be a great relief for such neighbourhoods and for that reason I support it.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I join the general welcome given to the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey and to the Bill. The Government strongly support it. The amendment would create an additional offence of purchasing alcohol on behalf of someone who is under 18. It is an offence under section 169 of the Licensing Act 1964 to purchase alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 in a bar in licensed premises. Effectively, the amendment would also deal with a problem that has been identified by the police on many occasions, perhaps to many hon. Members in their areas-when a young person asks an older person to buy alcohol for him and then consumes it.

<P>
The aim is that the only persons to be caught by the amendment would be those who purchased alcohol ``on behalf of'' a person under 18. So it would exclude, for example, a parent who took the view that he was purchasing alcohol for his own child, perhaps to serve it with a meal as a way of introducing a child to alcohol, or a friend who, with the parents' consent, purchased it. It is a narrow amendment to deal with a serious problem that the police in my area of North Warwickshire have identified, and one that the police around the country have raised with the Home Office.

<P>
A Manchester study found that regular young drinkers were much more likely to have a criminal record than those who did not drink, and a Scottish study of young offenders also showed that 80 per cent. of offenders found guilty of breaching the peace, and 88 per cent. of those guilty of causing criminal damage, were intoxicated at the time of the offence. We are dealing with a very serious and growing criminal problem as well as with young people who drink alcohol when they should not. I greatly welcome my hon. Friend's moves to tackle the issue.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) raised a number of issues on which I shall comment briefly before my hon. Friend replies. He said that there was greater difficulty with the burden of proof, and he is right. Of course, these offences will need to be proved on the usual standard of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, in a court. He said that an innocent person might be requested by someone whom he believed to be over 18 to buy alcohol for him, so might unwittingly get caught in such an offence. In each case-that of a person who innocently buys alcohol for someone whom be believes to be over 18, and that of someone who perhaps negligently or knowingly buys it on behalf of a person under 18 but seeks to disguise the fact by saying ``I wasn't aware of it''-the burden of proof would rest with the prosecution; but it would be for the court to decide whether, on the evidence before it, the view of an individual was a reasonable one to take in all the circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is being helpful, as I anticipated he would. Has he taken advice from, for example, magistrates about whether, in a magistrates court where such a clash of evidence occurs, it will be reasonably practicable to resolve it?

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Magistrates courts would usually readily determine issues of what is reasonable: essentially, that is what courts are for. I do not envisage there being any difficulty. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we had consulted magistrates. We would normally have such consultations, and I undertake to consult the Magistrates Association. However, such issues are determined daily by magistrates or juries, so I do not anticipate any problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Pudsey for their explanations. The amendment refers to an agency transaction; will the Minister expand on the hon. Member for Daventry's compelling point about the defence that a person was honestly mistaken about the purchaser's age? What effect will the Bill have on that defence?

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> ``Agency'' is the right word; it is used in Scottish legislation. The hon. Gentleman correctly identified the relevant area of the law. We felt that ``on behalf of'' was just as good but, as he said, it raises the matter of agency.

<P>
The defence would be as follows: ``When I met the individual who asked me to purchase the alcohol, there was nothing in his physical appearance or size''-he may have been tall and looked older-``to lead me to believe that he was under 18. Therefore, I was not on notice that I should act with a substantial degree of care and I did not have the requisite intention of breaching the legislation when I undertook the purchase.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Presumably, the key is the word ``knowingly'' in new section 169B.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. There would be a requirement of intention-a mens rea-in the operation of the measure. An innocent party would have a defence, provided that he could show that he acted innocently. The aim is not to create an absolute offence but a criminal offence in which both requirements, of an intention and of an act-mens rea and actus reus-will be necessary in order to prove that the offence was committed and for the magistrates or the Crown court on appeal to determine the guilt of the person involved and therefore to effect the punishment.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of internet purchasing. I cannot go through such a complex issue fully today, but I can say that most underage drinkers do not use the internet to purchase alcohol, primarily because they want instant gratification and such purchasing, by its nature, takes time. Another impediment to under-18s using the internet for that purpose is that few of them have a credit card. The evidence is that most underage drinkers do not obtain alcohol from the internet. Nevertheless, we shall monitor the issue carefully. The White Paper, which will be published in the next few weeks, will refer to the problem. The difficulties of legislating on the matter are substantial, as some internet purchases may be made from abroad.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also asked at what point the purchase would take place; if the supplier was on licensed premises, because of the nature of some internet purchasing, it would take place at the point at which the offer was accepted by the shopkeeper. At that stage, it would indeed occur on licensed premises, so it may be covered by the measure.

<P>
I think that I have covered the matters raised in the debate; we are dealing with an area of law that has caused substantial anxiety in many local communitites and to the police. If we can close that lacuna in the law so that we can deal with people who are purchasing alcohol on behalf of those who are under age, we will do something that the police and many communities throughout the country will welcome. I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising the issue.
