make some preliminary announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove
their jackets during Committee sittings. Will all hon. Members ensure
that mobile phones, pagers and so on are either turned off or switched
to silent mode? As a general rule, my fellow Chair and I do not intend
to call starred amendments that have not been tabled with adequate
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000007">&#160;</a>

everyone is familiar with taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, so it might help if I briefly explain how we will proceed.
The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion on
the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We
will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence, followed by a
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral evidence sittings. I hope that we will be able to deal with
that formally. Assuming that the motion is agreed to, the Committee
will move into private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the
witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into the room
and our oral evidence sitting will begin. If the Committee agrees to
the programme motion, it will hear oral evidence this morning and this
afternoon. I hope that that is
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000008">&#160;</a>

whether it is usual, because I do not have that level of experience. I

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is conceivable that we will reach an agreement with all the trade
unions in the current negotiations. At every step in the process, the
Government have made it clear that they intend, if possible, to reach a
negotiated outcome on the long-term sustainable compensation scheme
that we need in the future. If such an agreement were to be reached, it
would be open to Ministers to exercise the sunset provision in clause 2
and lay the new scheme before Parliament in the normal way, and it
would have immediate
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
possibility remains that, even if we had a scheme that was adopted by
the Council of Civil Service Unions and agreed with the Government,
individual or groups of civil servants may still wish to challenge the
terms of that scheme on the basis that it might contain provisions that
are less generous than those of the former scheme, which was subject to
judicial review earlier this year. It remains the case that were such a
challenge to be mounted, either individually or collectively, a court
might hear such a challenge and might grant interim relief while it was
being processed through the judicial system. If such relief were to be
granted, it would be for Ministers to decide whether it was necessary
to revive the terms of the legislation, so that we do not find
ourselves in a position where we are moving from one scheme to another
scheme to another at a time when the Government simply cannot operate
and plan to operate in terms of their work force in such a
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000057">&#160;</a>

question, and the first is the most important, because I cannot for the
moment see circumstances in which, if we were not to reach an agreement
with the unions on a long-term deal, we would recommend to Ministers
that they should exercise the provisions of the sunset clause. As it
stands, the Bill is designed to cover circumstances where a deal has
not been reached with the trade unions. If that were to happen, the
Bill and its provisions would then take effect. I cannot see any
circumstance in which the sunset provision would then be applied by
Ministers, which renders the question of why you might revive it in the
future more difficult to answer. My understanding is that under clause
2, revival would need to be under the affirmative procedure in the
House. It would therefore be subject to scrutiny by the House, if those
circumstances, however remote, were to come
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000060">&#160;</a>

I recognise the situation that you describe and I am happy to give you
a response, but I have not used the term “civil servants are
doing nothing”. The reality is that people may have lost their
roles because of reorganisation that is in the pipeline, or they may be
subject to reorganisation in the future when their roles would go. The
reality is that in the vast majority of cases those people are not
doing nothing—they are being gainfully
employed.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000064">&#160;</a>

we go beyond that definition to address what I think you are asking,
which is about the advice that we are giving. We are giving advice on a
daily basis. Before 10 o’clock—when I left to come here
this morning—I gave advice to three Departments on the
redundancy programmes and severance schemes that they wanted to run.
The advice we are giving is that all Departments have to take due
account of the work we are doing, the possible provisions of the Bill
and the landscape in which we are trying to negotiate a settlement. In
each case, there will be a different set of outcomes for the business
case, as to whether it should be offering terms and what those terms
might be. With very few exceptions, we are agreeing terms with
Departments for them to offer the work force voluntary—and, in
some cases, compulsory—severance. Yesterday, I approved a case
for the compulsory severance of nine people in a particular area of
work.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000065">&#160;</a>

that I need to come to. We all have a working assumption that, as a
result of the current spending review settlements, individual
Departments will have reduced budgets. In some cases, the headline news
already is that they will be much reduced. That will have an effect on
the number of people within those Departments, but those settlements
have not yet been reached. As a result, Departments are not in a
position today to say how many people they expect to lose, how many
people they expect to retain and the skills that need to be considered
alongside that. We are weeks away from the date in October when the
settlements will be announced and made public. Once those announcements
have been made, Departments will talk to the Cabinet Office about their
respective draw-down plans, to ensure that those plans are coherent

                           </em> Because before February, we were
negotiating a settlement with the CCSU in the hope and expectation that
we would arrive at a settlement. It was not until those hopes were
thwarted and dashed by our inability to reach a settlement with all six
of the unions that we arrived at the position where there was no
prospect of negotiating an agreement. That Rubicon was crossed when we
faced the outcome of the judicial review, which was announced at the
time of the general election—if my memory serves me right, the
outcome of the judicial review was after the general election—so
it would not have been appropriate to have been talking in terms of the
policy and the processes behind the Bill when we were negotiating in
good faith and hoping to reach agreement with six
unions.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000079">&#160;</a>

terms with the unions was that you knew that there would be absolutely
no chance whatsoever of getting even one of the unions to agree to the
terms in the Bill. The February 2010 proposals were agreed by five out
of the six unions. As I am sure you accept, the point about the
judicial review being an obstacle is easily met. The judicial review
succeeded only because the proposals had not been reached by agreement.
You can fix the 2010 package and meet the terms of the judicial review
without dispensing with the whole package. Would you

                           </em> Yes, with respect to the five unions, but
the sixth union did object to the terms in the package. You are
absolutely right. But the Public and Commercial Services Union did not
agree to the terms in the February package, and so it cannot be said
that those terms were universally adopted by the CCSU.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000089">&#160;</a>

about objection, and I think it is important to add that this is a
negotiation on both sides. By May, when this matter was being
challenged, we had come through a general election campaign when a
range of manifesto pronouncements had been made on compensation by the
various parties. I do not think it right to rest on the fact that the
Government formed after the general election would necessarily have
adopted the terms of the February agreement. In February, the then
Opposition stated quite clearly that they would review again the terms
of the compensation scheme if they were elected. I need to leave open
the question that on both sides of the negotiating table it was open
for us to return to that
discussion.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000090">&#160;</a>

unions to veto a change to the agreement. One of the unions decided to
use that veto to change the agreement, and the High Court—the
administrative court—struck that down when it was taken to
judicial review. Would I be right to assume, therefore, that you would

approach to open up the

points, but I will be as brief as possible. They follow on from the
point about the legal challenge. Mr Amroliwala, you have accepted in
your introductory statement that this is open to challenge. Indeed, the

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                           </div>PCS said at the Public Administration Committee that it
would challenge it on human rights grounds. You also accepted that it
could be open to successful challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How robust is
your legal advice, and how confident are you that the Government would
defend their position successfully this time? Is it a 50:50, 60:40, or
70:30 chance of success? I ask the question because in previous
meetings you were extremely confident in advising the Minister that the
Government’s previous position was robust. In fact, you were
virtually certain of victory in the courts, and then the Government
lost. Last time round, the High Court ruled that redundancy rates are
accrued rights. Therefore, that seems to be the basis of the challenge
under European laws that the PCS will use. How confident are you? What
have your lawyers advised is the percentage chance of
victory?<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the Public Administration Committee’s discussion, the Chair
said—as you have said—that if the courts rule against the
Government, they could provide interim relief or, in the longer term,
full redress. What calculation has been made for the potential
provision of interim relief? Have you recommended that the Government
have a contingency fund for such cases? I would also welcome an
answer—if not today, by a note—about the cost so far to
the Government of the legal actions that they have lost.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000099">&#160;</a>

very briefly, time and again in the debate we have discussed the number
of staff who were on terms of five or six years’ redundancy
payment calculations. The figures on the number of such staff and the
overall cost of that are still to be disclosed. It would be helpful for
us to have that information in advance of the final debate on the

that you asked them. I did say what I said about the Government being
open to challenge. Frankly, it would be impossible and rather arrogant
to say at any time that the Government are not open to challenge in
such matters. It will always be open to parties to challenge, and it is
for them to make those decisions. There is always a theoretical chance
at the very least that a challenge is capable of being mounted
successfully.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000106">&#160;</a>

know, I think, that legal advice in such cases—particularly that
given to the Government—is privileged. The Committee will be
aware, I think, that the Minister for the Cabinet Office has certified
the Bill as being compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. If it
helps the Committee—but I am sure that Members will already
know—the analysis of that is given in paragraph 18 of the
explanatory notes to the Bill. Now, I am not a lawyer and, frankly, I
do not think I can reasonably add more than that to what I have said,
so far as legal advice is concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000108">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You asked
about the costs, I think, of legal challenge thus far. I will happily,
Mr Chairman—if it is appropriate—go away and see if I can
provide a note to the Committee that covers that question. Indeed, it
may be possible also to provide a note that covers your third question,
which was to do with the numbers of staff who may possibly attract
terms which are, perhaps, levels of multiples in the order of five or
six years’ salaries. That question was asked.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are two
very clear classes or groups that we are considering here. There is the
population—those staff who may be entitled, by virtue of their
age and of their length of service, as matters of fact. That is not
impossible to deduce, because we have that level of data. What is far
more difficult, and frankly close to impossible to provide for anybody
with a degree of accuracy, are those who actually have applied over the
course of a period of time and who might have been entitled to that
level of compensation had their application been accepted and
progressed. Of course, when you are doing a calculation about those
people you are going to let go in any scheme, and one feature of the
scheme is affordability, there is always a reasonable chance that
somebody, whose calculation of salary on departure is five or six
times, is not going to be successful in applying for that scheme. So it
is just not possible to say how many people that would amount to. But
the population of those who might be eligible to apply—it is a
matter of public record that the Office for National Statistics
produces the figures—as I say, I am happy to do a distillation
of that if it helps the Committee to understand those
numbers.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000110">&#160;</a>

experience and expertise to tell you whether legislation in the past

my own experience to rely upon to help me there, so I can’t

                        <p class="tabbed">There
was a fifth question, about consultation. The short answer is this:
your very kind words about consulting staff I hope are true, at least
in part, but that consultation did not happen until after we had left
the domain of having private negotiations with the trade unions and we
actually had something that was in some way settled. I acknowledge that
it was only settled with five out of six unions, but it was a settled
position the Government had reached with five out of six unions and, at
a moment in time, it was agreed between all the parties that that could
become public. Only at that point, when it was agreed that it could
become public, did the efforts to engage the staff take place. Indeed,
the parallel work was then done by the trade unions to engage their

Member for Hayes and Harlington, would I be right in saying that the
reason why you haven’t recommended that a contingency fund is
established, or why you would have recommended any Government to go
down this form of route, is that whereas a statutory instrument is
secondary legislation and is subject to judicial review—either
on human rights grounds, or on the fact that in the previous instance
it was not in accordance with statute law—primary legislation,
which this is, cannot be struck down through judicial
review?<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000115">&#160;</a>

stretch in one sentence the limits of my knowledge on this, is that
primary legislation is capable of being challenged on the basis of its
incompatibility with European law. But in the event that such a
challenge were mounted, and even in the event that a court were
successfully to accede to that challenge, it still would not have the
effect of striking it down. It would create the effect of the
Government being obliged to respond and indicate how they intended to
remedy the defect that the court had agreed. It would create the effect

would presumably be a potential issue if primary legislation was
challenged. My understanding as an employee in both the public and

certainly accrued rights, redundancy payments are what are in practice
by the employer at the time when anyone is made redundant. Could you

required to be compensated for leaving early would be the rate that was

on both sides of the House, are keen to try to do as far as possible. I
know that is one of the Government’s primary objectives in
negotiating with the trade unions a settlement that will be different
from that proposed in the Bill. Could you clarify whether you believe
that the only way to protect the lower paid is through negotiation
rather than primary legislation? If, by chance, one of the unions
decided not to agree a negotiated settlement, would you consider
amending clause 1 of the Bill to achieve greater protection of lower

starting point was to ask whether the intent was to recognise the
position found by the low-paid in our negotiated settlement. Ministers
and the Government could not have been clearer from the day that the
Bill was first introduced. It is very much the case that one of the
fundamental pillars of our negotiations is around the low-paid. But I
have to say—you would expect me to say this—that the
negotiations with the trade unions and the CCSU have been conducted
entirely in private. I think the Minister said in the House on Tuesday
that to share with anyone at the moment where the negotiations stand
would be seen as an act of bad faith, and you would not want me to do
that in front of you today. I am sure that my colleagues who are on the
other side of the negotiating table would take the same position. All I
would say to you is that it is of fundamental importance to the
construction of the scheme, on both sides of the negotiating table,
that we find ways of both defining and protecting, because they are two
separate
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000124">&#160;</a>

introduction of the many different facets of protection, however you do
it mathematically—whether it is tapered by formulae or by any
other meaningful long-term way, by which I mean one that is indexed and
therefore keeps its value as the scheme moves forward—that
protecting the low-paid is the stuff of primary legislation. It would
require a level of complexity that this Bill simply could not
accommodate.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000125">&#160;</a>

is the judgment of Ministers and this Government that the terms of the

unaffordable, given the future economic situation and the size of the

but we are increasingly seeing local government schemes based on
statutory provision, albeit without the £380 per week
cap, and sometimes with a top-up for voluntary redundancy, certainly
significantly less than the month per year for the CS scheme. In the
private sector, for larger employers, median provision is about three
weeks per year, and it is reducing. Last year, a number of private
sector businesses took the opportunity to reduce their redundancy terms
simply to make them more affordable, given the financial situation that
they were
facing.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000135">&#160;</a>

understand the true situation as you understand it as to whether there
has been a gap widely in favour of the public sector versus the private
sector, both in terms of redundancy pay, which this Bill tries to
address, and weekly earnings and pension provisions. Crucially, we need
to keep our talent flowing into the civil service and we need a strong
and healthy public sector. Does this risk alter the compact that has
been built and deter good quality candidates from entering the system
at a time when we need fresh entrants, fresh ideas and fresh

Boreham:</strong>
                           </em> Yes, the situation has changed.
Historically, the public sector tended to pay lower weekly or monthly
salaries, and to have slightly better pensions and redundancy terms. In
the private sector, the pension terms have been scaled back for new
entrants. Typically, new private sector workers enter a defined
contribution scheme, in which they will not have guarantees and will
bear the investment risk, and for which employers’ contributions
will be much lower than in an historical private sector or current
public sector final salary
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
private sector is also pulling down redundancy terms on the grounds of
affordability. So, there is a significant gap between public and
private sector redundancy in financial terms. In large parts of the
public sector over the past 10 years or so, salaries have grown
significantly. For people earning up to about £40,000 or
£50,000, on average—the average covers a vast
variation—the public sector now pays more than the private
sector. That is probably less true in the civil service, but it is more
true in local government, which has to pay market rates, and in all
parts of the NHS, in which there has been significant salary growth
following “Agenda for
Change”.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
deal has changed, and the public service is now more competitive. That
is less true at the top end, although obviously in absolute terms,
those individuals are paid more. You ask, “Does it stop the
public sector, particularly the civil service, from hiring the right
talent?” No, I do not think it does, because I do not think that
bright people entering the work force think about what will happen when
they are fired, and if they are, one would not want to hire
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000143">&#160;</a>

compensation, and that is one way to achieve that. What is low pay? We
are into subjectivity here. A new graduate might be hired on a salary
in the mid-20s, but what salary do you give to a new graduate who is on
a fast track in the civil service? As a starting point, I might be
looking at something below that figure.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000158">&#160;</a>

civil service median salaries are below £21,000. One has to be
careful in redefining what “median” is, as it can
suddenly become “low paid”. The fact that you are paid
£1 below the median does not mean that you are low paid, and the
fact that you are paid £1 above the median does not mean that
you are high

                        <p>I wonder whether I
could draw you out on making distinctions between treatment of people
at the lower end of the pay spectrum and of people at the higher end,
in terms of redundancy practice. My second question relates to your
description in the written submission of<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000165">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On the first point,
typically, in the private sector, redundancy pay would be
directly proportional to service and salary. There would be no
differentiation between levels in the organisation, except at the very
top, where executives would be in a different, independent arrangement.
They would not, however, normally be entitled to redundancy pay. So, it
would be directly
proportional.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
minority of private sector employers would have a minimum payment in
place. Obviously, we have data from our databases, but I have talked to
a number of my clients over the past couple of weeks about what they
do. A couple of them said that they pay a minimum amount to
people—typically, a minimum number of weeks, rather than a
minimum figure in pounds. There was recognition that if somebody joins
an organisation and they are turfed out a year later, it is incumbent
on the organisation to pay reasonable compensation.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the
disconnect, somebody who has been in the civil service for a limited
period might leave with one or two months’ redundancy pay, plus
their notice period. By comparison, somebody who has been in the civil
service for a long time would perhaps leave with several years’
pay. In terms of fairness, I struggle to see why they would get so much
more. We have redundancy pay to allow people the breathing space to
find another job, so I am not sure whether people who have been with
the organisation for 20 years need to be getting 20 times as much as
somebody who has been with the organisation for one
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000169">&#160;</a>

redundancy terms. I think it is going to have an effect on senior
executive pay over the next few years. In the period in the early
noughties, in the boom times, we were in an environment where general
staff salaries were growing in real terms, inflation was quite low and
living standards were improving, so, to an extent, the work force lived
with the fact that chief executives’ pay was shooting up,
because they were feeling better off. I think we are going through an
environment now where, our research suggests, private sector salaries
are going to be growing no faster than inflation for the general
population. We are expecting to see some tax increases; we are
expecting to see public expenditure coming down. Living standards are,
at best, going to stagnate for most workers.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000175">&#160;</a>

here—apart from some of the fairly worrying concerns that people
have about the implications of the new scheme for their future
lives—is the view that people who have been in the service for a
long time have been in it for a whole range of reasons. They have
accepted lower rates of pay because they have the security of other
forms of payments, such as redundancies and pensions, and that comes
across in a few of the statements. I can understand your concern about
the differentiation over long service, but the reason why that has
built up is that people have entered this service accepting, for a
period of time, lower rates of pay because they have these other
benefits. So they have taken a view in the round when they have chosen
their career. I understand your view that that should not be such an
overriding factor now. That is why in the private sector, where there
have been changes, they have taken into account the historical
decisions of their staff and they have applied new systems to new
joiners.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000199">&#160;</a>

redundancies are in contracts of employment, so they have had to
negotiate those. On many occasions, if you look across the field, they
have applied the mechanism to the negotiations with new joiners. That
is to ease the implementation of the mechanism itself. Has the
consequences or financial implications been considered—perhaps
Mr Amroliwala should respond to this—of applying this mechanism
to new joiners only?<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000201">&#160;</a>

Boreham:</strong>
                           </em> If I can answer the private sector question
first, and then we can revert to the question of whether it has it been
considered. In the private sector, there are some businesses that have
redundancies in their employment contracts. That is generally seen as
an unwise way of doing things. The best practice would be to have the
terms in, for example, the staff handbook, and to make it very clear
that they can be varied from time to time. Clearly, if you hard-wire
your redundancy terms, and the organisation’s survival is under
threat, you could potentially end up with the situation in which the
whole organisation is dragged under by the redundancy terms, which is
clearly in nobody’s interests. Although that happens from time
to time, it would be unusual, and we would not see that as being good
practice. What you describe is very true for pension terms. That tends
to happen for new
entrants.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000202">&#160;</a>

Amroliwala:</strong>
                           </em> In response to your last point, that is
exactly the case of the civil service. In 2007, pension terms were
changed for new entrants, and when the new pension scheme for the civil
service was introduced, no change was made to the existing work force.
New entrants after 1 July came in on a new career average pension
scheme. We stopped new entrants joining on

			Column number: 19<a class="bkMark" name="Column19">&#160;</a>

“Have we considered doing the same for compensation?” is
no, we have not, because we are dealing with a community of 480,000
people for whom we want new, modern, revised, affordable and
sustainable terms to apply. Simply providing those terms for new
entrants on a trickle feed into the system does not do justice to what
we are trying to

thought was quite interesting—does this change the deal of
joining the civil service? Obviously, we need to look at what may come
out from the negotiations, but if this ends up as the answer, it
changes the deal in the longer term. I am sure that that has been
looked at within the civil service, because it raises questions about
the whole deal of quite inflexible and quite fixed pay—the high
pensions and high termination that we have in the public sector, which
differs from the deal in the private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000204">&#160;</a>

evidence that he might have from the private sector about the impact on
mobility for the lower paid—the more junior staff—in
organisations where the total compensation for senior staff being made
redundant is reduced. Is there any evidence from the private sector on
how that impacts on junior staff and their
mobility?<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000210">&#160;</a>

the whole cost agenda is a lot of talk about natural wastage, a lot of
talk about voluntary redundancy. In terms of reducing pain, that is
entirely good, but there needs to be some kind of overlay decision of
manpower planning. My private sector clients would be saying,
“Well, who do we need in finance? How many people? How many
people do we need in IT? How many people do we need in the north-east
of England?”, and also looking at the performance of individuals
in selecting people for

terms and conditions, we naturally have to give some thought to how
that will affect individuals and their productivity, and particularly
the element of discretionary effort that they might apply otherwise.

changes are necessary, so having been cognisant of those issues, we
still would need to move forward with what we are doing
here.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000229">&#160;</a>

work, which is to make sure that, as soon as is practically possible,
we can say to the work force that we have negotiated a successor scheme

the long term. That takes care of those issues that they would
otherwise be concerned about and affords protection to the groups of
people whom we would seek to protect. It would help to ensure that that
level of discretionary effort was maintained going forward. As things
stand at the moment, that is exactly the intent of our negotiations.

bonuses, severance packages and share options.” That problem is
not created by you or the civil service, but it will be difficult to
convince these civil servants

sector pay-offs? I do not think that anyone involved in private sector
remuneration likes the way it operates—it turns the stomach if
someone has not done a particularly good job but gets a huge pay-off.
No one likes that. Organisations do it because they do a cost-benefit
analysis, which says that if we pay this person a lot of money to go
away, they will go away, they will not take us to court, there will not
be a fuss and we will move on. If they try to play hard ball, however,
you end up in court, your dirty linen is washed in public and your
senior executives are tied up in legal action. So, although it is
unpalatable in many ways, it is a simple cost-benefit decision by those
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000232">&#160;</a>

you in any way mislead the Committee—you were not an advisor to
the Government in the past in terms of redundancies and all the rest of
it. I just want to say to Dusty that I know of no scheme in the public
sector, and certainly in the civil service, that is based on
“last in, first out”. In fact, every redundancy that has
taken place in recent years has, in law, required the Government and
Departments to identify the reasons for redundancy, to look at the
restructuring, to go through a consultation process and to judge people
on the basis of their ability to perform their duties in that
redundancy situation. It is true, is it not, that there is no
“last in, first
out”?<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to follow on with something because it relates to past practice.
Let me go back to the individual representations that have been made to
us, which are distressing at times. One person said that they did not
have any redundancy mortgage protection insurance—they were
worried about losing their home. When people entered the service, they
saw the redundancy arrangements that would apply almost as their
redundancy mortgage protection. They were not given the option of
redundancy protection insurance because they thought that the terms and
conditions on which they were employed would provide them with that
protection. If you are in the private sector, you know that if the
conditions are not particularly good, you can take out your own
redundancy mortgage protection insurance. However, these people have
not done that, on the basis of the

                           </div>calculation that if they ever entered a redundancy situation, they would
be protected by the existing scheme. That relates back to the point
Peter made—quite rightly so—that this tears up the
original contract and undermines the accrued rights that people had
looked to in order to guarantee their protection in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000238">&#160;</a>

happened in the private sector as well. Private sector organisations
have brought down their redundancy provisions. There is no doubt that
redundancy is a miserable situation that leads people into financial
hardship. The problem is that if we are in a situation in which we are
cutting the work force because we are short of money—this goes
back to the point made earlier—while we want to help those
people to stay on their feet, there are limits to how much we can give
them, because the reason we are cutting heads is to reduce costs. If
the pay-back period for cutting those heads is two or three years, it
does not make sense any more. However, there are no winners in such a
situation—except, perhaps, some of the top executives you
referred

approach redundancy is broadly right. People selected for redundancy
are never selected on the basis of a single feature. There is a broad

one.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000242">&#160;</a>

phrase was used to characterise the consideration of affordability, not

We have talked about why it is not necessarily applicable across the

which we have an enormous and proliferating number? Many of those are

civil service has maintained—there have been successive
statements by Ministers in both this Government and the previous
one—that compulsory redundancies are a last resort. What lies
behind that sentiment is the fact that there is a long-standing process
that has been agreed through negotiation with the trade unions not only
on the terms on compensation, but the process by which someone is
selected for redundancy. That process has an exhaustive number of
stages where considerations of other types of employment, including
inter and intra-departmental transfers, are all explored. It is only
when you reach the end of that process, in agreement with the trade
unions around the discussion table, that you jointly agree that an
individual or a group will be made redundant. There is a long

who want to go into the public sector or the civil service. Perhaps 15
or 10 years ago, the widespread belief was that your pay wasn’t
as high as that of the private sector, but there were compensating
factors, such as pension and other benefits. Over time, that has
changed. The public sector has had to catch up with the private sector
in terms of pay to recruit people and expertise. Again, you could say
that it might be time to look at the total package and see whether
things like that need to be rebalanced again. I would hope that nobody
goes into the civil service because it has a great redundancy
package.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000260">&#160;</a>

Is that a bad thing? I don’t know, although that is possibly
another question. If you look at the private sector, the deal or the
contract—however broadly you choose to define it—between
employees and employers is changing and evolving all the time. You need
to look at it from a number of different perspectives, one being the
employees’ perspective. What are the perceptions of this change
likely to mean for those employees? The employer always has a
perspective on these things. What is the kind of relationship that they
are trying to create with their employees and is this change supportive
of that? There is always an affordability question, which no doubt we
will come on to. There is also a competitive question. Is this deal
likely to be consistent with the practices that apply elsewhere and,
understanding that that is probably going to be the focus of other
questions, I will hold it at that

financial imperatives in private industries are more immediate than
they are in a Government scenario. So over the last decade or so
private sector companies have had to adjust over time to these new
financial imperatives. If you look at the overall package there are all
sorts of statistics that compare the private sector with the public
sector, but generally speaking public sector severance pay and
pensions, although perhaps it is more difficult to make that assessment
with pay, would be better now than those in the private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000262">&#160;</a>

make up an employment package but if one just takes severance terms as
an example, the severance terms of the civil service are much greater
than those in the private sector. There is no doubt about that. It is
not just a question of the cap action that seems to be talked about,
but the accrual rate and how quickly you get to the cap. That is a very
important factor that we could come back to if you wanted to. That is a
factor and although pensions are not the subject today, we are moving
towards a situation where defined benefit pension plans are no longer
in place in the private sector, compared with the public sector, where
they are. I am not saying that that is right or wrong; I am just saying
that it is creating different employment packages between the public
and private sectors, in quite a substantial way. It may not be the end
of the world, but I do think that that is a good thing, because those
in the private sector are

                           </em> There are a number of different factors that
an organisation uses to define its redundancy policies and payment
levels. We have touched on some of them, such as affordability and
competitiveness. The culture of the organisation is often very
important. Historically, has it been paternalistic, or has it been run
on a more commercial footing? Other factors include the history of
collective bargaining within the organisation. There are a lot of
factors around issues such as brand—how strong is the brand? Can
it get away with being cheap, or will that impact not only on its
public persona, but on the morale of the remaining people?
Organisations are often clear that they want to be fair and treat
people fairly. Those factors are the ones that we see coming to the
fore. As an institution, it would have to decide how those factors
would influence it differently from how they might influence other
private sector organisations. I suspect that factors such as culture
would be strong in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000274">&#160;</a>

review why it exists and why it produces goods or services. We need a
debate on what the public sector should be like in the 21st century.
Flowing from that, we will get a better idea of what skills, values,
behaviours and attitudes we need from our public servants, and how we
are going to recruit and retain them. At the moment, there is a danger
of focusing solely on the pay element without looking at the broader
context. In the private sector, you would see more of those
discussions—you would look at questions such as, why are we
here, what is success, and what do we need to do? Currently, the
discussion seems to be about how much we can afford, which is
important, but it will only get you so

the last one. One needs to be clear about what one is paying for when
someone is made redundant. It is not like any other form of dismissal,
where the individual will leave with the terms of the notice, and they
will have a degree of build-up to knowing that they are on their way.
There is always a question with redundancy payments of what you are
paying for. Is it a golden payment to an individual, to acknowledge
contribution and service, or is it to acknowledge the difficulties in
the labour market that the person will face? Typically, if one
organisation is going through redundancies, others will be doing the
same. Often it is somewhat linked to the skills that individuals have,
and the availability of those skills or otherwise within the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000276">&#160;</a>

handle this in private industry. If there is an economic imperative in
a company, you have to do

			Column number: 28<a class="bkMark" name="Column28">&#160;</a>
                           </div>something, but you want to do that, at all costs, in co-operation and
negotiation with the representative bodies and you want to explain it
to the employees—that is important to do. As a last resort, you
may not be able to do that, but that would be a last resort. You do a
lot of market research both in the public and private sectors, so you
understand what is really out there and what terms would be reasonable.
Such data should be collected from the public and private sectors, so
there would be a lot of market research. You then have to give yourself
a bit of time to negotiate, particularly when you are negotiating a
subject as emotive as redundancy terms—redundancy terms are
always emotive, but they are particularly emotive for employees who
think that they are about to be made redundant. In the private sector,
an employer would take some time to negotiate the position that they
wanted, perhaps with some compromises, of course, and might allow some
phasing, although not over too long a
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000278">&#160;</a>

Government’s dilemma is that the previous Government, the
previous employer, negotiated a deal that was blocked by law. I think
that a tactic potentially is to unblock that to reopen negotiations,
but you have to allow time for that to take place. I do not know how
the tactics will play out were the legislation to go through, but it
would be pretty difficult to say to your staff, who might be on, say, a
three-year cap, that the minute the legislation is enacted on 1
October, or whenever—I am not sure of the
date—negotiations will start from a position of reducing the cap
to one year. That would be difficult, because it is a big cliff and
probably does not allow sufficient room for
negotiation.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000279">&#160;</a>

links to the practices of businesses and organisations when faced with
a need for downsizing and their activities prior to making people
redundant. Based on my experience of the past two recessions and the
periods of growth that followed—I have heard accounts from
organisations and observed the pain that they went through and their
subsequent need to attract and retain people—I think that
lessons have been learned from the previous
recession.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000280">&#160;</a>

such as offering sabbaticals, part-time work and so on, but such
practices did not last long and the organisations quickly reverted to
redundancy activities; this time round we have seen more sincere

the answer is that we need to look at activities that might be
implemented to protect employment, because such activities are
beginning to
mature.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000281">&#160;</a>

far, and I believe that in part that has been a reflection of the
willingness of employers, employees and their representatives to

only thing that I would add is that when organisations look at
redundancy payments, they should consider, rather than paying the
maximum amount available, paying a little less, but using the extra
money for an out-placement service, or a scheme such as that, to help
those who have been made redundant to find work. Organisations might
also consider providing access to financial advice, because those
affected will be leaving

copies are available. As I read those statements, I was struck by the
personal circumstances. On the point to which you were just alluding,
there are examples of people who are, for example, in the redeployment
pool of the Ministry of Defence or are on what is known as the surplus
list of the Department for Work and Pensions. As HR professionals, what
advice would you give to your employers on best practice, given the
current economic conditions? Do you see such schemes as being practical
alternatives to redundancy? What impact do they have on mobility and
the attraction and retention of
staff?<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000284">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Generally speaking, in any redundancy
situation, one looks to redeploy staff within the organisation if you
possibly can. That is the first thing we do, and if it can possibly be
done, that is great and staff can be retrained internally. The second
thing one looks to do—my colleague referred to this—is
retrain and help people when they go out, if they have to leave the
organisation. One has to do that and that would be best practice, if
that is the question.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000285">&#160;</a>

possible. In a lot of organisations, it is not possible to carry people
if they continue to be paid. My employment before Mercer was in a
privatised utility organisation. It inherited many of the civil
services terms that applied. In relation to the particular example you
gave, there was a practice that meant that people could not be given
work because they were redundant. There were no compulsory
redundancies, so people were at home receiving full salaries for doing
nothing. That is not in anyone’s interest because
people’s skills begin to deteriorate and they become less and
less commercial in the market. If measures such as retraining are
possible, it is worth doing them, but if there is going to be bad news
at the end of the process it is better not to wait on those things and
to allow people the opportunity to go and pursue their
careers.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000286">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In my experience, in the private sector it
is normal to have a set of redundancy terms. They have probably been
used two or three times in the past in the company in question, and
there does not tend to be a distinction between voluntary and
compulsory terms—the terms tend to be what they are. I know that
there are situations where that is not the case, but in my experience,
it does tend to be the case. One looks for volunteers, and if you can
get the right group of volunteers that is great. If you cannot, you
have to move to compulsory redundancies. There is retraining where
possible, but obviously it will often not be sufficient to prevent
compulsory redundancies.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000288">&#160;</a>

colleagues will probably say that I have a different
perspective—was that in the private sector about half the
companies operate on the statutory scheme, but they tend to be the
smaller companies. If you look at significant companies, not the best
or the worst, but sizeable companies, they may have something like
three weeks’ pay per year of service. The best companies would
tend to have something like four weeks’ pay per year of service.
Of course, with those multipliers, the cap is not the big issue,
because at three years’ pay, it is 34 years before you hit two
years. My understanding is that the NHS, which I did look at, is about
a month’s pay per year of service with a two-year cap, which
would equate to bestish practice in the private sector—not way
out of whack, but a top company. The current civil service scheme is
way beyond that. There is a guy called Colin in the example, which I am
sure you read, who has 12 years’ service and 29 months’
pay. That is an accrual rate of about 10 weeks’ pay per year of
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000293">&#160;</a>

group, I am not sure—entered the service on the basis that
although there were lower levels of pay, there were arrangements
beneficial to them, such as the pension and redundancy arrangements.
They did not make alternative arrangements on that basis. They could
have entered into mortgage protection schemes in case of redundancy,
but they did not. Therefore, this unilateral tearing up of accrued
rights is what offends them. I have operated in both the private and

have private sector policies that were set in stone. They often reflect
the economic environment, and there are different reasons for
redundancy; for instance, some redundancies may be a response to
technological change. A type of job no longer exists and the
organisation might have sufficient funds to be generous, but other
situations can relate to the wider economy. Companies have to make more
widespread reductions in jobs, so it is not usual for private sector
organisations to have many benefits, other than pensions, that give

previous negotiation agreed some different terms, and they are sitting
there—“In the last 12 months, we negotiated those terms

would need to be some space and time to negotiate. There are a couple
of ways you could potentially do that. I do not know whether this is
practical or not, but assuming the Bill was passed, one way would be to
ask when that imposition would take place. If it took place at a period
of time in the future,

of time, one could even utilise the flexibility of voluntary terms on
the same basis as those that were negotiated, to give time to negotiate
the new terms and then phase things in. To answer your question, there
needs to be a bit of time to negotiate in good faith, but at the end of
the day, there needs to be a deadline, and both parties need to try to
reach an accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000305">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There has been research looking at the impact
of employee engagement. Individuals who have low levels of employee
engagement are less likely to stay with the organisation and to be good
performers and more likely to be absent through illness. So there have
been links showing that the more engaged a work force are, the more
productive and high performing they are likely to be. The issue,
though, is that many factors impact on employee engagement, and it is a
case of being able to realise that and not focusing on any specific
one.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000307">&#160;</a>

employees that has the greatest impact, and that is often the case with

suffer greater detriment. That clearly is the case. In a way, it
depends on how the formula works up to the point when the cap hits. If
the majority of your employees who are likely to be affected are
affected by the cap, it will clearly be an issue, yes, because a large
percentage of people will be above it. If the formula works up to a
position where very few people are affected by the cap, it will
arguably not be an issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10091427000313">&#160;</a>

make-up of the organisation. If it is correct that the more expensive
employees are not being made redundant because they are older, you
might end up making younger people and those lower down the pay scale
redundant instead. So in effect, you are distorting the make-up of the
civil service work force if you are encouraged to make only the
cheapest ones, who are usually younger, female and from other
disadvantaged groups,

about voluntary terms is that they are less likely to become an accrued
right, because you are playing them in and out. Also, you want to
encourage volunteers wherever possible. Of course, the dilemma with
that approach is that if someone is made redundant voluntarily versus
compulsorily, the compulsory person feels, in many ways, more put upon.
You can look at that either way, and I know of situations that do it
both

do it only on a voluntary basis and their terms tend to be more

before enacting compulsory redundancies. On the whole, however, looking
