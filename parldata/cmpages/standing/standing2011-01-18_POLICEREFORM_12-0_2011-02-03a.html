Good afternoon, Mr Chope. In relation to the point made this morning by
the hon. Member for Gedling about the need for police and crime panels
to engage with young people and his specific proposal that some members
of panels should be under the age of 18, I was saying that such a
formal requirement was not the right approach to take, not least
because it is the police and crime commissioner who should principal
ensure engagement with young people, but we need to think about how
best that could be achieved. It is not necessary for the legislation to
be prescriptive, but it is helpful to debate the matter. It is
something that all elected police and crime commissioners will want to
attend to, not least because of violent crime and other issues of
concern to young people. I hope that, on reflection, he will not press
his amendments to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the wider geographical and political balance raised by my hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh West, I have said that I shall reflect on
that. There are significant difficulties in achieving overall political
balance without creating complexity, but I am certainly willing to
consider such
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000060">&#160;</a>

the Minister that the key principle is that all areas within the
commissioner’s scope need to be represented, and I have been
careful not to challenge that principle through the amendments. Of
course, each local authority will choose whom they send to the panel,
but that is likely to make paragraphs 6 and 7 difficult to
achieve, which is why I proposed a small extra capacity. I am happy
that the Minister has agreed to take away that proposal and think about
it. The hon. Member for Gedling said his amendments were probing
amendments, although I realise that I could press them to a Division.

amendment centres once again on paragraphs 6 and 7, which deal with the
political and geographical make-up of a police and crime panel. It
would include in the Bill our statutory responsibility to ensure that
police and crime panels are politically and geographically
representative as far as is reasonable and practicable. At the moment,
all parts of a policing area are represented as far as possible, but
the schedule does not set out which body or bodies are responsible for
ensuring the balance. Under the amendment, the participating local
authorities would have a duty to ensure that, as a whole, the panel is
balanced. It would force them to come together and arrange details of
membership rather than just sticking a random cabinet member on the
panel. It is not prescriptive about the process that should be gone
through to meet the requirements of paragraphs 6 and

                           </div>7, but it tries to at least place a statutory responsibility on someone
to meet those requirements. That is all I want to say about the
amendment, because we have already gone into great detail about the
make-up of the panels.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000065">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Edinburgh West is right that
we touched on this issue in earlier debates, but it is relevant to
paragraphs 6 and 7, as he said. The Minister said that he would reflect
on these issues, which are important. If I might tease the Minister,
the proposals once again reflect the lack of clarity about some aspects
of the panel’s composition and functions. I appreciate that this
is a difficult conundrum for the Minister, but there is a need for
flexibility somewhere along the line so that we can deliver what
paragraphs 6 and 7 say. If we do not get those two aspects right, the
consequences will be quite significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We recognise the importance of ensuring that
members of the police and crime panel are geographically and
politically representative of the area. We also recognise that the duty
to ensure that appointments to the panel are representative must lie
with the responsible authorities. That is why all participating
authorities will be required under paragraph 19 to agree to the making
of panel arrangements, including arrangements to secure a geographical
and political balance of members on a panel. That will ensure that all
local authorities in the area are represented on the panel and that
local authority members are representative of the area’s
geographical and political make-up. It therefore follows that the
amendment does not really add anything to the Bill. For those reasons,
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West will withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As to the
additional point made by the hon. Member for Gedling, I do not accept
the assertion that there is no clarity in the Bill. There is absolute
clarity about how police and crime panels are to be constituted. The
fundamental principle is one member per representative authority,
except for those authorities that are too small, where a number is made
up, and two independents.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000068">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh West, however, raises the wider issue
of whether it is desirable for a panel to achieve some kind of overall
political balance in its membership, even recognising that each
authority should be entitled to nominate a member. That is a real and
important issue for us to discuss, and I have said that I am happy to
go away and think about it. However, it is a new issue, and it is
necessary to point out that it gives rise to difficulties, because it
would be a question of determining which authorities were to send
additional representatives and whether that would breach the principle
that they are meant to send one each to reflect the political balance.
How would a council feel if it sent two, but one had to be from an
opposition party?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those are the
sorts of issues that I need to reflect on, and we can discuss them at a
later stage if necessary. They go to the big question of whether it is
proper or desirable for the panel as a whole to represent some kind of
political balance in a particular police force area. They might,
therefore, go to issues of proportionality in voting. However, I am
concerned about the potential breach of the principle that each
authority nominates one member.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000070">&#160;</a>

here—the wider points that have been raised—and the fact
that the Bill is absolutely clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000071">&#160;</a>

issues arise in the Bill for panels with fewer than 10 participating
authorities. There is already capacity to make up geographical or
political balance, so those questions will still come up in such
circumstances. We are trying to lessen the impact, especially when
there are larger numbers of participating authorities. The issue is
difficult, but I accept that the Minister will take it away and have

                           </strong> This is a probing amendment. In September 2010,
9.5% of all police authority members were from a minority ethnic group
and, according to the figures, a little more than 30% were women. The
diversity of some police authorities is one of their strengths. It is
not as good as it should be, but it is certainly better than in other
bodies that we could mention. Will the Minister put on the record the
importance of that diversity, which I know he appreciates? Whether
through guidance, regulation or whatever, as far as is practicable, we
should encourage diversity in its broadest sense in the membership of
police and crime
panels.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000076">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I absolutely understand why the hon. Gentleman
has raised the issue, and I share his concern and interest. It is
certainly true that the independent members of police authorities often
bring to those authorities, particularly in areas where it does not
otherwise occur through the representation provided by councillor
members, the ability to represent, for instance, black and minority
ethnic communities. That is one of the advantages offered by
independent members, and it is one reasons why, in considering the
composition of panels, I felt it important to continue to provide a
role for them. Having two independent members provides the opportunity
to ensure that such issues can be taken

                           </div>into account. There is a provision in the Bill specifying how such
independent members are to be appointed, and they should have the right
skills for the

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would not want to include such amendments in the Bill, but I note what
the hon. Gentleman said about guidance. It will be important to ensure
that the panel addresses the issue if, for instance, it finds that it
lacks sufficiently broad representation through council nominations. Of
course, it is not only the panel that can take action; the police and
crime commissioner can make whatever appointments he or she
wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
issues of diversity, in particular in certain force areas, were
discussed yesterday in a Delegated Legislation Committee in the context
of changes to the codes under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. There was general agreement that the issues are important for
community confidence for the way in which policing is conducted. The
police and crime commissioner might well want to appoint advisers or an
advisory group. That is completely open to them. There is nothing to
stop them appointing advisers on the issues to ensure that they address
the question of diversity. It does not have to come from the panel,
whose job is to scrutinise the
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000079">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment goes back to the membership of police and crime panels,
focusing on co-opted members and asking whether they should
be voting members. While I am absolutely certain that co-opted members
who serve on police authorities are invaluable and bring great
experience and relevant knowledge, the central tenet of the Bill is to
advance the democratic accountability of policing decisions and
introduce a police and crime commissioner with a mandate from a vast
number of people to be involved in the strategic leading of those
decisions. It seems somewhat counter-intuitive then to have a police
and crime panel that could have co-opted voting members who do not have
democratic accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000084">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I can understand the
argument that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. However, with
reference to the previous debate, if the co-opted members were there to
represent, say, black and minority ethnic communities because they are
not represented in any other way, to have them there and then deprive
them of the right to vote is surely a touch
absurd.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000085">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> I draw the line there. There may well be
co-opted members who would be good proponents for the views of black
and minority ethnic groups. However, as young people are the major
victims of crime, they should be represented as well. With only two
co-opted members, where do we draw the line as to the most important
area to be represented? Should we be trying to ensure that we have
relevant experience or previous knowledge in criminal justice? Should
we look for someone who could give technical advice to the police and
crime panel? It is not just young people who are victims of crime. What
about victims’ groups? By the time you have a large number who
could be co-opted, you will have a difficult decision as to who to
co-opt as a voting member and who to co-opt as a non-voting member.
That is one option for working round the problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The point
that I am trying to make is that there is relevant knowledge and
experience out there that can be brought in. There may be an argument
for raising the number of co-opted members; perhaps two is not enough.
However, at its core, the Bill is about advancing the democratic
accountability of policing decisions. If one individual member has the
same input in the scrutiny of policing decisions made by the
commissioner, and if their vote has a value equal to that of someone
who is a representative of quite a large unitary authority representing
hundreds of thousands—perhaps up to 1 million—voters,
there is a definite imbalance. That is why I have raised the matter.
What are we looking to advance? Is it democratic accountability or is
it the relevant experience on the panel? I certainly would fall on the
side of democratic
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly
Oak made exactly the point that I was going to make. With a blanket
ban, we might exclude people whom we would not wish to exclude from
taking part and voting. From that point of view, it would be
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want the Minister to further clarify the provisions in the Bill. In the
arrangements that an individual panel makes for itself, can the
individual panel decide that its co-opted members should not be able to
vote? In other words, is it a blanket across-the-country thing or could
the individual police and crime panel make that decision, and is that
in the Bill? Does that therefore make the amendment irrelevant, because
the individual PCP could do that if it wished to do so, but if it was
worried about the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Selly Oak, it could decide not to do that. I have doubts
about a blanket ban on voting, full stop. A blanket ban would not be
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The answer to the hon. Gentleman’s
question is no. Paragraph 12 of schedule 6
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>So
it is clear that the two co-opted or independent members could vote. I
am always particularly pleased to be outflanked by my hon. Friends with
democratic arguments on how we should strengthen the Bill. I am
genuinely glad to have that bulwark. That was the case when we were
discussing the operational independence of chief constables, when my
hon. Friends were saying, “Be careful not to take that argument
too far. Accountability is important.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
the very reasons set out by the hon. Gentleman, I do not think that we
would want to return to the position that we have at the moment with a
significant number of independent members. It is clear that a large
majority of members will be elected councillors—a minimum of 10.
Therefore, the balance of decision making will lie in the hands of
elected members. However, there are circumstances in which the
independents can bring something to the deliberations that may not be
available by the nomination of a councillor by the authority. We have
already discussed the potential to address diversity issues, although
the Bill is clear. Paragraph 11 of schedule 6
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
co-opting members, the panel must secure that, as far as is reasonably
practicable, the members of the panel have, between them, the skills,
knowledge and experience necessary for the police and crime panel to
discharge its functions
effectively.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000412">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Back
in 1964, when police authorities were established by the Police Act
1964, I was just one year old. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock
Chase was not even a thought in his mother’s eye, still less a
gleam. There were no independent members on the police authorities
until they were added in 1994. I am clear that having two independent
members does mean, by definition, that they have no democratic mandate
whatever. However, they will be co-opted by the panel itself—by
the councillors. They will not be appointed by the Secretary of State,
so there is a localist aspect to this. There are only two of them and
the principal democratic mandate, of course, rests with the police and
crime commissioner. For that reason I am comfortable with the balance
of the arrangements that we have set up. It is right to give a place
for independents. Actually I think that, if the Government had not done
so, we would have been attacked for airbrushing independents out of
police and crime panels. On that basis, I hope that I may persuade my
hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West to agree with me and withdraw
the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000093">&#160;</a>

Friend the Minister said, but I still think that, although there is a
restriction to two members, that is still a significant proportion of a
police and crime panel of 12 members. In fact, it comes to 16%. I
return to the central argument that each one of those independent
members would have a vote of the same

                           </strong> I just want to deal with a couple of points that
arose earlier, for clarity, and to aid my understanding of the Bill,
and I hope other people’s. As to the panel arrangements for the
appointment of members, including independent members, is it for the
panel itself to make those arrangements? I think that is the case. If
it is, will the Minister explain the purpose of paragraph 21
on the “Application of other legislation”, which talks
about other things that the Secretary of State “may, by
regulations” do?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All I am
trying to understand is whether paragraph 21 applies to the
local panel arrangements. My reading of the provisions is that it is
for the panel to make its own arrangements, but under paragraph 21 the
Secretary of State can make regulations about all sorts of different
things. I just want clarity from the Minister as to whether I have
misread the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
a broader point, I agree about the importance of independents. There is
an interesting debate, and I expect it will continue, about whether two
is the right number. I do not want to dance on the head of a pin and
say that it should be three or one and a half or anything ridiculous,
but I agree that the change in 1994 to bring independents on to police
authorities was important. They can bring variety, skills and
experience to the authority that it did not have, and I think that it
is a good thing to replicate that with police and crime
panels.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The more
substantive point, which the Minister needs to spend a few minutes
explaining to the Committee, is the business of the elected mayors.
That is the point that troubles me. Under paragraph 3(6) of the
schedule, elected mayors will automatically be members of the police
and crime panel. That is probably quite reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was making
this point earlier. Let us say we have an elected police and crime
commissioner for West Yorkshire —I will use that area as an
example, because I know there is a proposal in the Localism Bill for
more elected mayors there—and three or four elected mayors,
perhaps for Bradford and Leeds, who are automatically members of the
PCP. Presumably, when they stand for election, one of their big
manifesto pledges will be on policing. The PCC can say, “I have
a democratic mandate to police West Yorkshire in this way”, but
the elected mayors on the PCP can say, “But I have a democratic
mandate for Leeds and Bradford.” The hon. Member for Amber
Valley and I were starting to have a little to and fro on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Which
democratic mandate has greater legitimacy? I suspect that the Minister
will have to say the PCC, because he is elected for the whole force
area. I can imagine the response. There is significant potential for
there to be a clash on this. I understand why the Minister wants
elected mayors on the panel—that is perfectly
reasonable—but who has greater democratic legitimacy for the
policing of an
area?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000106">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Does the hon. Gentleman accept
the point that this has been an issue in many fields of local and
national government? For example, say, in Scotland, a Member of this
Parliament was elected with a different mandate from that of the local
MSP. That would create the same conflict, as would be the case if a
Member of Parliament was elected on a different mandate from a police
commissioner. Those tensions will always be around where there are
different tiers. Council elections are coming up in May. Local
councillors could stand on different policies from those on which MPs
had been elected. The public will be clear on who has a mandate to do
what at each level. I am not sure that this is a new confusion, or one
where the public would feel
bothered.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Up to a point, the hon. Gentleman has a point, but
we are discussing a specific function, not a generality. This is about
one specific aspect of policy, perhaps with respect to policing, where
somebody could say, “This is what I will do about
policing,” and be put on a board that is responsible for
policing, vis-à-vis someone who has been elected to deliver
policing. The narrowness of focus is the issue. I accept that such a
clash can occur if someone is elected in generality on an issue, but
when the issue is more specific, the potential for a clash over who has
the democratic mandate is significantly greater. All I am asking the
Minister to tell us is how he sees that issue evolving with respect to
police and crime panels. It is legitimate for us to ask in Committee
how those PCPs will
function.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000108">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was just pondering the point raised by the hon.
Member for Amber Valley. This occurs to me: if someone ran for mayor on
an explicit ticket of challenging what the police commissioner was
doing because it was not properly representing the area, and was
elected, who would have the greater moral
legitimacy?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000109">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Those are the sorts of issue that will arise.
Interestingly, on a localism agenda, the person with the more local
mandate would be the elected mayor, because they would have been
elected in a smaller, more identifiable, community, rather than the
broader force area, which the police and crime commissioner is elected
for. This democratic legitimacy argument is important. The case can be
made that that will not be a problem, but I say to the Minister that,
as the PCPs roll out, it will be quite a problem, in my view. My hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak has raised one issue of how
that might be a problem; it could be a very real one. I am interested
to hear the Minister’s comments on the points I have
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to put one simple question to the Minister
about the people excluded under paragraph 9. I raised a
similar point on paragraph 4 to schedule 3, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 407<a class="bkMark" name="Column407">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and I am not sure whether his explanation got lost at that time. I am
seriously interested to know the rationale for excluding those
particular people, and why they, and not others, are
excluded.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
occurs to me that a Member of the House of Commons will be excluded,
but not a Member of the House of Lords. As I have mentioned, it would
be perfectly possible for a Deputy in the Channel Islands to be on a
police panel in Exeter, Weymouth or somewhere in that area, as it would
be for a member of another police commissioner’s staff in a
nearby force. That would certainly be the case in Warwickshire and the
west midlands. If we think about what happens in Parliament these days
with relatives or connected persons under the Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority rules, why are people who may have a closely
connected interest not excluded, while the specific people listed in
paragraphs 9(a) to (g)
are?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> First, on the question asked by the hon. Member
for Gedling about paragraph 21, the schedule will allow us to apply
local government legislation to the panels—for instance, on
local authority committees—but it cannot be used to make panel
arrangements. For example, if there were rules about the publication of
documents or on scrutiny, those could be applied to the way panels
operate. That is the purpose of that enabling
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry to intervene again, because this is
becoming technical. The Minister said in his opening remarks that
paragraph 21 did not apply to panel arrangements, which will be a
matter for the individual panel. If that is the case, there is no
leverage to deliver solutions to the issues that were rightly
identified earlier by members of the Committee. He is now saying that
there is leverage in the schedule to deliver solutions. I do not

                        <p class="tabbed">The wider
point that the hon. Gentleman made was about elected mayors. I had
addressed the issue when giving evidence to the Select Committee on
Communities and Local Government a couple of weeks ago, so he will be
able to read the transcript of my oral evidence. My hon. Friend the
Member for Amber Valley was absolutely right: the matter goes to the
clarity of the function. It is absolutely clear that the elected police
and crime commissioner will have the responsibility for holding the
force to account, appointing the chief, and setting the budget and the
plan. It is absolutely clear that those will be the responsibilities of
that elected
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the hon. Gentleman looks at the Localism Bill, which is being debated
in the Committee Room next door, he will see that there is no proposed
power for mayors to cut across that. It is important that there is no
confusion about who has responsibility for such
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, some have suggested that it would be desirable for a directly
elected city mayor to take some responsibility for the governance of
policing in their area—say, Birmingham. The difficulty is that
that would mean twin accountability for part of the force. It could
mean hollowing out the West Midlands force: the commander of the
Birmingham unit within West Midlands police would answer in one
direction, the rest of the force in another. That would be a recipe for
confusion, so it is right to have clarity about the role and say that
the elected police and crime commissioner will have responsibility for
the
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
just as local authorities have a role in community safety, which is why
we have sought to give them a role on the police and crime panel, so
will city mayors. That is why we have said that city mayors should have
a place on the police and crime panel. The electorate will need to be
clear exactly what are the functions of a city mayor when they elect
them. That never stops individuals going more widely than their
specific mandate, and they may give views about things in their areas.
Such people have significant influence, which they will be able to
exercise through the police and crime panel, but the police and crime
commissioner will have the direct mandate given to him by the people
for the
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000123">&#160;</a>

have understood the issue correctly. It is conceivable in a place such

directly elected mayors as part of the seven authorities. Is the

                        <p class="tabbed">Even trying to
pursue the amalgamation of police forces, which the previous Government
did and then abandoned, encountered massive opposition. It was my
judgment that there was no desire to do it, nor was there any desire to
create smaller police forces, which would have been the implication for
the west midlands—the boundaries that the city mayors cover are
much smaller than the area that the force covers. Given that they face
significant challenges in having to reduce spending, and that we are
changing wider governance, I do not think that that would be
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have clarity about the roles. There are, of course, examples of other
countries around the world where there are elected individuals in the
same area who have different mandates, which electorates understand.
New York, for instance, has an elected district attorney, an elected
mayor and an elected state governor, all of whom have differing roles
that the public understand, but they have to work together. Equally,
they are all significant figures who have influence in the many areas
of policy on which they are required to work together. I hope that that
explanation of the Government’s position is
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000128">&#160;</a>

shall try to provide clarity on paragraph 21 for the hon. Member for
Gedling. The provision allows the Secretary of State to apply to the
panel existing rules that apply only to local authority committees. It
cannot be used to make specific provision on panel arrangements, which
is for the panel to do, although the panel could be influenced through
non-statutory guidance that the Secretary of State might offer. Does
that give the hon. Gentleman the clarity that he seeks? If not, I may

                        <p class="tabbed">The
question might seem technical, but the answer could change the meaning
of the Bill substantially. If we look at offences with a maximum term
of two years, so falling within one definition but not the other, they
include assault with intent to resist
arrest—<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“assault
any person with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or
detainer of himself or of any other
person”—<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>which
does not sound like the sort of thing that we ought to be allowing a
police and crime commissioner to do without being suspended—if
he is charged with that
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Equally,
a number of offences, while carrying shorter terms generally, carry a
maximum term of two years when they become racially or religiously
aggravated. Common assault with those aggravations is an offence with a
two-year maximum, as is racially or religiously aggravated
harassment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
top of that, some sexual offences carry a maximum term of imprisonment
of two years, such as exposure or voyeurism. Again, should we leave a
police and crime panel unable to suspend a police and crime
commissioner who has been charged with such offences? A significant

			Column number: 411<a class="bkMark" name="Column411">&#160;</a>
                           </div>number of other such offences, including aggravated vehicle taking,
causing damage to property or causing injury, will not be covered and
so will not trigger the power of the police and crime panel to suspend
the
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Should
the Bill refer to maximum terms of imprisonment of “two years or
more”? If so, that would deal with many of my questions and
would go a long way to addressing my
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
a potential embarrassment would remain if a police and crime
commissioner were charged with offences carrying a maximum term of six
months. I am not entirely sure that we would want a PCC to continue in
post if he had been charged with any of the offences that carry a
maximum term of imprisonment of six months—vehicle taking
without consent; disorderly behaviour with intent to cause harassment,
alarm or distress; threatening behaviour, where there is fear or
provocation of violence, under the Public Order Act 1986;
and, interestingly, assault on a police constable, which carries a
six-month maximum term of imprisonment under section 89 of the Police
Act
1996.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Imagine
a scenario in which the PCC goes to meet the chief constable to discuss
the draft police and crime plan. Things get a bit heated and out of
hand, and the commissioner ends up assaulting the chief constable, and
is charged with such an offence. As the Bill stands, the commissioner
would be looking at a maximum term of imprisonment of six months. It
would fall outwith the powers in the Bill for the police and crime
panel to suspend the commissioner, so he would continue in post until
such time as guilt was proven. Interestingly, once the charge is proven
and sentence is given, the PCP can remove the commissioner under clause
67 if he is sentenced to only three months or more. That seems to point
to the potential for suspension needing to be applied at a much lower
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I leave it to
the Minister to make clear the intent of the Bill; to say what level of
maximum sentence should apply and whether he feels that we need to look
at this issue again. Should we try to catch some of these other
offences? Do we want the embarrassment of police and crime
commissioners, whose main job is to oversee, scrutinise and take
strategic decisions about the fight against criminal behaviour,
remaining in post if it is possible that they have committed such
offences
themselves?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, I am not saying that, which is why the PCC
would be suspended, not sacked. I guess that if someone is sacked on
the basis that they have been charged with an offence, that would be
pre-empting the decision of the court. However, I think that the point
that the hon. Member for Edinburgh West is making is not that someone
should be sacked but that they should be suspended, and not because
they have been arrested for something. Clause 30 says that they should
be suspended when they have been charged. If someone has been charged,
the prosecuting authorities clearly think that there is enough evidence
to take them to court and for the court to determine their
guilt.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Northampton North will know that there are certain standards
that have to be met before those decisions are taken. So, I assume that
the prosecuting authorities would believe that there was a reasonable
prospect of conviction, that it was in the public interest to charge
the individual and therefore that individual should be charged. In
those circumstances, the individual should be suspended, pending the
outcome of the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000174">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The fact is that there are punitive measures, as it
were, attached to the suspension, because clause 30(3) says:<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>One
must bear that in mind, as well as the fact that the police and crime
commissioner is likely to be a high-profile individual who might be
subject to spurious or malicious complaints. The test for charging is
not the same as the test for convicting, and people can be charged with
offences and very often acquitted. In my experience, it can take
anything up to a year for them to be acquitted. So a police and crime
commissioner could be obstructed and the process of scrutiny could be
obstructed by a charge that results in acquittal many months later. I
would be concerned about reducing the period to make it easier to
suspend a commissioner. Does the shadow Minister not feel that it is in
the wider interests of justice that penalties should not be applied
until after conviction?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000176">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If the hon. Gentleman feels that clause 30(3) is
unfair and prejudges the outcome during the period of suspension, he
can table an amendment to say that allowances and pay should continue
to be afforded to the commissioner. Many people suspended from their
posts continue to receive pay and so on, although I am not sure about
allowances. If he feels that that is one aspect of the unfairness, he
can table an amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To return to
the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West, the Bill sets the
threshold at such a level that the charges that trigger suspension are
for what the public see as serious offences. I do not think that the
public would understand if somebody were not suspended after being
charged with—if not arrested for—such an offence. They
would find it bizarre, for example, that a police and crime
commissioner could be charged with assaulting a police constable and
not be suspended from his post. According to my information, that
carries a maximum sentence not exceeding two years. People would find
that difficult to understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000178">&#160;</a>

explanation of why the threshold is appropriate. If it is accepted, but
it is defective and inappropriate, the Minister will have to table a

which is below two years, and saying that they sound serious, but
assaulting a police constable—the maximum penalty for which is
six months—can be as little as a push. It can be as little as
putting a constable in fear of being pushed. That amounts to a
technical common assault. Surely we must create some proper boundaries.

                           </strong> I apologise. Is the hon. Member for Northampton
North saying that a police and crime commissioner charged with pushing
a police officer would have any credibility? Of course someone is
innocent until proven guilty. I accept that, and Parliament has a duty
to uphold that principle, as do the courts. We are talking not about
sacking, but about suspension pending the outcome of the process. The
example cited by the hon. Gentleman was that of pushing a police
officer. I cannot imagine how a police and crime panel could do
anything else but suspend someone charged with that
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000191">&#160;</a>

such matters. People are innocent until proven guilty. The cases going
through my mind are those we read increasingly about in the press of
men accused of rape who then go on to be cleared after more than a
year. Last year, a chef called Peter Bacon was cleared by a jury in
just 45 minutes, despite being accused of rape following a drunk,
one-night stand. He felt that his reputation was so destroyed that he
changed his name and left the country. Had he been a police and crime
commissioner, he would have had to be suspended for a whole year if we
accepted the hon. Gentleman’s suggestion. Who would replace him
in that role for a year? It is
bizarre.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000192">&#160;</a>

think, is an argument for not keeping the threshold as it is but saying
that the amendments that have been tabled are pertinent, and that the
Minister needs to take them away to look at them. If the threshold

                           </strong> First, let us be clear that we are talking about
the power that the police and crime panel will be given under clause 30
to suspend a police and crime commissioner if the commissioner has been
charged with, not convicted of, an offence. That is an important
distinction. There is agreement on both sides of the Committee—I
think—that the threshold should be different, that the threshold
for a conviction should be
lower.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason I question whether there is consensus in the Committee is that
we will come to clause 67 later, which provides for the
disqualification of police and crime commissioners. As hon. Members
will see, the Government will table an amendment to reduce the
threshold so that any imprisonable offence will render the police and
crime commissioner disqualified from office. That threshold is lower
than what any hon. Member has proposed. That is a reflection of the
fact that while we originally set the threshold for disqualification at
three months, which is the same as existing local government
legislation that applies to councillors, we recognised, on the basis of
representations made to us, that because police and crime commissioners
have a responsibility to hold the police force to account, a higher
standard should apply to them. I think it is common ground that we
should apply that higher standard to police and crime commissioners. I
will table the amendment, which I am sure that the Committee will
support. Others argue that we should go further still, and we can come
to that when we discuss the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
this occasion, we are talking about suspension. My hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton North made some good points, saying that we have
to be careful to ensure that there is proportionality, as it would be
possible for a police and crime commissioner to be charged with an
offence and then acquitted. We must be careful to set the threshold of
the offence at a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 416<a class="bkMark" name="Column416">&#160;</a>
                           </div>level that does not mean that a police and crime panel can disqualify
the police and crime commissioner from office, which would be a serious
move, for a relatively minor offence. Again, I suspect that there is
agreement on that, and the question is: at what level should we set the
threshold? Should it be set at the same threshold as the Government
will propose for disqualification—any imprisonable offence? That
is something that we could reflect on, but it would still not include
careless driving and not having insurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
six-month threshold for suspension would include assaulting a police
officer, common assault or battery, threatening, abusive or insulting
behaviour, harassment, taking a vehicle without the owner’s
consent, driving while under the influence of drink and drugs, driving
while disqualified, and failing to stop and report an accident. Those
are all offences, which, up until this moment, the hon. Member for
Gedling did not think were suitably serious to be included in the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000205">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman invited me to reflect, so I too invite him to reflect
whether he was right in seeking to set the threshold rather higher than
six months at 12. I do not think, as my hon. Friend said, that there is
much of a practical difference between the amendment moved by my hon.
Friends, which is for a maximum sentence in excess of six months, and
that proposed in the Opposition’s amendment, which is for a
maximum sentence of 12 months.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000206">&#160;</a>

we should also reflect on the sentencing threshold, as my hon. Friend

to look at some of the offences that are caught in relation to maximum
sentences of six months or less—which, as I said, no member of

included—without

invite the Committee to reflect on the position that Ken Livingstone
found himself in when he was Mayor of London. His case was considered
by the Adjudication Panel for England after he made comments about a
reporter who had accused him of being a Nazi. The Standards Board for
England investigated and found the Mayor guilty of breaching the GLA
code of conduct and he was sentenced to be suspended for four weeks. It
was very controversial at the time and was overruled by the High Court.
I make no comments on the merits of the allegation, but what it reveals
is the extent to which a tool was being used, and there was some debate
at the time We are talking about elected individuals with a
mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000213">&#160;</a>

the Committee whether there is general agreement that the threshold

that it should be lower. I am certainly willing to reflect on the
suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West that it
should be lower than we propose, but I am not sure that it should be
the same threshold that I will propose for disqualification. That is a

                           </strong> That was exactly the point that I was coming to
in my conclusion, and my hon. Friend made it very well. The clause
gives the panel the formal power to require a suspension. If a police
and crime commissioner is charged with an offence that might be much
more minor, he or she might nevertheless choose to stand down until his
or her name is cleared. Equally, the PCC might strongly contest a
charge, but the amendment would enable the police and crime panel,
which may be no friend of the PCC, to require the PCC to stand
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000216">&#160;</a>

the interest of justice, we have to be careful to get the balance
right. I repeat that I have tabled an amendment to clause 67 and that
the Government have indicated that we take such matters seriously. We
will adopt a very strict test for conviction. I am certainly willing to
consider the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
West that the test for disqualification should be lower than in the
Bill as it is currently drafted, but I want to signal that we should
take great

on in my examination of the Bill, on the removal of pay on suspension.
I accept that a balance has to be struck between the level of offence
and the removal of remuneration as a punitive measure. I accept his
view that if punitive measures are to be introduced, a higher level of
sentence would be fairer. It would be even better and fairer to have
the suspension at the right level, but not to introduce the punitive
measures until such time as a person moves from being presumed innocent
to proven guilty. I accept that the amendment is incorrectly drafted,
and should have read “six months or greater” given the
arguments that I made. I should have tabled a subsequent amendment that
removed punitive measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000229">&#160;</a>

so many amendments. I will be brief. This amendment seeks clarification
as to what the procedure would be as a result of the Bill, especially
in terms of the resolution of small complaints. It is clear that if
serious complaints are made, such as the commission of criminal
offences, or other corrupt behaviour, a process is set in train to
investigate those complaints and deal with them effectively. I am less
clear, however, on the section that deals with the resolution of other
complaints. Paragraph 3(2) to the schedule
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000235">&#160;</a>

subject of formal investigation by the police and crime panel, or some
other body, we cannot agree with it. I do not think that that was the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
fundamental aim of any complaints system is that complaints be dealt
with promptly and effectively, commensurate with the seriousness of the
issue. Police and crime commissioners will be in the slightly
unusual—although not entirely unique— position of not
being part of any corporate body that has internal structures for
dealing with staffing or complaints. That does not mean that they
should or will be unaccountable. When a complaint is not so serious as
to warrant a police or IPCC investigation, however, the panels are the
most logical forum within which to seek resolution, given their general
role to scrutinise the actions of the commissioner in the public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At the same
time, it is not appropriate to create an unwieldy or bureaucratic
system. In the vast majority of cases, the most satisfactory,
proportionate and economic solution will be informal resolution of
complaints that do not amount to criminal conduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000241">&#160;</a>

paves the way for regulations to be prepared within the framework that
I have described. The precise content of such regulations will, no
doubt, be the subject of further discussion to ensure that all
necessary aspects are covered. Nothing will prevent the panels
considering a variety of routes, or the involvement of other parties as
necessary, to achieve a satisfactory informal resolution process. I
hope that that has explained the procedure and position to my hon.

                           <strong> </strong>In resisting the amendment, I underline
that the provisions under schedule 7 allow the Secretary of State to
make regulations for handling complaints and conduct matters in
relation to police and crime commissioners. They allow us to establish
proportionate mechanisms for handling problems at the right level; they
are deliberately not about central Government wading in and undermining
local decision making and local accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Naturally,
police and crime commissioners must uphold the highest standards of
office, and where there are complaints and allegations that such
standards are not being met, there must be a clear process for
investigation. The role of the Secretary of State is to set out in
regulations how complaints or other conduct matters will be handled and
investigated, so that the process is clear to those responsible for
investigating and for those wishing to make a
complaint.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill already makes proper provision for investigation and the necessary
decisions that follow to be made by the relevant organisations at the
proportionate level. The most serious, concerning the suspected
criminal or corrupt behaviour of a police and crime commissioner, will
be the responsibility of the IPCC, which has extensive experience of
handling high-profile and sensitive cases. The Bill does not, however,
allow for a police and crime commissioner to be removed from office by
central agency or the
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Decisions
as to whether to bring criminal charges rest with the Crown Prosecution
Service. In recognition of the seriousness of such a situation,
elsewhere in the Bill, as we have just discussed, we have given the
police and crime panels the power to suspend a police and crime
commissioner who has been charged in certain criminal matters. The Bill
is also clear that a suspended police and crime commissioner, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Northampton North noted, will not be paid a
salary, and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schedule
7 also allows the Secretary of State to make regulations that will
specify matters of a less serious nature, how they are handled and how
the police and crime commissioner will engage in the informal
resolution of such complaints. As the provisions currently stand, the
police and crime commissioner may be suspended when charged with some
criminal offences, but cannot be removed from office as a result of a
complaint or a conduct
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000251">&#160;</a>

conviction. Simply, in the absence of evidence of misconduct and no
decision against a police and crime commissioner being taken by those
bodies, the police and crime commissioner will have to face the local
electorate. Issuing regulations are a proportionate step for the
Secretary of State as to how such issues should be handled, but
exercising a power to interrupt the process of local accountability is
not. That is the balance we seek to strike in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000252">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment would effectively re-establish a

                        <p class="tabbed">I
feel that I have been getting under the skin of the Minister at times

London. I feel a bit wounded, because it falls to me to point such
things out, as I have been dealing with the London amendments. I
apologise if I am about to upset him
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of the arrangements in
London and of what has worked. The Minister himself said, in previous
discussions about the structures of accountability for police and crime
commissioners, that what has been going on in London has worked and,
therefore, that that structure is worth mirroring outside. However,
what has worked in London has been a panel, the MPA, made up of a
majority of assembly members—12 elected members—who then 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 423<a class="bkMark" name="Column423">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have the authority to appoint 11 extra members from among the community
in London. The strength of that arrangement is demonstrated by the
current MPA, as of September 2010, being made up of nearly 10% ethnic
minority members and 30%
women.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
capacity within that arrangement is to ensure diversity of
representation on the body and, as has been said before, a broad
spectrum of experience that can be brought to bear on the scrutiny of
the Mayor’s office. It is important that we continue with that
arrangement because it is strong and it is recognised that it
works—the Government have indicated that the arrangements in
London have worked. That scrutiny role has fallen to the Metropolitan
Police Authority, and it would clearly be a backward step to move away
from that arrangement to having a single person dealing with the
scrutiny role over the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who is then
scrutinised by the
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a series of amendments to strengthen the scrutiny role of the panel,
but amendment 206 deals with the size and scope of the panel. Scrutiny
is important, so it is important that the people who exercise that
function have a broad spectrum of experience and that the majority of
members are democratically elected. Until 2008, it was up to the
members of the Metropolitan Police Authority to appoint the chair. The
Mayor appointed members from the assembly, who then set up the
Metropolitan Police Authority by co-opting people, who then elected
their chair. Since 2008, that responsibility has rested with the Mayor,
but none the less, the person who chairs that body has to come from the
membership of the Metropolitan Police Authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
proposes that the assembly set up a sub-committee. If I have read the
Bill correctly—the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong—can set up an assembly sub-committee to perform the
function of the police and crime panel in London, without necessarily
having an elected assembly member on that committee. Clearly, when
someone is elected to the assembly, they should accept that holding the
Metropolitan Police Service to account is an important part of their
function, not something that they can just delegate to a body whose
majority is not made up of elected members. I would appreciate some
clarification of those
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason, as the Minister has indicated in discussions of arrangements
outside London, is that the London assembly, as a democratically
elected body, is accountable for its decisions. It therefore falls to
that body to decide whether it wants to have all democratically elected
members, none, or a mixture of elected and unelected members on any
sub-committee that it sets up to serve as the police and crime panel in
London. That will water down the arrangements in London, and it is a
backward step. If the current arrangements are working, and have served
Londoners well, we should exercise a great deal of caution before we
toss them
aside.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister say whether it is the Government’s intention that
the assembly should be free to have the power to set up the
sub-committee as it wishes, even if it has a majority of unelected
members? Is there a requirement in the Bill—I cannot find any
such requirement—for a majority of elected members? How can we
guarantee through the Bill that a representative body will carry out
the function of the police and crime panel in London in a way that is
similar to the current structure? Will people be co-opted and elected
members appointed 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 424<a class="bkMark" name="Column424">&#160;</a>
                           </div>so that there is a broad spectrum of representation on that important
body, rather than leaving it to a majority on the assembly from the
coalition? At a future election, people might not want to perform a
rigorous scrutiny role of the Mayor’s Office. Great discussion
went into the setting up of the Metropolitan Police Authority. It has
worked, and the Minister should set out on the record the reasons for
dispensing with the current arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000267">&#160;</a>

up a debate with all of the points that he made before about why he
wishes to retain the Metropolitan Police Authority. I shall not
rehearse the arguments about why it is right for the authority to go
nor about the fact that that proposal to have a police and crime panel
drawn from the London assembly is widely supported. It is a sensible
approach that will reduce bureaucracy by removing an unnecessary tier
of governance, and it will give greater clarity to the
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are much more prescriptive about how the panel should be
drawn up by the assembly. I could go into detail about why some of the
hon. Gentleman’s amendments are technically defective, but I
shall deal with the bigger point. It is right that the panel should be
appointed by the assembly, that the assembly should decide the
composition of the panel and how members should be co-opted. As for the
hon. Gentleman’s theoretical suggestion that the London assembly
could set up a police and crime panel to scrutinise the Mayor, with no
members of the assembly, is that really a serious suggestion? Why on
earth should the assembly seek to abdicate responsibility for that
crucial function? It is not possible to conceive that it would ever
wish to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
police and crime panel would be subject to the assembly’s
standing orders. As a committee, it would be bound by the Local
Government and Housing Act 1989, which means that the
Widdicombe principles will apply, including the prohibition of
single-party control. It is true that membership of the London assembly
comprises 14 white males, but it also includes eight females, one of
whom is black, two Asian males and one mixed-race male. There is some
diversity on the assembly now, but it is open to the assembly, should
it wish to do so, to make appointments that may change that balance on
the panel that it sets
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
say in conclusion to the hon. Member for Eltham that no one is in any
doubt about the significance of such issues in London, when it comes to
ensuring that the Metropolitan police have the confidence of black and
minority ethnic communities. The leadership of the Metropolitan police
is in no doubt about that, and I am sure that the Mayor is in no doubt
about it, given the relatively recent history of the Met. Retaining the
confidence of BME communities is important. Ensuring that the Mayor can
have access to advice from representative groups is important. It is
open to the Mayor to appoint such advisers as he or she sees fit. In
making sure that it is scrutinising such issues properly, it is open to
the assembly to make appointments to the police and crime panel as it
sees fit. Given the population profile of Greater London as a whole, I
am in no doubt that such issues will be properly addressed in the
governance arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000271">&#160;</a>

rehashing our arguments about the panel. I accept that perhaps I
am—many parts of the Bill relate to one another and
overlap—but the Government cannot have it both ways. Either they
place a great deal of importance on democratic accountability or they
do not. Currently, we have a body set up from the assembly with a
majority of elected members, who then appoint people to create a much
broader and more diverse representation of London’s community.
It works, and it is strong. It may be criticised, but even the
Government have recognised that what London has is strong, and they
have suggested that they want to repeat it elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000273">&#160;</a>

possible, and I think that that is a retrograde step. Either the
Government place a great deal of importance on democratic

                           </strong> The Government are seeking to amend the
arrangements in London by removing the MPA. The hon. Gentleman keeps
trying to suggest that we support the MPA’s continuing role,
when we do not. Does he accept that there is a difference between
saying that it might be legally possible for the committee to be set up
with no representatives at all and saying that that will happen? Does

that the Bill steps back from the extent of democratic accountability
that we have stipulated in London. The amendment is part of a set

                           </strong> These amendments attempt to strengthen the role of
the panel in holding the Met Commissioner and his staff to account for
misconduct, and they require the panel to consult other relevant
bodies. Amendments 210 to 215 similarly refer to holding to account the
Mayor’s office for policing and crime and the Mayor’s
staff. They also refer to carrying out reviews, investigating and
having oversight of any misconduct in functions of the Mayor’s
office. They increase the scrutiny role and the scope of the panel to
hold the Mayor’s office and the commissioner and his staff to
account. As we have discussed in earlier exchanges, we feel it is
important that the police and crime panel in London has a stronger
scrutiny role in holding the Mayor’s office to account and in
being able to hold the police to account. In order to discharge that,
they have to be able to carry out various functions in reviewing,
investigating and having oversight of those
offices.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000303">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Mayor’s office is extremely powerful, so there is a need for
checks and balances to be put in place so that the Mayor can be
investigated, should the panel deem it necessary. We have had examples
in the past of the Mayor being criticised—not in connection with
a policing matter—and the Minister mentioned the case of Ken
Livingstone. Boris Johnson was investigated when it was suggested that
he had interfered in the operational decisions of the police. Clearly,
there is a need for strong scrutiny of the powers of the Mayor and the
Metropolitan police. That scrutiny role should be independent with a
broad base of democratic accountability. I am sure the

                           </div>Minister will accept that a relationship between individuals can become
too cosy, too self-congratulatory and, at times, perhaps not as sharp
as it should be in holding EACH other to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are important, because they would give the police and crime
panel in London powers to obtain information and to require documents
to be given to it to carry out investigations. It would be able to ask
for information that would give it greater understanding of the
functions of the office of the Mayor and of the commissioner in order
to carry out the scrutiny role. The amendments beef up the role of the
panel, give it a greater scrutiny role, and sharper teeth in holding
the Mayor’s office to account. They enable greater scrutiny of
the Metropolitan police and how they go about local policing in
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000305">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister indicated the other day that it would be inevitable that
police officers would attend the meetings of the panels if requested.
We will come to the power to require that later. If the sessions are to
be of any value, surely it follows that the panel in London should have
the documents that enable it to make those sessions useful. Having the
information before it is necessary if it is to carry out a scrutiny
role. I should be grateful to hear the Minister’s response to
those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000306">&#160;</a>

general duty to keep under review the Mayor’s exercise of his

that purpose, it will have the power to scrutinise and make reports for
any actions and decisions of the Mayor, the deputy Mayor for policing
and crime and any member of staff of the Mayor’s Office for
Policing and Crime. That wording reflects what is used in the Greater

scrutiny functions in relation to the appointment of the deputy Mayor

drafted so that the London police and crime panel will have the same
powers of delegation in this regard as other committees of the London
assembly, as set out in the Greater London Authority Act

do not want to go over the same arguments again and risk another rebuke
from the Minister, but the strength of the amendment is that a broad
range of people—including from those who are democratically
elected to be on a PCP in London—would bring their skills,
knowledge and experience to that role. They surely have an important
role to play in drawing up a police and crime plan for

an extremely valuable part of the scrutiny process if they exercised a

knowledge of their local areas to the process, which perhaps even the
Mayor does not have. As an MP, I can give examples of the issues in my
area, from talking to my local community. The Mayor’s office
would not be aware of those, unless I had the opportunity to tell it
about them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000327">&#160;</a>

representative in my area, Len Duvall, would be able to bring his
experiences of the local community to bear, as well as use his scrutiny
role to influence the police and crime plan. These amendments are
trying to strengthen the scrutiny role and the wider democratic mandate
for elected members in London, because their experience and that degree
of democratic accountability will make the democratic process of
drawing up a police and crime plan for the capital city much more
robust. I will again attract the wrath of the Minister, but that is
what happens currently with the scrutiny role. It works extremely well,
so why would we not want it in the Bill? I welcome the
Minister’s

should play an important role in contributing to the police and crime
plan in London. In saying that the panel would have to approve the
plan, his amendments go too far, because that would cut across the
mandate of the Mayor to set the plan. That would be wrong, because it
is the Mayor who has been democratically elected. The panel will play
an important scrutiny role, and we want it to do so. It will provide
that support and constructive challenge, but it is not responsible for
setting the police and crime objectives. That is the remit of the

must have regard to. That will mean that the panel can flag any
concerns that it may have. By allowing the panel to set the police and
crime objectives, the hon. Member for Eltham would move the Bill away
from its most important principle—that there is a single
individual who is accountable to the public for their policing. The
hon. Gentleman goes too far, but I agree with him on the important

amendment touches on something we mentioned when dealing with
amendments 204 and 205. It is about strengthening the role of the panel
in London, to carry out investigations into allegations of misconduct
by the Mayor’s office. Unless I am mistaken—if I am, the
Minister will correct me—the Bill seems to contain no provision
allowing the panel to carry out such a function. Where are the checks
and balances on the Mayor’s office, in terms of scrutiny of
misconduct, the carrying out of proper investigation, the making of a
report if necessary and the sending of that to the Secretary of State?
There must be some form of democratic mechanism for holding the Mayor
to account, in between elections, over any allegations of
misconduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000335">&#160;</a>

mentioned earlier the investigation into the current Mayor for
interfering in an operational matter, for commenting on that in the
press and for commenting on private conversations about the operation
with police officers. Clearly, at times the Mayor’s office will
need to be held to account by the democratically elected body for
London. Also, the arrangement as set out in our amendment would give
the Metropolitan Police Commissioner the opportunity to give his or her
side of the story to the
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000336">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
would be an important part of the scrutiny role, because the Mayor is
an extremely powerful individual. Some bring a powerful personality to
the role—we have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 431<a class="bkMark" name="Column431">&#160;</a>
                           </div>had two Mayors of London who have been extraordinarily high-profile
individuals with an enormous amount of personal clout. At times, their
hubris has got the better of them. I suggest that both of them in that
role have at times transgressed, with the power they wield leading them
into
trouble.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
democratic body ought to be charged with the scrutiny role. The Bill is
changing the arrangements—that is the intent of the
Government—so that it will be the Mayor’s office that
carries out the function of scrutiny and oversight of the Metropolitan
Police Service. The Mayor will be accountable for that to the panel in
London. Therefore, when such situations arise under the new
arrangement, it must follow that the panel is entitled to investigate
and, where necessary, to write a report, to invite comment on it and to
send recommendations to the Secretary of State, if it feels strongly
enough about the situation. Not to have such provision is to weaken the
role and function of the
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000338">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we consider the role of the Mayor, in the Bill he or she has the power
to dismiss the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. That power similarly
needs to be subjected to checks and balances by the scrutiny body that
oversees the activities of the Mayor’s office. I strongly urge
the Government to consider the amendment because it deals with a
serious weakness in the proposals for the panel in London. It is an
important area of scrutiny, and the Government are not dealing with it
under the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000339">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. I
recognise his intention to ensure a robust mechanism for responding to
issues of misconduct or complaints in relation to the Mayor’s
Office for Policing and Crime, but I believe that such a mechanism will
be in place. That will not be the role of the police and crime panel in
London, which will be to provide the support and challenge to the
Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime. It will not be its role
to investigate complaints or misconduct, or any form of complaint. That
will be different from the position outside London because the Mayor of
London is already subject to disqualification arrangements created by
the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the standards regime that
applies to all local government under the Local Government
Act 2000. The Localism Bill will simplify the standards
regime that applies to local government. Police and crime commissioners
outside London will have a much more restricted role than the Mayor of
London, which is why they will not be subjected to the same regime and
why we have given the panels the role of investigating minor
complaints.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000340">&#160;</a>

police and crime panel has a role in consulting individuals, including
the public in the exercise of its functions. That is already set out
under legislation that applies to the London assembly of which the
panel is a sub-committee. Therefore, the amendment is considered to be
a reiteration of current legislation. The hon. Gentleman’s
worries are not borne out by the reality of how such issues will be
dealt with in London where there will be a robust regime, and I
therefore ask him to withdraw the

                           </strong> Again, this is an extremely important function of
the panel. Clearly, there is a difference of opinion between the
Minister and me. We believe that the function of the panel, as the main
scrutiny body of both the Mayor’s office and the Metropolitan
Police Service, is vital. It is a much stronger and more robust system,
as has been proved by the function of the MPA in London. The amendments
would enable the panel in London to require the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner to attend meetings. The Minister will say that it is
unlikely that the commissioner would not attend the meetings, if
invited, but let us suppose that the MPC were required to attend
meetings about the recent kettling arrangements for London at which
members of the panel wanted to question the commissioner about the use
of kettling when dealing with protesters. That is a controversial
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Can
the Minister envisage a stand-off between the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner and his office? The commissioner might say, “It is
not our function to attend your meetings and answer for operational
matters; we answer to the Mayor, so speak to him. We will not come down
to a media circus and answer the questions of the assembly.”
Such a situation would not be acceptable. As the Bill is drafted,
however, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner would be well within his
rights to respond like that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I know that
London assembly members do not feel that such a situation would be
satisfactory. If there is to be a proper scrutiny role for them, it is
essential that they have power. I suspect that such power would seldom
be needed, but either we believe in strengthening democratic
accountability or we do not. The Minister will say, “Yes, but we
have put that power in the directly elected Mayor—or whoever he
appoints as his deputy—who carries the democratic
mandate.” In a place the size of London, however, that is not
good enough. The assembly must have more clout and more say through its
sub-committee, the policing panel, so that it can question the
Metropolitan police.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000348">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The assembly
is able to drill down on questions about policing at local levels, from
experience from respective communities. If it wants the Metropolitan
police to attend meetings, it should be able to require them to
do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000349">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I know that
the Minister will say, “Why wouldn’t officers
attend?” Under the current Metropolitan police arrangements,
however, there is no requirement for them to do so, but that is the
scrutiny body. I can find nothing that states that Metropolitan police
officers must attend Metropolitan Police Authority meetings—and
I have asked the Library and members of the MPA to look into that.
Under current scrutiny arrangements, it is inconceivable that they
would not go along to such meetings, but the MPA will no longer be our
scrutiny body. The body will be an assembly sub-committee that is set
up to scrutinise the function of the Mayor. Therefore, if such a panel
is to have any real impact on policing in London, it must have power to
be able to require Metropolitan police officers to attend alongside the
Mayor’s office, which the amendments propose. I would welcome
the Minister’s comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000350">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> For the benefit of my hon. Friends, who are
probably in a soporific state, the hon. Gentleman has shot himself in
the foot with his closing remarks. He has said that it was
inconceivable that the commissioner would not appear before the MPA,
even though the MPA does not have a power to summon him. I could not
have put it better myself.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall
respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman, who has made the same points
before. He seeks to interfere with what we regard as the essential
architecture of the Bill. It is for the Mayor and—if
nominated—the deputy Mayor for policing and crime to hold the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner to account. That is not the function
of the Greater London authority, or the committee of the GLA that will
be set up as the police and crime panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
panel’s function is to scrutinise the Mayor or the deputy Mayor
for policing and crime. The hon. Gentleman either does not understand
or does not accept that, but it is our strong view. Such as system will
ensure clear accountability and ensure that there is no confusion about
whether the Commissioner of the Met answers to the Mayor or to the
assembly. That means that everybody is clear what their scrutiny job
is. The amendments would cut across that. Requiring the commissioner of
the Met to appear before the panel, and everything else that the hon.
Gentleman said, would suggest that it is the panel’s job to
scrutinise the Met. It is not. The panel’s job is to scrutinise
the performance of the Mayor, just as it is the Greater London
authority’s job. We must not confuse those two positions. The
amendment does, which is why we should resist
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000353">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a fundamental difference between us.
Either the Government respect assembly members’ role in
scrutinising the Metropolitan Police Service or they do not. The
amendment would give assembly members a mandate to hold the
Metropolitan Police Service to account on behalf of the people of
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
that I pointed out that the current arrangements do not require the
Metropolitan police to attend the MPA is that the MPA is the scrutiny
body and it is therefore inconceivable that the police would not
attend. However, in some circumstances, assembly members will have
legitimate concerns affecting people across London, such as kettling,
the retention of safer

possible closure of the training centre at Hendon. Those are legitimate
issues of concern to democratically elected assembly members, and they
should have the power to require the Metropolitan police to attend in
order to answer for them. I intend to press the amendment to a vote, as
it is a fundamental difference between us that I want to

                           </strong> These are probing amendments. The clause refers to
the Secretary of State’s ability to prescribe what information
cannot go before the panel. I understand that the Metropolitan police
deal with national policing issues for which such measures might be
necessary, but I seek clarification that the power cannot be abused.
I know that I will incur the Minister’s wrath again,
and I am sorry to keep doing so, but we currently have a Conservative
Mayor and a Conservative Home Secretary. Is it possible that they could
phone one another and say, “We’d rather this information
didn’t go before the scrutiny panel”? I seek reassurance
on that issue. Will the Minister put it on the record that hell would
freeze over before politicians came to such a cosy

first issue raised by the amendments is on the disclosure to the London
assembly of advice and documentation given to the Mayor’s Office
for Policing and Crime by its staff. The London police and crime 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 435<a class="bkMark" name="Column435">&#160;</a>
                           </div>panel has powers to call before it to give evidence the Mayor, the
deputy Mayor for police and crime, anyone who has held those offices in
the previous eight years, and any member of staff of the Mayor’s
Office for Policing and Crime. Those individuals may also be required
by the panel to submit any relevant documents relating to their duties.
The provision excludes any evidence or documentation that relates
specifically to advice that such staff members have provided for the
Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime. It is important that
professionals in the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime are
able to give advice to the Mayor in the same way that officials give
advice to Ministers, and for reasons that we all
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
London assembly police and crime panel will be able to scrutinise the
actions and decisions of the deputy Mayor for policing and crime,
including by calling for evidence from his staff. Proper regard and
challenge will therefore be given, where necessary. The professional
relationship and exchanges between the deputy Mayor and his staff are
outside the remit of that panel. We have opted to ensure that the
provisions for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime and the
Greater London Authority are consistent. To that end, a refusal to
answer questions or to disclose documents to the London assembly police
and crime panel will be a criminal offence, which makes it important to
apply exceptions
sensibly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000380">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second issue is about the power of the Secretary of State to prescribe
categories of information that an individual can withhold. I am
committed to the principles of openness and transparency, but there
might be information that should be withheld when that is in the public
interest, for example over protected information related to national
security, which might be particularly relevant in the case of the
Metropolitan police. I am sure that the Opposition accept that, and it
is important to continue to have that
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000381">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
agree that the safety and security of the public should be of paramount
importance in considering the functions of the clause. In a similar
vein, we will also include provision for the chief officer of police to
be able to prevent the disclosure of information, where it might be
used against national security, jeopardise the safety of any person or
have a detrimental effect on policing operations, or where that
disclosure is prohibited by legislation. I hope that we have the right
balance between ensuring transparency wherever we can and preserving
security where
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000382">&#160;</a>

34, on “Engagement with local people,” deals with
obtaining views in local neighbourhoods across the many local authority
areas, and with providing information to those neighbourhoods about how
those local areas are policed. It also deals with arrangements for
setting up meetings in local neighbourhoods, and it determines what
constitutes a local neighbourhood. Given the number of times that the
words “local” and “neighbourhood” are
mentioned in the clause, it seems strange that no role for the police
and crime panel is identified. We have already discussed how much
experience and local knowledge will reside in the police and crime
panels, and how they could be an invaluable resource to police and
crime commissioners, giving them advice and a local link across areas
that are, in some cases, very large.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000390">&#160;</a>

worthwhile exploring the reasons why the police and crime
panel’s role should not be hard-wired into the Bill, and I would
welcome the Minister’s view on the

break a few minutes ago, and when I came back I went into the wrong

serious point, which in some ways is also quite amusing, in every

am going to count them, or get someone to—about which he says
that he has tabled a probing amendment because he is worried about the
relationship between the police and crime commissioner and the police

constable and the police and crime

                           </strong> I sympathise with the hon. Member for Gedling.
There have been occasions during consideration of the Bill when I would
have liked to have found a darkened room. In fact, if he would tell me
which one it was, I would be grateful—usually when the hon.
Member for Eltham is moving his amendments, I have to say. That was
said with
affection.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000401">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am inclined to agree with some, though not all, of what the hon. Member
for Birmingham, Selly Oak said. The matter goes to the reply that I
gave regarding the previous group of amendments. I simply want to be
clear that we draw the distinction between the roles of the panel, the
police and crime commissioner and chief constable. If we start creating
direct lines of responsibility between the chief constable and the
panel, we are blurring the line of accountability and potentially
creating confusion or a bureaucratic requirement, even if the intention
is absolutely benign.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000402">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The force of
clause 34 is to require the chief constable to make arrangements for
finding out what is going on in the neighbourhood. As the hon. Member
for Edinburgh West said, the police and crime panel’s job is to
scrutinise the police and crime commissioner. It is therefore able to
ask about all the arrangements. Placing a requirement on the chief
constable to consult the police and crime panel in every case leaves
out the question of the role of the police and crime commissioner. It
is simply an unnecessarily bureaucratic burden. I entirely understand
the force of what my hon. Friend said in relation to the constructive
role that the police and crime panel can play, but I want it to be a
focused role. I repeat that we need to take care and ensure that the
police and crime panel is not seen as a replacement for the police
authority. It is not. I am saying that as much to the hon. Member for
Gedling, who has sprung to life after his period in a darkened room, as
I am to my hon. Friend. I hope that on that basis he will feel able to
withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000403">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his response. I say to
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak that I understand perfectly
what the Minister is trying to do. The provision deals with the
requirements placed on chief constables. I am clear that I am not
trying to introduce any type of bureaucratic responsibility. That is
why we used the word “consult”. It is not my intention to
introduce a huge responsibility for chief constables to constantly go
to the police and crime panel and say, “I need to now speak to
this
area”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000404">&#160;</a>

extend the remit of police and crime panels beyond that which the

consulting
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000405">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I made it quite clear that the purpose of
consulting them was to use relevant experience and knowledge. I equally
made it clear in what I said at the beginning. In reality, I think that
it is very likely that a chief constable would do exactly that, so this
was, as I said at the start, a probing amendment to see how that
relationship should work and whether there was a need to strengthen
that role in the Bill. I accept what the Minister has said. I still
think that that relationship will develop, but I accept that it might
produce an unnecessary burden by putting it in the provision, which
deals exclusively with the role of the chief constable and the
requirements of the chief constable in his or her engagement with local
people. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020333000406">&#160;</a>
