<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): This clause is an important part of the Bill because it contains the offences which are to be made racially aggravated under the new system. The Committee should be aware that the Government are doing this for less serious offences but not for the more serious offences. That is puzzling. The new system, whereby juries will return verdicts rather than the matter being in the hands of the judge, will apply to offences under section 20 and 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and to common assault. The Committee needs to be aware that these and certain public order offences are to be covered by the new system. If the Government are introducing the new system why are they doing so just for these offences and not for more serious offences of the same type? They say that they want to send a clear signal about racial attacks but the signal they are sending so far is a mixed one. We are changing to the new system but only for less serious offences.
<P>
Although serious in itself, the offence of wounding or causing serious bodily harm under section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act is less serious than offences under section 18 of the same Act. Offences under section 20 carry a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment, whereas offences under section 18 carry a discretionary life sentence. That is because the offences under the more serious section involve intent to cause the wound or grievous bodily harm.
<P>
The Committee has heard something about intent from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), and I do not wish to go into that in detail.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister may say that but we simply want to know why wounding with intent or causing grievous bodily harm with intent is not included in these offences. The Minister looks puzzled but I think what I am saying is right. He will see possibly in a moment that the new system will cover only those less serious offences. The more serious offences will be covered under what is in effect the old system under clause 77 of the Bill which, broadly speaking, re-enacts the present position with regard to such offences.
<P>
We are worried that this is an incomplete and flawed system which will be difficult to administer in practice. Judges, juries and magistrates will face these problems and we are afraid that it may result in confusion or even injustice. Ministers may know and may get confirmation from other places that it is common in the courts for wounding with intent and wounding to be alternative verdicts which juries are asked to consider. Often defendants are charged with wounding with intent and juries are told that if they are not satisfied of the intent they can return a verdict of wounding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Frequently in the Crown Court there are two counts on the same indictment, the first alleging malicious wounding with intent under section 18, which is the more serious offence, and the second alleging a section 20 offence. The jury is asked first to consider count one on the indictment, which is the more serious offence. If it finds guilty, that is the end of the matter. If not, it moves on to consider count two. The two counts are very much alternatives. My hon. Friend makes a strong point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his assistance. The Committee has just received a good direction, on which I shall not seek to improve. My hon. Friend accurately outlined the position.
<P>
It would be reasonable to consider whether racial aggravation is a factor in both offences. Considering it for one offence, but not the other runs the risk of confusing those who administer justice, making life difficult for judges and leaving juries with an unenviable task. The Government's approach is a recipe for confusion.
<P>
To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), how do the Government think that judges will direct juries when wounding with intent is the first count on the indictment and wounding, which is the less serious offence, is the second count? How will the judge do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. If the Government do not accept his point, will not the courts face enormous difficulties? I hope that the Minister's officials will advise him to reconsider the matter and return to it on Report. Unless the problem is dealt with in the Bill, huge confusion will ensue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The Opposition must not wind themselves up into a state of unjustified indignation.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran (Beverley and Holderness):</B> We have no trouble winding the Minister up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I assure the Opposition that they will not succeed in winding me up. They should make their points in a reasoned and cool way, and I look forward to responding to the serious point that was originally made.
<P>
<B>Mr Clappison:</B> I have been accused of making boring technical speeches, but I am glad that the Minister did not say that this was one of them.
<P>
I was discussing the serious point of how judges will set about the task of directing juries. A judge would first have to direct the jury on the offence of wounding with intent, which is count one on the indictment. He would have to tell the jury that it would have to decide whether the legal requirements of the offence had been made out and whether there had been a wounding. If so, the jury would have to decide whether the defendant caused the wound with intent to cause serious harm. Intent is the important difference between the two offences. It makes one more serious than the other.
<P>
As the judge directs the jury on the first count of wounding with intent, he will make no mention of racial aggravation because it will not be a racailly aggravated offence under the Government's proposals. However, if the judge is properly directing the jury and it is not satisfied on the first count, he will have to tell it to consider whether there has been an offence of wounding under section 20. That is a less serious offence and does not involve intent. However, the judge will have to tell the jury to consider whether the wounding was racially aggravated, according to the meaning of racial aggravation in clause 25.
<P>
It is difficult to put ourselves in the place of the men and women who make up a jury and to speculate on what they might be thinking. If a jury is directed about wounding with intend and then wounding with aggravation, might it not ask itself, ``Where has the concept of racial aggravation suddenly come from? Why has it come into the picture? Why do we have to consider racial aggravation on the less serious offence, but not on the more serious one?'' Faced with those questions in the seclusion of the jury room, it is likely that most members of the jury will have some difficulty with them. Unlike ourselves, they will not benefit from an illuminating reply from the Minister. We hope that his reply will be illuminating and that he will tell us exactly how he expects judges to face up to the difficult task of directing juries on wounding, wounding with intent and racial aggravation.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will spell it all out to us. It is no use him saying that judges are all clever chaps who will find a way of achieving it. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking and others have spoken to judges and practitioners and found that they had the same reaction as he did. I said that the Government might tell them that it is rather like an elephant on the doorstep--``You will know it when you see it''.--I had better not tell the Minister what they said I could do with the elephant on the doorstep, but let us hope that we do not receive such a reply from the Minister this afternoon. He must spell out for us what form he believes that any direction should take.
<P>
We want the Minister to think seriously about the problem. Is there no risk of confusion in the jury's mind, which might lead to the injustice of defendants facing racially aggravated charges getting away with their crimes? My hon. Friends and I believe that the simpler things are for juries, the better and the more confusion, the greater the possibility of injustice. We do not want defendants walking away unpunished by the courts for racially aggravated offences.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that, if a jury acquits a defendant of a racially aggravated offence but convicts him of a simple offence, the judge will be bound to pass sentence on the basis that the offence was not racially aggravated. I think that the Minister is nodding to confirm that, but we must have that question answered. We fear that some defendants will escape justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister wants to confirm that now, I shall give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> If the hon. Gentleman insists on commenting on every expression of approval, puzzlement or interest I make to what he says, he must expect interventions and, I warn him, retaliation.
<P>
If the decision does not include a racial element, it clearly cannot be taken into account in the punishment. The judge would be restricted as the hon. Gentleman suggests. The defendant would receive a penalty for the offence of which he has been convicted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That confirms our belief and provides all the more reason for matters to be kept as simple as possible for juries, to allow them to do their job properly and avoid injustices arising as a result of confusion. That is a serious matter. Practitioners are waiting for the Minister to spell out his answer. The Bill is defective in failing to include the more serious offences as well as the less serious ones and that defect needs putting right. We look to the Minister to do that now. Otherwise, there is a serious risk of the Bill causing trouble, confusion and injustice in courts throughout the country.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The offence of wounding with intent was the subject of amendment No. 132, which was not selected. I hope that members of the Committee will restrict themselves to matters pertaining to clause 26 stand part, as I am satisfied that the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall attempt to keep as close to that injunction as possible in replying to the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
A mixed message will be sent from this Committee only if the hon. Gentleman succeeds in creating an element of confusion in a clear matter. I hope that I can satisfy him on that point. It is not our wish for any confusion to arise in the courts as a result of the clause. He would be wise to ask himself why amendment No. 132 was not selected before getting too exercised about the points he has raised.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it is for the prosecution to use its discretion in deciding what goes into the indictment. If the jury acquits the defendant of racial aggravation, the judge can hardly proceed to sentence him in a way that is incompatible with that decision. That is perfectly clear and should answer the hon. Gentleman satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It would be helpful if I tried to respond to the key points in the hon. Gentleman's speech. Then I shall happily give way if hon. Members are not satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On that one point--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> As I say, I think it would be helpful if I just ran through the argument and then I will happily give way.
<P>
We have given careful consideration to the offences included in this part of the Bill. Where the basic offence already carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as under section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, the racially aggravated offence is not in practical terms required as the sentence cannot be increased. In other words, there is nothing to be gained, if there is no increased sentence, in placing the additional burden on the Crown Prosecution Service to meet the racially aggravated test. For that reason, we have not included murder and manslaughter in the list of offences.
<P>
Clause 77 applies where a court is considering the seriousness of offences other than those under clauses 26 to 29. It will require the court dealing with the offences not listed in the Bill to consider as an aggravating factor evidence of racial motivation or hostility. The existence of an aggravating factor will merit an increased sentence within the sentencing scale. That means that some offences are dealt with specifically in this part of the Bill. If they are not dealt with here, they are dealt with in the provisions in clause 77. There is not an omission as the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested. I hope that that will satisfy him that the situation is simple and clear and that he will support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What the Minister says is all very well. He says that there is nothing to be gained because it is a discretionary life sentence, but there is nothing to be lost either. The important point is that it is the jury's verdict that determines whether there is racial aggravation. He is erecting a mixed system where, on the one hand it might be the verdict of the jury and, on the other, it might be the decision of the judge. How does he think judges should direct juries on charges of wounding with intent in the circumstances I outlined? How will they direct them on racial aggravation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I would rather keep it simple, especially as that is what the hon. Gentleman asked me to do. For those sentences where the impact of the legislation is to increase the maximum penalty that is available, the jury should have that consideration in taking their decision. The judges then acts in accordance with the decision of the jury. Where a life sentence is available, there is often guidance on the type of sentence to be imposed. The racial element is taken into account as outlined in clause 77. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. It is not complicated. I think it is simple and straightforward and I invite him to consider further what he has said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I appreciate that the Minister sees this as a straightforward matter. Will he reflect between now and Report with his officials on whether there is not something to be gained, to use his phrase, in avoiding confusion for judges and juries--the point that my Hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has rightly made? We have both pointed out that on a charge on indictment under section 18 juries are often told by judges that if they do not feel that they can find intent, they should convict only of a section 20 offence. If there is only one of those offences to which this new element can be added, it makes the picture more complex. The Minister claims that he wants to keep it simple--a valid aim--but he actually erects a new complication by allowing the new element to be added to only one offence. I hope that the Minster will reflect further on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am happy to reflect on the matter, especially when the hon. Gentleman asks me with such courtesy, but the complication or confusion does not exist. The judge must decide how to direct the jury. If the defendant is charged under section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, the judge will explain that the jury must be satisfied that the offence was committed with the requisite intent. If the defendant is charged under section 20 of that Act, clauses 25 and 26 make clear the racial elements of that offence. There are complications in the interpretation of offences against the person. Therefore, we recently published a consultation paper on the way in which the law might be brought up to date. The comments of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath are relevant to that discussion and we will consider them in that context, but there is no confusion about the Bill.
<P>
I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman's comments, and if he wishes to expand on them in writing, I shall consider them. However, I am convinced that we have got the provisions right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The clause states that a person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (1)(a) or (b) will be liable, on summary conviction, to six months' imprisonment. Subsection (1)(a) deals with a person who commits
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an offence under section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure whether it is possible to try an offence under section 20 in the magistrates court. I shall let the Minister tell me that I am wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I believe that the hon. Gentleman is wrong. However, I shall check that. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue a hypothetical point anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> That was a minor point. I shall make my main point, which has not yet been clarified.
<P>
A court can refer to clause 77 when it considers the seriousness of a racially aggravated offence. However, that applies only on conviction and on sentencing, when, after the jury has discharged its duty, the court--a magistrates court or the judge who sentences--forms a view. Therefore, that consideration is nothing to do with the jury, which is never given any direction on that point, and simply deals with the offence. However, under clause 26, the jury is left to determine the issue.
<P>
It is strange that, for some offences, the court determines the issue of racial aggravation as a sentencing point, whereas clause 26 requires the involvement of the jury in a specific direction. Racial aggravation under section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 is purely a matter for the court that sentences, but, under section 20, the matter has to be set out fully before the jury. Where is the logic in that? Why is there a difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The logic is fairly clear. The jury decides, in any circumstances, whether an offence has been committed. Some offences already carry a life sentence, so the category of offence and its maximum penalty would not change because of a racial element. The jury would have to make a decision about offences under the clause because if the offence had a racial element that might move it into a different penalty category.
<P>
In the case of an offence for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, the judge would decide on sentencing matters, including establishing the tarriff, and would take the aggravating factor of racial motivation into account. If the jury agreed that there was a racial element to the offence, it would be taken into account. The jury might decide otherwise, so that the sentence would not include that element. The hon. Member for Woking made that point.
<P>
To clear up one point that has arisen, I am advised that section 20 offences are triable either way, in the Magistrates or the Crown court. Section 32(1) of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 covers that. I am sorry that that reference eluded my memory when the point was raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> What is the difference between what is proposed and simply upping the maximum sentence for section 20 and section 47 offences and common assault, and leaving it to the courts to decide, as they do with section 18, whether there is a racially-aggravated feature? That would boil down to the same thing, without the complication of directing juries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That would be an alternative approach, but whether it would be simpler would depend on whether it would affect the treatment of cases with no racial element. If the hon. Gentleman's suggestion were to be followed where a limit less than a life sentence applied, it would not be a solution. It would raise the maximum sentence for all offences of the relevant kind, and therefore would not produce the effect that I believe the hon. Gentleman is edging towards--an alternative way of allowing the racial element of an offence to be dealt with.
<P>
Some serious considerations relating to offences against the person arise and will be considered in depth. The law is unsatisfactory and leads to many appeals. That is why we have published proposals and options for discussion, which I hope will lead to constructive and informed debate, whose outcome will affect the treatment of some cases that have a racial element. That is where the debate about inconsistencies between sentences should take place.
<P>
The proposals in the Bill are coherent and would operate, within the current structure of offences--particularly offences against the person--reasonably and logically. Judges would be able to instruct juries sensibly. I am sure that the hon. Member for Woking, having probed the matter in Committee, will, when he comes to exercise responsibility in court, do so in an admirably lucid and limpid manner. It was right to raise this issue, but I hope that hon. Members will accept that the provisions are clear and straightforward, and that there should be no doubt in judges' or juries' minds in applying them.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 136, in page 23, line 14, leave out `or (b)' and insert `(b), (d), (e) or (f)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have some confidence that the Minister will accept the amendments, as, in view of what he has just said, if he does not do so he will be in danger of having egg on his face.
<P>
The Minister said in the debate on clause 26 that the insurmountable reason why the more serious offence could not be racially aggravated along with the lesser offence is that the more serious offence carries a discretionary life sentence. That is not a logical reason; we are discussing putting the verdict in the jury's hands. It will be for the judge, even under the Minister's mixed system, to decide whether there was racial aggravation in a case. We simply want to put the question of racial aggravation in both cases in the hands of the jury. Leaving that aside, the Minister told us that that is the insurmountable reason why the more serious offence could not be added to the lesser offences.
<P>
That reason does not stand up in respect of the public order offences covered by the amendments. Once again, the Government have included the less serious public order offences--serious in themselves but at the lower end of the scale of serious public order offences--in subsections (4)(a) and (5). They carry less serious punishments than the offences of riot, affray and violent disorder under sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Public Order Act 1986, which are much more serious offences and which have higher maximum penalties of a determinant nature; they are not discretionary sentences but carry fixed maximum sentences of a number of years' imprisonment.
<P>
We hope that the Minister will accept the amendments. He cannot rely on his reasons for disagreeing with what we said about clause 26 in this case because these offences do not carry discretionary sentences. These are fixed sentences; they could be increased in the same way as the sentences for the lesser public order offences. Unless the Minister says that his previous remarks were completely wrong and--pulling another rabbit out of the hat--he gives us a completely different reason for rejecting the amendments, I look forward to his favourable response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that I am giving him some pleasure in these debates; I trust that it is the pleasure of anticipation only.
<P>
Our intention in proposing these new offences is to deal with the specific problem of racial violence and harassment. For that reason we have restricted the range of the provisions to concentrate on the main violence and harassment offences directed against the person.
<P>
The offences in the amendment for the most part go beyond offences against the person to include public order offences, which need not be directed at a specific individual or victim. The offences therefore fall outside the immediate area of concern. However, the offences included in the amendment would nevertheless be covered by the provisions in clause 77 so that, where there was evidence of racial hostility, the court would be required to consider this as an aggravating factor meriting an increased sentence.
<P>
On a technical point, there is a mistake in the drafting of amendment No. 134, as the reference to section 8 of the Public Order Act 1986 which refers to unlawful violence is a reference to the section dealing with interpretation rather than an offence. We assume from the context that the amendment should refer to section 2 of the 1986 Act, the offence of violent disorder.
<P>
I hope that my explanation satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister is saying that people do not get upset by public order offences such as affray and violent disorder because they are not directed against the person, he should think again. The amendments would protect law-abiding members of the public from the terrible things that occur during violent disorder and affray. I am not satisfied by the Minister's explanation; we have a mixed system, which covers only less serious offences. The Minister is right to say that they are covered by clause 77, but clause 77 is essentially a re-enactment of the present position by which judges have strong authority from the Court of Appeal to pass sentence where they see elements of racial aggravation in an offence.
<P>
I wish to quote the wise words of the late Lord Justice Taylor. In the case of Ribbans, Duggan and Ridley, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It cannot be too strongly emphasised by this Court that where there is a racial element in an offence of violence, that is a gravely aggravating feature. There is no specific offence of racial violence although it has been suggested that there should be one. We take the view that it is perfectly possible for the court to deal with an offence of violence which has a proven racial element in it, in a way which makes clear that that aspect invests the offence with added gravity and therefore must be regarded as an aggravating feature.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have disregarded the course suggested by Lord Justice Taylor. They have introduced the concept of racially aggravated offences. We are trying to improve the provision, but we do not think that it is satisfactory for half the offences to be covered by one system and the other half by another.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that he will reflect on the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. Therefore, I shall not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his final remarks. I shall therefore not be provoked too far.
<P>
I do not put slightly convoluted interpretations on my remarks. The offences to which the hon. Gentleman referred cause a great deal of anger, misery, pain and damage to the wider community. That is why it is important that they are covered by clause 77 and, where appropriate, courts impose increased penalties as a result. That is our intention, and I hope that that message will go out loud and clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

I shall not detain the Committee long on the question of doli incapax, because the Opposition will not oppose the Government's proposal. However, in view of the importance attached to the issue in some quarters, we should say something about our views.
<P>
Doli incapax relates to the rebuttable presumption that children aged 10, 11, 12 or 13 are incapable of criminal responsibility. That presumption can be rebutted if the prosecution proves that a child knew that what he did was seriously wrong and not just naughty or mischievous. In short, the courts must be satisfied that a child knows the difference between right and wrong.
<P>
We have given careful consideration to the proposal to abolish the presumption. We know that some quarters have argued that the presumption should be reversed and that a child or his legal representatives should show that the child does not know the difference between right and wrong. We have listened to judicial authority and to practitioners and, on balance, we think that it is right that the rule should be abolished. We shall not oppose the Government even though there is a fair argument for the other point of view. We wonder if the operation of doli incapax is justified by the weight accorded to it by the Government in their presentation of youth justice issues. The doctrine has been with us since the reign of Edward III. It was widely thought that it had been abolished by the divisional court in 1994, until the House of Lords decided, a year later, that it had not been and that an Act of Parliament was needed to abolish it.
<P>
I am not aware that any great developments took place in the youth justice system during the period in which doli incapax was thought to have been abolished. I would be interested to hear of any such instances.
<P>
However, the abolition of doli incapax for 10 to 14-year-olds is given a starring role in the Government's ``No More Excuses'' White Paper. On Second Reading, the Home Secretary went even further when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Rules such as doli incapax and the extraordinary ruling in the Khan case . . . create a moving target before the offender is dealt with. All those factors add up to a system that is replete with excuse, and that is what we are trying to get away from.''--[Official Report, 8 April 1998; Vol. 377, c. 373.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would have surprised those who instituted the doctrine of doli incapax in the mid-14th century that they should be blamed for an alleged excuse culture in the youth justice system of the late-20th century.
<P>
The Home Secretary made some sweeping assertions, but what evidence are the Government using to back them up? My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) asked some probing questions about the Government's evidence for their proposals with regard to the under-10s. We might ask the same questions about the operation of doli incapax and the over-10s. Will the Minister tell us what research the Government have carried out into the operation of doli incapax that warrants the Home Secretary's assertions? I asked a parliamentary question about that matter. The Government told me that they were unable to say how many acquittals had resulted from the doctrine. They had no idea how it operated.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman say exactly where he saw words to the effect that the Government had no idea how it operated? That is rather different from saying that there are no statistics available for the way in which it has operated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I asked the Secretary of State what research his Department had commissioned in respect of the operation of the presumption of doli incapax and if he would publish it. The Minister gave the answer ``None''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman therefore withdraw the suggestion that we said that we did not know how the system was operating? We know how the system is operating. He asked specific questions about numbers and about our research intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No, I will not withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Disgraceful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the Minister will listen, I will clarify the point. I asked the Minister in a written question how many children had been found not guilty as a result of the operation of the presumption of doli incapax in each year for the last 10 years. He told me that that information was not collected centrally and that a not guilty outcome as a result of the presumption of doli incapax was neither in the interests of the child, or children concerned, nor in the interests of the public. He noted that it was important that the court was not prevented from dealing with the youngster when there was no doubt about the facts of the case.
<P>
That is all very well, but the Government have no idea how the doctrine of doli incapax was operating in the youth justice system. If they do, perhaps the Minister will share that information with the Committee. When I asked my question, the Government were able to tell me how many cases there had been, but they did not know in how many it had been necessary for the prosecution to rebut the presumption of doli incapax.
<P>
In the light of the parliamentary answers that I received, I am justified in saying that the Government have not carried out any research and are not able to give us any illuminating information about the operation of doli incapax. They have made sweeping assertions on the matter based on slender evidence, if any.
<P>
The Opposition do not intend to oppose the abolition of doli incapax, but I am entitled to make these observations. Now that I have heard the Government's views on other issues relating to very young children in the justice system, I am becoming unsettled by the general picture that is emerging of their attitude towards children and young people. Much of what the Government described as nipping in the bud may not be in the best interests of children's welfare and may not nip offending in the bud as the Government assert. On balance, after thinking about this carefully and considering all the legal authorities, I will not oppose the course that the Government are taking.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I do not know whether it is in order to talk to the amendment, I wish to talk to the clause and ask that, in pressing their argument for the change, the Government could make it quite clear what other actions they are thinking of taking to ensure that children should, if at all possible, avoid being brought to court. Finally there is a recognition that the Scottish system--

</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> To continue the theme, we want to hear that the Government have taken on board the fact that it is far more effective to try to prevent children getting into crime. Confronting them with courts as the first point of dealing with them does not seem to make sense. We hope that in England some of the lessons learnt from the children's hearing system and the children's panel in Scotland can be taken on board and that there will be some recognition that such interventions may be a more effective way to proceed.
<P>
We hope that the change is being seen as part of a complete package and not just in isolation. It would be a change from a former Home Secretary who argued that the Government could never countenance children's hearings in England because it would be against the concept of natural justice. It is an interesting comment on the United Kingdom that someone can sit in the Cabinet presiding over what he believes to be a complete travesty of natural justice in one part of the United Kingdom, while not accepting any debate in another part. I hope to hear that the Minister recognises that there are lessons to be learnt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I am not in any way trying to make a debating point. The hon. Gentleman is the only Scottish Member on the Opposition Benches. I am genuinely interested in why the criminal age of responsibility in Scotland is as low as eight. What is the practical experience on the ground? Is it true, as my briefing tells me, that children are rarely brought before the courts?
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The age is low for the historical reason that each country in Europe has a different age which has evolved with time. The practical reality is that children are brought before the children's panel where the whole issue is confronted and the family is involved. Discussions are held on the cause of their offending behaviour and the actions that can be taken to try to avoid it in the future. By discussing those issues and involving not just the children but others concerned with their care, the issue is tackled in the round.
<P>
Serious cases still end up in court but the system weeds out all the cases where court is not the appropriate way to deal with children. It then hopefully ensures that offending behaviour does not become part of their future lifestyle. In the serious cases where guilt has to be confronted and the sanctions of the court are needed, they obviously have to go to court; but that should be the exception rather than the norm. I hope that something like that can be built upon in England and that the Minister can give us some reassurances about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I rise to speak about doli incapax. This is a subject where there is clearly room for differing views. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and I agree on so many things, but in a broad church we are entitled to disagree on certain matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> You can tell the Whip is out of the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> While it may be good sport for the Minister to point to differences of opinion among Conservative Members on the matter, he will nevertheless recognise that it is one of those serious issues on which people have rather different views. It is sheer madness for us to say as a Committee, that we should effectively treat a 10-year-old the same as an adult for the purposes of criminal responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman point to anything that I or the Home Secretary have said in support of the changes that suggests that we should deal with a 10-year-old in the same way as an adult?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I hope that I have not missed the point entirely. I understand that the purpose of the clause is to reduce the age of criminal responsibility to 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The age of criminal responsibility is 10. The doli incapax doctrine suggests that we should maintain a theory that, in general, youngsters between the ages of 10 and 14 do not understand the difference between right and wrong. The doctrine therefore sets a test that prevents the courts from dealing with such children unless that point is proved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I chose my words without due care. I sought to express my belief that children should be treated very differently from adults. Is the Minister telling me--I hope that he will forgive me if I am wrong--that clause 31 will impose on children aged 10 to 13 a mens rea very different from that which applies to grown ups?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is important to deal with offenders in a way that is consistent with age and development. That is one reason why younger people are dealt with in separate courts, which take such factors into account when making decisions about the youngsters that appear before them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> We must be careful to discover what we are trying to achieve in our debate. I hope that I am supported by my hon. Friends in saying that the doli incapax presumption should remain. I share that view with Barnados, which has made submissions to the Committee and to the Government. It says that it would be wrong to abolish the presumption that a child is doli incapax. In its briefing document it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whilst it is common sense to presume that most children know the difference between right and wrong in a general sense, we do not believe that this should automatically lead to the conclusion that they can be expected to assume the same degree of responsibility for their actions as an adult.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman quotes from a brief from Barnados, which cares deeply about the impact of legislation on children and young people. I say that, having worked closely with Barnados workers on the ground over the years. However, I invite the hon. Gentleman to examine the impact of the doli incapax rule. What is he arguing for when he says how the doctrine will prevent consideration of some cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I will tell the Minister exactly what I am saying. I will quote from Archbold so that Committee members may be aware of what the doctrine means and how it applies in everyday life in the courts. Archbold says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is a presumption that a child between these ages''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--that is, between the ages of 10 and 14--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is doli incapax; (b) this presumption can only be rebutted by clear positive evidence that the child knew that his act was seriously wrong (as opposed to mere naughtiness or childish mischief) at the time when he did it; (c) mere proof of the doing of the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong that act might have been, cannot establish the requisite guilty knowledge and rebut the presumption''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the law as it stands.
<P>
Archbold continues in relation to particular cases, and this graphically illustrates the importance of the doctrine:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Proof that the child runs away after doing the prohibited act is not sufficient to rebut the presumption; running away is consistent with a belief in the child that what he has done was naughty and/or in breach of some school or parental rule|The nearer the child is to 10 years the stronger the evidence that is required to rebut the presumption''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on, and this is very telling:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``As in a bad home a child is likely to be brought up without knowledge of right and wrong, evidence of home background and circumstances, even though it may be on other issues highly prejudicial to the child, should be admitted on the issue of knowledge of wrong''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 That point about child's upbringing affects its maturity, its abiliy fully to understand the difference between right and wrong, its habits, family standards and so forth.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the doli incapax doctrine helps the court to consider what should happen to a particular youngster who has committed a particular offence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall give the Minister a particular example. Let us consider a youngester of an age to which the doctrine of doli incapax is applicable who commits an act that constitutes the actus reus of theft--the entry into the shop, the taking of an item and the going away from the shop. If I do that, the court has to prove that my intention was to steal--a full mens rea direction about dishonesty will be given. Theft is the intention permanently to deprive someone of his property: it is a dishonest intention. That is fine for an adult, but does the Minister accept that stronger protections are needed for youngsters in relation to the level of mens rea--or the level of guilty knowledge--necessary for a court to convict a child? That is a practical application of the doctrine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not think so. If factors pertaining to a particular youngster can be put before the court, is it not important for that court to consider what is appropriate in his particular case, having regard to his state of development and his understanding of the act that he has committed, and to come to a decision that will help to prevent his future offending? That would not only protect potential victims in the wider community, but be in the best interest of the child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I understand the Minister's point, but should not a particular standard be required for the child--in shorthand terms, that he knew that what he did was seriously wrong, as opposed to mere naughtiness? What troubles me about this clause, clause 32 and earlier clauses in the Bill is that we are moving far too far in the general direction of imposing on young people the same standards that we are imposing on older people. I am worried when I hear that no minimum age limit is being proposed for some of the orders and that a child under 10 can be taken to court, albeit a magistrates court, with all the panoply of criminal proceedings. I wonder wheter the different nuances of civil and criminal proceedings can be understood by the child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Magistrates courts dealing with care proceedings are not dealing with criminal matters. Is the hon. Gentleman addressing his criticism to all magistrates courts when they are dealing with non-criminal issues?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> No, because there is a difference in a child's mind between appearing in court in care proceedings, for example, and going before a magistrates court for what might be described as naughty behaviour. To a child, that is tantamount to saying, ``You have done wrong, you will be punished.''
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman goes back to his source at Barnardos and discusses what goes through the minds of children in respect of care proceedings. Often, a child suffers a considerable burden of guilt, some of it unjustified, but it exists. The hon. Gentleman's distinction is clear in the minds of lawyers, who know the law, but not in the minds of children.
<P>
I accept that it is important not to be excessive in these cases. Children under 10 must be dealt with carefully so that there is no suggestion that criminal matters are being considered, but it is very difficult for a child to make that distinction even when care issues are being considered in a magistrates court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Other colleagues want to speak and we are coming to an important debate on the next clause. I am aware of time constraints and of what might happen at about 6 pm. It may, therefore, be appropriate for me to sit down now, as I have made my point.
<P>
However, I hope that Government Members might share some of my concerns: the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) seems to have a conscience and to know about the practice of the law. He may have some sympathy with my point of view. However, I remain increasingly unhappy that the Bill contains so many references to ``age 10''. It goes too far towards bringing into the criminal justice system children who are too young to be part of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is a difficult clause. Against the Government is Barnardos opinion, quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, that the proposal
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would place a child aged over 10 years in the same position as an adult at the point at which innocence or guilt is being determined. The assumptions on which the Bill are based fly in the face of opinion that the child is still developing and maturing during the teenage years.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That, basically, is the purport of my hon. Friend's case.
<P>
At first sight, I was sympathetic to the point of view of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, especially as the presumption has been in place since the time of Edward III. Conservatives should remember Lord Falkland's dictum that when it is not necessary to change it is necessary not to change. One of the problems with Conservatism in recent years is that we have tried to be too radical in too many areas. I am beating my breast now and apologising for the shortcomings of the Government whom I supported. However, it should be said that the Government, having considered matters carefully, came down against changing the presumption as recently as 1990.
<P>
In support of my hon. Friend's view is the fact that the Bill will reduce the age of criminal responsibility to one of the lowest in Europe. Only in Cyprus, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Malta and Switzerland will the age be lower than in this country. The age in the United States is 18, which is very high. The matter is of such importance that we should consider it on Report, when we have more time.
<P>
Against my hon. Friend's view is that the presumption existed in our law because the penalties that the law could impose were so gruesome and draconian.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Speak for medieval England!
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend says that I should speak for medieval England, which I am happy to do.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking may wish to comment on the following remarks made by Glanville Williams, writing in the Criminal Law Review in 1954. It is perhaps the clincher; it is probably why my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is right not to vote against the Government on this occasion. Glanville Williams stated that in the present day--in 1954--the ``knowledge of wrong'' test stood in the way, not of punishment but of treatment. The article said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It saves the child not from prison, transportation or the gallows, but from the probation officer, the foster-parent or the approved school. The paradoxical result is that, the more warped the child's moral standards, the safer he is from the correctional treatment of the criminal law. It is perhaps even possible to argue that the tests should now be regarded as even legally obsolete. The test was designed to restrict the punishment of children and should not now be used where no question of punishment arises.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are wise words. Perhaps we should move on and consider the presumption carefully.
<P>
We need to know more about the provision's operation in practice. Our aim is not primarily to punish children from the ages of 10 to 14; we should try to direct their behaviour. If I understand the Minister correctly, he does not suggest that children aged between 10 and 14 will be treated in the same way as adults. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking pressed the Minister on that. I believe that my hon. Friend is right: it may not be the current practice in the courts, but once the presumption is abolished, children will be treated in the same way as adults. We must consider that carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> When the Minister responds to our useful debate, I hope that he will explain in detail how 10 to 14-year-olds will be treated differently from adults. The same burdens and standards of proof must apply in every criminal case: the burden is on the prosecution and the standard of proof is high. But we are considering intent--my hon. Friend is right to urge the Minister to focus on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is vital. The presumption that my hon. Friend quoted from Archbold is sensible. It states that the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the child knew at the relevant time that what he was doing was seriously wrong and not merely naughty or mischievous.
<P>
The Minister should share with the Committee the practical experience of the courts and explain why legal opinion, recent criminal cases and criminal records suggest that the presumption is no longer workable. The Government are taking a serious step after many centuries.
<P>
Why not reverse, rather than abolish the presumption? The court would then start with the presumption that children of 10 to 14 were capable of acting with criminal intent, but that a child would be acquitted if the defence could prove on the balance of probabilities, that the child did not know that the action in question was seriously wrong. I do not have a settled view on abolition or reversal, but the point is interesting, and although it was considered in the consultation document, it has not been made in the debate. I hope that the Minister will respond to it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest):</B> I find myself at odds with some of my hon. Friends on the matter, and I should be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on a few points.
<P>
Have the Government considered where the line of criminal responsibility should be drawn? The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) rightly pointed out that the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland is and always has been eight. I say that it always has been eight, but it was once seven. Some members of the Committee might allege that children in Scotland are in some way more responsible or mature than their counterparts in England. I see that some hon. Members might possibly agree with me, but far be it from me to suggest it--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> You will not get a majority.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> As usual, the Minister is right. I am not seriously suggesting that those of us who were brought up in Scotland were more mature at eight than those who were brought up in England. I want merely to highlight the fact that many schools of thought exist--each one thought to be right in the relevant country. I have it on good authority that the age of criminal responsibility in Germany is 14. There are vast differences in the western world about where to draw that line.
<P>
Was research done before the clause was drafted, and if so, what were its conclusions?
<P>
As has been mentioned, the doctrine of doli incapax was originally introduced in the 14th century, when it protected 10 to 13-year-olds from harsh adult justice. Surely things have changed significantly, so that rather than being exposed to harsh adult justice, a child is in the 1990s more likely to be helped than punished on being found guilty of a crime at that age. If we do not abolish the doctrine of doli incapax, we shall be denying another chance to children who, if found guilty, could be protected, given additional education or removed from unfortunate surroundings. That view of the matter leads me to support the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking made a very good case about the way in which 10-year-olds should be treated in the context that we are discussing. However, my concern is not with them, but with 13-year-olds. If a person is considered to be a child and therefore doli incapax until the age of 14, someone a week short of his or her 14th birthday can escape justice and proper punishment. In the real world today, 14-year-olds--both girls and boys--are frequently parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Frequently?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Occasionally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am sorry; my attention was drawn elsewhere and I misheard my hon. Friend. Did she say that children are often parents at 13 or 14?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point. Perhaps I was exaggerating in using the word ``frequently'', which I withdraw. I merely point out that while the Committee is right to debate the issue of 10-year-olds, young people some weeks or months short of their 14th birthday are leading adult lives.
<P>
As a result of unfortunate circumstances, such as ignorance or the lack of the chances that we should like children to have, ofter--or, to keep my hon. Friend happy, I gladly say sometimes--boy and girls aged 14 are parents. They act in an adult fashion.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I hope that a signal will go out from the Committee that it is not very adult behaviour to become a parent at 14.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I agree that it is unfortunate behaviour and that the Committee is not encouraging 14-year-olds to become parents. However, becoming a parent is behaving in an adult fashion.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Lady is in danger of being misinterpreted by some Conservative Members. Her point is perfectly valid. The result of the doli incapax rule is that the youngsters who are subject to pressures that are not appropriate to their age are prevented from receiving the help of the courts. They are not being protected from the law, but are prevented from receiving the benefits of the law that are meant to nip their offending in the bud and to help them in the circumstances that the hon. Lady has outlined.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I thank the Minister for interpreting my point so succinctly.
<P>
It would be sensible to examine whether children over the age of 12 should be considered as capable of crime and capable of understanding right from wrong. There is a considerable difference between a 10-year-old and someone who is almost 14. That is why I asked the Minister whether research had been carried out into the behaviour of 10, 11, 12 and 13-year-olds.
<P>
Will the Minister also confirm that the clause--
<P>
<H5>6.1 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.16 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I shall conclude my remarks briefly. Will the Minister confirm that the abolition of the rebuttable presumption of doli incapax will merely change the balance of proof? Is a young person, aged 10 or 11, more likely to be convicted, therefore, and to receive the help offered by the system? Alternatively, if the burden of proof were stricter and there was no conviction, the child might slip through the net. At the same time, an older child, aged almost 14, and living in an adult world and behaving in an almost adult fashion, might less easily escape the punishment, if the court considered that there were mens rea and that the child was capable of understanding right from wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall start with the point made by the hon. Lady. I agree with her. Abolition of doli incapax would not prevent the court from considering an offence in relation to the age and maturity of the child. The assertion of doli incapax prevents the court from ensuring that reparative action and appropriate rehabilitation can begin as soon as possible, when a young person is behaving in an unacceptable way.
<P>
The abolition of doli incapax would allow intervention to prevent reoffending and allow the possibility of stopping that youngster from engaging in activities that would be likely to damage his future--perhaps I should say his or her future, but it is more often boys who need that form of attention and intervention. Abolition is in the interests of the child, of the potential victims and of the wider community. It is certainly in the interests of the victim of the particular offence that the matter should be dealt with by the court and that the doctrine of doli incapax should not provide a senseless barrier to the court's ability to act.
<P>
The hon. Lady made a number of good points. However, I should like to deal specifically with her remarks about the age of criminal responsibility in order to set that matter on one side. She asked whether the Government had considered changing the age of criminal responsibility. The answer is no. She is right to refer to the fact that children develop at different rates. Many children develop a great deal between the ages of 12 and 14. There might be other arguments about whether the age of criminal responsibility should be 10, or 12, or 14, or eight--to take the Scottish direction--but they are not germane to the debate about doli incapax.
<P>
There is no intellectual argument for maintaining the doctrine of doli incapax. It is an obstacle to justice for everything, especially the young person involved. Children today are not subject to the draconian penalties of former times; the protection offered by doli incapax against overly harsh punishment is no longer appropriate. That view was shared by the House of Lords, which, following the case of C v. DPP recommended that Parliament should review the presumption, which had been inconsistently applied and was capable of inconsistent results. The House of Lords was right so to advise us and we have taken their lordships' advice.
<P>
The consultation document, ``Tackling Youth Crime'' asked the view of respondents how best to carry forward a reform of doli incapax. Of those who responded, 111 felt that the presumption should be abolished, 48 though it should be reversed and only 20 believed that it should be retained in its current form.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking rightly said that there is room for different views on the issue, and there are several different views on the Conservative Benches. I acknowledge the integrity of those who disagree, especially those whose primary concern is for children, but I believe that their views are entirely mistaken and misguided. I respect the hon. Gentleman's sincerity, but I do not regard the setting of 10 as the age of criminal responsibility as a mistake. It is simple and straightforward, and above the age of 10--the age of criminal responsibility as it now stands in law--the courts must take account of the maturity and development of the child concerned.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough apologised for not being Covervative enough, but he should have apologised because his Government did not tackle this mischief, and it is a mischief that children between the ages of 10 and 14 are not helped because the courts cannot consider their cases and offer assistance.
<P>
Several hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Hertsmere and the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine--I am gradually getting a grasp on his interesting constituency--invited me to say something about the context in which the issue is being considered and about our attitude to children and young people. Our attitude is that we should bring out the best in children and young people and discourage the worst. There needs to be a balance in our approach; we must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime and we need to provide opportunities for young people. For example, youth action groups give youngsters an opportunity to look at the problems that crime causes and to come up with their own solutions. That is an excellent approach that we want to encourage.
<P>
We want positive intervention in the lives of individual young people. The youth offending teams ensure that a youngster's educational development, health and family background are dealt with, as well as the offence that brings him before the court. It is far more effective to intervene to stop youngsters reoffending than to ignore the activities in which they are becoming involved.
<P>
	I tell the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that we are glad to learn from Scotland and from other countries. The White Paper ``No More Excuses'' sets out our proposals for the reform of the youth courts. Part of those reforms will include reform built on principles underlying restorative justice and making youngsters face the fact that they have damaged other people and that they should do something to repay a debt to a victim or to society. We propose that children who end up in the youth court for the first time and plead guilty can be referred by the court to a youth panel. Panel members will draw up a contract with the young person setting out clear requirements that will, among other things, tackle the causes of the offending behaviour.
<P>
We are considering ways in which parents can become more involved. On one hand, we will require parents to take responsibility for their children and offer the mechanism of the parenting order, and on the other we will look for ways of engaging parents and young people constructively in what has gone wrong in their lives. We want to examine the specific offence and wider examples.
<P>
We want to intervene more quickly. The final warning means that instead of having repeat cautions, giving youngsters the message that nothing much happens when they do something wrong, there will be interventions. There will be the final warning, which draws a clear line for that youngster and involves the youth offending team asking questions about the behaviour at that early stage. Questions such as whether the young person is attending school, or whether truancy is a problem, would be asked. These issues will be dealt with later, but the report of the social exclusion unit has highlighted the association between truancy and offending--particularly later, serious offending. That point needs to be tackled, but all the matters that I have referred to are important to society and to the reduction of crime and protection of the community--as well as to the interests of the young people who come before the courts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere, apart from appearing a woolly-minded old liberal who cannot bring himself to vote against the clause--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am agreeing with the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think I would characterise the hon. Gentleman's speech as agreeing with faint damns. He is wrong to say that the Government have no idea how the system works.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of the number of cases in which it had been necessary for the prosecution to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. In all prosecutions involving children under 14 the prosecution must rebut that presumption; that is the whole point and the reason we want to get rid of it. In 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 7,125 children under 14 were proceeded against in a magistrates court. The presumption of doli incapax has been in force over the past five years except for a period between a divisional court judgment in 1994, which ruled that it was no longer part of English law, and the House of Lords judgment in 1995 that reinstated it. That was referred to earlier, and surely such inconsistency of treatment is nonsensical.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere also referred to research, as if its absence were a problem. The lack of research is a problem only if one is not sure what the problem is. In fact, it is clear. In March 1995 the House of Lords commented, in the case of C. v. DPP that the common law presumption of doli incapax had been inconsistently applied. In 1997 we published our proposals. There has been considerable debate for some time, and the problems are clear to the courts.
<P>
The essence of the doli incapax doctrine is that children under 10 are below the age of criminal responsibility, and nothing in the proposal will change that. The presumption that generally children aged between 10 and 14 do not know the difference between right and wrong defies common sense. Anyone who has worked with children in that age group knows that they have a very well developed sense of right and wrong, and if that is not so in a particular case, evidence of the problem should be brought before the court. It is better for the court to take account of the offender's age and maturity at the point of sentence.
<P>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Hertsmere contained a suggestion that under the clause we should be treating children under 14 as if they were adults. That is not true. For all juveniles aged between 10 and 18 who are convicted of a criminal offence, the court has available to it a different range of sentences, graduated by age and taking into account the age and development needs of the person convicted. The range would be widened still further by the Government's new proposals, which would strengthen the capacity of the system to deal with child offenders in the most focused way. For those reasons we do not believe that the abolition of the presumption will conflict with international obligations under the United Nations convention on the rights of the child or the European convention on human rights. It has been suggested that conflict would arise, but I do not believe that. We shall be applying common sense.
<P>
If children of the age in question have committed a criminal offence, it is more, not less, necessary for their wrongdoing to be acknowledged, and corrective action to be taken. Appropriate punishment and effective intervention at that stage would prevent many such children from becoming tomorrow's adult criminals. Neither justice nor the young people are served by permitting the latter to evade responsibility for their actions.
<P>
Anecdotal examples can be given in multitudes, but I recently heard the case of three youngsters who were involved in a serious arson. The doli incapax doctrine prevented the court from dealing with them. I am certain that whatever the rights and wrongs and whatever the degree of culpability, that was a serious offence. It was regarded in that way by the victims and the community. In such circumstances, is it not sensible for a court to have the unfettered right to use its judgment in the appropriate way that I suggested--that is, appropriate to the needs of the child at its particular age and development--to ensure that the child is put on the right track? Is it not neglect for society to allow the doctrine of doli incapax to stand in the way? I hope that all members of the Committee will support the clause.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to an important clause and we look forward to hearing the Minister's views about it. We hope that he will provide a characteristically full and courteous response.
<P>
It is important for the Committee to be aware of the change brought about by the clause. Section 35 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 permits a court or jury to draw such inferences as appear proper from a defendant's failure to give evidence or refusal to answer any questions. In shorthand, that is known as the right to silence. The 1994 Act has been viewed as abolishing the right to silence by permitting such inference to be drawn. However, the 1994 Act specifically restricted the reform to defendants aged over 14. No such inference could be drawn in the case of a defendant aged under 14: a child of that age still had the right to silence. Thus children were treated differently from adults regarding the protection of the right to silence.
<P>
The clause will abolish the right to silence for under-14s. In future, children between 10 and 14 will be in the same position as adults and young people aged over 14. It will be possible for an inference to be drawn about the silence of a child during the course of a trial in the same way as for an older person. The Committee will, I think, agree that we are right to take this change seriously. We hope that the Government will also take it seriously and that we will not be chided for not having done something about the problem ourselves when we were in government.
<P>
The Minister will recall that when the previous Government abolished the so-called right to silence, the Labour party opposed the measure tooth and nail and voted against it in every Division. They would not then have wanted to abolish the right to silence for 10 to 14-year-olds. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has forgotten.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall remind the Minister in a minute. He says that I have forgotten but I have not. Let me remind the Minister of his own words during the debate on what was then clause 28 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill, which he described as being of a ``deeply unsatisfactory nature''. That was the same clause that the Minister now wants to apply to 10 to 14-year-olds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will give way in a minute because the Minister may wish to hear the next quotation as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should like to deal with the first if the hon. Gentleman will allow me. Saying that something is deeply unsatisfactory is not the same as totally rejecting a need for change. The hon. Gentleman should remember the discussions that took place on that Bill and the ham-fisted way in which the then Government sought to deal with the recommendations of the royal commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister will now regret not having heard the second quotation before he gave his response to the first. I shall now quote the words of no less a person than the Prime Minister speaking in 1994 as shadow Home Secretary about the case for change:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Our conclusion|is that|the case for changing the fundamental principles in this way has not been made. We go further, and say that it is more than merely a matter of high constitutional principle. There is a serious and substantial risk that, in the manner in which the Government have proceeded, we will not merely fail to convict more of the guilty, but that we are in danger of convicting more of the innocent. Those who are in primary danger from the changes will not be, as has been said, the professional and the hardened criminal, but they could well be the weak, the inadequate and the frightened.''--[Official Report, 13 April 1994; Vol. 241, c. 261-2.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That applies--I break off the quotation there--except for 10 to 14-year-olds who, in the eyes of the present Government, are exempted from being ``weak, inadequate and frightened''.
<P>
That clause was debated in 1994 and the Government now want to apply it to 10 to 14-year-olds. I hope that the Minister will not chide us about such matters. He would do well to consider the position on consultation. We are grateful that the Minister of State is responding to the debate--[Interruption.] The Minister shakes his head. If the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department is responding, we would like to learn a little about the ministerial doctrine that all changes should be consulted on fully.
<P>
Will the Minister--whichever one is answering this debate--tell us why the Government, with all the resources that are available to them, apparently have not mentioned the matter in their many consultation papers? Has there been any consultation with the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Criminal Bar Association, which represent practitioners in the field? We have received representations from organisations that deal with child welfare, but they may have been caught off the ball because the reform was not introduced into the Bill until a late stage in its consideration in another place.
<P>
We look forward to hearing the Under-Secretary defend the application of his doctrine. We think that change should be consulted on with practitioners in the field. That would enable us to find out how lawyers feel about putting 10, 11, 12 and 13-year-olds into the dock without the protection of the right to silence, thus allowing inferences to be drawn about their failure to answer pertinent questions. That is a material consideration.
<P>
I admit--freely and with some pride--that I was a member of the Committee that debated the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill in 1994; so Labour Members may be asking themselves how the hon. Member for Hertsmere can attack the Government for abrogating the right to silence, when he voted to remove that right from adults and younger people over the age of 14. The answer is simple. The 1994 Act removed the right to silence only from people aged 14 or over. It kept the right to silence for people below that age. It did so for good reason, because such people need special protection within our criminal justice system. The 1994 Act specifically excluded children from the reform that it made. I therefore feel that I can state our position with a degree of consistency. The Minister smiles, but it is the smile of someone who has executed a 360 degree turn and has gone from one extreme to the other.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman insists on commenting on reactions to his remarks, so I will point out that he was unable to keep his own face straight. He smiled as he tried to defend inconsistencies in his position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was smiling with pleasurable anticipation at what will no doubt be the extreme agility and skill with which the Minister will defend his position. The Minister must be aware that he has executed a 360 degree turn and has gone from one extreme to the other. The matter is serious and we must think seriously about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It is so serious that the Minister is not prepared to listen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister talks about amusement, but there is good reason for giving children under 14--I was about to refer to them as young people, but, as the Minister noted, in the eyes of the criminal law they are children--the same kind of special protection that they were given by the 1994 Act. The Government must be a bit more realistic about children than they have been in clause 32 and in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
Fairly recently very young defendants--I believe that they were under 14--were involved in a case concerning an allegation of serious sexual assault on a very young child in a primary school. Apparently, they were completely unaware of what was going on and had to be given colouring books and painting to do during the trial. The provision would place children of that age in the same position as adults in so far as inferences could be drawn if they did not give evidence. The Committee must consider that seriously.
<P>
Several reasons that do not apply to an adult may exist for a child's failure to give evidence, or to give evidence well, or to answer a question. A child may be overcome by or oblivious to court proceedings. Legal practitioners do their best to reassure children, but any child of the age that we are considering is likely to find the experience of going to court daunting. How much of those matters will children understand? How will legal representatives advise them about giving evidence and the inferences that might be drawn from their failure to do so? Will the rules for adults and younger people apply to children when, at the close of the prosecution case, legal representatives have to tell the court about their clients' understanding of the position and the inferences that might be drawn if they do not give evidence? The Government should be more realistic. The child's legal representatives are expected to advise the child about those matters. We need to know what they will be expected to say.
<P>
The Government are unrealistic about the position of young children in our system of justice. The Bill removes a protection that was specifically afforded to children in the 1994 Act, at the same time as the Government take away so many other protections from children. We have just debated the doctrine of doli incapax and, on balance, we decided that the Government were right about it. But the Government remove the protection of doli incapax at the same time as they take away the protection that we are discussing. When one protection is removed, it makes one stop and think even harder when another important protection is taken away.
<P>
Why did the Government introduce the provision at a late stage in another place? We want to know about the consultation that took place, how the Government expect the provision to operate for children, and how to avoid the injustices in the case of an adult about which the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) before he became Prime Minister, waxed lyrical in the Committee proceedings of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Why do not those considerations apply to very young children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We support the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. We share the anxieties that the Labour party had when the right to silence was debated in the context of the 1994 Act. Unlike the Labour part, we have not had the benefit of forming a Government and receiving excellent advice from focus groups to move our position on the issue.
<P>
We are considering extending the abolition of the right to silence to an especially vulnerable group--the 10 to 14 age group. It has been acknowledged that, in many circumstances, children from that group experience difficulty in giving evidence in court. If 10 to 14-year-olds are called as witnesses, special provisions, such as video links, are made. That acknowledges the difficulty that that age group experiences with the court environment. Sometimes, children abuse the right to silence in the same way that some adults did. That was the justification for abolishing the right to silence under the 1994 Act. However, we believe that the majority of children in the 10 to 14 age group require the protection of the right to silence, and that only a small number of children can be quoted anecdotally as being so wise to criminal law that they thumb their noses at it and ``won't say'' rather than ``can't say''. The majority should not be denied protection simply because we can give the odd example of abuse of the system.
<P>
If we are not successful in changing the Government's mind about the provision, we want assurances from the Minister about its use, and about the guidance to the courts on how to operate it. That will be critical in deciding whether it is advantageous to the general good or damaging to the interests of young children aged between 10 and 13. The courts would have to apply sensitively any presumption based on the fact that an individual in that age group was not able to testify. They would have to decide whether the individual ``can't say'' or ``won't say''. I suggest that in many cases ``can't say'' would be the only judgment that the court could rightfully make.
<P>
I will not repeat the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, although I am pleased to note that Conservative Members share the commonsense view of Liberal Democrat Members. We seek to reverse some of the trends under the previous Government, which continually chipped away at the ability of individuals to deal with the legal system in a just way. We do not want to build in presumptions that favour the criminal; we want a justice system that balances the rights of vulnerable individuals, especially children, with those of society, to achieve the prosecutions that are needed.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall be brief. First, I must tell the Minister that I do not like the clause one bit.
<P>
Secondly, I was not a Member of the House of Commons in 1994 when the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill was enacted. If I had been, I should have supported sections 34 to 37. Section 35 gives protection to people aged 14 in relation to the failure to give evidence, but that age limit does not apply to sections 34, 36 and 37.
<P>
Section 34 refers to the fact that a failure to answer questions under caution may lead to adverse inferences being drawn. Section 36 relates to the failure to account for objects, and section 37 to the failure to account for presence at the scene of a crime. In both cases, adverse inferences might be drawn. Under those three sections age does not matter. That seems odd to me, but the Minister might say that that is a reason for extending the provision to section 35.
<P>
However, court proceedings are slightly different and need special consideration. There might be a argument that section 35 should be brought into line with sections 34, 36 and 37, just because they have no age limit, but I do not think that it stands. I hope that the Minister will not say that the reason for the provision is to enable the courts to help young children when an offence has been committed. That misses the point. We are not discussing sentencing, but the question of guilt or not. That is the principal point. It is the reason why I am uneasy about proposals to give the court all the necessary tools to deal with people when crimes have been committed. The right to silence is a vital protection for young children and it should remain, but my views will not prevail.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): I have been accused of making a 360 deg turn. That would mean that I must be pointing in exactly the same direction in which I began. That is the case. The Labour party did not oppose the removal of the right to silence, or allowing inferences to be drawn in respect to court proceedings. There were issues relating to police stations, but I remember the debate about court proceedings very well. I took part in it and I remember the position of the Labour party. If Labour Members have been doing pirouettes, we are in exactly the same position as we were before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that I am not doing the Minister an injustice, but I am sure that we are discussing the same clause. He and I were both members of that Committee. He took part in the debate and said that it seemed that where the Government found solid ground they insisted on ``throwing down quicksand'' to undermine the balance that the courts could provide in making a ``significant change'' to the trial procedure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman then voted on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We were concerned about the way in which the clause was drafted. All the comments that the hon. Gentleman made about the manner in which the Government will proceed related to the way in which the clause was being dealt with. He then proceeded to make the extraordinary suggestion that all 10 to 14-year-olds are weak, inadequate and frightened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That was not the point I was making. I was saying that, following the Prime Minister's logic, since he was against doing this for adults, he must have thought that no children aged under 14 could be weak, inadequate or frightened. Perhaps the Minister will be as bold as his rhetoric. Could he look to see whether he voted in favour of what is now section 35 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and write to tell us the difference between the clause as it stands and the clause that he criticises?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> At the time we did not vote against those changes. I made that quite clear when I mentioned them when I started to reply to the debate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made great play of consultation. There was consultation on doli incapax and the point arose as a result--the changes were produced in response to consultation. The hon. Member for Hertsmere is hoist with his own petard. In many ways, he is becoming the Conservative spokesman for inconsistency. In a sense he is advocating that we should not have consistency between the previous clause and this clause. If we have removed doli incapax, surely to ensure that there is consistency, we have to move towards making changes in this clause.
<P>
Consistency is one of the key reasons why we believe the change is necessary. It will enable the behaviour of the young person to be addressed. We wanted to change the rules for doli incapax, not because we wanted to impose draconian penalties on young people, but because the aim of dealing with young people in the courts today is to nip their behaviour in the bud, create circumstances in which their behaviour can be changed and prevent reoffending.
<P>
The clause tells young people that they must accept responsibility for what they have done. Any child from five onwards knows that if he starts misbehaving he has to answer the basic questions, ``Did you do it?'' and if so, ``Why did you do it?'' Any child will understand that before he reaches the age of 10. We are saying that once they have got to 10 it is logical, if there is a court case, for them to be given the opportunity and to be obliged to say whether they did it and if so, why they did it, and that an inference may be drawn if they decide not to do so. Those basic issues must be addressed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking rightly pointed out that there is a need for consistency in relation to section 34 of the 1994 Act and the position on police stations. Does he now say that we should change the position for young people between 10 and 14 in police stations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Does the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who leads for the Opposition, advocate that? Does he say that we should change section 36, which obliges people over 10 to account for objects, substances or marks or an inference may be drawn? Does he suggest that we should change section 37, which obliges them to account for their presence in a particular place or an inference may be drawn? He is the Conservative shadow Minister for inconsistency if he does not. If the Government are putting forward the argument for consistency in the law, the Conservative Opposition appear to be advocating inconsistency. At least the Liberal Democrats seek to achieve some element of consistency.
<P>
The real woolly-mindedness comes from the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who sees a need for greater protection for young offenders. How does he square that view with the approach adopted towards the Bulger case by the Home Secretary in the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister may say what he likes about my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), but the 1994 Act protected those under 14. The Minister may smile, but he knows who is being consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I notice that the hon. Gentleman had no answer to the question about the Bulger case. The Home Secretary in the previous Administration not only took the view that young people had to bear some responsibility for what they did, but sought to increase the penalties. We need an element of consistency from the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> What has the Bulger case got to do with this Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Conservative Government took the view that in certain cases 10 to 14 year-olds were responsible for their behaviour. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that we need greater protections for young offenders aged between 10 and 14. That is inconsistent with the Conservative Government's approach and that is why he has become the shadow Minister for inconsistent approaches to the criminal law. He appears to be saying that we should not nip in the bud or tackle the difficulties that young offenders aged between 10 and 14 create. He is defending the courts' inability to deal with such issues.
<P>
Our proposal brings clause 32 into line with clause 31. That is an entirely consistent approach and one that I hope the Committee will support strongly.
