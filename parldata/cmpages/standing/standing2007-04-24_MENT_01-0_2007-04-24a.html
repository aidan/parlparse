speak on behalf of all members of the Committee when I say how pleased
we are to be sitting under your expert chairmanship, Mr.
Cook, and that of Lady Winterton. We are very much looking forward to
the debate.</div><a name="07042442000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
certainly raises some extremely sensitive issues. I wish first to
emphasise the Government&#146;s objectives, which are to make sure
that people with serious mental health problems receive the treatment
that they need; to modernise mental health law in line with the
development of services; to tackle current European
convention on human rights incompatibilities and to strengthen
patients&#146;
rights.</div><a name="07042442000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
modernisation of mental health legislation has been under discussion
for something like nine years. I thank all the parliamentarians who
participated in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>those discussions, particularly members of the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee. I wish also to thank all the interested organisations that
have contributed to the debate and officials at the Department of
Health and the Home Office who have spent much of their waking hours
putting together this and previous, draft Bills. We have a fine body of
men and women here today. I am sure that the debate will be lively, but
I hope also
constructive.</div><a name="07042442000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">As right
hon. and hon. Members know, the Government wish to make changes to the
Bill that has come from the other place, but I emphasise that that is
because we consider it vital that treatment and help are given to some
of the most vulnerable people in our society&#151;the subject of the
Bill. It is important to point out that we need to see the Bill in the
context of the improvements that we have been making to mental health
services during the past 10 years, particularly through the national
service framework. Many of the changes that we are proposing under the
mental health legislation are because of the many new services that we
can now offer to people with mental health
problems.</div><a name="07042442000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay
tribute to the hard work and dedication of the many thousands of staff
in our mental health services who have done so much to improve what we
can offer to make sure that we have high-quality services that are
accessible to people who need them. I shall conclude my remarks by
again thanking all those who have helped to draw up the legislation and
I look forward to the forthcoming
debates.</div><a name="07042442000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000379"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): May I
reiterate the comments of the Minister in welcoming you, Mr.
Cook, and Lady Winterton to the chairmanship of the Committee? As you
are aware, Mr. Cook, this is a fairly contentious piece of
legislation and we are likely to have a full and frank exchange of
views during the debate, which I am sure you are more than familiar
with.</div> <a name="07042442000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also
reiterate the Minister&#146;s comments about welcoming the fine body
of men and women on both sides of the Committee? A great deal of
expertise has gone into the Committee, which I am sure will come to the
fore. It gives those of us&#151;certainly the Minister, myself and
others&#151;who have been working with the Bill for many years
something of a strange sense to be here. The Bill has been some eight
years in the making. We have had two draft Bills and an excellent
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, which I had the privilege to serve
on under Lord Carlile. Now, at last, we have the Bill in front of us in
black and white as it continues its progress.</div>
<a name="07042442000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The strong interest that we saw
in the Bill on Second Reading is symptomatic of the many people who
have an interest in getting the legislation right. On that basis, I am
pleased that the Government have given us six sittings in the programme
motion. I hope, Mr. Cook, that given the strong issues of
principle involved, particularly in those six areas of the Bill that
were substantially amended in the House of Lords, you will allow some
fairly substantial debates, because those issues remain contentious.
The issues are also fundamental to the acceptability of the Bill, not
just to Members on either side of the argument here, but to a great
many people outside this place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="07042442000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that no fewer than 80
organisations representing mental health professionals, service users
and service providers, particularly in the voluntary sector, have
formed the extraordinarily close Mental Health Alliance, which has been
going for some years and has gone from strength to strength, we will
want to probe in Committee to find out why the Government seem to be
standing in &#147;splendid isolation&#148;&#151;as my hon. Friend
the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) described it on Second
Reading&#151;and why they appear resolute in overturning the scrutiny
and the excellent amendments that improved the Bill during its passage
through the House of Lords.</div>
<a name="07042442000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only today, the British Medical
Association issued a press release that stated:</div>
<a name="07042442000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the mental health Bill will not
help vulnerable patients, say doctors.&#148;</div>
<a name="07042442000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the Minister to justify why she,
her Department and her Government think that the BMA, the Royal College
of Psychiatrists, the Law Society, Rethink, Mind, the
Sainsbury Centre for MentalHealth, the Royal College of
Nursing and assorted other highly reputable organisations, which are
often quoted by the Government, are wrong to oppose the way in which
the Government are trying to overturn the Lords amendments to the
Bill.</div> <a name="07042442000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to have
a full debate on six issues: treatability, exemptions from mental
disorder, the renewal of detention, age-appropriate treatment, impaired
decision making and, perhaps most contentious of all and an area on
which we want to spend as much time as possible, community treatment
orders. I envisage that we will have some voting action in the process
of the Committee as well.</div>
<a name="07042442000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I put in a plea,
Mr. Cook, for the Committee to have every opportunity to
scrutinise all the available evidence in the six sittings? You will be
aware that the Government controversially published their report on the
international experiences of community treatment orders, which the
Minister&#146;s own Department had commissioned from the Institute of
Psychiatry last year. According to the institute, that report was
available in a format that could have been published,at least
in interim form, many months before it was,on 7 March. The
Government, however, decided to publish that report the day after the
House of Lords had finished its proceedings. Yet community treatment
orders were a very important part of that debate. My plea is that, now
we have had an opportunity to lookat that report, which offers
no empirical evidence to justify community treatment orders being
introduced, any further evidence that the Government may have
commissioned or may be considering that is germane to the
Committee&#146;s proceedings should be made available to it at the
earliest possible
date.</div><a name="07042442000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
particularly alarmed by comments by Labour Members on the recent tragic
shootings at Virginia Tech. One right hon. Member who spoke on Second
Reading drew a close parallel between what happened in Virginia and
what could happen here, subject to our deliberations
on the Mental Health Bill. I fundamentally disagree with those
implications, which are based on no evidence whatsoever. I know that
the Minister&#146;s Department has been in close contact with mental
health experts from the university of Virginia school of law and that
the Minister&#146;s mental health tsar has invited an eminent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>professor to meet a group of Members of Parliament on 5 June, but I have
not been made aware of anysuch meeting. What happened in
Virginia may have implications for our deliberations on the Bill, but
if the Government think it relevant to invite an expert, the Committee
should be aware of what might come out of that meeting. We need to have
that information sooner rather than later.</div>
<a name="07042442000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a general point, I hope that
other evidence that will be useful in our deliberations will not come
out when it is too late. We all want a Mental Health Bill that will
work. The primary purpose of the Mental Health Bill must be to improve
services and safeguards for patients, reduce the stigma of mental
disorder and ensure that the public are protected. That was the view of
the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, on which I served, and its
report was widely acclaimed by many people. I hope that we can have a
full and frank debate on all the evidence available, on the basis that
all hon. Members&#151;whatever side of the argument they stand on in
relation to the technicalities of certain parts of the Bill&#151;want
to achieve a better situation for some of the most vulnerable people in
society.</div><a name="07042442000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also
be aware that mental health legislation can contribute to stigma.
People suffering from mental illness are some of the greatest victims
of stigma in our society, so we must ensure that our deliberations are
fully conscious of that and that our final resolutions lead to
something that can, at last, help to reduce the stigma from which so
many people with mental illness suffer. I hope, therefore, that we can
do a great dealof good in producing a piece of legislation fit
for the 21st century and that it helps those people that Committee
members want to
help.</div><a name="07042442000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000380"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): May I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Cook? When we were last in a debate together you
used a rather vivid canine metaphor to describe Liberal Democrats, from
which I hope that you will temporarily exempt me and my hon. Friend the
Member for
Romsey.</div><a name="07042442000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, was overawed when I saw the list of Committee members. Never have
I seen such a thoughtful, experienced group of individuals assembled
for a Bill as controversial as this. It is fair to say that we do not
have a Committee of yes-men, or yes-people. I take that as a relatively
hopeful sign, because if people take fixed, immovable positions, stake
out the ground, raise their flags, and rehearse and repeat the same
arguments, there is a serious danger of our easily entering into a
dialogue of the
deaf.</div><a name="07042442000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Lords
debate, as we have seen already, was not like that; it was thorough,
eloquent and well-informed. Copious amounts of
research material and submissions have been made available and I assume
that every Committee member has read those thoroughly to the last
letter. We do not need to rival or equal that debate. Our job should be
much more modest; we should see whether we can bridge the gap between
the Government and, not the Opposition, but a large section of the
mental health community&#151;the professionals, the carers and the
sufferers. The Opposition, to some extent, stand proxy for those people
and many of the amendments tabled by the Opposition are formulated by
them. We must tease out and clarify the differences that currently
exist and see, where possible, how those can be bridged.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="07042442000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
help if, in the initial stages, we could park our views about the
Government&#146;s intentions and adopt as little forensic language as
we need to. At this stage, we need not air views about what rogue
psychiatrists may or may not do with particular proposals. We must
concentrate simply on what the proposals say and do, because the
legislation that we will produce is, ultimately, likely to affect
millions over decades. We owe it to them to progress matters as
rationally as possible. The issue is about not simply
liberties&#151;although liberty has been talked about a great
deal&#151;but some of the most intense suffering known to man. It
genuinely ought not to be decided simply by political force majeure, or
by the lottery of the wash-up or the ping-pong. In that spirit, we
would like to begin examining the Bill.</div>

Loughton:</b> We are all on a fast learning curve here,
Mr. Cook, and I wrote to the Minister before Easter to get
some elaboration on how she thought this process might work. My
concern, not least in light of my previous reference to the publication
of the report on community treatment orders after the House of Lords
had finished its deliberations, was that further scrutiny of new
evidence would be beneficial to the Committee. I therefore asked the
Minister whether the full rigours of the Public Bill Committee could be
brought to bear, so that we could have an oral witness session,
particularly on community treatment orders, to examine that important
evidence, which could then feed through to the Committee&#146;s
deliberations, as well as the normal written submissions that have been
mentioned. The Minister suggested that further oral witness sessions
were not necessary, in her view, and that the procedure would be to
invite written submissions that would be then be made available to the
Committee. I also thank you, Mr. Cook, forthe speed
with which you have made those initial38
submissions&#151;</div><a name="07042442000037"></a>

Loughton:</b> Yes, it is now up to 46. For those of us who
took them away, those initial 38 ruined our weekends but enabled us to
have some time to look at them properly before the Committee started.
Very interesting submissions they are too, and I am gladthat
that invitation was taken up seriously by the organisations and
individuals who have responded.</div>
<a name="07042442000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that written
submissions can continue to be made and will therefore be made
available to the Committee, subject to your discretion, Mr.
Cook, until the final day of its proceedings, and that those written 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>submissions approved by you will also be published as part of the
written <i class="I">Hansard</i><i class="I"> </i>record of this Committee<i class="I">.</i> May I
take your nod as to whether I am getting it right so
far?</div><a name="07042442000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000386"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think that I had better provide some
clarification. Some submissions have been presented with the proviso
that they will not be published on the internet. That being the case,
the submissions will not be preserved there but in the
archives.</div>
<a name="07042442000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000387"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Thank you for that clarification, Mr.
Cook. I am sure that the Committee will be more than happy to rely on
your discretion as to what finally gets published; as we have seen,
what has been made available so far certainly seems to be fairly
extensive.</div> <a name="07042442000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point
here is that the Minister suggested that we did not need to have
further scrutiny of this Bill, and while those of us involved with it
over several years might be inclined to agree, new things have come
out. The Bill that we are scrutinising is now fundamentally different
from that which started its scrutiny process in December in the House
of Lords. On that basis, we thought that further scrutiny would be
beneficial to the Committee, and as I have mentioned to you,
Mr. Cook, several members of the Committee decided to set up
a witness session yesterday afternoon in Committee Room 16. There, for
a marathon three and a half hours, 11 members of the House of Lords and
the House of Commons, from the Conservative, Lib Dem and Welsh
nationalist parties, and Cross Benchers&#151;unfortunately no Labour
Members were available to attend&#151;scrutinised no fewer than 25
witnesses from an enormous range of organisations and individuals. The
vast majority of them are familiar with the Bill, whether in submitting
evidence, appearing as witnesses before the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee or making other representations all along. For three and a
half hours we took some fairly extensive evidence, most pointedly on
the community treatment orders, to which we devoted most of our time
yesterday afternoon. We were able to have the proceedings recorded, and
they will shortly be transcribed by a <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporter in a
written format, which we would then wish to publish and make available
to all Members of Parliament,of both Houses, and certainly to
members of the Committee, as soon as it has
physically been
transcribed.</div><a name="07042442000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000388"></a><b class="B">Chris
Bryant</b> (Rhondda) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman said that the
session was recorded by <i class="I">Hansard</i>, which would suggest that it was
an official Committee of the House. Is that what he
means?</div><a name="07042442000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000389"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> No, that is not what I said. I said that the
proceedings were recorded by House officers, but the transcription will
be done by a <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporter on a free-lance basis, for which a
fee will be paid. So, the session was not, nor was it ever assumed to
be, an official Committee of the House. At no point wasit
claimed to be an all-party group or an official
Committee.</div><a name="07042442000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">To clarify,
a joint letter was sent by the hon. Member for Romsey and myself,
initially to every member of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee,
whose names&#151;from both Houses&#151;we obviously knew, which
referred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>to an impromptu committee being set up that we hoped would have the
involvement of all parties. At no point did we claim that it would be
some sort of official committee. It was made quite clear that because
we felt that further witness sessions were desirable&#151;it is
better to inform the Committee, and I do not see what the downside
could possibly be&#151;we wanted to set up a committee involving as
many interested parties as possible, from all parties as well, to take
expert witness
testimonies.</div><a name="07042442000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000390"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Cook.
We are all finding our way on the Public Bill Committee and I
understand one of the reasons that we could not have an evidence
session right at the beginning of proceedings was that the Bill started
out in another place. However, does my hon. Friend agree that it would
be an idea to have such evidence sessions when the Bill starts in the
other place? I certainly found yesterday&#146;s evidence session
rewarding and useful, and would have found it much more so had we been
able to do it formally, on a cross-party basis, so it was much more
similar to a Select
Committee?</div><a name="07042442000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000391"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he was
one of the attendees at the session yesterday. He has come to the
legislation relatively late. Clearly, the deliberations and evidence
taken yesterday have better informed his ability to scrutinise the
legislation in Committee. That was the whole point, and it was
unfortunate that the committee could notbe conducted on an
official basis. However, at the end of the day, the result is to
achieve a written record of25 witnesses, including some who
agreed with the changes proposed in the amendments,
and some previously pleaded in aid by the Government and some
not.</div><a name="07042442000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000392"></a>Chris
Bryant:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I do not want
to sour the beginning of the debate, because I hope that we can reach a
Bill that commands the respect and support of as many Members of the
House as possible. However, I think that he has inadvertently misled
the Committee, because his e-mail to the Minister, which was widely
circulated by his office to others, said quite specifically the
opposite of what he just told us, namely, that the Minister was invited
to speak at a special all-party
committee.</div><a name="07042442000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000393"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I have not misled the Committee in any way. I
will hoy out the letter. On Second Reading, I said that we were setting
up the committee and would invite the Minister to attend. At no point
was it challenged as claiming to be anything other than what the
letter&#151;a copy of which was also sent to the hon.
Gentleman&#151;referred to, which was an impromptu committee. On
Thursday, the Whip in charge of the Bill gave me a list of all the
Labour members of the Bill Committee. Afterwards, I think at 11.22 am,
the letter went out as an e-mail, inviting the hon. Member for Rhondda
and other members of the Committee to the impromptu
committee. Curiously, at business questions, which started some eight
minutes later, I gather that the hon. Gentleman mentioned that he had
received the letter and referred to me by name. When the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>Gentleman was challenged by the Speaker about whether he had mentioned
to me that I would be named, he said that he had been trying to get
hold of my office all
morning.</div><a name="07042442000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000394"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="07042442000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000395"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I will in a
minute.</div><a name="07042442000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
rather strange, given that the letter arrived by e-mail only some eight
minutes before business questions and my office had no record of
receiving any calls from the hon. Gentleman, having been manned since
7.30 that
morning.</div><a name="07042442000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000396"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): Will the hon. Gentleman
give
way?</div><a name="07042442000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000397"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I will give way to all hon. Members in a tick. I
do not understand why there seems to be a fuss about a committee that
was set up informally on an impromptu basis for the purpose of better
informing everyone involved with the Mental Health Bill about our
proceedings. I think that the Minister wanted to intervene first. I
shall then give way to the hon. Member for Norwich,
North.</div><a name="07042442000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000398"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am anxious to ensure that our
deliberations take place with an attitude of tolerance and free
exchange. At the moment, we are discussing a motion on written evidence
that may be submitted before the last sitting of the Committee. I do
not want to become bogged down at this stage in the finer detail of how
and why the event under discussion has happened. The hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham has given what seemed a fairly clear
explanation of how, why and who was involved in the matter, and related
it to a statement made on Second Reading. I do not want to spend undue
time going through the detail now. If such questions are essential, I
shall go along with them for the moment, but we are absorbing an undue
amount of time in what is a tight programme; 12 sittings have been
allocated, and we shall have a lot to
accommodate.</div><a name="07042442000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000399"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Bearing in mind absolutely what you have just
said, Mr. Cook, I wanted to intervene on the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham to say that written evidence is extremely
important, but that I was a little concerned about the impressions
given to organisations because of his letter inviting me to</div>
<a name="07042442000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be the first witness at the
special all-party committee we have
convened&#148;.</div><a name="07042442000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not want
organisations to feel that I had not gone to a formal Committee of the
House, which was the impression that had been
given.</div><a name="07042442000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000400"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is a fair
point.</div><a name="07042442000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000401"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Norwich,
North.</div><a name="07042442000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000402"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> My concern is not about whether we hear the best
evidence and all the evidence that is available, but that we must
contain that evidence within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>a room such as this where we can discuss it openly with each other. To
set up another committee or all-party mental health group seems to
undermine the work of this Committee. I feel that deeply. If we want to
play at silliness, we can start taking trips around every mental health
hospital in this country, Russia and the rest of the world. We do not
want to get into that. If we can get evidence from other places, fine.
We do not need to set up other committees that seem to undermine the
work of this Committee. Bring the evidence to us; we shall look at it
and argue about it. If we, as a Committee, think that we need to have
someone to inform us about matters because we do not understand issues
or argue about them, I accept that. What the hon. Gentleman has been
talking about smacks of undermining the work of this
Committee.</div><a name="07042442000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000403"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Loughton, you have made your
point clearly. Can we move on with the
motion?</div><a name="07042442000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000404"></a>Tim

Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): As a member of the
scrutiny Committee, I should like to mention one of the useful things
about yesterday&#146;s meeting. The scrutiny Committee made a great
many recommendations to Government in response to the draft Bill, Just
about every salient recommendation was rejected by the Government, but
they have now been reinstated in the Bill in another place.
Revisitingthe evidence base in the light of those changed
circumstances was therefore extremely constructiveand
helpful.</div><a name="07042442000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

Doug Naysmith</b> (Bristol, North-West) (Lab/Co-op): It is a
great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once more,
Mr. Cook. I understand that you want to move on, but I would
grateful if you would let me say a word or two, because of the
reference to the scrutiny Committee. I think that I am the only
Government Committee member who was also a member of the scrutiny
Committee. I received two invitations to the meeting yesterday: as a
former member of the scrutiny Committee and as a member of this
Committee.</div><a name="07042442000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
disingenuous, to say the least, to suggest that Committee members
missed a huge amount by not attending the meeting yesterday. Setting up
the meeting struck me almost as a political game to try to trip up
Labour Committee members. I understand, Mr. Cook, that you
do not want remarks like that to be made. I shall try to restrain
myself. However, I have never, ever&#151;I am not allowed to mention
people in the audience, so I apologise&#151;had more information
supplied for a Bill than we have been supplied with over the past few
months by the organisations that have been sending it in, since before
Second Reading. The pile of papers is so high. I have read much of that
evidence carefully. In fact, I read most of it when I was a member of
the scrutiny Committee. There is no lack of evidence for Committee
members to read. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>not saying that it is a bad thing for people to talkto
Conservative Members. However, it is clear thatwe have plenty
of stuff to go on. There is loads of
information.</div><a name="07042442000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000407"></a>The

Loughton:</b> Perhaps I can rise to speak without any hon.
Member trying to intervene on
me.</div><a name="07042442000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall bring my
comments to a close by saying that at no juncture was there any
intention to mislead the Minister, Committee members or the House about
the nature of what was happening yesterday. The letter that went out to
the hon. Member for Rhondda and all other Committee members
said:</div><a name="07042442000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
our intention to make this impromptu committee cross-party and involve
Members of both
Houses.&#148;</div><a name="07042442000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Invitations went
out on that basis to all the people I have mentioned and to others who
had been involved in the House of Lords&#151;small parties as
well&#151;who we thought could contribute. We would have welcomed
greatly the input of Labour Members with relevant expertise. There was
never any intention to mislead. I cannot see what the problem is with
an extra piece of research being discussed, particularly on the subject
of community treatment orders, by the authors of the report. They took
questions and debated with another witness who took issue with some of
their findings. That was exceedingly helpful. That facility was not
available to any Members of the House of Lords at any point during
their deliberations on the Bill. Therefore, hon. Members being part of
the deliberations yesterday could surely only improve the
process.</div><a name="07042442000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to make it clear that we will make the transcript of yesterday&#146;s
proceedings, which those who attended seemed to think was
useful&#151;all the witnesses were grateful for the opportunity to
put their case, wherever it came from&#151;available to all Committee
members as soon as it is prepared. I hope that we can submit it
formally to the Committee to be included in the <i class="I">Hansard</i>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000415"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We will now begin to consider the Bill
proper.</div>
<a name="07042442000008"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4><a name="07042442000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Removal
of categories of mental
disorder</div><a name="07042442000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="07042442000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000416"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I want to take the opportunity to ask the Minister a
few questions. I understand that the new definition of &#147;mental
disorder&#148; is a heck of a lot better than what was in the Mental
Health Act 1983. Having read that Act with care, I do not object to the
change. The new definition is more colloquial and less misleading. The
previous one dwelt on behavioural issues and confused a number of
causally quite different conditions.</div>
<a name="07042442000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically, under the
definition, &#147;mental disorder&#148; appears to be something
that results from illness rather than from any structural impairment of
the brainor genetic deficiency. It is very helpful to draw
that distinction. Lord Rix in the House of Lords was particularly
pleased to see references to mental impairment disappear.</div>
<a name="07042442000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">One assumes that by
&#147;mental disorder&#148; one simply means the
common neuroses; the psychoses, of which the symptoms are normally
delusory states or hallucinations; bipolar disorder; personality
disorder, which is understood in a wider context; and psychopathy.
There are certain organic conditions, such as Korsakov psychosis and
the like, which are definitely a consequence of the structural
impairment of the brain in one way or another. Are they included in the
definition of mental disorder? After all, we are not in an area in
which there is absolute clarity. Even now, there are debates about
whether schizophrenia is one condition or several. If there is a mental
disorder that results from structural damage and is not genetic or
inborn, is that included as a mental disorder in the Bill or
not?</div> <a name="07042442000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
constituent whose behaviour causes great concern. His parents are
extraordinarily worried about him. He cannot get treatment from the
health service because, although his behaviour is aberrant in many
respects, it is a product of physical damage to the brain as a result
of an accident, and not something inborn or a genuine impairment that
he started off life
with.</div><a name="07042442000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000417"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Perhaps it would be helpful if I gave some
background to the clause and explained why we have taken the decision
to abolish the four separate categories of mental disorder, which are
used in parts of the Mental Health Act 1983 as it
stands.</div><a name="07042442000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we have
tried to do with the clause is to simplify the definition, so that we
have a single 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>definition of mental disorder throughout the Bill.
The clause also simplifies, although it does not change the effect of,
that basic definition
to</div><a name="07042442000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any disorder or
disability of the
mind&#148;.</div><a name="07042442000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason why we
wanted to remove the four categories is that they serve no useful
purpose at the moment. They do not help with people getting the
treatment that they need, when using the Act is the only
option left, and they do not protect patients against inappropriate use
of the Act. They are legal and not clinical terms. They do not relate
directly to clinical
diagnoses.</div><a name="07042442000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000418"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think that my intervention will be supportive
of the Minister&#146;s point. Can she give the Committee any evidence
as to where clinical freedom is being inhibited or made more difficult
by the existence of somewhat archaic
distinctions?</div><a name="07042442000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000419"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I certainly will do. As I was saying, the
definitions do not relate directly to clinical diagnoses. What counts
legally as psychopathic disorder goes well beyond what the person in
the street would probably mean by a psychopath, for example.
Clinically, in many ways the legal definitions are a distraction. A
clinician does not need to know which of those categories a
patient&#146;s disorder falls into in order to decide on treatment.
The current law forces the clinician to spend time thinking about the
categories. Importantly, they can also be a legal distraction. Time can
be taken up by tribunals, especially when dealing with restricted
offender patients, who might be trying to gain some advantage by
arguing about classification when it has nothing to do with the risk
posed bytheir disorder or the treatment needed to tackle it.
Obviously, we believe that compulsion should be determined by a
patient&#146;s needs and the degree of risk posed by their disorder,
not by the particular legal label
applied.</div><a name="07042442000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The four
categories in the 1983 Act create arbitrary and unnecessary
distinctions between patients. Also, coming to the points raised by the
hon. Member for Southport and the hon. Member for Daventry, the
categories may leave some patients out entirely from certain parts of
the Act. In other words, patients could be detained for assessment but
not then detained further for the treatment that they need. I should
emphasise that we are talking about a very small number of people here.
There have been some misconceptions that somehow, by changing the
categories, we are widening the number of people who might come under
the detention provisions. That is not the case. A very limited number
of people are not covered by the current &#147;disorders&#148;;
they almost certainly include certain mental disorders arising from
brain injuries acquired in adulthood. That may be the difficulty to
which the hon. Member for Southport
referred.</div><a name="07042442000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000420"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The Minister&#146;s contributions are very
helpful. Is it fair to say that the &#147;mental disorders&#148;
described by the Bill do not match any particular set of clinical
diagnoses, but are simply what psychiatrists at any one time in our
culture define as a mental disorder?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="07042442000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000421"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. There are certain
guidelines and international classifications of mental disorder, but
essentially he is right that there is clinical discretion. It cannot be
said that something that is not in any classification is not a mental
disorder.</div><a name="07042442000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="07042442000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, to
expand on some points about those small numbers who may not be covered,
there may also be certain types of personality disorder that would not
legally be mental illness but do not meet the current definition of
psychopathic disorder, as they do not result in seriously irresponsible
or abnormally aggressive conduct. Even so, to go back to the cases that
the hon. Gentleman has raised, such a disorder could cause the person
concerned great suffering&#151;serious enough to make serious
self-harm or suicide a real possibility. Therefore, in practice, I
suspect the reality is that people are found ways of getting that
treatment. I am sure that there are some people who would say,
&#147;Well, somebody can be put under that category&#148;. However,
given that we are trying to improve and to modernise our legislation,
it is important to take this opportunity of having real clarity
here.</div>
<a name="07042442000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000422"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> With regard to psychopathy, I understand that that
term is becoming almost clinically unfashionable. It is being replaced
by &#147;personality disorder&#148;, in much the same way that
manic depression was replaced by bipolar disorder. As a result of the
amendments, will the term psychopathy retain any legal significance or
value whatever in legislation?</div>
<a name="07042442000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000423"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> No, it will not.</div>
<a name="07042442000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also assure the
Committee that there has been a general welcome for the changes that we
are considering in clause 1. There is general agreement that these
legal categories have not necessarily contributed anything particular
to treatment or care and, again, for the small number of people who are
excluded, it is important to have clarity.</div>
<a name="07042442000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000424"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Minister mentioned just now that the
new definitions will not broaden the net. However, is it not the case
that the new definition covers all the diagnoses listed in the
international classification of diseases 10&#151;some of which
eventhe Government acknowledge may be appropriate for
compulsory powers&#151;and that nothing in the Bill confines the
definition to the conditions listed in ICD 10 or the American
diagnostic manual?</div>
<a name="07042442000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000425"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> No. As I have said, there are international
classifications. That does not mean that those are the only things that
can be counted as mental disorders. Clinicians can make diagnoses. I
emphasise that, within the Mental Health Act 1983, there is the obvious
ability to appeal to a tribunal. First, though, two doctors have to
agree that a mental disorder is present. If that is disputed&#151;if
the patient believes that they have no mental disorder&#151;they can
take it to a mental health tribunal to challenge
it.</div>
<a name="07042442000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000426"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> In the regulatory impact assessment for this
proposal, the Government outlined the risks and benefits and I note
that the Minister does not regard that there will be any additional
costs as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>result of a change in this part of the law. Does she
not think that advocating the opportunities for appeal and tribunals
will mean that there will be more challenges, which will have a cost
impact? I raise that matter because this change, and what its
consequences may be, has been sadly neglected in the regulatory impact
assessment. If the funding is not there, the safety blanket that she
has just described will not be met, through lack of
resources.</div>
<a name="07042442000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000427"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am sorry, but the hon. Lady may have
misunderstood what I was saying. I was simply pointing that, if a
patient disagrees&#151;it is important for them to have those
rights&#151;and if they feel that they do not have a mental disorder
and want to challenge that, they can appeal to the tribunal.
Personally, I think that it would be difficult to start saying,
&#147;Let&#146;s not talk about the tribunal, in case people start
appealing to it&#148;. I am simply saying that that is the path which
people would
follow.</div><a name="07042442000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000428"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> My colleague may also want to intervene on the
Minister but, to put a gloss on my interpretation of what she said, it
seems self-evident that, if one is making more flexible the definition
of mental disorder, a larger number of people in the population, albeit
a small number, will be susceptible to the provisions of the Mental
Health Act and will therefore be able to avail themselves personally of
the appeal mechanisms of the Act. My hon. Friend the Member for
Tiverton and Honiton made a point about the resource implications. I
make no judgment as to its merits, but it requires an answer at
least.</div><a name="07042442000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000429"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member
for Tiverton and Honiton to my previous comments about restrictive
patient offenders. One of the current difficulties is when people argue
in front of the tribunal about the classification into which they have
been placed. I want to turn matters the other way round. At present, a
tribunal&#146;s time can be taken up arguing about the classification
of people and, thus, by removing the false categories, we are more
likely to increase the tribunal
time.</div><a name="07042442000146"></a>

moment&#151;but I wish to pressthe Minister about the fact
that, listed under the Government&#146;s risk option 2&#151;the
recommendation for a single definition of mental disorder&#151;they
identify the new appropriate treatment test. It will ensure that an
holistic assessment is carried out in each case. I do not disagree with
that. Of course, it is a good thing, but surely there are resource
implications in such an
approach.</div><a name="07042442000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000431"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am not quite sure of the hon. Lady&#146;s
point. If we remove the present categories and less tribunal time is
spent arguing about the categories, other parts of the Act have to kick
in, as they do at the moment. It is absolutely right that appropriate
medical treatment is available and that it is part of the conditions of
detention. Half of the Opposition&#146;s argument is that, under the
Government&#146;s proposals, people will not receive treatment.
However, now the hon. Lady is arguing that people will receive too much
treatment under the Government&#146;s
proposals.</div>

little further. She seems to be suggesting that, because we are
changing the definition of mental disorder, each disorder in the ICD 10
list&#151;a long list, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham said&#151;would suddenly fall under the Act and therefore
everyone might be up for detention. The truth is that the vast majority
of those several different layers, both organic and other conditions
that are termed in the ICD 10 list as mental disorders, would not be
recommended for detention at
all.</div><a name="07042442000152"></a>

Browning:</b> I am raising matters that areon the
record in the Government&#146;s own impact assessments under the
heading &#147;risks of option 2&#148;. They themselves have
identified those risks. I am challenging the Minister because I am not
convinced that she has fully estimated in the regulatory impact
assessment the resource implications of the changes. If those changes
have not been properly calculated within the regulatory impact
assessment, there will be long delays for people wanting to access
those parts of the Bill. She herself has identified the
risk.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000438"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b><b class="B"> </b>I want to emphasise that we have
undertaken the regulatory impact assessment. We believe it to be
accurate, and I think that there are lots of counter-balances in that
regard. The hon. Lady says that by advocating tribunals, one increases
the costs. I would also say, as I have said before, that by reducing
the categories, one spends less time quarrelling about them in
tribunals.</div>

Coffey</b> (Stockport) (Lab): Is my understanding correct? The
category of mental disorder has not been extended. All that has
happened is that the two categories of mental disorder and psychopathic
disorder, which were in the 1983 Act, have been brought together under
the one category of mental disorder, with the term psychopathic
disorder being omitted. Therefore, there is not a new definition of
mental disorder. That is my understanding. I do not see why there
should be any more resource implications than in the 1983
Act.</div>

disorder&#146;.</div><a name="07042442000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
pleased to speak to the amendment, which is supported by my colleagues.
The subject has been discussed in the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee and also in another place. The amendment seeks to add
autistic spectrum disorders to those areas that have been modified to
accommodate the needs of people with learning disabilities. The
Minister and I have shared many a conversation about the matter. I am
very grateful that she has agreed to discuss it again on Thursday
privately.</div><a name="07042442000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to use the opportunity of moving the amendment to clarify the
reason why the issue is so important. I should begin by declaring my
interest as the vice-president of the National Autistic Society. I also
hold positions on other related autism charities.</div>
<a name="07042442000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendment is
to ensure that people with autistic spectrum disorders are recognised
in the way that the amended Bill now recognises learning disability. I
am familiar with the Government arguments, both in another place and
elsewhere, about their reluctance to draw up a list of conditions that
are exceptions to the rule. However, given the background on learning
disability&#151;its recognition in the Bill and the way in which it
is dealt with in the 1983 Act, which I will mention in a
moment&#151;this is a special
case.</div><a name="07042442000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the Minister has heard a lot of special pleading from people who are
concerned about a range of disabilities and believe that there is a
case forthose to be recognised in a Bill, rather than ignored
altogether or tucked into a code of practice. However, I want to make a
case for making a special exception for autistic spectrum disorders.
There are many reasons for that, not just because I have an interest in
the
subject.</div><a name="07042442000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000442"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that, notwithstanding
my less extensive experience of such conditions, this is a particularly
sensitive matter and certain people with autistic spectrum disorders
may be rather high performers, whether they have Asperger&#146;s
syndrome, and may not, in some definitions&#151;including locally, in
my experience&#151;be regarded as learning disabled on account of
that? However, both in terms of some of their social behaviour and
their need for social support, such people are clearly in this
category, without being mentally disabled in any
sense.</div><a name="07042442000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000443"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> My hon. Friend is right. A diagnosis of an ASD
does not mean that someone has a mental disorder, but we all recognise
that there can be a multiple diagnosis. For example, a person with ASD
can have a learning disability and can&#151;frequently,they
do&#151;have a recognised mental illness. Sometimes people have a
combination of all three things: a triple diagnosis is not unknown.
Cases can be complicated and often difficult for the professional
psychiatric services to understand properly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="07042442000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to put on record
the concern of the National Autistic Society, which understands the
need for a clearer definition of a mental disorder. I do not think that
there is any disagreement about that. However, it is concerned that,
because of the changes and the lack of recognition of how ASD presents
itself&#151;and our greater knowledge of it now, compared to when we
legislated on mental health in 1983&#151;more people with an ASD
could be inappropriately
detained.</div><a name="07042442000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain to
be convinced by the Governmentthat there is a case for people
with an ASD being compulsorily detained for treatment if they are not
mentally ill or, in the context of the clause, they do not
exhibit</div><a name="07042442000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally
aggressive or seriously
irresponsible&#148;</div><a name="07042442000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">behaviour.
That is why the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the draft
Bill, of which I was a member, identified ASDs, in addition to the
exclusion for learning disability, as the one condition to which we
felt that the Government should pay due regard. We took evidence from a
lot of people, representing those with a range of quite legitimate
conditions, who made that case. However, autism, which is a complex
condition, is different and I should like to explain why that is
so.</div> <a name="07042442000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Autism is a
lifelong disability. It is a developmental disorder and is not
something that people catch. We do not know yet what causes it,
although there is a lot of research being undertaken in this area, but
we know that, although it is different in every individual, it presents
with three core deficiencies that have a huge impact on people&#146;s
lives and
behaviour.</div><a name="07042442000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Autism
leads to a lack of understanding of social behaviour and problems
making social relationships. I am putting this in layman&#146;s
language, rather than talking about what we sometimes call the triad of
impairment, which is language that just floats over people&#146;s
heads. For children, that can mean failing to make friends in the
playground. Going to a school for children with autism and seeing them
at play time is quite a shocking thing. One does not see, as normal,
children running around, interacting and playing with each other, or
creating any imaginative play. Lack of imagination, of an ability to
put oneself in somebody else&#146;s mindset, is part of the triad of
impairment. Children in such a school at play time will either stare
into the middle distance or be preoccupied with repetitive
behaviours.</div><a name="07042442000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000444"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend recall that one of the
celebrated books written by someone who was subject to an
Asperger&#146;s definition was entitled &#147;A Martian in the
Playground&#148;, which makes her
point?</div><a name="07042442000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000445"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Indeed. I began by talking about children
because it is perhaps the one area in which in the past 10 to 15 years
we have started to make some progress. I am not complacent, but we have
started to give recognition in our education system and through social
services departments. First, early diagnosisis important; the
Minister will know how early intervention is key after picking up the
symptoms and signs of autism. Early intervention and management of the
condition are extremely important. Managementof the condition
very often depends on appropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>resources being available, but certainly in the education scenario we
are in a very different position from that in 1983,
when the previous Mental Health Bill was drafted. I am old enough to
remember that
personally&#151;</div><a name="07042442000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000446"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Surely
not.</div><a name="07042442000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000447"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> My hon. Friend is most kind, but sometimes it is
better to be older and have a longer
memory.</div><a name="07042442000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us recall
that excellent report by Baroness Warnock in the late 1970s, which
looked at the way in which we educate children with learning
disabilities. Back in the early 1970s it was not unknown for children
with learning disabilities, which would have included a wide body of
children with autism, not to be considered suitable for education at
all. The ground-breaking Warnock report led to education legislation
that started to introduce the statementing process and to the formal
recognition in statute of the rights of children with a learning
disability to receive an education appropriate to their ability to
receive it. That was within the lifetime of most of us in this room,
but at the same time as the Mental Health Act 1983 was being drafted.
So, I can fully understand why&#151;although we have a better
knowledge of learning disability per se than back in 1983, when the
Mental Health Act was being drafted&#151;we were only at that point
just getting to grips with how we handle the education of children with
a learning disability, which would have included
autism.</div><a name="07042442000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000448"></a><b class="B">Meg
Hillier</b> (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op): It is
a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I am
very interested in what the hon. Lady has to say&#151;I have been an
advocate for a relative with a learning disability, so it is an area
that greatly interests me. I wonder whether the hon. Lady can answer a
couple of
questions.</div><a name="07042442000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, how
many people with autistic spectrum disorders have been detained under
the Mental Health Act 1983? Secondly, is she not effectively arguing
against the amendment? She is saying that our understanding of autism
is so much greater nowadays that the idea of a psychiatrist considering
anyone with autism to have a mental disorder is as remote as their
considering someone with a learning disability to have a mental
disorder. Back in 1983 there would perhaps have been more argument to
have included autistic spectrum disorder in the
Bill.</div><a name="07042442000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000449"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> The point that I am trying to make, which I hope
to expand, is that because our understanding is so much
greater&#151;I am beginning with children, but I will move on to
adolescents and adults&#151;we should be looking at the mental health
legislation in a totally different way to how we looked at it in
1983.</div><a name="07042442000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked me how many people had been detained. There have been two bigger
pieces of research recently, one by the National Autistic Society and
the other a report, from which I will quote in a moment, by the Royal
College of Psychiatrists. We know the figures for people with an
identified autistic spectrum disorder who come within the criminal
court system. However, a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>huge number of people in our prisons almost certainly have an ASD. We
are looking at that as a body of work at present. There is a big debate
to be had about how appropriate it is for such people to go into the
criminal justice system. It is difficult to put a number on it in
quantifiable terms.</div> <a name="07042442000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that this has been put to the Minister before, but can she
identify the number of people with an ASD diagnosis who are deemed
potentially dangerous and therefore cannot be treated in the Bill in
the same way as those with a learning disability? At the moment, we
have seen only the tip of the iceberg in terms of adults; as you go up
the age scale, the available statistics are certainly fewer and fewer.
We still have a great many people in the latter half of their lives who
are in the community but as yet undiagnosed. Not until they come before
the criminal justice system, or until there is a huge breakdown in
their mental health, or social services suddenly become involved with
them for some reason are these individual cases picked up. The figures
are not collected so we do not know the exact number, but it is
severely underestimated at present.</div>
<a name="07042442000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000450"></a>Meg
Hillier:</b> Does the hon. Lady really fear that people with
autistic spectrum disorders will be detained under this Mental Health
Bill? Does she want ASD included for completeness&#146; sake, or is
there a realthreat that a psychiatrist would have such a lack
of understanding of the seriousness and the range of such disorders
that they would section or recommend sectioning somebody, rather than
recognising that the person had autism?</div>
<a name="07042442000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000451"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Yes, I do believe that there is such a threat. I
raised the first Adjournment debate in this House on Asperger&#146;s
syndrome a few years ago, and followed it up the next year with one on
the psychiatric treatment of people with Asperger&#146;s. Indeed, I
thoroughly welcomed the 2005 report of the Royal College of
Psychiatrists. It is absolutely essential that the professionals get to
grips with that condition, of which there has been only a restricted
understanding until now. The point that the hon. Lady just raised is my
point exactly. However, there are more complexities to it, and I am
coming to them.</div> <a name="07042442000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that ASD should be recognised alongside learning disability
under clause 2. We are not trying to prevent people with an autistic
spectrum disorder from receiving appropriate mental health services
nor, for that matter, are we saying that they should never be detained
since, like the rest of the population, in certain circumstances they
would need the security of detention. There are behaviours associated
with ASDs that do not have a psychotic base but are normal and
triggered by events.</div>
<a name="07042442000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to a particular example.
Later on, in part 2, we will deal with how the Government are going to
deal with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to take account of the decision
of the European Court of Human Rights in the Bournewood case. We should
not forget what Bournewood was about. It involved an adult man named HL
with an autistic spectrum disorder&#151;a gentleman whom I have met.
It was quite clear that the episode leading to his detention was
event-triggered rather than an underlying psychosis. His carers had the
perseverance to take the case through every court in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>this country and eventually to the European Court of Human Rights, and
as a result the Minister will now amend the law to ensure that the
experience of HL is not replicated and that there is more protection in
future legislation for people in his position. I, of course, support
that and I hope to contribute to that process of amendment when we
reach that clause of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="07042442000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="07042442000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
personally heard first-hand accounts about how HL went from a day
centre to being detained for a very long time, to his detriment,
without the people who knew him best having an opportunity to explain
to medical professionals why it would have been, in their view, normal
behaviour for him to have presented in the way in which he did when an
event triggered an episode. I remind the Minister that that is how,
very often, even the most able people on the end of the spectrum can
behave in a different set of
circumstances.</div><a name="07042442000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">So what
is autism and why is it different? We know from the figures that, of
the population of working age, there are about 330,000 people with
autism. Of course, there are more children with autism coming through
and people often ask why autism is more prevalent today. Personally, I
believe that it is because we are much more aware of it, have a greater
knowledge of it and there is more early diagnosis.</div>
<a name="07042442000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have mentioned the fact that
we have had a history of late diagnosis, but why is that? It is because
autism is a spectrum. If we examine our early understanding of
autism&#151;that is what the Mental Health Act 1983 would have
considered&#151;we see that Kanner identified autism in 1943. The
Kanner definition of autism influenced psychiatric understanding in
this country for some years, although it was not until the 1960s that
there was much recognition of the distinction between autism and other
conditions. Perhaps more prevalent in recent years has been the
understanding of Asperger&#146;s syndrome, which is on the more able
end of the spectrum. Asperger identified Asperger&#146;s syndrome at
about the same time in the 1940s as Kanner defined autism, but it was
never really recognised, and it was not part of psychiatric teaching
and training until very
recently.</div><a name="07042442000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
strange combination of an autistic spectrum disorder with that triad of
impairment that leads to the very distinct diagnosis that is an
autistic diagnosis. However, in the case of Asperger&#146;s syndrome,
it means that there can be people who present who are extremely able
indeed. In fact, from an educational perspective, many can go on to
university degree level, so that gives an idea for the range of
abilities. Indeed, I have been told by the faculties of some of the
Oxford colleges that most of their mathematics and physics departments
are well populated with people who might have, or who might be
diagnosed with, Asperger&#146;s syndrome. There is nothing
detrimental about
that.</div><a name="07042442000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, if
we consider some of the footage that we have seen of the people who
cracked the Nazi codes in the UK during world war two, I recall seeing
what looked like an amusing piece of footage. It showed someone who was
intelligent enough to crack the codes but who would also, every
afternoon at four o&#146;clock, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>walk down through the grounds of the HQ to the lake, carrying his cup of
tea, drink his cup of tea and then throw the teacup and saucer into the
lake. That was repeated on a regular
basis.</div><a name="07042442000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such behaviour,
one might think, is idiosyncratic, so where is the depth of concern
about that? However, I would say that that is just one example. I will
give another example, again of my own experience&#151;in fact, there
are myriad examples&#151;of a gentleman who lived, undiagnosed, with
his parents into his 40s. When the second parent died, he was left in
the house on his own, completely unsupported, for the first time ever.
It was only at that point that he really came to the attention of the
social services department. The reason that he came to their attention
was because he never went out of the house; the neighbours had seen him
a little, but he had never given them any cause for concern. However,
after his second parent died, the neighbours noticed, to their great
concern, that after it got dark he was to be seen digging up the garden
by torchlight. They were concerned that he was burying something,
because they found him to be an odd person to deal with andto
communicate with, and, therefore, reported his behaviour to the social
services department. When the department intervened, it discovered that
he was digging up the garden at night because he had a passionate
interest in gardening but did not like being around other people. He
found that, when it got dark, people did not lean over the fence and
ask, &#147;What are you planting there?&#148;, to which he would
have to find a reply, and communicate and socialise with them.
Therefore, it suited him to maximise his ambition of gardening by doing
it at night. I am pleased to say that I have met that gentleman, who is
now working under supervision, potting plants in a greenhouse. He has,
therefore, maximised the opportunity to do what he always wanted to
do.</div><a name="07042442000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">On first sight,
some of the people who present in what may seem to society to be an odd
way are intelligent and have other abilities. Despite the idiosyncrasy
of that particular episode, in other circumstances, that gentleman
could present himself as someone who has the capacity to express a view
about what he wants to
do.</div><a name="07042442000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000452"></a><b class="B">Ann
Coffey</b>: The hon. Lady is making a good case for more
knowledge about, and understanding of, autism. In relation to this
Bill, she seems to be concerned that those who are autistic will be
diagnosed as having a mental disorder and could be detained in hospital
against their will. However, I am not clear about how making an
exemption will help. If the assessing psychiatrist does not diagnose
people as autistic in the first place, any exemption on the face of the
Bill for autism will not protect them. Surely the way forward is to
ensure that the psychiatrists who undertake mental health admissions
have as extensive a knowledge of autism as possible at the point of
assessment.</div><a name="07042442000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000453"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> The hon. Lady has made a good point, and
psychiatrists&#146; knowledge about this group of people is a matter
that I have raised in debate many times. Despite the 2005 report of the
royal college, it remains true that we are fortunate in some of
ourinner cities, as we have a resource of psychiatrists who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>understand autism and who work with people who have
learning disabilities. The run-of-the-mill provincial
psychiatrist&#151;if I may use that terminology&#151;does not
experience enough of these cases to get sufficient working knowledge of
what is and is not appropriate behaviour.</div>
<a name="07042442000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about the Mental
Health Act 1983 does not relate to the sort of situation that I have
just described, involving my gardening friend. I raised that example to
illustrate the breadth of the situation. However, when these people are
in crisis, it is not because they have a mental illness&#151;and if
they have a mental illness, of course they should be entitled to the
same treatment and services as everyone else&#151;but because the
nature of having an autistic spectrum disorder means that many people,
including those with a high intelligence quotient, sometimes present in
a challenging way, or in a way that may be regarded as
inappropriate.</div><a name="07042442000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
point, it would be a good idea to quote from the report of the Royal
College of Psychiatrists, which I have referred to many times. I am
conscious that I have been critical of psychiatrists over the years,
not least because there is a prevalence of people with autistic
spectrum disorders who present in a challenging way being admitted as
in-patients, sometimes even when they have an autistic spectrum
disorder clearly diagnosed by another professional. Psychiatrists
commonly believe that those people have schizophrenia, and all too
often medicate them accordingly. Given the nature of the drugs used to
treat schizophrenia, what happens next is that they start to go through
the list. If the first drug does not work, they move on to the next. By
the time someone is on their fourth or fifth drug, and that still does
not work, it is very difficult to unscramble the situation to get a
clear view of whether the initial or ongoing behaviour is a psychosis,
or whether it is autistic behaviour, which, if they were harming
themselves or others, I quite agree would need
intervention.</div><a name="07042442000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I
may, I would like to quote from a report by the Royal College of
Psychiatrists. It is an excellent report that
indicates why, when these people are inappropriately detained or
brought within the ambit of mental health services inappropriately, it
is not only an injustice in terms of human rights, but is detrimental
to the way in which they recover from the incident that caused it. The
Royal College of Psychiatrists report states
that</div><a name="07042442000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Autistic-spectrum
disorders are not an illness but a disability that can have a major
impact on the development, presentation and management of psychiatric
disturbance.&#148;</div><a name="07042442000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
following point is one that I would particularly like the Minister to
understand, because it explains why those people are different from
other
groups:</div><a name="07042442000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
fall into a limbo between the various psychiatric specialties, their
ability putting them outside learning disability contracts but with
developmental disabilities that, once they have outgrown child and
adolescent services, may be unfamiliar to the various specialties
dealing with adult mental health or else fall outside their remit.
These issues are touched on in the Council report on services for
individuals with mild or borderline learning disability (Royal College
of Psychiatrists, 2003). This report emphasised that the defining
criterion for acceptance by the services provided by learning
disability psychiatry should continue to be a measured overall
intelligence quotient of less than 70. At the same time it recognised
that individuals with an autistic-spectrum disorder were a group who,
at times, might be better served by learning disability
services.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="07042442000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The link with the way in which
such people present is not unfamiliar to people who deal with learning
disabilities, but at the same time you are dealing with people who do
not necessarily have an IQ of under 70. In most cases, if you have an
IQ under 70, you are regarded as being learning
disabled.</div><a name="07042442000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the point that the prevalence
of behaviour and the way in which it is managed is not that far
distanced from learning disability, despite the variation in IQ and
people&#146;s potential, particularly those who are at the
moreable end.</div>
<a name="07042442000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have produced a
White Paper, which I certainly welcome. It is called &#147;Valuing
People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st
Century&#148;. When the Government first produced that paper, because
of the benchmark of an IQ of 70 or under to indicate learning
disabilities, they excluded people with Asperger&#146;s from
accessing services from the social services learning disability teams.
As a result of a number of people&#151;not only me, but a number of
others&#151;jumping up and down when we read this, the Department of
Health then issued a
circular.</div><a name="07042442000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I carry
these documents around with me to this day. Every time I give a talk on
autism, people come up to me afterwards and say, &#147;Let me have a
copy of that Government circular&#148;. I have several copies of
this, which I give out. The Government realised, to their credit, that
to deny people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome the right to access
services through the learning disability team was
doing those people a grave disservice. They put out guidelines that
said:</div> <a name="07042442000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
guidance focuses mainly on action to implement the proposals for
improving the lives of all adults with learning
disabilities&#151;those with severe and profound learning
disabilities through to those with moderate or mild learning
disabilities. Adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning
autism&#148;&#151;</div><a name="07042442000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
with an IQ of over 70, of which there are a great
number&#151;</div><a name="07042442000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are not
precluded from using learning disability services, and may, where
appropriate, require an assessment of their social functioning and
social skills in order to establish their level of
need.&#148;</div><a name="07042442000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, our knowledge of how people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome
function in practice, on a day-to-day basis, is something that we know
far more about now than we did when the Mental Health Act 1983
was drafted. It is also something that the Government have picked up
on, sometimes with a bit of prompting, as they start to legislate in
other
areas.</div><a name="07042442000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="07042442000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Bill
is to last another 20 years, we should consider our knowledge of how
autistic spectrum disorders are managed and how people with an ASD
function in their day-to-day lives, particularly when they come into
contact with services, especially mental health services. We should
recognise that there is a correlation; it is not that people with an
ASD are necessarily learning-disabled, but there is read-across in
respect of how we treat people with a learning disability. The point is
that they are different. They may have an IQ of more than 70, but they
behave differently from how one would expect people with such an IQ to
behave.</div> 
<a name="07042442000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is such behaviour that
unfortunately all too often brings those people into contact with the
mental health services and professionals who do not understand and
cannot disaggregate what I would call normal autistic behaviour and a
psychotic basis for their
behaviour.</div><a name="07042442000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000454"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> The hon. Lady obviously has an intense interest in
the subject and a deep knowledge of it. Having talked to people in the
field, can she speculate about how research work is progressing? Such
research might relate to genetic causes, for example, and might
alleviate some problems. What is likely to happen in that field over
the next 20 years is pertinent, as she
said.</div><a name="07042442000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000455"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> I will send the hon. Gentleman details of an
excellent Medical Research Council paper that deals extensively with
the subject. Having been asked that question, I shall put on record my
view of some of the various theories about the causal basis of autism,
which I have declined to do before, primarily
because&#151;</div><a name="07042442000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000456"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Anxious as I am to maintain the technical
nature of this debate, it is important that we focus our minds on the
points in sequence. We are discussing our ability to include autistic
spectrum disorder in the clause. We will do ourselves a favour if we
concentrate on that, rather than on research which might, or might not,
take place in the future.</div>
<a name="07042442000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000457"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. I will speak to
the hon. Member for Norwich, North privately on the subject as he has
shown such an interest in it. You may have noticed, Mr.
Cook, that I have an interest in it. I frequently feel that I must
apologise for my fixation on it, and for talking about it ad
nauseam.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000459"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Yes, indeed. Many hon. Members know that I have
a 35-year-old with Asperger&#146;s syndrome and I sometimes say
jokingly to other members of my family when they go on too much about
the cricket, for example, &#147;Just remember there is autism in the
family.&#148; I think it has a genetic base.</div>
<a name="07042442000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I move on, Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000461"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> I want to make the case for the Bill to treat
learning disability and ASD in the same light, despite the
differentials in the two conditions, and to move on to the legal
aspects of psychiatry in relation to people who have them. I shall draw
from council report 136 of the Royal College of Psychiatrists entitled,
&#147;Psychiatric services for adolescents and adults with Asperger
syndrome and other autistic-spectrum disorders&#148;, which was
published in April 2006, not 2005 as I said earlier. I very much
welcome the report, which particularly informs this debate. In the
section headed &#147;Legal aspects of psychiatry&#148;, the
psychiatrists
say:</div><a name="07042442000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Most
individuals with autistic-spectrum disorders are keen to avoid trouble
with the law and most do not offend.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="07042442000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is absolutely
right. There is no propensity for them to offend more than the rest of
society. The report continues:</div>
<a name="07042442000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This law-abiding
respect for rules can be offset by a number of predispositional factors
that make the individual more
vulnerable.&#148;</div><a name="07042442000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
vulnerability to such conditions that needs to be recognised as well.
As I mentioned earlier, social naivety and misrepresentation of
relationships can lead such people into problems with the criminal
justice system. The report argues
that</div><a name="07042442000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;misinterpreting
rules, particularly social ones, whereby individuals can find
themselves unwittingly embroiled in
offences&#148;</div><a name="07042442000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">and behaviour
in which they are led on by others has consequences for them with the
criminal justice system. I would also argue that in certain
circumstances their behaviour might well bring them to the attention of
psychiatric services.</div>
<a name="07042442000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular, the report
states that</div><a name="07042442000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;impulsivity,
sometimes violent, that may be a component of a comorbid
attention-deficit disorder, a state of anxiety turning into panic or a
confusing blend of both. The result is a response that is out of
proportion to the
situation&#148;&#151;</div><a name="07042442000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would argue that that was the situation in the detention of HL in the
Bournewood case. For example, what in children could be regarded as a
tantrum, could in an adolescent or adult be believed to be a
threatening episode. That is why it is very difficult to explain what I
mean by normal behaviour. Clearly, nobody wants anyone to be exposed to
a threat, and neither do we want people to self-harm.</div>
<a name="07042442000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">More often than not, however,
such tantrum-like behaviour in adults with autism is event-influenced,
rather than psychotically influenced, as I have said before. I shall
give the Committee an example of how such behaviour might present
itself. We know that people with autism often follow ritualistic
routines. For example, some feel that they must eat at a certain time
of day. I know of one young man who, every Sunday, takes two bus
journeys to eat at the same restaurant. Most of us would get thoroughly
bored with that routine, but for somebody with autism it is a security
indicator&#151;they know that next Sunday will be the same as this
Sunday. If followed, that pattern provides comfort and
security&#151;next Sunday will be
predictable.</div><a name="07042442000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000462"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Some MPs do
that.</div><a name="07042442000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000463"></a>Angela

o&#146;clock in the Members&#146; Dining
Room.</div><a name="07042442000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
predictability might seem pretty benign, but if disrupted by external
circumstances, such people do not just have a tantrum in the same way
as a small child might if deprived of sweets. In the mind of somebody
with autism, such disruption is a major event, and a third party might
interpret their response as out of proportion. However, it is a really
serious matter for the autistic person that totally undermines how they
had reckoned that the day would turn out. As a consequence, for an
adult, their response to something as minor as having their routine
being disrupted in such a way would come across as totally
unreasonable. It is particularly difficult for people with whom the
autistic person does not have a confident relationship&#151;there
will be very few with whom they do&#151;to rationalise and negotiate
their way out of such a situation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000464"></a>Ann
Coffey:</b> It is, of course, terrible that people are
misdiagnosed, whether for physical illnesses or mental health problems,
because there can be a stream of consequences for their treatment that
put them at a disadvantage and make their condition much worse.
However, I do not understand how the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment would
prevent psychiatrists who do not understand autism from diagnosing
somebody, in a mental health assessment, as suffering from a mental
disorder when in fact they suffer from autism. I just cannot see how
the amendment would help. We cannot protect through an exclusion unless
the mental health professional making the assessment understands that
they are dealing with somebody with
autism.</div><a name="07042442000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000465"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> The hon. Lady is right, and that is not actually
the basis of what I am saying. What she has just expounded is exactly
what happens in some cases. Having been critical of psychiatric
services, I must say that I am convinced that the royal college is
getting to grips with the problem through training and so on.</div>
<a name="07042442000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The behaviour of people with
ASD may well have a qualifying basis. If we are to make an exception
for somebody with a learning disability&#151;an IQ of less than
70&#151;unless, as the Bill states, it
is</div><a name="07042442000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;associated with
abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on his
part&#148;,</div><a name="07042442000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">the same should
apply to autism because of the way in which it presents itself. It is
very different from any other condition, except that one can measure it
as a learning disability. There can therefore be quite a read-across,
as interventions for those with learning disabilities can apply
equally, if resources are available, to those with
ASD.</div><a name="07042442000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The royal
college&#146;s report mentions the services for individuals with a
learning disability, and again one can see the comparator used between
how we treat people with learning disabilities and those with autism.
It
states:</div><a name="07042442000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Increasingly,
services for individuals with a learning disability have become
familiar with autistic-spectrum disorders, and where there is a
significant intellectual disability, they are ready to engage with
these individuals. When disturbed, their management is often a matter
of improving communication, their environment and their level of
support rather than of more traditional individual psychiatric
treatment.&#148;</div><a name="07042442000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, as we learn more about the management of people with ASD we can
see some of the lessons that we have learned from the management of
people with learning disabilities. We do not just lock them up when
they are &#147;having an episode&#148; unless, as the Bill states
and I support, they
demonstrate</div><a name="07042442000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally
aggressive or seriously irresponsible
conduct&#148;.</div><a name="07042442000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is
quite a read-across in the management of people. It is not about
locking up people who might suddenly in one way present as potentially
having a mental disorder, because they might not have a mental disorder
any more than does someone with a learning disability who is behaving
in the same way. The test for psychiatrists is to disaggregate the two
set of behaviour, which is why the matter is difficult and there is a
need for specialisms. In some of our hospitals in London and other
large cities there are psychiatrists who specialise in autism or in
learning disabilities, so they can disaggregate types of behaviour and
understand clearly what the appropriate treatment is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="07042442000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The royal college report
continues:</div><a name="07042442000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
issues, while familiar to learning disability psychiatry, also apply to
individuals of normal cognitive ability, although their ability may
well bar their acceptance by an element of the learning disability
service&#148;.</div><a name="07042442000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed that in relation to the Government&#146;s health White
Paper. The report also
states:</div><a name="07042442000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is therefore the risk that such vulnerable patients fall between
contracts despite their statutory entitlement to psychiatric
services&#148;.</div><a name="07042442000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="07042442000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation,
particularly for adults and adolescents who present behaviour that is
treated by psychiatric services, is only as good as the knowledge of
the people treating them. In managing behavioural episodes, it is clear
that although we make allowances for people with learning disabilities,
we do not for people with autism because they do not present in the
same way or because they have a higher IQ.</div>
<a name="07042442000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Psychiatrists understand that
somebody might have great ability in one area of their life but behave
in a certain way because they are autistic, not because they have a
psychiatric condition. That is why we should recognise in the Bill the
fact that that group of people is different. I cannot think of another
group who would present in such a way in certain circumstances
andyet not have a psychotic base. Very often such people
present themselves as intelligent, and despite what people say about
autism, they can be quite articulate&#151;sometimes inappropriately
so. They are different from other sets of people and we should
recognise that.</div><a name="07042442000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is making provisions for the future. It has to look forward and
not simply deal with our assessment of how things are now. We already
recognise in other parts of government that we have a
better understanding of autism than we had 20 years ago, and that
should be reflected in the Bill. The fact that it was not recognised in
the 1983 Act is no argument. We know from the casework around the
country that more and more people will fall within this grouping who
need the attention of services. When it is psychiatric services that
they require, they need more equality, not
less.</div><a name="07042442000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">More and more
cases of people with autism who have been denied access to appropriate
services or treatment are coming before tribunals and the courts. The
HL case is a classic case in point. People are starting to ask
themselves, very often with legal backing, &#147;Is this right in
terms of civil liberties? Is this right in terms of what we understand
these people need and the sort of attention they should be
receiving?&#148; More often than not, particularly when I look at my
social services casework, once one has cut to the chase and challenged
the social services on behalf of someone with autism, they settle out
of court.</div> <a name="07042442000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government would do well to recognise that our knowledge and awareness
of autism and what is and is not an appropriate treatment or package of
support are increasingly such that when we challenge social services,
the courts tend to rule in our favour. The Government should take that
on board, because to deny it at the stage at which legislation is being
introduced is not merely negligent, but a concession that they know
this but are not going to do anything about it. That is indefensible
behaviour towards a vulnerable group of people. All the statistics show
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>as a group they are not an increased risk to other
people, but people who themselves need support and appropriate
services.</div><a name="07042442000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
College of Psychiatrists points out in its report the need to address
inappropriate detention under the mental illness category, detention of
this group in inappropriate settings and detention for longer than is
absolutely necessary. This group of people is already discriminated
against. If that is what psychiatrists identify as the problem,
specifically with regard to the interaction of such people with mental
health services now, surely the Bill should aim to improve their lot in
future. We cannot do anything about the past, but we can do something
about the future. The information is there; it is on the
record.</div><a name="07042442000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
am asking the Minister&#151;colleagues will be pleased to hear that I
am concluding my remarks&#151;to think again about whether those with
an ASD are different. I believe that they are, and I hope that the
examples that I have given show how and why they are and, in
particular, why the Bill, rather than the code of practice, should
associate the appropriate treatment of their needs by mental health
services with the conditions identified for people with learning
disabilities.</div> <a name="07042442000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Stockport identified the need for better and more
specialist services and for better recognition, which is an issue that
I discuss all the time. Although we can do nothing about such issues in
the Bill, we can ensure that it recognises people with ASD, and I
stress that they are people&#151;people who, as a result of whatever
fate has befallen them, will live with this condition for the rest of
their lives. However, although they are born with it and will die with
it, we can make a difference to what happens in between. We need to do
more to improve their quality of life and the way in which they are
treated between the time they are born and the time they die. At the
moment, we are nowhere near getting that
right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000466"></a>The
Chairman:</b> In presenting her amendment so comprehensively
and clearly and with such passion, the hon. Lady obviously had to
compare the particular condition of ASD with many others, and she
therefore expounded on more general matters in the clause. For that
reason, I am happy for the Committee to expand discussion of the
amendment into a clause stand part debate. We shall pick the bones out
of the Divisions
later.</div><a name="07042442000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000467"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b><b class="B"> </b>I support the amendment and pay tribute to
the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton for all the work that she has
done on autism. I noted her example of the man digging the garden in
the dark, and there is nothing essentially pathological about that. The
last time I did it, I was burying the cat, although I should say that
it was dead, and I needed to explain myself to the milkman as he came
past.</div> <a name="07042442000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are learning
that psychiatry is not an exact science, particularly when it comes to
the classification of ailments. I think that we all accept that autism
covers an extraordinarily wide spectrum, but is genuinely a learning
disability. However, it is also linked&#151;this is a key
point&#151;with social disabilities,and sometimes with
disturbed but non-psychotic behaviour. There is therefore a real danger
that it will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>not be treated correctly under the legislation, and there is a real case
for giving it a proper and appropriate mention. Autism, like many
learning disabilities, is essentially hardwired into the soul; it is an
impairment, not an illness. If any form of coercion is required, the
Mental Capacity Act 2005 is available, although Lord Rix in the House
of Lords thought that even that did not give sufficient protection in
every
circumstance.</div><a name="07042442000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady said dual diagnosis was a special problem, but that argument was
less convincing. Dual diagnosis crops up all the time, creating
clinical and legal challenges, but those challenges are the same,
whether we are talking about autism or dementia. None the less, given
the link between ASD and often quite disturbed social behaviour, there
is a case for including it expressly in the Bill, and I support the
amendment.</div>
<a name="07042442000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000468"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I should like to start by paying a warm tribute
to the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, who has put in a lot of
work over the years to advance the cause of people on the autistic
spectrum. As she mentioned on Second Reading, she is vice-president of
the National Autistic Society, and the founder member of the all-party
parliamentary group on autism. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for
the thoughts that had not been put on record before, but that will have
to remain between her and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North.
I look forward to finding out what they actually were.</div>
<a name="07042442000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that it would be
helpful, particularly as the hon. Lady set out so clearly the reasons
why she has moved the amendment, for me to refer back to why there is
the exclusion or exception for learning disability, and why clause 2
exists in the first place. As hon. and right hon. Members know, there
has been a lot of debate about learning disability itself and whether
it should be excluded. Let me go back to what we have now achieved in
terms of the Bill. It will mean that people with learning disabilities
can be detained for medical treatment or made subject to guardianship
on the basis of their learning disabilities alone only if those
disabilities are accompanied by</div>
<a name="07042442000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally aggressive or
seriously irresponsible
conduct&#148;</div><a name="07042442000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">on their part.
Similarly, it will ensure that people with learning disabilities cannot
be made subject to the new provisions for supervised community
treatment solely on account of their learning disabilities, unless,
again, they are associated with</div>
<a name="07042442000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally aggressive or
seriously irresponsible
conduct&#148;</div><a name="07042442000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">on their
part.</div> <a name="07042442000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, that
provision was not in the 2004 draft Bill. In that Bill, which was
submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny, there was no special provision
in relation to learning disability. We started from a
principle&#151;in many senses it is still valid&#151;that
exclusions of any kind were likely to create an arbitrary obstacle to
the proper and effective use of the legislation to protect people from
the effects of the mental disorder. However, we also know that many
people with learning disabilities, and those who work and care for
them, were concerned that that would put people with learning
disabilities at a greater risk of being detained inappropriately. We do
not believe that that is the case, but it is true that historically
this has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>been a very emotive issue, going back to the 1983
Act. There was great concern that people with learning disabilities
could be inappropriately detained, sometimes because of the effect of
their behaviour, which might be seen as not the
norm.</div><a name="07042442000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We listened to
what the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee said with regard to
learning disabilities. When we decided to amend, rather than replace,
the Mental Health Act, we took the opportunity to say that we would
preserve the way in which the Act currently works with regard to
learning disability. That is why we have preserved that provision in
clause
2.</div><a name="07042442000352"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="07042442000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means that
before professionals even begin to think about whether a person whose
only mental disorder is a learning disability meets the criteria for
detention under section 3 and similar sections, they must first be sure
that the disability is associated with</div>
<a name="07042442000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally aggressive or
seriously irresponsible
conduct.&#148;</div><a name="07042442000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reference to aggressive or irresponsible conduct does not suggest that
either is a normal feature of learning disability&#151;quite the
reverse, as I am sure all hon. Members would agree. It is to
distinguish the small minority from the rest. The vast majority of
people with learning disabilities do not display</div>
<a name="07042442000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally aggressive or
seriously irresponsible
conduct&#148;</div><a name="07042442000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">any more than
vast majority of the rest of the
population.</div><a name="07042442000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000469"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Does the Minister agree that, unless it is
event-triggered, nor do people with autistic spectrum
disorders?</div><a name="07042442000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000470"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> That can certainly be the case, and I shall
come to some examples, including that one. I hope that I have helped to
illustrate my point. Obviously,</div>
<a name="07042442000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally aggressive or
seriously irresponsible
behaviour&#148;</div><a name="07042442000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">is not a
clinical concept, but it is something that we understand.</div>
<a name="07042442000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also true&#151;again,
this goes back to the history of the previous Mental Health
Act&#151;that some people believe strongly that learning disability
should not be labelled a mental disorder, both on principle and for
fear of exacerbating confusion between learning disability and mental
illness. Again, that is often
raised.</div><a name="07042442000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are clear
that the Bill is not about labelling people but about treating people
when necessary. I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that if people with
learning difficulties were excluded entirely from the definition, that
would risk the very small minorityof those people who need
compulsion not getting treatment when they need it; or it would
meanthat clinicians would end up sometimes applying
inappropriate diagnostic labels to ensure that people who need
treatment receive it. Again, if we did that, when a learning disabled
person committed a serious offence, the courts might have no
alternative but to pass a prison sentence. That is why learning
disability remains a mental disorder for the purpose of the Bill
generally.</div><a name="07042442000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were
many detailed and sometimes emotive and sensitive discussions about
learning disability. There was no exclusion in the 2004 draft Bill, but
we listened to representations, and a key issue that will apply to many
of our discussions in Committee is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>we have tried in many instances to retain what is in the 1983 Act. In
the case of learning disability, that means that we are maintaining the
status quo. We listened to many of the people who said that they would
be uneasy about removing it in case it sent the wrong
message.We do not believe that it would have done, but
wehave listened and we understand the point. We are
maintaining the status quo with regard to learning
disabilities.</div><a name="07042442000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s amendment would add to that the condition of autistic
spectrum disorder. We are not in favour of it for the reasons that I
shall set out. I assure her that I have looked carefully at the
amendment because of the many points she has made not onlyin
Committee, but elsewhere, about some of the difficulties in diagnosis
and the need to ensure that we improve the care available to people
with autistic spectrum disorder. She is absolutely right to say that
there have been improvements, but that there is still some way to go.
One of the key issues that she put her finger on was
diagnosis.</div><a name="07042442000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
maintained the general stance that the fewer exclusions in the Bill,
the better, because the risk of exclusions is always that someone who
perhaps needs treatment will not get it. We want to hold to that
general principle because each time an exclusion is added, someone will
be at risk of not receiving treatment. The hon. Lady rightly said that
others could well make the same case. I am thinking particularly of
people with hyper-activity or obsessive compulsive disorders. The same
could be said about people with such conditions, so it is difficult for
us to pick out a particular group of people and say that we will add
their condition to the Bill because others would be well justified to
say, &#147;Why not this as well?&#148; I have even heard it said
that some people with depression might ask whether their condition
should be
excluded.</div><a name="07042442000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
first reason why we do not want to accept the amendment. The hon. Lady
was right to refer to some of the discussions that took place when
the 1983 Act was drafted. People generally did not understand
the full extent of autistic spectrum disorder,
particularly Asperger&#146;s syndrome, and some of the other higher
functioning forms of autism. I am sure that we all agree that there is
now a far wider and better understanding of autistic spectrum disorder
than there was in 1983. The hon. Lady is probably aware of a paper
byDr. Lorna Wing. It was published in 1981, so by 1983 it had
not really received the widespread respect that it enjoys today. It is
also true that all forms of autism are now widely recognised as
disorders of the
mind.</div><a name="07042442000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000471"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> I wonder whether the Minister would rephrase
that description as being a disorder of the brain rather than the mind?
There is a
difference.</div><a name="07042442000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000472"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I am more than happy to write to the hon. Lady
about it, but I am strongly advised that the condition is a disorder of
the mind.</div><a name="07042442000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady rightly referred to the fact that it is only possible to detain
people when strict conditions are met. The application for assessment
is used when an individual is suffering from a mental disorder of a
nature or degree that warrants his detention in hospital 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>for assessment, or for assessment followed by medical
treatment for at least a limited period. Under the
Government&#146;s proposals there is an additional stipulation that
the patient must be one who ought to be detained in the interests of
his own health or safety or with a view to the protection of
others.</div> <a name="07042442000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
position on assessment. Under section 3, which is concerned with
detention, an application for treatment may be made on the basis that a
patient is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree that
makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment in a
hospital, or that it is necessary for the health and safety of the
patient or for the protection of others that he should receive such
treatment. There is a further condition that detention under the
section is required for the provision of such treatment and that
appropriate medical treatment is available.</div>
<a name="07042442000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes that the Government
are proposing under section 3 in relation to appropriate medical
treatment, and the link between that treatment and individual
circumstances, will enhance the care that is available, and in that way
will help with some of the points that the hon. Lady made about
inappropriate treatment. I hope that that gives some reassurance with
regard to the very valid points that she made about ensuring that
people are diagnosed early and that they receive appropriate
treatment.</div>
<a name="07042442000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000473"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Obviously, I accept that thereare
people with an ASD for whom detention may sometimes be the appropriate
route. Detention is traumatic for anybody, however, particularly for
those with an ASD, because it involves a change in routine, environment
and so on. I hope that the Minister will consider what the royal
college has said about alternatives to detention for such people,
because detention often compounds the
problem.</div><a name="07042442000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000474"></a>Ms
Rosie Winterton:</b> I shall give way to the hon. Member for
Southport before
responding.</div><a name="07042442000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000475"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Pugh</b>: I understood the hon. Member for Tiverton and
Honiton to be suggesting that there was a danger that autism could be
undifferentiated from various forms of mental illness. She sought to
highlight autism and put, it in a sense, alongside learning disability.
Is the Minister now proposing that autism is both a learning disability
and a mental disorder, because that seems to be the case? If so, how
does the clause deal with
it?</div><a name="07042442000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000476"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Autism is recognised as a mental disorder, as
is learning disability. However, even at the time of the 1983 Act it
was felt important that, although learning disability is a disorder,
the message should not be given that everyone with a learning
disability might be detained. There was strong discussion at the time
between Lord Rix and David
Ennals.</div><a name="07042442000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000477"></a>Dr.
Gibson:</b> One of the previous MPs for Norwich,
North.</div><a name="07042442000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000478"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Indeed. The wording that was arrived at to
reflect those discussions was, I believe, dictated down the phone by
Lord Rix to David Ennals. Those were the good old days. We have
decided, for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>reasons that have been raised again, that in a sense it is
important to keep what was in the Act at thetime, because that
is reassuring for people in those
circumstances.</div><a name="07042442000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="07042442000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000479"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> For absolute clarity, what is being said is that
although there are some learning disabilities that may or may not be
mental disorders, autism is a learning disability that, in whatever
form it takes or however severe it is&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>It
is a mental
disorder.</div><a name="07042442000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000480"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As I understand it&#151;I am sure that the
hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton will help me out&#151;learning
disability is a mental disorder. Autism is a mental disorder, but
autism arrives because of behavioural
development.</div><a name="07042442000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000481"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> It is a developmental disorder with a triad of
impairment; all three boxes have to be ticked for there to be an
autistic diagnosis. The Minister might be interested to know that the
National Autistic Society was formed because a group of
parentswho previously were members of Mencap&#151;a very
worthwhile charity, which I have a lot of dealings with&#151;felt
that although they had been previously been grouped with Mencap on the
basis of a learning disability, their group of children were rather
distinct, because of that triad of impairment. Therefore, the NAS was
born, but there is quite a read-across
still.</div><a name="07042442000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000482"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I certainly understand that. It is important to
examine the rationale behind the clause in the first place in order to
be able to address the issues raised by the hon. Lady. It is important
to understand that this is a very particular exclusion. People might
say that under the application of the Act, if properly used, there
would not be this exclusion, but we have reacted to the strong feelings
that exist on the issue. The reason why we are concerned about adding
further to the list of disqualifications is that unfortunate
circumstances would arise if we included people with autistic spectrum
disorders within the learning disability
qualification. There would be unfortunate
consequences where, for example, a person with Asperger&#146;s
syndrome committed a serious
offence.</div><a name="07042442000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
I received information on some cases from Dr. Nick Land, who is a
consultant psychiatrist, with expertise in learning disability and
Asperger&#146;s syndrome. If it would be helpful and if it met with
your approval, Mr. Cook, I would be more than happy to
circulate that to members of the Committee, having first obtained Dr.
Land&#146;s permission, and to try to submit it as written evidence.
In considering closely the points that the hon. Lady has made, I wanted
to consult experts in the field and ask, &#147;What are the
possibilities? What might happen if we went along the line of the hon.
Lady&#146;s
amendment?&#148;</div><a name="07042442000285"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000483"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Will the Minister clarify something for me? If
she does not put autistic spectrum disorder alongside learning
disability in clause 2, how will people with a dual diagnosis be dealt
with? It is, of course, quite possible that someone has an autistic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>spectrum disorder and a learning disability diagnosis. Which will take
precedence under the Bill? The learning disability? Will the person
have protection, as someone recognised as having a learning disability,
in terms of</div><a name="07042442000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;abnormally
aggressive or seriously
irresponsible&#148;</div><a name="07042442000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">behaviour,
or will that be
waived?</div><a name="07042442000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000484"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> In those circumstances, I would expect a
clinician to be able to consider the learning disability and whether
the person was, because of the learning disability, displaying
abnormally aggressive behaviour, as we have set out in the Bill, or
whether the autistic spectrum was the reason for the disorder. That,
again, connects to all the other aspects of the detention, which would
be taken into account. Obviously, if someone needed treatment and
fulfilled all the conditions&#151;if that person had a learning
disorder and was, in a sense, a risk to themselves or others and if
appropriate treatment was available under section 3&#151;that is what
one would want them to have. It is important that the clinician should
be able to make use of the Act to get care to people who need
it.</div>
<a name="07042442000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000485"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> Would there ever be circumstances in which, if
the person with a dual diagnosis was not demonstrating abnormally
aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct, the learning disability
diagnosis could let them off the hook, so to
speak?</div><a name="07042442000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000486"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that there will be no letting off hooks
if treatment is required.</div>
<a name="07042442000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I may discuss a case
that I wanted to bring to the attention of the hon. Lady. It is
important to recognise that there would be real problems in accepting
her amendment in such a case. Mr. H. is a 25-year-old man
with Asperger&#146;s syndrome, who lives in a small hostel and
attends a sheltered workshop. He has a supportive family and a good
relationship with mental health services. A community psychiatric nurse
visits him regularly. He is quite withdrawn socially and becomes very
anxious around people he does not know. He is fascinated by fire and on
three previous occasions has started small fires in public places. This
time hehas started a fire in his hostel and although no one
has been hurt there has been serious damage to the building and he has
been convicted of arson.</div>
<a name="07042442000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">His psychiatrist advises the
court that Mr. H would be highly vulnerable in prison. In
his opinion, Mr. H is not suffering from any other mental
illness or personality disorder and his IQ is at the low end of the
normal range. He believes that he should be admitted to a mental health
unit under the Mental Health Act 1983 where he could be helped
to understand the effects of his fire setting. The court questions
whethera mental health disposal is legal if his diagnosis is
Asperger&#146;s syndrome. What does the psychiatrist do in those
circumstances? The point is that if autistic spectrum
disorders&#151;autism and Asperger&#146;s syndrome&#151; were
excluded from the definition of mental disorder, Mr. H would
have to go to prison.</div>
<a name="07042442000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000487"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> But surely his conduct is seriously
irresponsible. It has to be. If he is a fire setter, that
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>is seriously irresponsible conduct. Society would be protected and he
would be appropriately treated.</div>
<a name="07042442000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000488"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> No, because at the moment his only diagnosis is
Asperger&#146;s syndrome, which has been excluded from the Act. He
has started small fires, but he is not at present covered under the Act
as the hon. Lady suggests.</div>
<a name="07042442000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000489"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> He would be.</div>
<a name="07042442000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000490"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> He would not in those circumstances be able to
have a Mental Health Act disposal. The point is that, in such
circumstances, if one makes the exclusion one also creates uncertainty
for the clinician. In those circumstances, the clinician has to ask
whether there was a disposal that we could make from the court. The
court is confused because it sees that if it comes under
Asperger&#146;s syndrome, the problem would have been excluded from
the Act. Therefore, the court is left with saying that if we want to
treat the person in a mental health unit, we would have difficulties
doing so. The difficulty in those circumstances is that the person then
has not to be treated but to go to prison&#151;because they have
committed an offence&#151;instead of being
transferred.</div><a name="07042442000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
problems have also been raised about learning disability, because many
people said that had to be absolutely clear, which is why there were a
lot of discussions in the first place, as the hon. Lady knows. If
learning disability continued to be excluded, then there would be a
problem if someone committed a crime as to whether they could
effectively be treated underthe Mental Health Act
1983&#151;whether they would continue to be treated or be kept in a
prison setting. That is one of the reasons why we do not want the
overlap between the prison setting and the mental health
setting.</div><a name="07042442000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000491"></a>Angela
Browning:</b> The Minister is talking about the inadequacies
of the 1983 Act. If she were to accept my amendment, there would be
absolute clarity about ASD, and the Bill would be very clear about how
the person in the case she has just described&#151;which Iam
quite sure, incontestably, would be seriously irresponsible
conduct&#151;should be treated. That would be the reverse of what she
has been saying all morning. She could clarify the Act, which would be
helpful to the individual, to society and, particularly, to clinicians.
That is missing from the 1983 Act. We are now informed about ASD, and
she has the opportunity to pick up on that and put it in the
Bill.</div><a name="07042442000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000492"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The issue at stake here is whether the court
can truly say that the person has abnormally aggressive or seriously
aggressive
conduct.</div><a name="07042442000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000493"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> If that action of fire-setting was not
seriously irresponsible conduct, what would be an example of seriously
irresponsible
conduct?</div><a name="07042442000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000494"></a><b class="B">Ms
</b><b class="B">Winterton:</b> That is exactly the point at stake. We
could get into a grey area. We would be trying to ask the courts to
define what is abnormally aggressive. There may be instances, as in
this case, where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>somebody says that they have a fascination with fire&#151;that is
their issue&#151;and so there is no guarantee with that individual.
The point is that the court then has to look at the case, which might
stand in the way of somebody receiving
treatment.</div><a name="07042442000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07042442000495"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I am finding the Minister&#146;s
logic convoluted. She is now arguing against the exemption for learning
disabilities. Surely the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>same argument would apply in that case? What isthe problem in
extending the definition to autistic spectrum disorder as
well?</div><a name="07042442000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07042442000496"></a>Ms

exemption.</div><a name="07042442000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
