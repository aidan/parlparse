</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Ms Atherton:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. May I convey my thanks to you and ask you to convey my thanks to the officers of the House for providing this chair, for which I am very grateful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. May we please be associated with those thanks?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I take this opportunity to say thank you to the servants of the House, be they Badge Messengers, Door Keepers, members of the police force, Hansard staff or civil servants, who do a marvellous job and, in spite of our idiosyncrasies, manage to cater for us. We are grateful and I should like that to be recorded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> May I add to those thanks an acknowledgement of the good work that respective trade unions do? Application forms are available for those who have not availed themselves of the facility.
<P>
I shall speak to amendment No. 96 and, in particular, amendment No. 97, which was the subject of the last contribution before the welcome break. In speaking to amendment No. 97, the hon. Member for Daventry referred to the Secretary of State's letter dealing with the remit of the Low Pay Comission. Public debate about the Bill and, beforehand, about the policy has been dominated by the worries of Opposition Members about the effect of the national minimum wage on levels of employment.
<P>
Those worries are misfounded and misplaced. They are based on the assumption--the hon. Member for Daventry repeated it--that the price of labour is determined by the supply of and demand for it. That is not wholly the case in the real world. If it were, there would be no unemployment in India, for example. There is a great deal of unemployment in that country, which discredits the argument. All members of the Committee know that other factors--skill shortages, transport, general education levels, sectoral issues and geography--play a hugh role.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry presented as a danger the fact that employers would restructure their labour forces in the light of the Bill. If they do, good, because the objective of the Bill is precisely to force companies and organisations in the private and public sectors to abolish the scourge of low pay.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham considered other economic implications--inflation in particular--which have not featured in the public debate. There is a relationship between the cost of employment and inflation, but it is interesting to note that although similar arguments were made about the effect of the implementation of the Equal Pay Act 1976 on employment and the RPI, they were not realised either in its immediate aftermath or, indeed, the years after. That is because the supply and demand of labour in this country does not take place within the confines of a purely free market--if, indeed, it does in any country.
<P>
The argument that differentials affect RPI and inflation is also subject to that false assumption. The engineering industry and the electrical and engineering union were referred to in that regard. The engineering and electrical industries have operated a minimum rate of pay for many decades. The differential impact of that is taken into account when that minimum rate is agreed by the two sides, but it is not true to say or imply that the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union opposes the concept of a national minimum wage. It does not--it simply argues about the sensible implementation of it. That is one of the reasons why the Government wisely set up the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
We have to debate competitiveness. We did not talk about levels of investment, although, to be fair, the hon. Member for Buckingham referred to the letter from the Secretary of State. The most important factor for investment levels, especially those of small firms, is the level of investment in human capital. Yet we do not argue that there should be exceptions for certain small firms, sectors and geographical areas in relation to skill levels and qualifications. We have national vocational qualifications--we do not make exceptions for GCSE levels in, for example, east Anglia or the south-west. We apply a level playing field to the measurement of investment in human capital--that is, qualifications.
<P>
Similarly, the Bill will apply a level playing field to pay. It will simplify that intervention in the labour market in order to meet the objectives of equality and effectiveness. Of course there is a relationship between labour price, investment and profit, and of course that will apply to small firms, but I argue that the need for simplicity and a level playing field in small firms--a common definition is companies employing fewer than 20 people--would be greater if more complications and exemptions were introduced into the National Minimum Wage Bill and not less, as hon. Members sought to argue. Experience abroad, especially in the United States, provides evidence to back up that view.
<P>
One cannot separate arguments about the costs to industry from those on costs to public funds. For Tesco to make up the rate of its lowest-paid workers to, say, &#163;4 per hour--a figure that I choose merely for convenience--would, despite a profit last year of more than &#163;700 million, cost the equivalent of only 0.07 per cent. of its turnover. We can all find examples where the cost would be greater, but one cannot argue that the cost to industry has a deleterious effect on companies in sectors such as security and clothing and textiles, where, in the main, people are employed on low wages.
<P>
The argument applies to savings to the public purse, where there is a point of agreement. There is a balance between the cost to the taxpayer of benefits to subsidise low pay--we now know that the Opposition want to see a minimum income, which would have to be based on some definition, albeit with regional variations--and the huge tax saving to industry, not just to individuals, which results if the Treasury no longer has to subsidise low pay. There is a relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Will you allow me to conclude my point? Perhaps then you will see its logic if you have not seen it yet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman is addressing me, I see quite plainly what he is getting at. If he is addressing the hon. Gentleman, perhaps he would make that clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I have a final point to make on amendment No. 97. To be fair, the hon. Member for Daventry quoted the Secretary of State's letter, but I was surprised that the arguments about red tape and bureaucracy were not introduced. One of the commonest arguments from Opposition Members over the years has been that interventions in the labour market increase red tape. Yet making exemptions to a national minimum wage, whether on the basis of size of company, regional or area differentiations and sectors, increases red tape. There would also be huge implications for the tax and benefit system as a result of such complications. Arguments in earlier debates defended the Inland Revenue. Goodness knows what it would make of amendment No. 97.
<P>
The other amendments in the group--with the exception, to be fair to the hon. Member for Eastleigh, of amendment No. 82--attempt either to make exemptions to the national minimum wage or to give powers to the Secretary of State to make those exemptions. But the Low Pay Commission has been asked to look at those implications in most regards. We all recognise that good legislation is that which lasts--it stands the test of the real world and cannot be watered down by this or future Governments. Good legislation must be simple, effective and provide for equality. By making exemptions, as proposed, we would undermine the legislation's effectiveness and turn what is a good Bill into a bad Bill. Complications would undermine it.
<P>
The problem arises not from the motive behind the amendments, but because there is no shared concept about what the Bill is trying to achieve. It will not treat the minimum rate of pay in the same way as other matters and variables do when it comes to calculating pay. There are many hundreds of collective agreements in this country, and the questions posed in the amendments come up every day. One criticism of industrial relations in this country is that there is too much complication in calculating these matters.
<P>
We want to provide a level playing field; we do not want a bumpy playing field, which accepting the amendment would inevitably mean.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> I will not, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind.
<P>
This intervention in the labour market--which the Bill represents--attempts in the same way as the Equal Pay Act to provide a universal playing field across all of industry and the public services. Not all low pay is subject to collective bargaining. If it were, there would be no need for the Bill, and some of the points that have been made would be valid. The danger is not that the Bill would be too restrictive either by sector or by occupation, but that the minimum could be seen as a maximum. Points about London weighting are often based on the assumption that all that low-paid people in London have to look forward to is the achievement of the national minimum rate whatever it is. No member of the Committee would want to say to staff who work nights in London's catering and service industries that all that they can look forward to is a minimum wage. The minimum wage sets a minimum, not a maximum.
<P>
<H5>1 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If Labour Members' arguments are correct--only time will tell--and if the policy raises standards and quality without the bad effects on price and investment that are feared by the hon. Member for Daventry, the minimum wage will be used as a minimum.
<P>
To differentiate according to company size would distort the labour market in a way that would not be subject to supply and demand, but to other factors that impact on the labour market. That would be detrimental to some small companies. In short, a minimum must apply to all small companies, not just to some.
<P>
The arguments about area or regional differentiation, which are relevant to amendment No. 82, are not pragmatic and would have the same effect. Differentiation according to occupation would be a lawyer's delight. Nothing takes up the time of industrial negotiators more than defining a job and who it applies to.
<P>
Most of all, the legislation is intended to be effective. To be effective, it must be enforceable. Many employers and employers' federations--we could argue about their number, but there are many--have supported the concept of a national minimum wage, never mind its practical implementation. One major reason for that is that they recognise the truth of Sir Winston Churchill's words. To be enforceable, a minimum wage must be universal, otherwise Churchill's dictum falls out of the window. It must also be simple.
<P>
I do not wish to call upon old Labour too much. The words of a disciple of new Labour, John Kenneth Galbraith, are appropriate and pertinent. I shall quote--I think that I am allowed to quote in a speech.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Briefly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Very briefly, I shall quote a sentence, although Galbraith's sentences are long. At the opening of ``The Affluent Society'', he states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Wealth is not without its advantages and the case to the contrary, although it has often been made, has never proved widely persuasive. But, beyond doubt, wealth is the relentless enemy of understanding. The poor man has always a precise view of his problem and its remedy: he hasn't enough and he needs more.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A minimum wage should not be set at different levels in different parts of the country, for different occupations within different sectors. Such a wage would not be enforceable, and it would not be understood.
<P>
The point is very important. If the minimum wage is not understood, and it will not be if it is set at different levels throughout the country, the genuine policy worries that come from the practical experience of Labour and Opposition Members about detrimental effects on the labour market, on inflation and on investment, would become reality. That would occur as it would have done if exceptions had been made in the Equal Pay Act 1976. A shift in female labour would have occurred, to the detriment of companies and industries in parts of the country.
<P>
If the Bill is to be effective, it must be universal. When the national health service was introduced, it was universal. When people talked about medical provision being free at the point of delivery, they did not say that that was except for people working in companies employing fewer than 20 people or for people working in the clothing and textile industry in Northern Ireland. They said that it had to be universally free. The same was true of universal education and suffrage. The national minimum wage can work only if it is universal.
<P>
I accept that the amendment would give powers to exempt, rather than to instruct an exemption. However, the Bill must make it clear that the national minimum wage has to be universal to be workable. If it does not, the national minimum wage will become a problem for industry and for people in low-paid work. It will not represent an opportunity to abolish the scourge of low pay.
<P>
For that reason, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I wish to deal with several of the amendments in the group.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth said that the national minimum wage had to be universal to prevent a future Government watering down the provisions. However, a future Government who did not want the legislation could repeal or change it, so the contention is irrelevant.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that universality is the bedrock on which the national minimum wage must be based, but the clause deals with exceptions. The Government accept that some exceptions have to be made, so they have already sold the pass on universality. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Wentworth are therefore doomed to disappointment.
<P>
There is no need to go to India or the United States to find support for Conservative Members' opinion that raising remuneration for the low paid may lead to job loses. The Government's welfare to work policy subsidises employers so that more people are brought into work as a result of the lower cost of employing them. Logic dictates that, if lowering the cost of hiring workers increases employment, raising that cost will increase unemployment. That is the central incoherence in Government policy strands.
<P>
I have the pleasure of supporting a Liberal Democrat amendment. That does not happen often, but the hon. Member for Eastleigh has noted that he is one of the few people who can unite the Committee, usually against him.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 proposes regional variations in the national minimum wage. We first discussed the possibility of differentials in benefits in kind in relation to clause 1, but the debate has moved on since then. It is apparent that the structure of pay is more complex than was imagined and that there may be some benefit in regional variations, specifically in those employment sectors where benefits in kind are common, as such variations would permit a flexibility that otherwise would not be possible.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth spoke eloquently against the proposals dealing with different sectors of employment, but the point is that they would not instruct the Secretary of State or the Low Pay Commission to institute that flexibility: rather, they would simply have a permissive power to do so. The clause allows the Secretary of State some exceptions, so an amendment that made the range of exceptions as wide as possible could be argued to fit the Government's strategy.
<P>
The present Secretary of State may never countenance using that discretion, but the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth said that the Bill should last as long as possible, so we should maximise the discretion available to future Secretaries of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point, but the Low Pay Commission may not advise the Secretary of State to countenance any exemptions. The result would then be no recommendation, or no decision by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that perceptive intervention. Later in my speech, I was going to deal with the role of the Low Pay Commission and its interaction with the powers of the Secretary of State as defined in the clause.
<P>
It would be sensible to allow future Secretaries of State flexibility with regard to sectors of employment because of the increasingly rapid change in the structure of industry. This country's industries have risen up the pay scale. Several hon. Members have mentioned that the textile industry used to be noted for its low pay and relatively low value-added products, but international competition has meant that our industry no longer subsists at that end of the market. By and large, wages have risen and the industry's future lies in relatively high value-added niche products. The same is true of other industries: the hon. Member for Eastleigh spoke about home workers, whose wages have risen over the past five years.
<P>
Those changes mean that a Secretary of State should be given discretion to allow different levels of the national minimum wage in different sectors of industry. New, undreamed of sectors of industry could arise and mop up future levels of unemployment. Although they may be relatively low paid in their early years, it would be madness to say that in no circumstances will we ever want people employed in those industries.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission may, in the future, realise that an industry wanting to come to Britain is prevented from doing so by the minimum wage. In such circumstances, a Secretary of State may want to suspend for five years the application of the minimum wage in that sector. The amendment would not tell the present Secretary of State what must be done now; it would provide a permissive power to future Secretaries of State. That would be prudent.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry spoke eloquently to amendment No. 97, which fits perfectly with the enabling status of the clause. The Bill is curious in that it mixes enabling provisions with the odd disabling provision. Amendment No. 97 would give the Secretary of State a wider framework for discretion and make it easier than at present to pay attention to factors that promote high employment and well-paid employment.
<P>
It would be irrational and nonsensical for a Secretary of State to adopt a recommended rate for the national minimum wage which he or she thought would adversely affect inflation or business competitiveness in general. The result would be that many people would be thrown on the dole, or that rising inflation would lead to businesses closing down because of higher interest rates. If the Government think that it is not sensible to give a Secretary of State such discretion, why should any discretion be given? If the Government believe in giving discretion, they should have included in the Bill all the economic indicators which any sensible Secretary of State would take into account when setting the minimum wage. She would not have to use them all if she did not want to--
<P>
<H5>1.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been listening carefully, which is one of the hazards that the hon. Gentleman faces. I hope that he will remember that although we are discussing a group of amendments, he cannot constantly rehearse the same debate. We must restrict ourselves to discussing the amendment that is before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall continue to restrict myself, Mrs. Dunwoody, to discussing amendment No. 97, and in particular proposed new subsection (4)(e)--``costs to public funds.'' That matter must concern any Secretary of State because the public sector is and will remain one of the largest employers in this country.
<P>
Many of those employed by the public sector and its institutions will be affected by the Bill. The Secretary of State might decide that the minimum wage recommended by the Low Pay Commission would result in a deterioration of the public purse and large-scale job cuts. Workers could be sacked. Many of the low paid would be better off if such a wage were not imposed. That may not be true this year, but it may be true in the future.
<P>
I did not go along with the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, who said that the deletion of the words ``undertakings of different sizes'' by amendment No. 20 would result in a lawyers charter. Putting all of the conditions on small as well as big businesses is a way for successful big businesses to raise barriers to entry to their industry. We have seen that in various sectors and would certainly see it in the matter of pay. Firms prefer to have as few competitors as possible. There is a danger--I put it no higher than that--that there would be a barrier to entry and, therefore, to growth in employment.
<P>
Small businesses may be badly damaged by the measure. Rural shops are often family businesses with, perhaps, one non-family member as an employee. Family members could work longer hours and get rid of that person. There is potential for sensible exemptions for such businesses, and for charity shops or museums which attract people who work semi-voluntarily to support the institution. Such workers might be paid a small sum, but without the derogation allowed under amendment No. 20, the Bill might ensure that they will be paid nothing. I cannot think that that is the Government's intention, but if it is, it is not a sensible one.
<P>
The recommendations in the amendments to allow the Secretary of State greater discretion may well also occur to the Low Pay Commission. Labour Members tell us constantly that the commission is doing thorough work and asking people throughout the country what they want, but it does not seem to have occurred to them that the commission may well think that it would be a good idea to have regional variations, for example, or variations for small businesses.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the debate on the Low Pay Commission will come later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that reminder, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was simply pointing out that if the commission comes up with similar recommendations, but the amendments have not been accepted, we will have finished our deliberations on the Bill and the Government will be unable to respond to those recommendations. Thus, I was making a point about the Government, not about the Low Pay Commission. If the Government do not accept the amendments, they are ignoring important potential recommendations from the Low Pay Commission. I cannot believe that that is the Bill's underlying intention. If we rule out the amendments now, the Government should give us more explicit guidance.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 97 and 20 would give the Secretary of State greater flexibility and more ability to respond intelligently to what one assumes will be wide-ranging recommendations from the Low Pay Commission. I therefore commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I have risen now because, as I could have predicted, the debate has revolved around the issues discussed in our previous debate about the context and principle of clause 3 and its enabling provisions regarding universality, a single national minimum wage rate and the process--to which the hon. Member for Daventry referred and which we discussed when we debated previous amendments--and relationship between clause 3 and the powers of the Secretary of State in the light of the Labour party's commitment to a single national minimum wage. So far, we have heard Opposition Members arguing again about why a national minimum wage will be bad for the UK economy in general and for certain sectors in particular.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned the Arthur Daley economics to which I referred earlier. He set out, in total isolation, the theory that if the rates of those on the very lowest wages rose, we would immediately see major job losses, despite the fact that there is no evidence, either international or national, to support that. Moreover, the previous Administration tested that theory to destruction. They got rid of minimum standards and a floor for wages in the labour market, yet there was no rise in jobs--in fact, in some sectors there were wage cuts. When the Conservatives left office, unemployment was double what it was when they entered. All that the theory achieved for millions was pain and insecurity in the workplace. The Conservatives' legacy is the many individuals and families in Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales living on poverty pay.
<P>
The amendment would undermine the Government's capacity to set a single national minimum wage rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I want to continue on this point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry said during a discussion on general economic matters that the Government had not been faithful--I apologise if I paraphrase the hon. Gentleman--to the concept in principle and that we had established the minimum wage without taking into account general economic practice. As a consequence, whatever the rate is, there is the difficulty of people losing wages.
<P>
I refer the hon. Member for Daventry to the letter of 23 September from the President of the Board of Trade to the chairman of the Low Pay Commission. She says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In making its recommendations, the Commission should have regard to the wider economic and social implications; the likely effect on the level of employment and inflation; the impact on the competitiveness of business, particularly the small firms sector; and the potential impact on the costs to industry and the Exchequer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As well as giving the commission a specific task, the Government, from the outset, established that there should be recommendations on the starting rate, young people and training and general economic matters. The Government could not have been clearer in the wide nature of the remit that they provided to the Low Pay Commission. On that basis, the commission has faithfully attempted--in the structure that it has set itself, and in taking evidence, both written and verbal--to fulfil its obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On the specific point that the Minister has just made, the first two criteria are addressed in the Bill, and he referred to general economic matters, as did I when moving the amendment. Our concern is that there is no mechanism for addressing those points, whatever the Low Pay Commission's recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is not the case. The purpose of the Low Pay Commission--its dynamics--is to take those factors into account and come to a decision and make a recommendation. The hon. Gentleman has offered a crude analysis of the economy. The only factor with a bearing on the economy is this--the level of wage equals a level of employment or unemployment. The variances, whether up or down, will have a positive or a negative impact.
<P>
The Opposition's theory was tried out and it failed dramatically. That is why there are so few Conservative Members on the Opposition Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No; I am not giving way now. Hon. Members think that smiling at me will encourage me to give way. Let me have a moment to deal with the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
This takes me to amendments Nos. 96 and 97, which are at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. They aim to set new criteria in deciding exemptions. It goes back to making exemptions on the grounds of size, region or sector. It is trying to do what we have provided for in the Bill in ensuring that the Secretary of State makes decisions in relation to clause 3, but on the basis of a single national rate. The proposals are an attempt to remove the conditions regarding areas, sectors of employment, different sizes of undertakings and different occupations. They are no less than an attempt to drive a coach and horses through clause 3.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Daventry is serious about these proposals, he should give examples of how accepting them would assist the low paid. All along he has said that the Opposition are not attempting to destroy the Bill, but trying to improve it. Yet on every occasion he has come forward with a negative proposal. He has not yet given one specific example why these exemptions were assessed in, first, establishing an assurance that a worker gets the minimum wage, and secondly, that they have no difficulty in ensuring from their first day of employment in the work place the practicalities of securing that minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister invited me to give examples. I would not be so arrogant as to presume to do so. My amendment simply seeks to provide for the Low Pay Commission and then, on the commission's advice, the Secretary of State, to consider examples and representations and to have some mechanism for addressing the problems which may be drawn to its attention. It is not sufficient or necessary to have any one example. It is simply that the mechanism for consideration and action needs to be put in place.
<P>
<H5>1.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That was a pretty inadequate answer to a reasonable question that asked why an amendment was tabled. The amendment should be important from the Opposition's point of view, because it seeks to amend one of the most important clauses of the Bill. The truth is that the hon. Gentleman has no idea why he tabled it, other than his opposition to the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Eastleigh have both put the case for regional rates, for somewhat different reasons. I believe that the hon. Member for Eastleigh supports the principle of the minimum wage, and that he has done so consistently. It is a matter of judgment, resting with the hon. Gentleman, Labour Members and I, whether his proposals or those of the Government are right. The Government have made that judgment, and I have argued that our conclusion is right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry and Opposition Members hold a different view, and have different reasons for trying to tease out a regional aspect from the debate. They do so simply as a smokescreen for their continuing opposition to the national minimum wage. That opposition goes to the heart of the national minimum wage, to the principle that it should be easily understood by employers and employees, easily applicable to people who work in all sectors of the economy, and applicable in a way that will tackle low pay throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. That must be achieved in the context of the Government's overall economic and social objectives.
<P>
I shall give examples of the difficulties that a regional strategy would cause. I address my remarks especially to the hon. Member for Eastleigh. To be fair to the hon. Member for Daventry, there is very little that I can say or do to explain the Government's policy that will be acceptable to the Opposition, because we hold a completely opposite view. There is clear blue water between us. There will continue to be so--as the debate proceeds, that water gets deeper and deeper, and wider and wider.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister has suggested several times, and he is beginning to do so again, that the economic theory--as I believe that he put it--of the previous Government was tested to destruction. May I ask him a simple question? If, three years after the introduction of a minimum wage, unemployment is higher in Britain than when the wage was introduced, will the Minister regard the policy and his economic theory as a failure?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I regard it as a priority for the Government to deal with the unemployment left by the previous Administration. That is why we have introduced the new deal, with a &#163;3.5 billion investment programme to deal with the long-term unemployed and with the young unemployed, and it is why we are working with industry on competitiveness and training. The Government are dealing with the legacy of the incompetence of Opposition Members and of the Administration of which they used to be members or supporters. I do not need lessons from the party of mass unemployment about what actions the Government should take on employment, or about investment in the labour market.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> This is the last time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Is there any major European country blessed with a minimum wage that has shown in the immediate past a better economic performance than the United Kingdom in terms of jobs, inflation or growth?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I notice that the hon. Gentleman had to use the word ``immediate''. He does not wish to examine the previous Conservative Government's 18-year record, in relation to Britain's European competitors and to the cycle of the economy. Almost all of Britain's industrial competitors have a better record of investment, training, job creation and job retention than Britain. That is the truth.
<P>
I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was misled down a byway, along which I did not want to go. I was led by my enthusiasm. I think that you will agree that my point had to be made in an historical context.
<P>
The complexities in the proposals for regional rates are legendary. They relate to companies and employers that work across regions, to regional benefits, to the size of regions and to the definition of a region. I shall give some examples. For the purposes of discussion, I shall be charitable, and imagine a minimum wage that is based on six different regions in 10 sectors, and which incorporates a lower rate for small businesses. That is a reasonable assumption to make. The practical consequence would be a combination of 120 minimum wage rates. The complexity would create a minefield for employers. What does an employer do whose enterprise crosses three or four regions, or sectors?
<P>
I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I did not mean to have my back to you.
<P>
One of the main principles of the Bill is that the single national minimum rate should be easily recognised. Employers will be responsible for paying it and employees will be able to understand how much they will get.
<P>
The proposals of the hon. Member for Daventry would undermine the simple premise that there must be a floor to pay in the United Kingdom labour market below which no one can go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but would not the amendments relating to clause 3 merely remove the restrictions on the specific additional class of persons included in clause 3 by virtue of clause 4?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is right, but I am answering the debate about amendments that would reintroduce differentials and undermine the concept of the single rate.
<P>
The previous debate dealt with the purposes of clause 3, its relationship with the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State's relationship with the Low Pay Commission. We did that to death, and I do not intend to go over that ground again. It is important to make clear now that the complexities of regionalisation would undermine the concept of a single national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter (Weston-super-Mare):</B> The Minister has drawn many conclusions from the proposals about establishing a regional element in the minimum wage. We believe that those conclusions were for the Low Pay Commission to reach: we want the commission to be allowed to consider the regional aspect and reach its own conclusions. The Minister should not put words in the commission's mouth.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I can understand that, but the Labour party in opposition did not hide from the electorate or employers its clear and specific policy on establishing a single national minimum wage rate. We won a huge mandate for that policy. It was therefore right to make clear to the Low Pay Commission, from the outset, the parameters for that single national rate. The Low Pay Commission has a wide remit to make recommendations, but one commitment is sacrosanct: the minimum wage will be set a single, national rate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about differentials. The argument had already been done to death in previous debates, but I shall simply say that interesting things have been happening in the British economy ahead of the introduction of the single national minimum wage. In both the public and private sectors, significant agreements have been reached between employers and trade unions--even in the textile industry, where union representation is at a low level. Those agreements, even in advance of the introduction of the minimum wage, have favoured low-paid workers over those in higher-paid enterprises.
<P>
Employers in all sectors of the economy already are taking into account the fact that a minimum wage will be introduced. They want it to operate effectively, and they are prepared to ensure that pay structures give an uplift to the lowest-paid employees. That is a welcome indication that, once the minimum wage is established, employers and employees in all sectors will come to sensible pay arrangements.
<P>
Opposition Members have exaggerated on the issue of differentials. They simply want to say that they oppose a national minimum wage. They have given us no argument for accepting the amendments, which I must ask my colleagues to oppose if they are pressed to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's interpretation of my party's position, which was more or less correct. We support the principle of putting a floor under poverty wages, but differ with him over the mechanism. The Minister feels that, as a member of a newly elected Government, he has a mandate for his party's policy. That does not prevent me for continuing to support my party's position.
<P>
The Minister gave an example of how our policy would work, but did not say--I understand that he cannot--at what level the minimum wage would provide an uplift for people on poverty wages throughout the country. His response has not enabled me to find it in my heart at this late hour to withdraw my amendment. I must push it to a vote.
<P>
Mr. Bercow rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want to continue? As I understand it, the hon. Member for Eastleigh wants to push his amendment to a vote at this point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> At the close of the debate. May I seek your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody? I want the amendment to be voted on at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am prepared to accept separate votes, for which I have specifically been asked. The hon. Gentleman wants to push the amendment to a vote.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I raised a point of clarification earlier, but this is a substantive point of order. A number of hon. Members participated in that debate on a wide group of amendments. The lead amendment was tabled by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. With no disrespect to the hon. Gentleman, I sense that we were confused about what was taking place and I noticed that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham sought to catch your eye, Mrs. Dunwoody. I have no wish to criticise your conduct, but were you saying that, in effect, you accepted a closure of the debate on the hon. Gentleman's amendment--I understood him to say that he was prepared to vote on his amendment at the closure--and therefore, by definition, were we precluded from further consideration of our amendment? I feel that the situation was subject to the construction that you were demerging the amendments so that we could continue to debate the substantive issues that the other amendment raised.
<P>
<H5>1.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. We must understand that the amendments are called in accordance with the selection list. Hon. Members on both sides, but specifically those who moved and spoke to amendments, ranged extremely widely in the debate. I did not seek to restrict anyone in any way, although I could perhaps have been a little tougher on hon. Members who wandered wide of the amendments.
<P>
I agreed to the request of the hon. Member for Eastleigh for a separate vote on his amendment. Normally that would not be a matter of his making another speech, but of the question being put formally and the hon. Gentleman pushing it to a vote, if he so wished.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry moved his amendment and chose to wind up his remarks. Originally, I took it that he had spoken to his amendment and treated it as such. He then chose to push it to a vote. If he now wants to have a vote on amendment No. 97, I am prepared to allow it, but it will be a formal vote. Does he want that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I first thank you for your clarification of the matter--I am much obliged. I confirm that I want to push amendment No. 97 to a vote.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, may I point something out? Hon. Members have been very patient; this has been a long sitting, and everyone has been involved. But when votes are being taken, there must be silence in the Room. We cannot have an undercurrent of noise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Betts </B>(Sheffield, Attercliffe): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I believe that the Ayes were 17. Could the figure be checked again?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, the Ayes were 17 and the Noes 8. The Ayes still have it.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to add to the persons to whomsection 3 applies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 3, leave out line 14.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 30, in page 3, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) No amendment shall be made under subsection (1) above which treats persons differently in relation to different sectors of employment, except for persons employed by registered charities.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Clause 4, which we have waited eagerly to debate for the past few weeks, provides the mechanism by which additional classes of person may be included within the scope of clause 3. The power to include additional classes of person through that mechanism is limited by a number of provisions imposing non-discriminatory requirements on the use of those powers in a way that we have become familiar with through the structure of the Bill this far.
<P>
There will, I am sure, be various areas of restrictions on the discretion of the Secretary of State that members of the Committee may want to address, Mrs. Dunwoody, should you be minded to allow a debate on clause stand part. I shall attempt to be relatively brief and restrict myself specifically to the amendment relating to clause 4(2)(b) in the hope that that may mind you to allow us to address the wider issues under clause stand part.
<P>
The amendment is simple and straightforward. It seeks to allow the Secretary of State to include the persons employed by charities as a class of persons who may be treated differently within the scope of the Bill. I anticipate that Labour Members will say that it is yet another wrecking amendment, that we have sought to exclude this class and that class of person until no one is left within the scope of the Bill. I assure the Committee that that is not our motive. I tabled the amendment without prompting from any quarter, because the question of employees of charities must be addressed if the Bill is not to have an unintended and unfortunate outcome.
<P>
Underlying the structure of the Bill as it is presented is an assumption that people go out to work with one motive only--to earn money. That is perhaps not an unreasonable general assumption; selling their labour in the work force is indeed the primary motive for most people.
<P>
I do not want to refer in detail to future clauses in the Bill. However, the Government have made provisions within the Bill that would exclude those who work on a purely voluntary basis. That must be right; we welcome that exclusion.
<P>
However, anyone who does not work on a purely voluntary basis would be subject to the provisions of the minimum wage under the structure of the Bill as presented. There is no scope for the Secretary of State to deal differently with anyone whose motives for employment are mixed--for example, someone who works for reasons other than maximisation of their earning capability.
<P>
There are many people who are active in the economy in a marginal but none the less important role who are willing to work under certain circumstances for a wage that is purely nominal and considerably less than any of the figures that have been suggested as a likely outcome for the minimum wage.
<P>
I shall cite some examples from my experience and from information that I have gathered from colleagues and other sources over the past few days. Charity shops are a now familiar feature of our high streets--alas. I say alas because their presence tends to reflect a downturn in retail trade in some of our less prosperous high streets. Many people who work in such shops do so on a purely voluntary basis.
<P>
However, others are employed at rates of pay that would not be regarded as competitive in the open market. Such people would not work for Tesco or Sainsbury for the wages that they are paid by Oxfam or Sue Ryder. However, they are willing to work in such circumstances for very much below market rates because they believe that what they are doing is worthwhile as a contribution to the activities of a charitable organisation.
<P>
Many charities operate residential accommodation; the Youth Hostels Association is one example that I mentioned in a previous sitting. Others provide sheltered accommodation for young or homeless people. Again, people are technically employed--they are paid for the work that they do. However, they may work very long hours, often through the night on a residential basis, at a rate of pay that equates to a very low hourly level.
<P>
Many young or elderly people support charities through quasi-commercial activities. Many charities run fund-raising activities that involve door-to-door collection, not necessarily for purely charitable contributions. For example, one well-known cancer charity runs a football pools competition. People working for nominal rates of pay go from door to door to collect the weekly or fortnightly subscriptions of those who play it. All hon. Members will agree that such activities are examples of sterling work by people who are perhaps not able or willing to contribute their labour entirely freely or as a voluntary gesture, but who are nonetheless willing to work for certain organisations for a rate of remuneration below the realistic market rate.
<P>
I do not intend to speak about this subject in great detail, but there are other examples in the education sector, where non-profit-making schools employ classroom assistants at low rates of pay. At the risk of being out of order, I will say briefly that schools in the public sector also employ classroom assistants at low rates of pay. Those classroom assistants are often parents who genuinely believe that they are making a worthwhile contribution, and are accordingly willing to accept a low rate of pay.
<P>
<H5>2 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has specifically said that he hopes that I will allow a clause stand part debate, it might be of help to him if I point out that both amendments are narrowly drafted. If he sticks to his own amendments, the future of the debate is in his own hands. I have allowed wide debate on amendments, which is why I have not allowed a clause stand part debate. It is up to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for that guidance. After that brief diversion into education, I shall now confine my speech strictly to employees of charities.
<P>
I would like to draw the Committee's attention to one specific class of ``employee'' of charities. I am unaware of its technical or legal status, but I have had direct personal experience of it. I believe that Labour Members will agree that unforeseen consequences of the Bill in that sector would be undesirable. The amendment would avoid such consequences.
<P>
The class of ``employee'' to which I refer comprises people with disabilities who work under supervision in a sheltered workshop environment provided by a charitable organisation. Such workshops undertake commercial work, which is usually piece work. The work is done for rates of pay that, because of the often severe disabilities of the workers, would translate into a very low hourly rate. Such work is not done primarily to earn money, either for the charities or for the disabled people. The workshops are primarily a form of therapy, but the people who attend them would technically be ``employees'' of charitable organisations. I feel sure that the Minister would not want the Bill to damage such worthwhile activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend may not be aware that one of the foremost charities engaged in such activities is the Papworth Trust, which is in my constituency in south Cambridgeshire. Does my hon. Friend also acknowledge that the remuneration available to persons who work in such circumstances often combines commercial pay with some form of benefit? Where benefit is ruled out, the national minimum wage would apply to the employment contract of those persons, and might prejudice their position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have direct knowledge of the Papworth Trust, which he mentioned. Unless the Bill allows the Secretary of State to make exceptions at her discretion, there is a genuine danger that such organisations could be inadvertently but completely caught in a trap.
<P>
I am not seeking a blanket exception for all employees of charities--that would be grossly unfair. Many people are employed by charitable organisations in a straightforward, open-market transaction and they are paid at market rates. The amendment relates not to those people, but to those whom I mentioned earlier--semi-voluntary workers and special classes of disabled workers.
<P>
The amendment seeks to get the Government to acknowledge that there is not a straightforward dichotomy between people who work for nothing and those who are seeking in an aggressive sense to earn money. Many retired people have mixed motivations: they need to earn money, they want to do part-time work and although they might not work for a commercial organisation for the wages that charitable organisations offer, they are willing to accept those wages when a worthwhile cause is involved. They gain their reward in two ways: through monetary compensation and through the satisfaction of providing a useful service to the community. We should all encourage that spirit of voluntarism.
<P>
The Bill involves an all-or-nothing situation. One is either excluded because one works for nothing or one is included. The amendment would give the Secretary of State the power to create a halfway house for employees of charitable organisations. She would be able to use at her discretion the power to define additional classes of persons under clause 4. If the Government do not accept the amendment--or its provisions by another means--that would be to the detriment of charities and of our community and it would hamper the development of our civic society. They should give due consideration to the spirit behind the amendment--the need to make provision for a genuinely special case.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I intervene at a relatively early stage because I have some experience of the charitable and voluntary sector. One of the more enjoyable jobs that I had in this place--sadly, it had to end when I became a Minister--was to serve as the chairman of the all-party working group on charity law, which has undergone a progressive and gentle evolution into a wider group that represents charities and the voluntary sector. I undertook that work because I had--and still have--a special interest in the subject. I therefore listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge with great sympathy, and I endorse virtually every word that he said. In the same breath, I undertake firmly not to repeat it or to stray from the narrow compass of the amendment, because wider issues also need consideration under the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge got in ahead of me. I had decided, when beginning to think about suitable amendments, to hold my fire until we reached clause 41 on voluntary workers before making the point that he has made, but he has ingeniously found a way of promoting the amendment, so he got in first.
<P>
Perhaps I may diverge for a minute, as my hon. Friend did, and deal with the issue of disabilities. I am conscious that, as the Committee is now making such excellent progress, matters may be overtaken by events and there will be a need for a tactical repositioning of amendments. I have tabled--clearly you will not yet have considered it, Mrs. Dunwoody--an amendment to address precisely my hon. Friend's point about disabilities. I am concerned about this matter. I sought to deal with it by tying it to persons--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Much as I admire the hon. Gentleman, he will be pushing his luck slightly if he tells us what he has put in his amendment before we reach that point. I am trying hard to follow every word, but we cannot discuss something that he has tabled for debate on a later clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As drafted, Mrs. Dunwoody, the amendment is on this clause, but I shall follow your advice. There may be opportunities to raise the matter at another stage. Suffice it to say, that I fully understand what my hon. Friend is driving at in that matter.
<P>
To deal with my hon. Friend's more general point, I have written in my notes that for the individual deciding to engage in work for the voluntary and charitable sector there is not a simple all-or-nothing decision whether to be remunerated or be a volunteer, but more often a spectrum between full-rate employment and total voluntary work. I used to have some dealings with Oxfam. I cannot speak for the current position, because I have not had a chance to check it, but some years ago the then director told me that the typical salary of Oxfam employees--these are people who go all over the world, often in uncongenial and demanding environments--was rebated by some 25 per cent. As I said, I cannot claim that that is the position now, but it is my recollection.
<P>
Many people, whether working for an organisation with a systematic salary pattern of that kind or for a smaller, more local organisation on a more informal basis, will have similar arrangements, not because someone has put pressure on them or because their eyes are closed to what they could get in the market, but because they regard it as part of their voluntary contribution. Indeed, it would be possible to take full remuneration and then covenant it back. As I found when I made inquiries of the Fees Office, some of us occasionally--I do not claim always to do so--give away certain fees that we receive. The Revenue does not like that, unless one arranges to do it as an explicit series of transactions. The attraction of the half-way house is that, quite informally and without much hassle, the individual may make his charitable contribution without having to make a fuss about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend may find that the Revenue is distinctly churlish about the idea of covenanting money back to one's employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. That may be precisely the point, and it is also a matter for consideration. However, the spirit in which the amendments were moved was an invitation for the Government to begin to address a real, if small, problem.
<P>
I am conscious of your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody, and do not want to widen the debate or, indeed, to speak for much longer, but I hope that the Government are also considering the wider impact of the national minimum wage on the voluntary sector. It is not necessarily individuals who make the decision to rebate or diminish their salary; it is also a question of the overall pattern of employment. In this connection, the Royal National Institute for the Blind has done extremely valuable work--working with the Low Pay Unit--in conducting a survey of the voluntary sector, of which I suspect the Minister will be aware, and then making a submission to the Low Pay Commission. I do not intend to speak on that at length, but the survey showed that, as one would expect, there was a huge variation in the employment patterns of individual charities and voluntary organisations. For the record, voluntary organisations might include political parties, for which some of us have worked for rather small remuneration in the past.
<P>
<H5>2.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The RNIB's evidence showed that 25 per cent. of employees in the voluntary sector are paid less than &#163;4.15 an hour, which was about half average earnings last year, with some organisations offering less than &#163;3 an hour. The RNIB says that the impact on the sector as a whole is difficult to work out, but it could mean a wage bill increase of 2 or 3 per cent. which, if we remember our earlier exchanges, is three or four times greater than that expected for Tesco or a major food retailer.
<P>
In conclusion, my hon. Friend has done the Committee a service in raising the matter now. I do not advise him to press the matter at this stage, subject to the Minister's response, but I hope that Ministers will consider the point which he has made and others may make. I stress that it is important to have a proportionate and sensible response that meets the realities of the fascinating sector that includes charities and voluntary initiatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I added my name to the amendment, but it was his inspiration that it should be moved at this point, and I think it is entirely right to do so.
<P>
I made a brief reference to the Papworth Trust in my constituency and I shall not elaborate, other than to say, for the avoidance of doubt, that some of its activities do not require the special protection offered by the amendment but operate on a wholly commercial basis. Equally, there are circumstances in which Papworth continues as the employer of those who are disabled, often jointly with another employer and providing a subsidy to that employer, who does not necessarily pay the employees anything remotely approaching the national minimum wage. There is a clear implication here, and it would be most helpful if Ministers replied to it.
<P>
I know about that particular instance, but in my experience, a number of organisations, including charity shops, often go out of their way to offer a route into employment for those who have difficulties of one kind or another, such as lack of basic skills, lack of work experience and so on. In the same way as we have elsewhere considered making special provision for those who might otherwise find it difficult to find their way into employment, the amendment offers a useful route. It might also offer a solution to some of the difficulties that I mentioned in an earlier debate in relation to the special position of some of those who work in churches.
<P>
If we do not go down this route, those who work for charities and voluntary bodies generally would have to make a clear distinction between whether they are employees or wholly voluntary workers. Even though--as my hon. Friend made clear--the remuneration may be modest, people gain a certain security out of the employment status that they acquire, for reasons of protection, insurance or a range of other factors. If we create a lack of flexibility in that respect, we may find ourselves getting into difficulties or we may find that those who are engaged in voluntary activity for modest sums are encouraged to become self-employed to escape the application of the national minimum wage. That is a considerable disincentive for those who do valuable but relatively poorly remunerated work in the voluntary sector because the process of becoming self-employed and having to declare tax, for example, is a considerable burden at which many cavil. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry suggested, it would be valuable if the Government would either accept the amendment or include its provisions in the Bill by another means. If they fail to do so, difficulties might proliferate.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): When I first read the amendments I knew that I should listen with great interest to the justification that lay behind them, and I wondered whether I might be convinced that they are the right way forward. Nothing that I have heard this evening--or perhaps I should say this morning--has convinced me.
<P>
I am actively involved in the voluntary sector--I have been for many years--and I am one of the officers of the all-party charities and voluntary sector group. Opposition Members spoke about registered charities and the voluntary sector, but the amendment refers only to registered charities. It is ludicrous to discriminate in that way--it involves saying, for example, that staff from Greenpeace and from Amnesty International will be entitled to the minimum wage and that staff from Friends of the Earth and from Oxfam will not be entitled to it. That drives a coach and horses though the amendment.
<P>
There is an assumption that the only reason for working is to earn money. That is not the only motivation for people who work in the voluntary sector or for charities--they have altruistic reasons for working as well as the need to pay the mortgage, like the rest of us. Such people do not appreciate the Opposition's argument. They have the same bills and expenses, but the fact that they choose to work in the voluntary sector, and are fortunate enough to do so, should not inhibit them from receiving a decent rate of pay. Charities constitute a very small part of the voluntary sector, but with regard to the application of the national minimum wage there is no difference between charities and the voluntary sector.
<P>
Charities' views of the amendment--and of the move to discriminate, in a sense, against employees of charities--are as important as the views of Members of Parliament. Various surveys and independent polls have been undertaken. The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned a report by the RNIB. For the sake of accuracy, I should say a bit more about that report. It was actually produced by the policy forum of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, it is entitled ``The Minimum Wage'' and is dated 15 July 1996. It was co-authored by Steve Winyard--who was then the head of the policy unit at the RNIB--and by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond), when he was the director of the Low Pay Unit.
<P>
My analysis of the report's statistics differs somewhat from that of the hon. Member for Daventry. The electoral reform ballot service surveyed voluntary organisations and found that 79.1 per cent. of those questioned supported a national minimum wage and that only 15 per cent. opposed it. Such figures were reinforced by polls conducted by MORI and by Opinion Leader Research. The Institute of Management found that a decent wage in the voluntary sector or in charities improved staff morale and performance and lowered staff turnover. One of the great problems in the voluntary sector is the number of enthusiastic, young people who are attracted--

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Is it in order for the hon. Lady to continually quote figures relating to the voluntary sector when the amendment relates to charities? My speech was exclusively about charities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have been following the hon. Lady's remarks closely. I assume that she is responding to points that arose earlier when we discussed the report.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The distinction between charities and the voluntary sector has been clearly drawn. I want to raise matters that were not discussed by Opposition Members.
<P>
It is important to hear what charities and voluntary organisations think of the amendment. I received a letter from the National Council of Voluntary Organisations, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``NCVO wishes to distance itself from this amendment. In our submission to the Low Pay Commission, NCVO made it clear that voluntary organisations support the national minimum wage proposal. Indeed, for many charities it will help address one of the four heads of charity: the relief of poverty. The voluntary sector is not seeking an exemption from the national minimum wage provisions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Its views are based on a ballot of its members, which showed that voluntary sector workers should have the same rights as workers in other organisations.
<P>
If Opposition Members really believe that people work purely for altruistic reasons and do not deserve the decent minimum wage that is available in other sectors of employment, they must give a far stronger justification for their views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I was fascinated by the hon. Lady's contribution, and in particular by her enthusiasm for plebiscitary democracy. Labour Back Benchers do not seem to be bothered about it in other contexts. One could argue that people who work for charities want the national minimum wage to be applied at a uniform rate. One could also argue the toss by asking other people whether they want the national minimum wage to be applied in their sector--perhaps only to a specific category of employees in that sector. However, the hon. Lady was not interested in public opinion in such contexts.
<P>
My hon. Friends argued the case for amendments Nos. 28 and 30 with conviction and grace. Labour Members who opposed them have not done justice to the amendments or to those who spoke in favour of them.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that the implication of our argument was that people either did not want the national minimum wage or did not deserve it. The question is not of wanting or deserving but of the ability of those organisations to pay that wage. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that in some cases that simply was not a practicable proposition. People who work for charitable organisations that cannot afford to pay them at the rate of the national minimum wage do so partly for money and partly for the sense of satisfaction that their work brings.
<P>
I have personal experience of people who work for a modest consideration for charity shops and who would not do so if the national minimum wage applied. A constituent of mine raised that matter at a public meeting that she and her husband attended before the general election. Our discussion long predated the Bill's publication. She is fortunate enough to have other means of support, so she can afford to work for a modest sum per hour--it is rather lower than the rate at which the national minimum wage is likely to be fixed. She works for that modest consideration partly because she feels that she is getting something for the work that she does--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Does she work as the hon. Gentleman's cleaner?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that most helpful and constructive invervention. I must answer him in the negative. My cleaner is an admirable lady who goes by the name of Linda, and she lives in central London. The lady to whom I refer does not live in London.
<P>
<H5>2.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I explained to the Minister if he was listening--I accept that it is half past two in the morning--that lady is a constituent of mine. It follows logically that she resides within the boundaries of the Buckingham parliamentary constituency. I will not go any wider, Mrs. Dunwoody, as I would be subject to your strictures, but it so happens that she works for a charity shop within the confines of the constituency. She works partly for the modest sum she receives but rather more for the stimulation and sense of satisfaction that she derives from her work. She is helping the community.
<P>
I know of many other people in a similar position. If the charity shop had to pay her at the rate of the national minimum wage, as certain as night follows day, her job would cease to exist. If Government Back Benchers are saying that there are no other examples, it is an extraordinary thesis. It is quite a peculiar notion that only I have a constituent to whom this applies. Of course there are examples right across the country in a whole variety of constituencies of people who have other means and earn a modest crust by working in a public spirited way for a charity. It might be a charity shop or some other sort of charitable institution.
<P>
Such people do decent work, receive modest reward and if they had to be paid at the national minimum wage, they simply would not be paid at all. With all due respect to the extremely good natured hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith), my hon. Friends and I could not give a tinker's cuss whether she can cite an organisation that has passed a motion saying that it disapproves of the amendment or that has written her a letter to that effect. Some of the organisations that Labour Members are inclined to quote in their support are well known to have been packed with left-wing political activists. We are therefore not terribly interested in their views. I am interested in the--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to slide away with ``tinker's cuss'' but he must not push his luck. I mean this seriously. If there is a wide debate on the amendments, there will not be a clause stand part debate. I made the rules quite clear and I leave it to hon. Members to decide whether to stick to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mrs. Dunwoody. I intend to follow it in my own way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will follow it in my way or not at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Of course I will follow your directions, Mrs. Dunwoody. What I meant, and I meant no discourtesy in saying that I would follow it in my own way, was that of the two options that you kindly offered, I was minded to go for one or the other. I hope that you will take that to be following your exhortation directly.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> You have lost it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have not lost anything. The hon. lady is in danger of losing my constituent her job. That is a matter of the most animated importance for me. I do not want her to lose her job or others in a comparable position to lose their jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards (Monmouth)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) who is in an excited and eager state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Buckingham. Would he tell the Committee which charity shop Linda works for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I should like to do so but I cannot. I know that it is now 2.33 am but the hon. Gentleman had to follow only two examples: my cleaner and the lady who works for the charity shop. He has mixed them up. Linda is the cleaner, not the one who works in the charity shop. I leave the hon. Gentleman to reflect on his mistake. I simply support the amendments and I rest my case upon that basis.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member's involvements with various ladies are quite fascinating but not instructive. Could we return to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As I had just explained, I support the amendments. I have concluded my remarks and of course, Mrs. Dunwoody, you will be relieved about that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chair is never relieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I am not sure that I can help you there, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am now relieved and happy, even if you are not. I shall try to assist by rushing through this.
<P>
I will respond in a charitable way. I do not think that there is anyone in the Committee who has not personally been involved in work for charitable or voluntary organisations, either within the context of their family or as an individual, although we will leave out the hon. Member for Buckingham's Monday Club adventures for the purposes of this debate. In general terms, we are all committed to the concept and principle of volunteering in the community.
<P>
Many voluntary and charitable organisations were set up for the relief of poverty and to help people who had been isolated or marginalised. Some people might therefore find it difficult to understand why organisations set up for the purposes of relieving poverty should perpetuate it, which is what Conservatives call for when they say that charities should not pay their workers a national minimum wage.
<P>
There are about 320,000 full-time equivalent employees of registered charities in the United Kingdom. That not insignificant number of people are employed by charities to ensure that the voluntary part of the charity operates effectively. That is a marrying of arrangements; full-time resources are available to charities to ensure that volunteers operate effectively. Charities understand that, as should Opposition Members.
<P>
Issues relating to people with special needs have also been raised. I worked in special needs for many years before entering the House. I still have a keen interest in it and I am still the president of a charity that works in special needs. I will return to these issues in a moment.
<P>
The issues relating to volunteers are specifically covered by clause 41. In response to the hon. Member for Daventry, I say that I will reflect on our discussions tonight about volunteers so that when we debate clause 41 it will ensure that genuine volunteers, who work for no payment at all or for genuine expenses, are not included within the provisions of the Bill. I will ensure that the Bill is drafted sufficiently vigorously to ensure that no one who is a genuine volunteer is covered by the national minimum wage. The Government do not intend that they should be.
<P>
I shall now say why we will oppose amendments Nos. 28 and 30. Amendment No. 28 paves the way for amendment No. 30, and discriminates by sector employment against persons employed by registered charities. Amendment No. 30 is an arbitrary and unjustified amendment for a number of reasons. A charity worker is of equal value, and often it is said that he is of greater value, to the well-being of the community as other workers. Why should genuinely employed workers face the risk of being exempted from the minimum wage simply because they work for a charity? Opposition Members know that charities are extremely diverse in their functions: there are 180,000 registered charities and another 180,000 non-registered charities. Therefore charities form a diverse group of organisations. For example, a cleaner in a centre providing leisure facilities, a teacher working for an independent school and a care provider may all work for different charities. The amendment would achieve the absurd result that such workers could be exempted from the national minimum wage while their occupational counterparts, who do not work in charities, would be entitled to a minimum wage.
<P>
Conservative Members are always keen to ensure that market forces can let rip; they should therefore reflect that the amendment could also create a distortion in competition. Registered charities might compete with commercial bodies, or with a local authority, for the provision of local authority services, and would be exempted from paying proper rates of pay by the operation of this clause if the amendment were passed. Such charities would still be able to compete for the provision of services, many of which would be for vulnerable people in the community.
<P>
By contrast, one reason why the Government wish to introduce a national minimum wage is to create a level playing field. Some will claim that charities should be exempted to prevent them from going bust. We are not forcing charities to pay their volunteers the national minimum wage: they will be exempt. However, I see no reason why their workers should not be entitled to it. It is not just my view. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon said that not only does the NCVO wish to dissociate itself from the amendments, but that in its submissions to the Low Pay Commission it supported the establishment of a national minimum wage. Therefore, charities support the concept of a national minimum wage in principle and will support its implementation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I appreciate that the Minister of State is adopting a constructive and sensitive tone in these deliberations. First, I did not advocate to the Committee a general exemption for charities, although my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge may wish to comment on that. Secondly, given some of the points that I made about the impact of an exemption, will the Minister at least consider in conjunction with the Low Pay Commission--or invite it to consider and report to him--whether there might be a case for delayed implementation in respect of charities with a historic pattern of employment, that may be hard hit by the clause? I am not asking to move from the principle of equal treatment, but there may be a case for a longer phasing-in period. I hope that he will take that point away and think about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> If the organisations are concerned about that, I am sure that they will have included it in their evidence to the Low Pay Commission, which may or may not weight it in its recommendations. However, it is clear from the evidence sent to the commission and then to Ministers--I have not seen it all, but only what has been sent to us--that that sector has no problem about the principle of establishing or implementing a national minimum wage for charities and voluntary organisations.
<P>
I tried to make the important distinction between volunteers and full-time employees at the start of the debate. That brings me to a couple of points. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised two issues which I believe are worth addressing. I do not mean that the rest were not. He referred to volunteer charity workers raising resources by selling raffle tickets for prizes. Again I know from experience that volunteers give their time and effort. At local, regional and national level, charities increasingly employ somebody full time to co-ordinate that effort, set up the competitions and schemes and deal with the sponsorship and all that goes with the fundraising. That person is responsible for an army of volunteers in the local community, across the region or nationally. That is understood. I would expect the person or persons with that responsiblity to be paid the national minimum wage, but I see the others as volunteers. I shall take into account what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said when we reach clause 41.
<P>
The other issue concerns people with severe disability and therapeutic earnings. We are not excluding people on the basis of disabilities. We wait to see whether there is any evidence from the Low Pay Commission, but the concept in principle is clear: people should not be excluded on the ground of their disability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Opposition Members are in no sense seeking a general disapplication on the ground of disability, so we are at one on that.The issue, therefore, comes down to therapeutic earnings.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We are talking about the nature of the work, the environment in which it is undertaken, its purpose and whether there is an arrangement in respect of people's dexterity and their sensory, physical or mental deprivation. In such a complex area, on some occasions repetitive activity can be seen to constitute work, or the work can be seen as educational in terms of the individual's overall needs or as part of his care package, or he may simply do work for which the charity receives payment.
<P>
There can be two forms of payment here. One is where a charity receives a payment from an organisation as sponsorship and, in return, activities take place involving the company, either with the company's own staff or with volunteers at day or other centres. Last year I came across a case, unfortunately in my own area, where work was carried out under a discriminatory arrangement for as little as &#163;1 a week. The job was being done by people with severe learning disabilities, supervised by non-disabled adults who received a significant sum of money. The &#163;1 was then added to the disabled person's therapeutic earnings. To be fair to the company concerned, it did not realise that it was involved in a contractual arrangement. Such an arrangement is exploitative and is not acceptable.
<P>
<H5>2.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry's point is one that we all accept. Therapeutic earnings and therapeutic activities for people with severe disabilities raise complex issues. The hon. Gentleman was right: neither side of the Committee wants to include in the Bill a process by which people with disabilities are automatically excluded. I do not know whether the Low Pay Commission will make proposals. If it does, we shall look at them on the basis that we see no grounds at this stage for excluding people from the minimum wage on the basis of disability or to allow people in a contractual arrangement to be exploited because of their severe disability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister of State is being most generous about giving way on this important matter, on which the Committee is feeling its way towards consensus. Does he accept that another consideration is the level of personal income available to people who, for example, are living in registered residential care and go out to work for therapeutic reasons? That consideration may well be a factor, because such work is severely limited by statute and by the terms of their public support in residential care. I hope that the Minister of State will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I know of circumstances where such people are rightly paid a market rate. In a range of organisations, such as Remploy and other workshops, people are paid a proper rate for the job. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but I would not use it as a generality to exclude people with disabilities from the minimum wage.
<P>
I hope, therefore, that, following my remarks, the hon. Gentleman will not wish to press his amendments to a vote. If he does, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist it. I hope that I have responded in a helpful way.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might be convenient to suspend the Committee again. On this occasion I shall suspend it for an hour. I expect everyone to return at 10 minutes to 4 o'clock.
