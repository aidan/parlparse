wish to make a few brief introductory remarks. I welcome you, Mr Chope,
to the Chair. It will be a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship and, indeed, that of Mr Caton. I note that you have
already highlighted the document boxes, which you described as one of
the privileges for members of the Committee; I am sure that they look
forward to discovering what other privileges there are, if any. I know
that you will provide your usual sage guidance and, while we tackle a
somewhat technical Bill, I am sure that you will ensure that our
deliberations are kept to the point. I also wish to extend my welcome
to Mr Patrick, Clerk to the Committee, who will be assisting
you.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000019">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
has been a political year, given the general election and the many
contentious issues that face the country, and I am pleased to welcome
to the Committee the hon. Members on the Opposition Benches. I
congratulate the right hon. Member for Delyn and the hon. Members for
Nottingham East and for Bristol East on their appointments as shadow
Treasury spokespeople. They will no doubt delight at the opportunity to
be members of many more Public Bill Committees in respect of Finance
Bills, although I hope that they enjoy doing so from the Opposition
side of the room, as I did for many years. Furthermore, I am sure that
they and the Committee as a whole will be served admirably 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>by their hon. Friends on the Opposition Benches. This Bill is shorter
than most Finance Bills; none the less, I am sure that hon. Members
serving for the first time in Committee will find it a
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have certainly not forgotten the hon. Member for Strangford, who I know
will forcefully represent the views of Democrat Unionists. I shall be
joined in later proceedings by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury,
my hon. Friend the Member for Putney, and I know that she will want to
extend her welcome to our hon. Friends, all of whom will be considering
the Finance Bill for the first time, and also to our coalition
partners, the hon. Members for Bristol West and for Solihull. I look
forward to hearing enthralling and valuable contributions from them
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
Finance Bill, more than most, has been a product of consultation and
deliberation. Given that 97% of it was proposed by the previous
Government, I hope that those on the Opposition Benches are already
familiar with the details. We also consulted on the Bill during the
summer and received more than 40 responses. I thank all those who
worked with the Treasury and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
on the preparation of the Bill, especially those who prepared the draft
legislation; the Bill is the better for that. I look forward to our
deliberations over the next week and a half, and I am sure that the
Committee will approach the Bill with fortitude and
dedication.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000022">&#160;</a>

welcome the Minister’s initial comments on the proceedings
today. He is right to say that the Bill is, in large part, a Labour
Government Bill that he has inherited. Although we will scrutinise it
over the next few sittings, we agree with much of it. As the Minister
will recognise, it is still the duty of the Opposition to table
amendments, to test the Government’s thinking and to ensure
that, even with the perfection that the Labour Government put in place,
the Bill will be practicable and deliverable on the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000024">&#160;</a>

welcome my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham East and for Bristol

Treasury team. I also welcome the Labour Whip, my hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham, and my hon. Friends the Members for Islwyn, for
Edinburgh East and for Wirral South, who are serving on a Public Bill
Committee for the first time. I know that Members on the Government
Benches will also enjoy the Committee, and I look forward to their
possible contributions. However, having served in Government myself, I
know that there is often a remit for Government Back Benchers, and they
do not necessarily contribute as much as they might like. We will see
whether any contributions are
forthcoming.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000025">&#160;</a>

thank the Committee for providing a red document box—it is the
first red box I have had since May. It is a great pleasure to get one
again, and I will give it back in due

                           </div>important that we consider that motion in context before we finally
agree it. I have some concerns, which have arisen since their

support much of the Bill, but we want to test
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000027">&#160;</a>

are sitting today, this morning and this afternoon. According to the
sittings motion, we will not be sitting this Thursday—presumably
because of the pressures over the comprehensive spending review on
Wednesday and the overflow from it. Potentially, we will be sitting on
Tuesday morning and afternoon and Thursday morning and afternoon next
week. Since my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham discussed this
matter with the Government Whip, the business of the House has been
announced for Tuesday and Thursday next week. That will be Treasury-led
business, on which my hon. Friends from both the Front and Back Benches
may wish to make contributions on the Floor of the House, as they
follow such matters with
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000028">&#160;</a>

for West Ham, for Bristol East and for Nottingham East and me; and, not
least, for the Back-Bench Members on both sides, including the hon.

the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill is being taken
on the Floor of the House on Tuesday, we will be at the
Committee’s afternoon sitting, which will presumably commence at
4.30 and go through to 7 pm. If there is no statement in the House, the
debate on that Bill will commence at about 3.30 and go through to 10
pm, as is usual for a Second Reading debate. I have studied that Bill
with some interest; there are interesting matters in it about which my
hon. Friends the Members for Bristol East and for Nottingham East, and
my other hon. Friends and I, would wish to say a few words on the Floor
of the House. Yet we might find ourselves sitting in this Committee

do not know about you, Mr Chope—I would not wish to draw you
into this political debate in any way, shape or form—but the
abolition of the maternity grant of £190 to mothers at their
25th week of pregnancy is a matter of concern to Labour Members. That
will be a major issue, on which we will contest the Government during
the next few weeks and months. Mothers receive the health in pregnancy

                           </strong> I raise those important matters because we find
ourselves in two places at once. There are matters before the
Committee, but equally there are important matters on the Floor of the
House about which we wish to comment. We wish to discuss the Savings
Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Abolition of
the health in pregnancy grant is a key issue, as is the abolition of
the child trust fund in the same Bill. We debated that matter
previously in Committee, but the abolition of that fund will be
enshrined in the Bill. I dealt with the initial discussions on the
child trust 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                           </div>fund in Committee, and we stopped the payments to new entrants several
weeks ago. I wish to deal with that matter on the Floor of the House,
yet I find that I cannot be there for the opening speeches or
contributions, although I could be giving the winding-up speech on the
evening in
question.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Without
testing your patience too much, Mr Chope, dare I mention the abolition
of the saving gateway scheme in that same Bill? It should have been
available from July 2010 but has now been frozen and will potentially
be abolished by the Government. In that Bill on Tuesday, saving
gateways, child trust funds and maternity grants are big key issues, of
which Labour Members were proud. We wished to see those issues
developed, but the current Government are now pledged to abolish them.
In my view, that will hit some of the poorest people who most need
those
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
I move on to Thursday, I want to remind the Minister that next Tuesday
there is a major Bill that hits poor people hardest. Labour Members
wish to oppose it, but we will find ourselves in here as members of
this Committee dealing with important Finance Bill matters. We will
find ourselves as Treasury spokespeople dealing with issues in two
places at once.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000036">&#160;</a>

comprehensive spending review announcements come tomorrow, and on
Thursday next week we will have a full day’s debate on the Floor
of the House, probably commencing around 12.30 or 1 o’clock.
Again, we will find ourselves—three Treasury shadow
spokespeople, the Labour Treasury Whip and interested parties on
Labour’s Back Benches—with two Ministers and the Treasury
Whip in this Committee from 1 o’clock until 4 o’clock
next Thursday afternoon, while there is a major debate on the
comprehensive spending review on the Floor of the House. Again, without
wishing to widen the debate too much, I simply say that a potential 50%
cut has been announced in public sector housing allocations for the
relevant Government

want to know how we are going to fund prison places and community-based
sentences if we are facing a 30% cut at the Ministry of Justice. As the
former Minister with responsibility for policing and counter-terrorism,
I want to know what the expenditure on policing will be given that we
face a potential 20% to 25% cut in policing and the loss of 16,000
police officers.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000040">&#160;</a>

Mr Chope, because it is important that we consider the
sittings motion before us. I have tried to tailor my remarks around
that motion. The Committee will be discussing the Bill’s 33
clauses and the 14 schedules to it. Those measures relate to important
issues. Although there is large-scale agreement, we have tabled
amendments so that we can discuss particular points of
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000045">&#160;</a>

are in a position in which there are two big debates relating to
important matters for our constituents to which we wish to contribute.
Without wishing to politicise this too much, the proposals in both the
Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grants Bill and the
comprehensive spending review will hit our constituents and the poorest
in society hard. They contain unfair choices and cuts in public
spending. Those cuts tackle a deficit that we need to tackle, but they
are too quick, too deep, unfair and inappropriate. Those are issues
that we will want to debate on the Floor of the House.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000046">&#160;</a>

look at my suggestions in a positive way? We could allow our sitting to
continue today as planned so that the matter can be discussed through

spending review. Since I became a Member of Parliament, that is what
people have contacted me about most, in addition to some of the

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right that there is a
great deal of trepidation and concern about the impact of the
comprehensive spending review. Indeed, I have also received
representations on the child trust fund, health in pregnancy grants,
the savings gateway and other matters—those issues are
important. Although the comprehensive spending review will be announced
tomorrow and we do not yet know what it will contain, I read the
papers, so I have seen the Government machine gently indicating some of
the directions of travel. Even today, Treasury spokespeople wish to
debate housing grant cuts, policing and justice cuts, today’s
defence review, the potential child benefit changes and the winter fuel
allowance, which might be hit. My Back-Bench colleagues in Committee
may also wish to contribute, but there seems to be a clash.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000050">&#160;</a>

welcome the Minister’s initial view on whether he regards that
as a problem, because we do. I would like some discussion about this,
and I would also welcome hearing the views of my hon. Friends about
whether they, too, see it as a problem. I hope that the matter can be
resolved, either outside the room today or through some other
discussion and arrangement. I do not feel that we can proceed with the

there are five House of Commons Treasury Ministers and five House of

look at everything that we do to try to work as efficiently as possible
and achieve more for less, it is not unreasonable for the Treasury and
shadow Treasury teams also to improve productivity and efficiency and
to be capable of dealing with two matters at the same time. We believe

                           </strong> As I say, there is always a difficulty for Members
because there will always be plenty of things occurring at the same

conscious, as the right hon. Member for Delyn rightly said, that the
Bill is largely non-contentious. He is right to say that Opposition
Members should test the Bill by tabling amendments, making speeches and
asking searching questions about it. However, I see no reason why
Opposition Members, who include highly capable shadow Ministers, should
not be able to deal with the Bill as well as organising themselves so
there is sufficient cover in the Chamber to address the matters that
the right hon. Gentleman raises. Consequently, I am not persuaded by
his argument, however eloquently and passionately he put it, that we
need to change the sittings
motion.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have listened to the Minister, but I still think
that there is an argument for us to look at the matter positively. This
is no reflection on the discussions and negotiations that have taken
place between my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and the hon.
Member for Scarborough and Whitby, but I think that a significant
change has occurred since the initial discussions were held. I suggest
to the Minister that we look at amending the motion so that we can meet
his objective of completing our proceedings on the Bill in reasonable
time and also allow Members on both sides of the Committee to
contribute to the two important debates on the Savings Accounts and
Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill and the

                           </div>comprehensive spending review. The Committee could then still consider
the Finance (No. 2) Bill in a fruitful and productive
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If you will
allow me, Mr Chope, I would like to table the following amendment: at
the end of the Government’s motion, insert, “except that
there shall be no afternoon sittings on Tuesday 26 and Thursday 28
October.” That would give us the option of two sittings on 2
November, which is the Tuesday following. Our proceedings might
conclude on the morning of 2 November. They might even be completed as
early as the morning of Thursday 28 October—we do not know; we
go at the pace we go.  I do not want to cause the Minister
trepidation, so I should say that we could finish the Bill on Thursday
morning next week without needing to sit on 2 November. However, if we
are faced with sittings on the afternoons of Tuesday and Thursday next
week, when the House considers the CSR and the health in pregnancy
grants Bill, it might be that my hon. Friends and I will find details
in the Finance (No. 2) Bill that we will wish to test even more than we
might have
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not think that anything would be lost by accepting an amendment that
would allow us to clear Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. We could then
attend the health in pregnancy debate and stand up for our constituents
who are being unfairly hit by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
Government on pregnancy grants, on the savings gateway and on child
trust funds. We could also stand up for them on issues to do with cuts
in housing, defence, police and justice, and on tackling the deficit.
The Government could get their Bill as early as next Thursday
afternoon, and certainly no later than Tuesday 2 November. I commend
such an amendment to the Committee and ask whether my hon. Friends or
other Members wish to speak to it.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000060">&#160;</a>

am particularly concerned about the position of all Back-Bench Members
in respect of such debates, because our ability to put forward the
views of our constituents and the issues that we have been taking up
depends on our presence in the Chamber to indicate that we want to be
part of the debate. In some ways, I think the position of Back Benchers
is more difficult than that of Front Benchers, who can divide up
responsibility for who is going to be where. These are extremely
important issues. For example, I made a point in a Westminster Hall
debate last week about the number of affordable homes being built and
said that the best way to reduce the housing benefit bill would be to
build more affordable homes. I was told by coalition Members that if
the Government of my party had built more homes, there would not be a
problem. To hear this morning that the amount being spent on affordable
homes might be halved suggests that if our record in building homes was
not as good as I would like, the coalition Members who made that
comment last week will have to explain why they are supporting their
Government’s proposal.

move forward on a satisfactory basis whereby we will have an
opportunity to express ourselves on behalf of our constituents. I
certainly want the opportunity to participate fully in next

the opportunity to do so. It is not too much for any of us to ask that

usual channels may discuss the matter—that might be helpful. I
served on 24 Bill Committees as a Minister, and I was involved in
probably 10 or 11 others as an Opposition Member when John Major was
Prime Minister, so I think that I am in order in asking for such an
suspension. If that proposal is not accepted, however, I will press the
amendment to a Division it because it would give us scope to meet our

                           </strong> I am sorry that we had such a brief debate on the
sittings motion. I was surprised that many Government Members did not
express their views. Hopefully, we will hear more from them during the
meat—the substance—of the Bill, as we proceed through it.
I was hoping that the Minister would take the opportunity to set out to
the Committee the substance of clause 1, but I will make my few brief
points first in the hope that he will respond to those and that the
Committee will then be able to ask the Minister questions if further
issues
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I understand it, clause 1 amends the Income Tax (Trading and Other
Income) Act 2005 to modernise and update the arrangements for adult
placement care and to ensure that the various expenses and tax
exemptions are relevant to contemporary circumstances, including the
short-term nature of foster care and adult placement
care.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
all hon. Members will know from their postbags and constituency work,
being a carer is an enormous commitment requiring a great deal of
patience, understanding and hard work. It offers young people and
adults who need support because of their health or disability a
valuable opportunity to live with people who can give them the help
that they need. They can share their hobbies and interests with them,
enjoy family life and fulfil their potential to the full.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
given the rather circular nature of the time frame in which we are
considering the Bill, the measures have their origin in a Labour
Administration. I am proud of the fact that there are measures to
clarify and simplify the tax treatment of both foster care and shared
lives care, to ensure that the costs, expenses and capital allowances
are recognised more fairly by the tax
system.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
care, support and accommodation for people who need help owing to a
learning, physical and/or sensory disability, or perhaps mental health
problems, can be costly. Carers are specially recruited, particularly
in respect of shared lives care, to provide services in their own
homes. That is a positive initiative because not only does it result in
less institutionalisation of those in care but it provides respite
breaks for families of carers—or, perhaps, cover that would
otherwise cause great strain on families and carers during
emergencies.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 14<a class="bkMark" name="Column14">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
arrangement also helps to prepare individuals for independent living
and independent lifestyles, so it is proper for the Government and
Parliament to support and encourage such arrangements. I want to place
on the record my own tribute to those among my constituents and across
the country who give their time and efforts to be a carer, either for
an adult in the shared lives placement or in foster care. They make an
incredibly important
contribution.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
definitions are set out and we will discuss the first schedule to the
Bill later; that sets out some of the arrangements. My points to the
Minister are as follows. Can he tell the Committee how many shared
lives care arrangements the reliefs will apply to? It was not clear to
me, either from the explanatory notes or from associated discussions on
the Bill, how many people and families might be falling underneath
those particular taxation arrangements. A bit of context would be
useful, if the Minister can gather some
inspiration.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
a similar way, I wonder whether any work is being done in the Treasury,
the Department for Work and Pensions or other Government Departments to
project trends in future volumes that might also exist. It is all very
well having a snapshot of how many people we are talking about at one
particular time, but given the complexity of the tax relief
arrangements, I hope that there will be some methodology or way of
predicting what the trends in such arrangements might be. We know from
the 1980s care in the community arrangements that over the decades care
arrangements can change and evolve. I would expect that this more
pioneering form of care—the shared lives placement
arrangements—might burgeon and grow in future, so I wonder
whether there is facility for that in the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
a technical point, can the Minister say whether the provisions relate
to the UK as a whole or only to England? Again, it was not clear to me
how the provisions relate. Obviously, certain matters are devolved, but
that was a specific point that I thought the Minister might know. I
wonder whether the Minister has had any other representations from
organisations about associated issues related to the costs of foster
care, adoptive care, shared lives placements and so forth. In that
respect, there is a series of clauses to the Bill, which are probably
some of the most substantive of the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
have made a number of points. I was talking to my hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham, for instance. She highlighted casework that she
had dealt with about anomalies for parents who are involved in foster
and adoptive care. For example, statutory adoption pay is available
only to people in full-time employment and not to those in casual or
self-employment. There is a whole set of anomalies that needs to be
addressed in respect of the treatment of reliefs and  the
grants available to carers. I will be interested to hear the
Minister’s comments on such matters.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry if I caught the hon. Member for
Nottingham East by surprise, but I am sure that the Committee was
anxious to hear from him in full early on. It is a pleasure to respond
to the points and questions that he has raised.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 1
introduces schedule 1, which extends the existing relief for foster
carers by replacing it with broader qualifying care relief. The changes
simplify the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 15<a class="bkMark" name="Column15">&#160;</a>
                           </div>computation profits for tax purposes by allowing carers to apply a
notional amount of relief rather than having to keep track of all the
expenses of providing care. That is done by calculating the relief by
reference to the number of people who are placed with the carer and it
is a simple and clear way of calculating profits for tax
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The changes
will greatly assist those who operate on a small scale. Using
qualifying care relief will encompass many carers who have benefited
from the approach on a concessionary basis. The hon. Gentleman asked
how many people will benefit as a consequence of the changes, or how
many will fall within the category. The answer is about 8,000 carers.
We are ensuring that their tax affairs are on a firm statutory
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The measure
may be familiar to some Opposition Members. As with many of the other
provisions in this “housekeeping” Bill, it was announced
by the previous Government at last year’s pre-Budget report.
Draft legislation was then published for comment. I believe that the
change is worth while and welcome, so I have proceeded with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As part of
this Government’s work to improve tax policy making, however,
the clause—like all the others—was published in July to
allow for additional consultation, which has been helpful. The measure
has been received favourably by carers and their representatives,
including The Fostering Network, and National Association of Adult
Placement Schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One change
has been made to the schedule, to clarify its meaning, that also
relates directly to the subject of consultation. In its draft form, the
relief might have been construed as applying to other sources of
income, so two commas were added to ensure that it can be applied only
to income received from caring. I am sure that the hon. Member for
Nottingham East will have spotted that, so I have saved his having to
highlight it in the debate on the schedule. The change demonstrates
some of the benefits of
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause has been welcomed by both sides and will offer greater certainty
to many carers. At the Budget, we announced that the rule change will
take effect this tax year. The relieving clause has retrospective
effect to 6 April 2010, which I am sure will not be too much of a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that the hon. Gentleman will understand that the trend in the number of
carers is not a matter for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
Local authorities hold data on the number of carers; HMRC, which
administers the relief, deals only with the tax effects and the
payments. In answer to another of the hon. Gentleman’s
questions, I should say that the measure covers the whole of the UK. I

the Minister’s answer that it is not for HRMC to project future
volumes or look at such issues, whether he and his officials have been
in consultation with local authorities across England and with the
Scottish Executive, for instance. With whom in those particular
organisations has the consultation taken place to make these
arrangements?<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000119">&#160;</a>

implies that there is a potential burden being moved in the direction
of local authorities to make planning arrangements, even though, as I
understand it, the revenue implications will certainly fall on the
Treasury. If he was not undertaking projections in-house, at least
there would be some ongoing dialogue with the people who he says are
responsible for the day-to-day running and projections of these
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000120">&#160;</a>

the Minister return to the issue about the statutory adoption

Gentleman was right to ask about consultation with local authorities.
Of course HMRC consults local authorities as appropriate, and as I
mentioned in my remarks, the legislation has been out for consultation.
It was first published at the time of last year’s pre-Budget
report and it was republished in July, when we published the draft
Bill. It was out for consultation for eight weeks. So there have been
plenty of opportunities for local authorities to make their views
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000123">&#160;</a>

the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, which addresses the
way in which the shared lives care tax relief arrangements propose to
treat a group of siblings—brothers and sisters—placed in
the same household as though it was a single placement, no matter how
many brothers or sisters are actually placed in the household. Clearly,
while there might be ease-of-administration reasons why HMRC wishes to
restrict the relief in that particular way, there are surely additional
burdens and costs that grow according to the number of related shared
lives placements, especially if the people involved are adults. It
might be preferable to reflect that in some way in the tax relief
system. I can imagine, for instance, that when there are two
individuals physically together, while it is important to keep the
family unit happy and cohesive, there is obviously an additional burden
on the carers

			Column number: 17<a class="bkMark" name="Column17">&#160;</a>
                           </div>involved. It would be regrettable if we unwittingly
put into the system a disincentive to keep a family together. I would
have thought that there would be worth and value in ensuring that there
was some reflection of the fact that an opportunity to keep brothers
and sisters together as a family unit, albeit moving into adulthood, is
something the system should
reflect.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate that this is a probing amendment, and
I am sure that I can provide the reassurance for which the hon.
Gentleman is looking. Amendment 1 would remove subsection (6) of
proposed new section 804A of the Income Tax (Trading and
Other Income) Act 2005, as introduced by schedule 1 to the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new section deals with the placement cap, which focuses the relief on
small-scale arrangements by limiting the availability of the relief to
arrangements where no more than three people are cared for at a
time. Subsection (6), which covers siblings, qualifies the
terms of this limit so that if a carer provides shared lives care for a
family group, that will not automatically mean that the placement cap
is exceeded. It achieves that by treating siblings as if they were one
person for the purposes of establishing whether the placement cap has
been exceeded. Without subsection (6), a carer looking after four
siblings would exceed the placement cap. This subsection therefore
preserves the entitlement to relief in those
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Nottingham East rightly said that it would be
regrettable if there was a disincentive to keep families together. The
provision ensures that families can be kept together. It is worth
noting—this might be the hon. Gentleman’s
concern—that siblings are not treated as one person when
determining the amount of relief available to the carer. For these
purposes, the carer would treat each sibling as a separate person for
whom qualifying care was provided so that the appropriate amount of
relief could be
calculated.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand that the Opposition want to ensure that there is fair
treatment for carers, as we do, but I think that they might have
misunderstood the purpose of subsection (6). It does not penalise
carers; quite the contrary, it ensures that the placement cap, which
affects the relief that they receive, is not exceeded should carers
look after siblings. I hope that that explanation is satisfactory to
the hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000133">&#160;</a>

carers who look after brothers and sisters will not be financially
worse off for doing so compared with if they looked after non-siblings
or another set of individuals. I think that he is nodding his assent,
which is extremely welcome. I do not know whether other organisations
will have observations to make on those points but, given the

the Treasury It raises issues that were first highlighted by the
Chartered Institute of Taxation, which hosts a low incomes tax reform
group. It made its representations in June, pointing out that one group
of carers might lose out under the proposed changes. Mr
Robin Williamson, the technical director of the LITRG,
asserted:<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Specifically,
paragraph 12(2) of the schedule sets a new weekly amount for an adult
of £250, which I think stands in contrast to the £400 a
week received for the first child in a foster care scenario. I would
welcome the Minister walking the Committee through exactly how those
arrangements will apply, especially in the different circumstances of
shared lives placements versus foster
care.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand that the new fixed amount per residence is worth while, but
there are circumstances in which some carers who look after both foster
children and an adult placement might lose out. That could be the
intent of the Treasury, but I doubt it, or it could be a drafting
anomaly. Carers in such circumstances might well risk losing the
enhanced weekly amount of £400 under the new rules, when they
would have been entitled to it previously. The proposal creates a
problem for the particular set of carers who have looked after a number
of young people, perhaps some of whom have passed the age of 18. The
guillotine age of majority issue does not necessarily change the
circumstances of the care that young people require when they move from
the ages of 16, 17 and 18 to 19. Even though young people have passed
the age of 18, they might still require home support although they are
technically
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
circumstances can occur relatively frequently, and such carers might
find themselves in the predicament whereby they lose tax relief on
income of up to £7,800 per year, which is £400 weekly
minus the new amount of £250, multiplied by 52 weeks. That, in
turn, could create a tax burden at the basic rate of
£1,560—money that would then not be available for use by
carers on the children and adults in their care. The Chartered
Institute of Taxation has, in particular, urged Ministers to reconsider
that aspect of the rules. It would be useful in a wider context to look
not only at the point raised by the institute, but at the importance of
the fact that the new

			Column number: 19<a class="bkMark" name="Column19">&#160;</a>
                           </div>adult placement care arrangements are coming under a relatively recent
set of tax
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
our debate on clause 1 and the changing nature of care arrangements, we
need to have an ongoing review to ensure that carers do not fall into
hardship and that they can sustain the costs involved in that care. For
young people, that can include school uniforms, sports clothing, school
equipment, travelling expenses, babysitting and childminding costs,
gifts for birthdays and Christmas, holidays, other educational costs,
glasses, playgroup fees, hobbies, sports, activities, passports,
adaptations to housing and the general well-being of the
child—they are just a few of the miscellaneous costs that will
be incurred whether a foster carer is looking after children or in
adult placement arrangements. It will be important if the Bill
underlines such principles, especially in respect of adult placement
care arrangements, which are relatively new to legislation. If we could
draw attention to such matters and hold a review, it would be
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000143">&#160;</a>

Labour Members must take responsibility for initiating such technical
changes—I am proud that we did so. However, we believe that it
would be a fair concession to allow for a review of such arrangements,
especially to test for hardship that might result from the new blanket

while.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000144">&#160;</a>

9 December 2009. The PBR stated that the changes would take effect from
6 April this year. Despite that, the measure did not feature in the

that stage, it is necessary to take it forward under the Bill that we

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
2 would commit the Treasury to publishing a review into the impact of
the shared lives legislation. It is fair to say that Government and
Opposition members of the Committee agree that bringing together
reliefs for foster care and shared lives care will benefit carers on
the whole. However, the low incomes tax reform group has raised
concerns about individuals who may claim both reliefs separately. We
believe that that is a theoretical possibility, but the reliefs are in
place to make a standard allowance for household expenses incurred, so
it would be inappropriate to make two allowances available for the same
household expenses. It was certainly never the policy intention that
individuals in a position to claim both the existing statutory relief
and the extra-statutory concession for adult placement should have an
unfair advantage.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As with any
policy, HMRC will be monitoring the legislation’s effect in
conjunction with interested parties to ensure that it operates fairly.
Although Opposition Members make an understandable point through
amendment 2, I do not think that it is appropriate for the Committee to
accept it. Ensuring that legislation is implemented fairly and properly
is important, of course, but it would be burdensome to put such a
commitment into the Bill. However, I confirm that we will ensure that
we review the measure’s implementation and discuss any cases of
hardship with representative bodies. HMRC takes such issues seriously
and has told me that it will happily receive representations on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000147">&#160;</a>

would allow carers a further year to apply the new rules. The schedule
permits carers to continue to use existing practice until 5 April 2011,
although they can choose to use the new rules from 6 April
2010. The proposals were announced almost a year ago, in December 2009,
and have been widely publicised and discussed with interested parties.
In most instances, the schedule merely has the effect of providing a
firm statutory basis for existing practice. For most carers, the
transition will be straightforward and have no appreciable effect.
Furthermore, after consultation with interested parties, HMRC will
prepare guidance, which will be published as soon as possible to
support carers in making the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000148">&#160;</a>

that the initial announcement was made in 2009 and there is the
possibility of a year’s transitional period, carers will have
ample opportunity to adapt to the new regime. Also, it would not be
appropriate for HMRC to continue extra-statutory treatment for a full
year while the parallel legislation is already in place, because that
would confuse rather than reassure.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000149">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> With the leave of the Committee, I shall return to
the Minister’s point about amendment 2. I do not quite follow
the logic that enshrining in legislation the Treasury’s
requirement to conduct a review would be burdensome in any way,
although I accept that he is on record as giving a commitment to
conduct an ongoing review to ensure that arrangements are up to date
and minimise any possible difficulties. Will he give us some indication
of what sort of review process that will be? Will officials put contact
details on the website for people to use if issues arise? Often, people
in those circumstances do not know who to make representations to, and
the large, monolithic face of the Treasury is not necessarily the
easiest to make representations to, particularly in its current
guise.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
3, which I did not dwell on sufficiently in my original comments, is
designed to build on the transitional arrangements that the Treasury
had conceived originally. The reason why we want to delete
“2011-12” and insert “2012-13” in proposed
subsection (2) is to give a two-year transition period so that those
affected can opt for the current rules instead of moving straight away
to the new arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000154">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We felt it
important at least to seek a concession from the Minister because it is
reasonable to allow that slightly longer transition to give busy
individuals and families the proper opportunity to adjust and come to
terms with the extremely complex arrangements. A two-year transitional
phase would recognise the time that it takes for families and
households to adjust their circumstances and shared life care
arrangements to the new financial regime—circumstances that
might well take many months to alter, given the human scale and the
nature of the issues at
hand.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
two years rather than one? I believe that we need to give help to
families in those particular circumstances because, although to many of
us 12 months might be ample to move house or change particular
arrangements, the financial circumstances in such arrangements require
a little bit more care and attention and, possibly, time. If the
financial arrangements are changing, the carer’s circumstances
may well have to change, and to force that change within 12 months may
prompt a premature series of changes in the carer arrangements. That
might not be particularly welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I ask the
Minister to err on the side of generosity in that respect. I do not
believe that it would have a major impact in a financial sense, but I
think it could make a vast difference to the
carers.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000157">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman’s
further remarks. As far as a review is concerned, I do not think it is
necessary to put something on the face of the Bill, nor necessarily
have a full formal review with requests for consultation. The Treasury
may have a large, monolithic face, but it and HMRC are in continuous
discussion with organisations such as the low incomes tax reform group,
and we will ensure that we discuss the implementation of this matter
with it and other interested
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000158">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
far as the transitional period is concerned, we have to remember that
the reforms are based on an existing relief. Guidance on how this works
will be published by HMRC, but in the vast majority of cases, there
will not be a substantial change to what is already in place.
Consequently, we believe that it is right to proceed. If we tried to
run a parallel system over a long time, it would cause more confusion
than it would solve. I note the concerns that have been reasonably
expressed by the hon. Gentleman, but we believe that it is right to
proceed with the reform according to the timetable in the

                           </strong> The clause provides income tax relief for
particular payments to special guardians, which I understand not to
mean those in respect of whom local authorities have legal powers in
terms of looking after children, but guardians who do not have full
adoptive rights and where there are ongoing and retained rights by
birth parents. The clause also makes changes in respect of other carers
looking after children placed under residence orders—certain
kinship carers. For those unfamiliar with the technical term, kinship
carers are grandparents, aunts, uncles and so forth who look after
children. The exemption, which I gather will be similar to the current
tax arrangement, for payments to those who have an adopted child will
apply only to qualifying carers and will have an effect on payments
received on or after 6 April. Qualifying payments are payments made in
relation to a special guardianship or residence order either by the
child’s parents, or on behalf of the local authority, to a
qualifying carer.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Qualifying
carers are those who care for a child or children placed under them
with a special guardianship or residence order when the carer is not
the child’s parent or step-parent. Kinship carers looking after
a child who has not been placed under a residence order are not
qualifying carers for the purpose of the exemption, but will be
entitled to the new income tax relief for shared lives care, as we
discussed earlier. Will the Minister explain a little more about that
treatment of kinship carer arrangements without the residence order and
why such carers would not be eligible in such circumstances? There are
currently special income tax rules for foster carers, those who have
adopted a child and shared lives
carers.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000165">&#160;</a>

have been told that the decision to tax carers who take on legal
parental responsibility for a child in a similar way to those who have
adopted a child follows informal consultation about the new income tax
relief for shared lives carers. That was set out in Budget press notice
37 when the announcement was made. Will the Minister tell the Committee
what that informal consultation about the new income tax arrangements
involved? Whom did the Treasury consult? I am slightly wary when I see
the phrase “informal consultation” in a formal policy
announcement because there is a risk that although officials have their
own particular networks, they might not extend their tentacles to
organisations that might have a worthwhile and legitimate say but are
perhaps excluded. I would prefer more formal consultation arrangements,
or at least advertising on websites that are likely to be visited by
those with a particular interest.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000166">&#160;</a>

with the relevant bodies—the Local Government Association, the
Association of Directors of Social Services and, when relevant, housing
bodies and other organisations involved in shared lives care
policy—to ensure that there is widespread notice of the changes
being made and that those new arrangements are kept under review. What

                           </div>parents. From 6 April 2010, the exemption from income tax will also
apply to similar payments made to support individuals who are not
adopters but instead provide care for a child under the terms of a
special guardianship or residence order. It brings into line the tax
treatment of payments made to support individuals who take on parental
responsibility for a child, thus putting the tax treatment of those
payments on to a sound statutory basis.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The exemption
replaces an extra-statutory arrangement that allowed a carer to
substitute a fixed rate of expenses for the actual costs of providing
care. As with clause 1, the measure was announced by the previous
Government in last year’s pre-Budget report on 9 December 2009.

the informal consultation, the hon. Member  for Nottingham East
asked whom we consulted. The organisations involved included the
Fostering Network, the National Association of Adult Placement Schemes,
the fostering and adoption team at the Scottish Executive, the low
income tax reform group, the then Department for Children, Schools and
Families and the Department of Health. I hope that that provides some
reassurance that there was considerable consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000178">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman said that he preferred a formal rather than an
informal process, but it is helpful at times to have an informal
process. Indeed, it is right that the Treasury and HMRC consult
informally as much as possible to ensure, particularly in an area with
a strong relationship with the then DCSF and the Department of Health,
that we can work across Government in a co-ordinated way. It is fair to
say that clause 2 has been welcomed. Despite the lengthy consultation,
it has not been the subject of great criticisms or

carers. At the very least, we have a complex set of provisions. In the
interests of simplification, they could be looked at again. It might be
the case that a kinship carer is eligible for relief under shared lives
care, but that is not self-evident to the average person, which might
cause difficulty. There is also a placement cap for the numbers who
might be cared for regarding shared lives care. We now have the
opportunity to look further at this huge provision of care in many
communities. A number of people perform such functions, which are
identical in practical and financial terms whether or not they are
subject to a legal order. If the Minister does  not want to
address these matters as part of the passage of this Bill, perhaps he
will give a commitment to look at them in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000180">&#160;</a>

treating a kinship carer in a different financial way from that for
other care arrangements. If necessary, we will want to return to the
issue on Report. After listening to the Minister’s illuminating

3 will correct technical anomalies in the special capital allowance
rules for foster carers and shared lives carers to ensure that the
rules operate as intended when individuals start or finish qualifying
or being elected for foster care relief. I understand that carers can
stay out of the tax regime if they earn below the individual limit for
qualifying care relief. If their earnings from the provision of care
exceed that limit, however, they can sometimes use the normal tax rules
that apply to businesses. That might seem quite unusual, given that we
are discussing carers, but such a resource can sometimes be
discussed—as we see in the explanatory notes—as though it
were a business arrangement. That can include claiming capital
allowances for certain plant and machinery.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000190">&#160;</a>

applies in care scenarios? Will he elaborate on that and describe the

make to gain such a capital

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am told that the rules seek to prevent excessive claiming of those
capital allowances, or double-claiming in excess of the original costs
of plant and machinery that were previously relieved. What evidence
does the Minister have that there have been abuses of those capital
allowance arrangements in the past? Is it to do with computer
purchasing or transport or kitchen equipment? What exactly is it and
what evidence is there of previous abuse?<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000192">&#160;</a>

Minister has gained some inspiration about the sums of money that
relate to this, I should be grateful to know what figures are involved
in making the changes. Are we moving from one estimate of capital

estimate of the financial implications of the arrangements?<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000193">&#160;</a>

Minister say how many qualifying carers choose to calculate their
taxable earnings as profits, as though they are in a care business?
Again, I am not clear about that, because there seem to be two routes
that carers can go down. How many carers, does he estimate, treat the
situation in that sense and may fall under the capital allowance
arrangement? If we are discussing care as “a business”,
at what point would qualifying carers come under the inspection regime
of—I presume—the Care Quality Commission? When does the
number of placements, or people in care who are being looked after by a
family, grow so large that it becomes a business that merits an
inspection arrangement? I should be grateful if the Minister would
answer those specific points about clause
3.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000194">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 3 amends the capital allowances rule that
applies to individuals who are entitled to qualifying care relief. As I
explained in the context of clause 1, qualifying care relief provides a
simple set  of rules for calculating profits for tax purposes,
which includes special capital allowances. I ought to say that the hon.
Gentleman raises a fair point about what constitutes plant and
machinery in such contexts. The glib answer is: anything that qualifies
within the capital allowances rules—cars, vans, computers and
furniture could qualify under such circumstances. Carers are permitted
to claim capital allowances for their care businesses only in periods
when they calculate their profits using normal trade rules, rather than
the qualifying care relief rules. It follows that carers may be able to
claim capital allowances in one year, but not in the
next.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Broadly,
the special capital allowances rules simplify the calculations required
when a carer changes from one profit calculation method to another. The
changes under the clause do not reflect a change of policy, but will
ensure that the special rules for carers operate consistently and
equitably.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has come
to the attention of HMRC that the special rules do not always work
fairly or as intended. This legislation has been brought in, not so
much as a consequence of observing and identifying abuse of it, but
because the law as it stands is flawed and could result in a double
relief that is not the intention of the policy. The legislation will
prevent double claims and that is the right thing to do.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman has asked a fair question on whether this is costing a huge
amount of money. The answer is that it is not; the cost is negligible.
None the less, it would not be fair to allow the regime to operate in a
way we did not intend. The hon. Gentleman has asked how many people
will be affected. Some 5,000 carers complete a return and have taxable
profits greater than nil. I hope that that is useful background to
him.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It might be
helpful if I give the Committee an example of how a double claim could
operate, because it is a somewhat complicated matter. Currently, an
individual may be able to claim allowances in excess of the original
cost of an asset. For example, an individual may claim the full cost of
a £12,000 minibus in year 1, under normal annual investment
allowances rules. In year 2, the carer may use foster carers rules,
which are outside the scope of capital allowances. In year 3, they may
return to the normal rules, which allow for a capital allowances claim
to be made for the market value of the minibus. The individual would
have already claimed the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 27<a class="bkMark" name="Column27">&#160;</a>
                           </div>whole value of the capital item in year 1, but in year 3 they could
claim a further 25% of the market value. Double-claiming is unfair,
both on those carers whose circumstances do not permit it and on other
taxpayers. To address that, and to ensure that beneficial rules for
carers operate consistently in future, no further allowances will be
given in respect of qualifying capital expenditure which has already
been relieved. I stress, however, that carers will still get relief for
qualifying capital expenditure that they incur. The change applies only
to double-claiming.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The broad
operation of the special capital allowances rules is unaffected by
these changes. In particular, it is a feature of the rules that a carer
who has claimed capital allowances in one year is not subject to a
balancing adjustment on receiving qualifying care relief in the
following year. The changes will take effect for accounting periods
that end on or after Royal Assent. I hope that the Committee will see
fit to include clause 3 as part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am interested to hear the Minister’s
further explanation of clause 3. He said that there is not a vast cost
involved in tightening up these arrangements—he used the word
“negligible”. Furthermore, he said that there do not
appear to be many abuses of these double-claiming arrangements. He gave
a helpful illustration involving a minibus that might have had a
further 25% double relief in year 3. It strikes me that there is an
awful lot of HMRC and Treasury effort put into tightening up an
arrangement on people who are on low incomes. I wish that the Treasury
and HMRC spent as much time tightening up tax evasion and
loopholes—those multi-million pound abuses that we know are
still exploited by those with the best advice at the higher end of the
income scale. I make that observation simply to say that there seems to
be a lot of effort and attention going into a particular tax law change
where there is neither a great cost nor a massive abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having said
that, there is, I suppose, merit in the theoretical. If it is
academically necessary to redraft the legislation, in order to have a
full belt-and-braces, tightened-up arrangement for the capital
allowances, I suppose that that is worth while. We would not want to
leave anomalies there for the sake of doing so. I may have missed this
point, but I did ask the Minister about the inspection regime for a
family organisation with large numbers of adults or children in care
that becomes more business-like and reaches the point where the
inspectorate would make inquiries—not with the local authority,
but with the family organisation directly. Will the inspectorate get
involved at that level? If the organisation is more business-like, the
expectation would be that there should be a second look at how that
business is operating. I do not particularly object to clause 3, but I
wonder whether the Minister would elaborate on my later
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000202">&#160;</a>

whether there is substantial abuse. It is of course right that we
should seek to tighten those matters before there is a significant cost
to the taxpayer, and it is in order to ensure that the capital
allowances regime works fairly and consistently that we are taking
those steps now. The hon. Gentleman asked about the inspection

will be surprised if any Member can find a link between clauses 1, 2, 3
and clause 4, so there will be a prize for the committed Member who
manages it. Seafarers’ earnings are an important matter for
those who work at sea. The clause will extend to seafarers who are
resident in the European economic area the same 100% deduction from
income tax on earnings from employment that is enjoyed by seafarers who
are wholly or partly outside the UK during that eligible period; I
understand that at present the tax relief is only available to those
seafarers ordinarily resident within the UK, but clearly there are
seafarers resident in other EEA states who are not ordinarily resident
in the UK who might also warrant the seafarers’ earnings
deduction.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000207">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Would
the Minister answer a few specific questions on that change? Would he
tell the Committee a little more about the eligible period? I assume
that the navigation of waters beyond the UK continental shelf is our
main geographical consideration in that regard, and the length of time
a seafarer is away from the UK continental shelf presumably has
something to do with the definition of the eligible period. Would he
set out for the Committee what that is and how many seafarers are
involved in that concession, as it is difficult to envisage the point
on which we are legislating without a better feel for the number of
people affected? I presume that we are talking about merchant seamen,
fishermen and so forth, although I want to ask him about other
seafarers and whether that will apply to those serving in the armed
forces, whether they are in the Navy or not. It is not clear what is
and is not included in the definition of
seafarer.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000208">&#160;</a>

issue that has been the subject of recent controversy: what discussions
have the Government had with the Norwegian and Icelandic Governments in
the drafting of that provision? As I understand it, it is a specific
clause that is extending to their resident seafarers a set of tax
relief arrangements that will be relevant for them. I ask that because,
presumably, we will have to require some sort of reciprocity for UK
seafarers who may be resident in those countries. To what extent have
those Governments offered such reciprocity in tax
arrangements?<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000209">&#160;</a>

Scottish Executive and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the
impact the change might have on the current sensitive negotiations
between the European Union and Norway and Iceland over the mackerel
quota? Obviously, all hon. Members will be familiar with those. I
gather that it has been the recent practice of the Icelandic fishing
community to make unilateral changes to the fishing and mackerel
quotas. That has caused considerable consternation in some quarters,
potentially risking the sustainability of fish stocks and disrupting
previously settled agreements. Some people have characterised it as the
“mackerel wars”. Representatives of the trades within
those countries are undertaking sensitive negotiations, with which the
Minister will be familiar. It strikes me as something that needs
further thought. When there is such great sensitivity, is this an
appropriate moment for the Treasury to grant a tax concession to
Icelandic fisherman?<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000210">&#160;</a>

fishermen from Iceland in particular. I would like the Minister to
update the Committee on those negotiations, as well as say whether a
tax concession is the right thing at this juncture. It may upset the
balance and, in the process, perplex fishermen in our country. Why are
we giving a tax concession now to those whom they perceive as having
taken unilateral actions that cut across international

“seafarer” may be inadequate. I would like to press the
point about the mobile drilling rigs arrangement, for example. I know
that, in the past, early-day motions have noted concern about the
different treatment of seagoing vessels. Such treatment can result in
some seafarers becoming ineligible in certain circumstances,
particularly when it comes to exploiting mineral resources, and
consequently, financial hardship can occur. For the moment, I want to

                        <p class="tabbed">It may be
helpful if I provide some background. The seafarers’ earnings
deduction allows a UK resident to claim 100% deduction from their
earnings from employment as “a seafarer”. The definition
of seafarer includes merchant seamen and fishermen, but Navy personnel
do not qualify and never have. The deduction was claimed by 16,000 UK
ordinarily resident seafarers in the tax year 2007-08. The duties of
the employment must be performed wholly or partly outside the United
Kingdom during an eligible period, which the hon. Member for Nottingham
East has asked about. The eligible period can be 365 days outside the
UK in one period, or a combined period in which 183 days are spent
outside the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000217">&#160;</a>

share fishermen have a different role. Is there a different category

eligibility and geographical fronts, there is not a further
distinction, as I understand it. Potentially, depending on those
conditions being met, the deduction may well apply in the circumstances
that the hon. Gentleman has outlined. I add that there are questions as
to the definition of ship and what constitutes a ship for such
purposes. The hon. Member for Nottingham East rightly recalled some of
the controversy that has existed in recent years relating to oil and
gas platforms that are not seen as ships. That has been an ongoing

require duties to be performed on a ship wholly or partly outside UK

EEA, Liechtenstein, in this context. We wait to see. It is worth
pointing out that UK citizens will be free to make similar claims in
other EEA countries where there are similar rules to support seafarers.
This is about bringing consistency of treatment for all EU and EEA
citizens. As has been pointed out, there is an Adjournment debate on
the fishing rights issue, but this is very much a different debate. I

sensitive negotiations are going on between people who feel deeply
aggrieved because their carefully divided quota arrangements on
long-standing fishing settlements have been violated by the unilateral
actions of one country—in this case, the allegation is against
Iceland—and if those fishermen feel that they must regain their
position and settle the situation properly, how does the Minister think
they would feel about the British Government’s giving a tax
concession at the same time to those very Icelandic fishermen? It would
feel difficult to understand, would it

                           </strong> It would, but that matter is not related to the
clause. The clause has not been brought in as a consequence of lobbying
by the Icelandic or Norwegian Governments. It is a consequence of the
view taken by the European Commission about the operation of the
seafarers’ earnings deduction and the belief that the rules, as
they currently apply, do not comply with our treaty
obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000232">&#160;</a>

providing clarity. There is no evidence to suggest that it will be
Icelandic or Norwegian nationals who will benefit specifically from the
extension, although of course if they are ordinarily resident in the

benefit from comparable arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000233">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps I may
also respond to the point about the definition. It is a broad
definition: someone who works on a ship. There has been some
controversy before, to which I alluded, about the definition of
“ship”, because that does not include offshore
installations. The original policy purpose behind the seafarers’
earnings deduction was to assist the merchant navy and to ensure on
strategic grounds that we have capability in the area in question. The
seafarers’ earnings deduction continues to achieve that. I hope
that that provides some useful clarification for the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000234">&#160;</a>

I do not think that the Bill should be presented in isolation from the

to close loopholes. Theoretically the measure could aid Norwegian and
Icelandic seafarers. In view of the fact that it is a live issue, we
should not act as if we are

                           </strong> It is not a related issue. I am finding it hard to
resist making a pun and calling the Opposition’s argument a bit

                        <p class="tabbed">The issue of
the mackerel wars is important, but it is not relevant to the clause.
We need to make the change to comply with our EU duties and to prevent
infraction proceedings. That should not be seen as some great
concession to Iceland or Norway. It is necessary to enable us to comply
with our European Economic Area obligations. It provides clarity. In
practice, it will probably not benefit large numbers of individuals,
but nevertheless it puts the clause on a good and sustainable
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
pointing out that we think that most of the individuals who will
benefit will be east European nationals. As I have said, the
representative bodies and unions that have strong views on our
relationship with Norway and Iceland in the relevant areas have no
objections to the clause, because they recognise that it is not part of
those negotiations. It is something that we need to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="10101936000238">&#160;</a>

Certainly, the fact that we have put the spotlight on this question
suggests that it will be returned to at a later

am not quite content that I have had sufficient clarity from the
Minister about the reciprocity of arrangements, or the point at which
the Icelandic and Norwegian Governments will also be enacting mirroring
tax provisions and ensuring that they also apply to UK seafarers in a
contemporaneous scenario. Constantly reiterating that this is not
relevant to the discussion does not actually make that the
case—the controversy over mackerel quotas is of great concern to
many
