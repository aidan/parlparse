Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I shall draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to the normal procedure. First, would you
make sure that your mobile phones are switched to silent? I shall check
mine in a minute. There is a money resolution in connection with the
Bill&#151;copies are available in the room. Also, the formal warning
about starred amendments: in general, my fellow Chairmen and I do not
intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached
during an afternoon
sitting.</div><a name="0901217000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those unfamiliar with the slightly new system, I shall outline what
will happen today. The Committee will be asked to consider the
programme motion, on which debate is limited to half an hour. We then
proceed to the motions to report written evidence and to permit the
Committee to deliberate in private&#151;I hope that we can deal with
them formally&#151;in advance of the oral evidence sessions. Assuming
that the motion is agreed, the Committee will move into private
session. Once the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and members of
the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence
session will commence. The arrangements are similar to those in a
Select Committee&#151;look at the brief provided and we shall work
out who wants to ask any
questions.</div><a name="0901217000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the programme motion is agreed, the Committee will hear oral evidence
this morning, this afternoon and on Thursday morning. On Thursday, the
Committee will meet in the Boothroyd room, moving to the more familiar
scene of the Committee corridor next week and reverting to the normal
clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill. Is that reasonably clear to
everyone? We shall see if we can find our way through
that.</div><a name="0901217000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered</i>,</div><a name="0901217000040"></a><div class="hs_brev">That&#151;</div><a name="0901217000041"></a><div class="hs_brev">(1)

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1</b><a name="0901217000098"></a> <b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): Before I question
the witnesses, I wish to say what a pleasure it is to see you in the
Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I hope that that is the proper way in
which to start our proceedings. It is a new process for all of us, and
you are very welcome in the
Chair.</div><a name="0901217000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ms
Milne, I wonder whether you can help me. The background to such matters
stems very much from the Lyons report and the suggestions of
flexibility and an appetite for engagement with local authorities and
business. What is your assessment of whether this will assist local
authorities in engaging with business? Do you see other potential
pitfalls?</div>
<a name="0901217000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We think that we already have a good model for
engagement between business and local authorities in the business
improvement districts and the way in which they are organised, so that
there is a genuine conversation and partnership between the two parties
in developing proposals that will benefit the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>communities. I am afraid that the business rate supplements proposals
try to short-cut some of those processes, such that there may not be a
proper conversation between local authorities and the business
community. They have the air of something that might be imposed on
business, rather than being worked out together with
business.</div>
<a name="0901217000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="0901217000099"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> What do you mean by the phrase
&#147;short-cut&#148;?</div><a name="0901217000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> In terms of developing the prospectus,
although there is talk of consultation once the initial prospectus has
been published, it is to appear as if by magic from the local
authority, whereas within the BIDs process there is a genuine
engagement of business at the initial stages, so that the whole project
is worked up together in
partnership.</div><a name="0901217000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="0901217000100"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> What would need to be done differently to make the
engagement
genuine?</div><a name="0901217000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> One of the key things that gives everybody an
incentive to work together within BIDs is the fact that there is a
mandatory ballot that has to approve the whole project before it can go
forward. That means that everybody has an incentive to work together to
find schemes that genuinely address the issues within the community and
that therefore will benefit the
community.</div><a name="0901217000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="0901217000101"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Have you carried out any assessment of the impact
that the current proposals might have on your
members?</div><a name="0901217000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We have certainly done some
costings.</div><a name="0901217000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> Based on the proportion of rateable value
that retailers account for, we have calculated that anything up to a
quarter of the overall moneys that could be raised through a business
rate supplement may fall on our
members.</div><a name="0901217000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="0901217000102"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> In the written submissions there is a statement
that the proposals would</div>
<a name="0901217000076"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;increase costs
without any correlation to a business&#146;s profits or ability to
pay.&#148;</div>
<a name="0901217000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument might be:
if we do not use rateable value as a measure, what other measure could
we
use?</div><a name="0901217000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> The problem with rateable value is that it is,
in effect, an input tax. It does not try to match contributions to the
benefits that will be derived from a given project, so there is no
proportionment between different sectors of the economy. Because retail
is a property-intensive sector and retailers have relatively little
choice in which properties they occupy&#151;they need to be in the
high-access, high-footfall areas like the high street or certain retail
parks&#151;we have historically seen rents and property values, and
hence rateable values, move up much more sharply for retailers than for
office accommodation or other parts of business. Therefore, as Tom
said, not only do we pay 25 per cent. of the overall rates bill, while
actually generating 8 per cent. of GDP by value&#151;we are paying
three times our overall output&#151;but that is likely to increase
rather than decrease in future, so we see the burden falling
increasingly heavily on us. In some respects it is the modern
equivalent of a hearth tax or a window tax; it is not actually about
the overall prosperity of different sectors in the community.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="0901217000103"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Because, you will argue, you are being taxed on a
measure that is a higher percentage of your members&#146; costs than
other sectors of the
economy?</div><a name="0901217000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Yes, exactly so, rather than according to how
much additional profit are we making as a result of the
investments.</div><a name="0901217000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="0901217000104"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Where does that leave you as to a cost-benefit
analysis for your members of what might come from a BRS
scheme?</div><a name="0901217000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> It would obviously depend on the precise
details of an individual scheme, and different schemes will favour
different sectors of the business community. One of the advantages of
the BIDs process is that all that can be worked through at an early
point in drawing together the
proposals.</div><a name="0901219000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><a name="0901219000300"></a> <b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): May I take
up a couple of the points you have made and refer back to one of the
points in your written evidence? You talked about retailers paying
about a quarter of all business rates and you estimated that about a
quarter of any business rate supplement will be met by your members.
The retail sector is very diverse&#151;it includes small shops as
well as large ones. Under the design of the scheme, it is proposed that
those with rateable values of under &#163;50,000 will be excluded.
What is your estimate of the proportion of total business rates paid by
your members with rateable values over
&#163;50,000?</div><a name="0901219000002"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> We do not have an accurate estimate of what
that proportionate impact would be. You are correct in saying that, for
a significant proportion of our members, the &#163;50,000 threshold
will have a beneficial impact. However, for members who sit above the
&#163;50,000 threshold, that might act to increase the burden on them
for any given BRS-funded economic development
project.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000301"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I hear that message. However, you made the
point that you expected your members to meet 25 per cent. of business
rate supplement contributions. That does not seem likely if you cannot
quantify the percentage of total business rates accounted for by your
members with rateable values over &#163;50,000. I find that figure
unconvincing without back-up evidence.</div>
<a name="0901219000004"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> The important issue, from our point of
view, is whether, relatively speaking, retailers have a larger
proportion of businesses under the &#163;50,000 threshold than other
sectors of the business community. I have not seen any evidence in that
area which would lead me to make a conclusion about
that.</div>

10</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000302"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> You must have some idea, because we know all
about the make-up of the retail sector. There are some very large
businesses, but there are vast numbers of small corner shops. In other
sectors of industry&#151;the pharmaceutical industry, or the
construction industry, for example&#151;you will not have quite the
same diversity, will
you?</div><a name="0901219000006"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> At the same time, as I think Jane observed
earlier, retailers often find themselves in high rateable-value areas
of town centres, or in out-of-town retail parks, which will lift them
into a higher bracket in many cases.</div>

of anticipated business rate supplement that your members&#151;the
retail sector&#151;will pay. The figure of 25 per cent. is clearly
not convincing.</div>
<a name="0901219000008"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom

which cast into doubt that 25 per cent.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000304"></a> Mr.

that a significant proportion of your members have rateable values
below &#163;50,000.</div>
<a name="0901219000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> We would also argue that a significant
proportion of other businesses would also find themselves below that
&#163;50,000 threshold, because they have an opportunity to locate in
areas which are not necessarily quite as high-value as the areas in
which retailers find
themselves.</div><a name="0901219000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901219000305"></a> Mr.

a strong case on the basis of what I regard as quite flimsy

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><a name="0901219000306"></a> <b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): How many retail businesses
have gone into administration or liquidation in the past
year?</div><a name="0901219000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> It is an ever-mounting figure. We can
certainly provide that data although I do not have them to hand at the
moment.</div>
<a name="0901219000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000307"></a> Mr.
Dunne:</b> Do you have a feel for how many jobs in retail have
been lost in the past
year?</div><a name="0901219000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Certainly, over the past month, and looking
forward a couple of months, we expect about 40,000 jobs to go in the
big chains, where figures are publicly available. Our problem is
understanding the number of individual people who have been let go from
many small and independent retailers, as those jobs disappear without
anybody being able to count them.</div>
<a name="0901219000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000308"></a> Mr.
Dunne:</b> Have your economists come up with a forecast for
2009? You mentioned 40,000 over the next two months. Do you have a
full- year forecast at this stage?</div>
<a name="0901219000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We would expect that number to grow, probably
quite significantly. There is a mixture of fortunes, with different
parts of the sector doing better than others. A number of the
supermarkets, for example, have announced that they will recruit staff,
so there is some good news in the sector. Certainly among the non-food
retailers, formal redundancies have been announced but, given that
there is always a certain amount of movement through
retailing&#151;it is an entry-level employment sector for a lot of
people, who then try to move off into other things&#151;a lot of jobs
will just disappear without anybody being made redundant, but with no
opportunities for others to move into those
jobs.</div><a name="0901219000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000309"></a> Mr.

UK?</div><a name="0901219000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

the work force altogether.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="0901219000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000310"></a> Mr.
Dunne:</b> With forecasts of unemployment on a national level
on the rise, do you anticipate that any additional taxation on your
members would accelerate the rate of loss of jobs over the coming year
or
two?</div><a name="0901219000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Retailers are facing a crunch of a different
nature from the credit crunch that we often hear about. They have a
number of rising costs, including the rising costs of the goods that
they put on their shelves, because the falling exchange rates make
imports more expensive. There are a number of business rate increases
coming through the pipeline too, in terms of the annual uplift and the
2010 review, and when you tot them all up it comes to an increase of as
much as &#163;1.6 billion, which is a 30 per cent. increase in the
rates bill. In addition, with the national minimum wage and so on there
are a number of other cost pressures coming through while, at the same
time, customers are looking for reduced prices. We are helping to
deliver the reduction in inflation that is coming through very rapidly
at the moment through discounting and the like. We are therefore
getting to the point at which there are such thin margins that pushing
up the rates bill inevitably puts jobs at risk. The total cost coming
through with business rates equates to about 100,000 retail
jobs.</div><a name="0901219000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000311"></a> Mr.
Dunne:</b> Could you break down that &#163;1.6
billion a little? How much of it is associated with revaluation
arrangements that are already in train, and how much with the impact of
the
Bill?</div><a name="0901219000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> About 90 per cent. of that figure is
associated with both the annual revaluation and the quinquennial review
that takes effect in 2010, and about &#163;160 million would be
associated with the BRS if it were taken forward by all of those who
are entitled to do
so.</div><a name="0901219000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><a name="0901219000312"></a> <b class="B">Derek
Twigg</b> (Halton) (Lab): What evidence do you have that a
local authority would impose this increase on business on the basis of
wanting greater economic development, when the fact is that business
does not like it, it will cause it a problem and jobs will be lost?
What local authority would do that? What evidence do you have that
local authorities, in wanting to promote economic development, would
cause job losses in doing
so?</div><a name="0901219000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We would hope that local authorities would not
do that. However, good legislation includes safeguards that ensure that
that is not the
case.</div><a name="0901219000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000313"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> So you are not opposed to the legislation per se.
The issue is the safeguards that it
includes.</div><a name="0901219000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Yes, the safeguards are extremely important to
us and that is why we referred to the BIDs process as the model that we
would like to follow more
closely.</div><a name="0901219000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000314"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> But you can see the logic. Economic development for
local authorities has, certainly in the past ten to 15 years, been a
focus, and it most probably was 20 or 30 years ago. You say that you
hope that local authorities would not impose the increase. I ask the
question again: what evidence do you have? Do you have any evidence at
all that local authorities would impose an increase on business that
would be contrary to their economic development? Which local authority
would do that, when doing so would cause many jobs to be
lost?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="0901219000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Perhaps one issue concerns cases in which the
local authority has a different view of what would be beneficial to the
community from the business community. We would not suggest that local
authorities were deliberately setting out to cause business
problems&#151;of course not&#151;but they might not fully
appreciate all the issues involved. The BIDs process enables all of
that to be worked through and a very high-quality proposal to come
forward. The fact that about 85 per cent. of BIDs have been supported
by the local business community demonstrates that that process
genuinely gives rise to projects that are seen to be beneficial to the
community and, therefore, attract the business community&#146;s
support.</div>
<a name="0901219000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000315"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> So, it is more of a fear than a fact.</div>
<a name="0901219000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> I think that good legislation puts a framework
in place that ensures the right outcomes and does not simply rely on
chance.</div>
<a name="0901219000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><a name="0901219000316"></a> <b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I, too, welcome you to the
Committee. I am pleased that we have the benefit of your experience at
this stage and as we move towards more detailed scrutiny of the Bill. I
would like to explore the interaction between BIDs and the potential
for the supplementary business rate for financial change. Why do you
think that the BIDs model is so successful? What works about that
model, both in terms of putting together the BID and of its
operation?</div>
<a name="0901219000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> At the outset of a project, people in the
local authority, in retail, and in other business sectors, as well as
key community players, sit down and come up with a proposal that meets
the specific issues that that community faces. Retail has a good track
record of working with local authorities and of involvement in
regeneration projects through BIDs and other means. That very close
arrangement ensures that the issues that must be addressed and the best
ways to address them are worked out.</div>
<a name="0901219000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000317"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> Clearly, one of the Bill&#146;s main concerns
is Crossrail in London, so we are talking about very big infrastructure
projects. Would you agree that BIDs would not be not the right model
for funding similar projects, which may be on a smaller scale, but
still fairly large for those regions, counties or
boroughs?</div><a name="0901219000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> I think that the procedure set out in BIDs
provide the model for the engagement that enables the examination of
those projects, makes the right assessments and ensures that a
genuinely robust business case is developed within the initial
prospectus. We are supportive of Crossrail&#151;our problem is the
way that it is being funded.</div>
<a name="0901219000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000318"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> I hesitate to paraphrase, but you said in answer
to earlier questions that the principle of some form of supplementary
business rate to fund a project that the business community in that
area thought would be beneficial to the whole community, including its
ability to trade, prosper and play a part in economic development, is
not the problem. If it signs up to a project, the problem is how it is
arrived at and delivered. Is that
fair?</div><a name="0901219000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> The principle of making a contribution is not
the problem, but the issue of whether it is a property-based
contribution is more questionable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="0901219000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000319"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> There is also the issue of areas where a BID may
already be operating, but which sit within a wider area that might be
subject to the measure. What do you think that the interaction between
those ought to be? What safeguards should be in place for existing BIDs
sitting within areas subject to an SBR?</div>
<a name="0901219000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We would like to see an automatic offset. If
that is not there, we risk losing BIDs as a process to put in place
regeneration projects beneficial to the community. Inevitably,
retailers have to look at their overall cost base, and while many of
them are enthusiastic supporters of BIDs, if they think that they are
going to have a BRS imposed on them, they simply have to look at the
budget and work out what costs they need to avoid to meet this
statutory
requirement.</div>
<a name="0901219000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000320"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> Would a ballot for the BRS as well, which many
are arguing for, be sufficient? Where a BID is operating, people would
have the chance to say whether they thought that two projects were
incompatible at that time and that one needed to be completed before
moving on to another. Is that enough of a safeguard? Do you think that
there should be automatic offsetting in that area, or do you think that
businesses should decide whether they could cope with both, given that
they are delivering different sorts of scheme and that there may be two
sets of
benefits?</div><a name="0901219000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> If the case is made for the project being
looked at under the BRS, you must look at overall funding and the
extent to which you are going to rub up against the 2p ceiling. If
there is scope within that, there are ways of arriving at the funding,
while still giving the offset to the BID.</div>
<a name="0901219000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000321"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am just trying to establish whether the offset
is sacrosanct or whether&#151;if business is involved in arriving at
the BRS decision&#151;there will be enough and one could be flexible
about the
offset.</div><a name="0901219000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> If the benefits are sufficient from both
schemes, retailers would find it much easier to deal with both,
particularly if the BID proposal came forward subsequently. In the
current trading environment, it is all about driving down
costs.</div><a name="0901219000045"></a>

Milne, I think that all of us here have some sympathy with many of your
members, given the tumultuous economic events of recent months.
However, I want to explore one or two of your answers and to ask one or
two questions, partly on the BIDs process, but also more generally. You
said that you are not averse to the principle of making a contribution
to infrastructure projects. You were asked whether that would be
through a property-related tax, and I am not sure whether you had any
other ideas in mind. How do you think that large-scale infrastructure
projects, such as Crossrail in London, which obviously affects my
constituency, can possibly be
funded?</div><a name="0901219000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

where taxpayers in general need to make a contribution. Our only
argument over business&#146;s contribution is that it should be in
proportion to the benefits that that business sector will
receive.</div><a name="0901219000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000336"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> One of my concerns, being slightly devil&#146;s
advocate with your approach&#151;I appreciate that you have to speak
on behalf of your members&#151;is that, ultimately, people will argue
that all these retailers and many tenants in properties have cut a
pretty bad deal with their landlords to get the property. The
commercial property market was buoyant until the past 18 months or so,
but you have cut a bad deal with your landlords and you now want to
oppose the Bill. You are acting to the detriment of the public at
large, who desperately need some large-scale infrastructure projects.
There needs to be a way of funding them. We have looked at the whole
issue of value capture. This debate does not just go back a few years;
it goes back many decades, and it concerns the whole idea of how to
ensure that a proper project is in place for something that is for the
common good. What do you say to that criticism? I understand that you
have to argue your case, but is it entirely
self-interest?</div><a name="0901219000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> First, I touched earlier on the fact that the
retail property market does not necessarily work in a perfect manner,
particularly during a growing economy. The costs of renting and leasing
retail property have accelerated much faster than other sectors. An
awful lot of that value sits with the developer, not necessarily with
the
occupier.</div><a name="0901219000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000337"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> That, as you say, is potentially a market failure,
but it is ultimately an issue of being able, with the benefit of
decades-worth of hindsight, to cut the right deal. You have cut a bad
deal, and you are expecting the rest of the general public to have poor
infrastructure, just so that you can make your case and not pay your
way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="0901219000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> It is difficult to portray some of the bigger
retailers as victims of this process; but nevertheless, it is a
sellers&#146; market in very many cases, and it does not matter how
big a corporation you are on the other side of the deal. If you want a
certain site on the high street and there are only so many of them and
you are competing with others to get to it, you have to pay whatever it
takes to get it.</div>
<a name="0901219000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000338"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> I will take you down to Victoria street, in my
constituency, where there are enough voids to make one think that it is
not quite so much a sellers&#146; market now. I appreciate that those
are the market conditions, but I expect that that applies to my hon.
Friends&#146; constituencies. The market clearly has
turned.</div><a name="0901219000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to touch on BIDs. There are BIDs in my
constituency&#151;the New West End Company and the Paddington
Waterside Partnership&#151;and they have worked well. Superficially,
I can understand one of the arguments that you made: effectively, it
sounds like double counting&#151;you become part of BIDs and then
potentially you also have the maximum 2p surcharge through business
rates. Do you see that there is a view that what a BID is trying to do
is somewhat different from what the Bill is trying to achieve? The BID
process is looking at some additional spending&#151;to get a few more
police, to smarten up a rather small vicinity&#151;whereas the Bill
is proposing to get much larger-scale infrastructure
projects?</div><a name="0901219000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that Crossrail is an exception in terms of costing a total of
&#163;16 billion or &#163;17 billion, with about &#163;3 billion
to be covered, ideally, by the BRS under the Bill. However, the same
will apply on a smaller scale elsewhere across the country. It is a
quite different idea. The BIDs are there for additionality in a very
small location, whereas the idea of the Bill is to look at large-scale
infrastructure projects that would otherwise not be funded, because,
clearly, there would always be other priorities from local and central
Government. I understand why you make your case, but do you see that a
BID and a business rate supplement scheme are two quite separate
things?</div><a name="0901219000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> First, of course, it comes back to the
additionality of the benefits and how those stack up; but also, as I
mentioned previously, it relates to the distribution of those benefits.
In the case of Crossrail, where we have had some modelling done, we
find that the benefits that retailers are likely to derive
at &#163;17 billion are just less than half the costs that
they will be asked to provide. It is just adding extra cost, without
delivering extra
benefits.</div><a name="0901219000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000339"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> What proportion of the overall costs would you
require for it to be worth while&#151;matched funding&#151;or would
you expect to get a multiple of benefits from
costs?</div><a name="0901219000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> I think that an arrangement whereby we as a
sector made a proportionate contribution, linked to the benefits that
we were going to derive from it, would be much easier to swallow; but
retail tends to be a very high component of BIDs, and that is why we
end up with this double whammy. I do not know whether Tom wants to add
anything.</div><a name="0901219000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> I think that that covered the point very
accurately. It is a real concern for our members that they will be
paying a much larger proportion of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>overall BRS&#151;certainly in the case of Crossrail&#151;than the
benefits that they may derive. We have research, which we could share
with the Committee if it is
helpful.</div><a name="0901219000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000340"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> You say that retail accounts for a high
proportion of BIDs. Of course, there is a fairly fundamental difference
between BIDs and the BRS, in that the &#163;50,000 rateable value
threshold does not apply in the case of BIDs, which are often designed
specifically to help a range of retailers, including small ones. There
is a pretty obvious difference between the two, is there
not?</div><a name="0901219000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> I do not dispute that there is not a
&#163;50,000 threshold in the case of all BIDs, although some BIDs do
have self-introduced
thresholds.</div><a name="0901219000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000341"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> But lower than
&#163;50,000?</div><a name="0901219000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> In some cases, they are higher, I believe,
such as in the case of the New West End
Company.</div><a name="0901219000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000342"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> The crucial point that I want to establish, and
want you to agree on, is that there is a pretty fundamental difference
between major infrastructure development and the kind of objective with
which BIDs have been very successful. I strongly support BIDs and
introduced them as a Minister, so I am wholly behind them, but they
were about regenerating and building confidence on high streets, rather
than about supporting major infrastructure
development.</div><a name="0901219000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> We certainly do not dispute that there is a
difference in the scope and range of activities that many BIDs carry
out, compared with the sort of proposals that we understand may come
forward under business rate supplements. That still does not
necessarily lead our members to think that a mandatory ballot would not
be a worthwhile improvement to the legislation as drafted, because
those substantial costs and significant issues will move ahead with the
business rate supplements,
too.</div><a name="0901219000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000343"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Let us turn to Crossrail, because that is
obviously very important. It is a major infrastructure development. You
said that, although you support Crossrail, you do not like the way in
which it is funded, and you are on record as saying to the Committee
that you would like to do without the Bill altogether. Do you recognise
that, without the Bill and without the business rate supplement,
Crossrail would not proceed? You need not take my word for that. In his
evidence to us, the Mayor of London&#151;not a member of my
party&#151;said:</div><a name="0901219000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
successful passage of the BRS Bill is therefore crucial to the
construction of
Crossrail.&#148;</div><a name="0901219000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Throughout this process, we have been urging
for some years for the Government to find another way of achieving
precisely that. The fact that we are where we are is not because we
have not pointed out that it would be the wrong
approach.</div><a name="0901219000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000344"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> But do you think that your London members would
seriously support a case for the Bill not proceeding knowing that that
would actually kill Crossrail&#151;which it
would?</div><a name="0901219000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Our London members are extremely concerned
about the additional burden that will fall on them as a result of the
Bill and the contribution that they will be asked to make to
Crossrail.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div><a name="0901219000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000345"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> So please square with us why London business
representative bodies, such as London First and the London branch of
the CBI, have supported the framework, including the supplementary
business rate, for funding Crossrail. Are such bodies different
industries? Are there no retail members in London
First?</div><a name="0901219000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> You will have put that question to them. I
cannot answer on their behalf, but I can tell you that retailers feel
extremely
strongly.</div><a name="0901219000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000346"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Why then, when they represent their views in
another business forum, do they take a different view? Are you saying
that London First, the CBI and the London chamber of commerce, all of
which have supported Crossrail and the supplementary business rate, do
not have a retail
voice?</div><a name="0901219000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> They certainly do, but whether they have
chosen to listen to that retail voice is something you need to ask
them.</div><a name="0901219000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000347"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> Do you seriously think that it is right that
retailers, who have a strong presence in many of the areas where
Crossrail stations will be built, particularly in places such as Oxford
street, will really not get any benefit from the arrival of the new
stations that will deliver huge additional opportunities for
retail?</div><a name="0901219000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

yes.</div><a name="0901219000101"></a>

54</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000348"></a> Mr.

substantial business benefits in all parts of the London&#151;not
just along the route&#151;and huge benefits in key points on the
route is
wrong.</div><a name="0901219000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000351"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> May I just ask about thresholds? I am told that
&#163;50,000 is postulated as the threshold. It is not in the Bill.
How adequate do you regard that, and what will be the position when
revaluation takes place in
2010?</div><a name="0901219000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Clearly, revaluation will have a significant
impact on that, particularly since it was based on April 2008 values,
which clearly do not reflect the world that we are in today. One of our
key concerns is that retailing will have a different experience and
that the impact will be skewed. We are also concerned that there may
well be regional implications for having a specific cut-off with
different balances in different parts of the
country.</div><a name="0901219000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000352"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Can you elaborate on those two points? You said
first that the effects may be different from 2008. What has been
happening to retail since then?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div><a name="0901219000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> As Mr. Field mentioned, thankfully
we have seen a reversal in the movement of rents. Some rents have
actually come down for some retailers although, given that many are
locked into upward-only rent reviews, that is by no means true of all
of them. It is only where vacant properties and new leases are being
taken on that we are really seeing the benefit of that. However, given
that we have vacancies on high streets, and property owners are taking
a rather different attitude to the market, there has possibly been more
of a shift within the retail sector than other sectors. There is a
shift in the balance between our and other parts of the
economy.</div><a name="0901219000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

some questioning. What is your answer to
that?</div><a name="0901219000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Of all the issues that we look at&#151;we
look across the whole range of things impacting on retail&#151;this
is probably one where there is the most unified voice and the most
stringent urgency in what members are putting to us that we need to
make progress on. We need to get the business rate system changed, so
that it does not impose these huge increases&#151;30 per cent.
increases in costs&#151;that are coming down the track over the next
couple of
years.</div><a name="0901219000112"></a>

you quantify
that?</div><a name="0901219000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

annual uplift&#151;based on the September inflation rate, which is
probably around twice what it will be announced to be this week and
certainly well ahead of overall annual inflation, which could be
deflation this year&#151;with the revaluation coming forward in 2010
and the potential in what the business rate supplements could bring
forward.</div><a name="0901219000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Farrelly:</b> May I just ask a hypothetical question? What if
the legislation were to be amended to make a ballot&#151;governed by
a dual-key mechanism&#151;mandatory? On the basis of your views,
would it be fair to say that you could mobilise your many thousands of
members in London? Would you expect them to go out and vote against
Crossrail in droves, if Crossrail could only be funded with the
participation of the business rate supplements
scheme?</div><a name="0901219000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Of course, the dual-key approach takes account
of both the numbers of business rate payers and the value that each
pays. At the most generous assessment, our members would remain 25 per
cent. of the value. It would be an overall response from the business
community as a
whole.</div><a name="0901219000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000356"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> I am thinking of the numbers really. It would be
fair to say that, if those circumstances came to pass and you had those

Crossrail.</div><a name="0901219000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><a name="0901219000357"></a> <b class="B">Mr.
Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): Do you think that the
Government&#146;s proposed requirements for the consultation with
local businesses are sufficient? If not, what would you
suggest?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="0901219000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We believe that the proposals need to be
strengthened in a number of areas. I have already talked about the need
for inclusion in discussions to produce the initial prospectus. The
consultation process needs to be more than a process to be gone
through&#151;to be one with a bit of bite to it and having a
mandatory ballot at the end. That would result in genuine engagement,
which would result in quality proposals that would genuinely answer the
issues that local authorities are trying to
address.</div><a name="0901219000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000358"></a> Mr.

required only if the supplement is to fund more than one third of the
total cost of the project. However, is it appropriate to allow a ballot
in other circumstances, when the authority may wish to hold
one?</div><a name="0901219000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

Ironside:</b></i> What we say in the criteria document
circulated to BID proposals that are brought forward is that the
proposals should demonstrate a clear business benefit, and that that
benefit should be quantifiable and measurable. The businesses concerned
should then be able to make a judgment on the basis of the information
that they are presented with. So, it will vary from case to case. It
may relate to addressing retail crime, or to improvements to the
physical environment&#151;to cleanliness. In many cases, it is about
delivering quantifiable benefits within their trading
environments.</div><a name="0901219000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000361"></a> Mr.

have done. Obviously we are in a recession and things are difficult,
but does the modelling take into account that the recession will
end&#151;whenever that may be&#151;and we could be into a boom
period, and businesses could benefit considerably from various projects
being
suggested?</div><a name="0901219000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> The modelling that we did on Crossrail was
before the R-word was mentioned and therefore we were looking forward
to&#151;</div><a name="0901219000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901219000362"></a> Mr.
Scott:</b> I apologise for mentioning the R-word. Perhaps I
should have said credit crunch, but recession is the
word.</div><a name="0901219000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> At that stage we were not
envisaging that there would be a downturn. We are not looking
at a growing industry at the moment; we are looking at a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>shrinking one. That was not included in the modelling, so, if you like,
it is already an over-optimistic view of the world, in the short
term.</div><a name="0901219000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000363"></a> Mr.
Scott:</b> I find that interesting, because I have seen some
figures for Crossrail&#151;the project does not affect my
constituency directly but it does affect the neighbouring
one&#151;which showed that businesses, not in Oxford street but in
the suburbs, were going to benefit considerably from the extra people
that Crossrail could bring in. That study was done before the current
climate, and the figures might be different now, but that does not mean
that in the longer term there could not be bonuses for businesses.
However, you say that even when business was good the modelling showed
that people would not benefit from
Crossrail.</div><a name="0901219000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Retailing will benefit but at around only half
the rate of the contribution that the sector is being asked to make.
So, in the end, it is a net loss to
retailing.</div><a name="0901219000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><a name="0901219000364"></a> <b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): We are finding it
difficult to understand that your modelling seems totally contrary to
all the other modelling that has been done on this matter. That point
was raised not just by Mr. Scott but by Nick Raynsford. Are
you looking in the short term? What is your time scale for the
so-called benefits that you talk about? How narrow are the assumptions
that you have made about the boost to business from huge numbers of
people flowing from outer to inner London? Just give us a taster of how
you have assembled that
modelling.</div><a name="0901219000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> I will give you a little more background on
the modelling that was undertaken. It was carried out by Oxford
Economics and looked at a London-wide picture. It estimated a cost of
&#163;34 million per annum to the retail sector in London from the
time that the BRS was introduced, and at the same time it estimated
that the benefit once the Crossrail project was completed would be
&#163;15 million per annum. Those are the headlines of the research.
We have the research document, which I am sure has already been shared
with Government Departments. We would be only too happy to provide you
with it, as well. I do not have a copy with me&#151;it is a 10 or
12-page document&#151;but we would be more than happy to share it
with the Committee if that were
useful.</div><a name="0901219000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000365"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> We would obviously want you to share that with us,
but we are trying to square the circle here. As Mr. Scott
said a few moments ago, we are talking about some 600,000 additional
people living in east London, who will be carried through Crossrail
either to work or to make purchases at all the stops along the line.
Looking superficially, it seems that there would be significant
benefits not just for central London but all along the Crossrail route,
yet you suggest otherwise. I am trying to cope with how you have come
up with a different set of figures from almost everyone
else.</div>
<a name="0901219000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
questions I critically want to ask is, what is your time scale for the
figures that you have produced? In the submission by the Mayor of
London, he
says:</div><a name="0901219000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
long-term benefits of Crossrail to business will far outweigh the costs
to them of the BRS.&#148;</div>
<a name="0901219000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">He goes on to
say:</div><a name="0901219000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All
London&#146;s boroughs will benefit from
Crossrail&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="0901219000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">not just those through
which Crossrail passes. That is a definitive set of findings. The Mayor
would not have come up with that if he had thought there would be any
challenge. But you are saying not only that it does not work but the
benefit is only half the cost to retailers. We have always assumed that
retailers would be among the main beneficiaries of this scheme. How do
you come up with these different
figures?</div><a name="0901219000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> I would like to understand why you think the
existence of a railway will mean that people will want to buy more.
They may well buy more on Oxford street and less in their local stores.
It is a question of looking at what the overall net benefits to retail
are.</div><a name="0901219000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000366"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> Let me put it to you this way. Where the underground
has been extended, all the evidence suggests that there is a
significant benefit, not just in terms of people flows but in terms of
the value of properties close to the underground. It has to be assumed
that that will be the case with Crossrail. It will carry huge numbers
of people, albeit perhaps not more than the overall underground network
carries, yet you are asking us to believe that retailers will not
benefit. I find that incredible, especially as almost everyone else
suggests that there will not just be significant but overwhelming
benefits to business from the building of
Crossrail.</div><a name="0901219000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> I think you are lumping everybody into the
term &#147;business&#148;. Our point is that there will be
different sectoral effects and we need to reflect those in the
contributions that each sector is asked to give. Just because the value
of a property has increased it does not mean that the value to the
occupier has
increased.</div><a name="0901219000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000367"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> Let me put you on the spot. How narrowly did you
draw up the research? Did you say, &#147;We want you to tell us the
bottom-line effect on retailing business, compared with the cost,
without taking any of the wider benefits into consideration?&#148;
Did you look at this over a longer time scale, or did you set it in the
short term? What assumptions did you give to Capital Economics to draw
up the figures that you are now telling
us?</div><a name="0901219000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> We did not narrowly prescribe the scope of
the research in that way. It was a genuine attempt to understand what
the impact would be on the retail
sector.</div><a name="0901219000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000368"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> Okay. We will need to see the figures.</div>
<a name="0901219000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me ask you
a final question, again trying to square the circle. As has already
been said by Mr. Raynsford, all of the business
organisations in London have come out strongly in favour of Crossrail,
and there is a significant retail element within them. Yet you are
telling us that your members are overwhelmingly opposed to this Bill
and what it will achieve in terms of building Crossrail. How
representative is London within the overall British Retail Consortium?
Does it account for 11 or 12 per cent. of your membership, or a much
higher proportion? How representative is London and have its views in
retail terms been taken on board regarding your attitude to this
Bill?</div><a name="0901219000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> In so far as we have the overwhelming majority
of the major brands, which have a significant presence in London, those
companies are clearly taking a view on both the specific Crossrail and
London 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>question and the broader question of BRS across the rest of the UK. Our
membership includes a number of companies which operate only in London,
so their views are also
reflected.</div><a name="0901219000147"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><a name="0901219000371"></a> <b class="B">Mr.
Neil Turner</b> (Wigan) (Lab): I wonder whether we could
explore that a little further. Mr. Ironside, you said
earlier that your organisation would support a supplement where there
was clear and demonstrable benefit. We have just heard that the models
that have been done have produced quite different results. Does not
that show that small changes in assumptions will make a model show
either a benefit or a disbenefit and that what you are really asking
for is impossible to
deliver?</div><a name="0901219000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> I think that the research that we initiated
shows the impact on the retail sector.</div>
<a name="0901219000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000372"></a> Mr.
Turner:</b> I am not asking you what it proves. I am trying to
get at the fact that we have a number of models that show different
results. You are saying that your organisation would support the
measure only where there are clear and demonstrable benefits, yet small
changes within any of the assumptions that are built into these
projections which produce the results will produce a different result.
Therefore, there will never be a definitive, clear and demonstrable
benefit. You are asking for the impossible.</div>
<a name="0901219000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Ironside:</b></i> I was going to say that our research is the
only research of which I am aware that has looked solely at the impact
on a single retail sector. I am not sure that the findings of our
research are incompatible with the other modelling. Our modelling shows
that the impact on the retail sector would be negative, but that does
not necessarily mean that the impact on the wider business community
would be.</div>
<a name="0901219000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> I believe that the financial services sector
was expected to benefit disproportionately. I am not sure whether that
still holds in the present circumstances, but when the original
proposals were looked at, it was going to receive much greater benefits
than retailing, for example. The distribution between sectors is as
important as the overall benefit to
business.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000373"></a> Mr.
Turner:</b> You said earlier that you did not think that
Crossrail should be supported by business. If not by business through
the supplementary rate, by whom should it be
funded?</div><a name="0901219000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> We did not say that it should not be supported
by business, but that our contribution should be in line with the
benefits that we are likely to receive from
it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="0901219000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000374"></a> Mr.

because it is a projection.</div>
<a name="0901219000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> In which case, you can never make a business
case for any investment in infrastructure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000375"></a> Mr.

evidence of whether there is any
benefit?</div><a name="0901219000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Although, as we have discussed previously,
BIDs are about somewhat different projects, that whole system has
worked because, in making the case and working in partnership with
business, local authorities have been able to demonstrate and quantify
the benefits that businesses would
receive.</div>
<a name="0901219000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000376"></a> Mr.
Turner:</b> Do you think that there should be a differential
supplementary rate? For instance, in Crossrail, financial services
should have 4p in the pound and retail 1p in the pound because that is
the benefit that you assess they will get from
it?</div><a name="0901219000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> Whether it is through the business rates
mechanism or A. N. Other method, we feel that it would work much better
if there was the flexibility to reflect sectoral differences, and not
just treat business as some kind of homogenised milch
cow.</div>
<a name="0901219000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000377"></a> Mr.
Turner:</b> How would you do
that?</div><a name="0901219000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> It is possible to do modelling to ascertain
what the different benefits to the different sectors would be. One
would then need to find a mechanism which reflected
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000378"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> I want to return to the question of ballots,
because that seems to be crucial. We have established that in your
dream Queen&#146;s Speech, this measure would not be the first thing
out of the bag. However, having accepted that it might be appropriate
for business to make a contribution to economic development where
business will benefit, and that the property-based levy is the
mechanism that is currently on the table, how important would the
safeguard of a ballot in all circumstances be to your ability to accept
it as a way
forward?</div><a name="0901219000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jane
Milne:</b></i> It is, as far we are concerned, the single
most crucial step as to strengthen the safeguards. There are already
safeguards within the Bill, but we do not feel that they go far enough.
The next most important step would be to keep the 2p cap in
place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000379"></a> Dan

consultation that takes place will be more focused on ensuring that
everybody is signed up effectively.</div>
<a name="0901219000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a
discussion about Crossrail. Most, if not all, of the Committee would no
doubt feel that Crossrail is a project worthy of support, which we are
eager to see go ahead. However, there has been an Act of Parliament and
intensive scrutiny and discussion about Crossrail, its viability and
what effects it might have. Most of the measures under the Bill would
have nothing like that. Would you say that that makes them different
from Crossrail and that there is a clear distinction between the way in
which the Bill enables Crossrail to be funded and to take place on the
model that has been set out, and the potential for other schemes across
the country?</div>

hybrid approach going on. Ensuring that there is full and proper
scrutiny of proposals is at the heart of many of our

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
84</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000380"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> Do you want to say anything about the type of
ballot that should take place and the dual-key approach that has been
proposed? Do you have any views on whether that is the correct approach
and whether the balance between large and small businesses is
correct?</div><a name="0901219000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000384"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Good morning, Mr. Frost. I would be
grateful if you outlined the overall view of the British Chambers of
Commerce. I read your submission, and as you represent 100,000
businesses across the UK, I do not think that any of us will suggest
that you are not representative. The Lyons review set forward the idea
of greater flexibility in business rates and discussed the existence of
an appetite for greater engagement with local authorities on economic
development. Is this proposal the right way to get
that?</div><a name="0901219000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> The British Chambers of Commerce network is
made up of 53 accredited chambers of commerce. The one thing that I
have learned in my time in this job is that chambers of commerce
have&#151;and share strongly with their local authorities&#151;a
real sense of pride in place and real passion: a desire for their
community to be the best. If it is not the best they want to look at
measures to make sure that it is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="0901219000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chambers of
commerce and local authorities also share legitimacy. The boards of
chambers of commerce are elected from the business community, from a
membership. The business members of those chambers are typified by a
strong sense of identity with the area. Theirs are frequently second or
third-generation businesses. Those businesses will not move to the
other side of the globe; they have an owner-manager who lives in the
area, whose children go to school there and whose partner could be a
school governor or magistrate. Those people have a strong sense of
place.</div><a name="0901219000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yes,
there is a view, clearly expressed in a number of parts of the country,
that there is a need for more local determination and, to be fair, for
the ability to raise additional revenue from the business community,
among others, for local projects that will benefit and develop the
local economy. The issue is that we are not sure that the business rate
supplement is necessarily the way to do that outside
London.</div><a name="0901219000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Neill:</b>
Why?</div><a name="0901219000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We are concerned that the whole area of local
determination and funding appears to lack any strategy and coherence.
We have the concept of business improvement districts and business rate
supplements; we have community infrastructure levies; we hear word
of&#151;and I have correspondence about&#151;the idea of
accelerated development zones; we talk about workplace parking levies
and congestion charging. From the point of view of the business
community how does all that tie together? Where is the overall strategy
to improve the community? The business community&#146;s worry, in
difficult economic times, is that there will essentially be layering of
one charge on another to raise additional funds for local authority
expenditure.</div><a name="0901219000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000386"></a>Robert

impact of the Bill on your
members?</div><a name="0901219000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We have. We have produced some figures, which
are in our submission; we suggested that the cost to business based on
the number of authorities who would take it up would be about
&#163;320 million per
annum.</div><a name="0901219000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000387"></a>Robert

limited purely to funding
Crossrail?</div><a name="0901219000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We think that Crossrail is a unique UK
project. In a sense, our view is that the concept of the BRS was
developed as a funding measure specifically for Crossrail. We suggest
that London is a separate issue and could be handled by a
BRS.</div><a name="0901219000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

90</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000389"></a>Robert

Accompanying the ability to add a supplement to the business rates,
should there be an ability to reduce business rates at local
level?</div><a name="0901219000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We have always said that. First, there should
be much greater connectivity between the business rates that are raised
and the funding that comes into an  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>area. With that, there might be an incentive in certain local
authorities to make reductions, and it might act as a stimulus to

91</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000390"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> In your opening comment you said&#151;and I
strongly agree&#151;that chambers of commerce have a strong pride in
their place. They often work with local authorities to enhance the
area. When we came on to discuss Crossrail, in response to
Mr. Neill&#146;s question, you said that it was a unique
project. You indicated that you were quite sympathetic to the idea that
the measure should apply in London only, but that the wider power
should not be available. What do you think would be the view of a
chamber of commerce in, say, Leeds, Manchester or another part of the
country which felt that there was a real need for a major
infrastructure project that would enhance the economy and improve the
place, but which was told that it could not do it because the Bill has
been limited to
London?</div><a name="0901219000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> That discussion has already taken place in
Manchester. The vote at the end of last year gave a clear indication of
what the overall community felt about it as a way of raising
revenue.</div><a name="0901219000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
92</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000391"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> That was a specific response to a question
about a congestion charging scheme, not about the need for necessary
infrastructure investment that a local authority and the business
community would see as improving the quality of their area. Mine was a
theoretical question, not tied to congestion
charging.</div><a name="0901219000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> My point is that there is an understanding
that improvement in infrastructure is needed at local level; the
business community&#146;s concern is that there does not seem to be a
coherent strategy on how that money should be raised. Government
Departments seem to be fishing around for a way of doing that, whether
it be congestion charging, a workplace car parking levy, a business
rate supplement or an accelerated development zone. There seems to be a
whole range of initiatives here, with no real thought being given to
what we are trying to do and what the single strand is by which we
should seek to raise that money. The business community is worried that
we will simply get a series of layering on. So, for example, you would
raise the money for a business rate supplement, and two years down the
track the next idea would be a business improvement district and then a
workplace car parking levy and perhaps even congestion charging after
that. There is a very real fear that business is simply seen as a cash
cow, without these programmes having a strategic idea behind
them.</div><a name="0901219000199"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
93</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000392"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I hear that message, but I simply want to come
back to the question. A chamber of commerce in a particular locality
might believe that it was extremely important to get a major
infrastructure development, which would benefit business and towards
which it would be reasonable for business to make a contribution. If it
looked at London and saw Crossrail being built on exactly that basis,
how would you explain to it that it cannot do that even though it wants
to do it because the Bill does not apply outside
London?</div><a name="0901219000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We are not saying that. We are saying that
there needs to be some coherence in the method of funding such projects
and a far greater involvement by the business community in both
deciding what the projects will be and playing an active role in
selling the concept to the wider
community.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000393"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I think you said in your evidence that there
has been active involvement by the business community in London in the
funding of Crossrail. It is very supportive of Crossrail, and
regard it as a successful model. Let us remember that this is for a
scheme that has been talked about for 20 years. It has taken a very
long time to get to the point where, at last, it appears to be
proceeding because there is now a broad-based funding model that looks
credible. Why should that option not be available to any other part of
the
country?</div><a name="0901219000291"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We are not saying that it should
not be, but there must be a decision as to what we
going to run with. Are we running with a business rate
supplement? Are we running with a business improvement district? Are we
running with a workplace car-parking levy? Are we running with
congestion charging? People can make their mind up about which way we
are going to run, but they are concerned that it will be just a
mish-mash.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000394"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> With respect, we are in a Committee dealing
with the business rate supplement because that is what is on the
agenda. You have given us evidence suggesting that you are sympathetic
to its application in London for Crossrail, but you do not see its
potential value outside London. I am trying to get to the bottom of the
question of what you will say to your members if they want to proceed
on a similar basis as London, are in agreement with the local authority
and see a project as necessary, but you have opposed the power to make
it possible.</div>
<a name="0901219000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No.</div>
<a name="0901219000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000395"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> So you are not opposed to the Bill&#146;s
powers extending outside London?</div>
<a name="0901219000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> What we are saying is that we want a
determination of which route authorities are going to take and the
clear involvement of the business community. Chambers representing the
business community are far more welcoming of the BID concept, as
opposed to the business rate supplement, because there is far greater
business engagement with BIDs than with
BRS.</div>
<a name="0901219000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000396"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I am sure that we will come back to that, but
can you say for the purposes of clarity that you are not opposed to the
powers in the Bill being available outside London, obviously subject to
the issue of votes and so
forth?</div><a name="0901219000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> If communities want to examine that, they can
do&#151;yes, absolutely.</div>
<a name="0901219000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000397"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> I suppose the issue is that they cannot do that
at the moment, so the Bill is important in its wider scope beyond
London, to allow communities to do so. Perhaps we need to explore that
message and return to it later.</div>
<a name="0901219000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
dealt with ballots. Is that what you are getting at? You have talked
about engagement with the community. The message from our previous
witnesses was that the Bill would be far more reassuring to their
members if a ballot was a standard part of the imposition of a
supplementary rate.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div><a name="0901219000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> The ballot and the timing of a BID are one of
the measure&#146;s most attractive elements because, first, they have
forced the business community and agencies, particularly local
authorities, to find out what communities want. Secondly, they have
forced them to get out and sell the concept of a business improvement
district, and explain the added value. The BID then goes to a ballot.
We think that the simple majority and the measures concerning the
aggregate rateable values form a good twin-track approach. At the end
of five years, you have to go and resell the concept; that is democracy
at work and it is a good thing. That is why the BID concept is strongly
supported.</div>
<a name="0901219000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000398"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> So with that proviso, the Bill is slightly less
scary to your members.</div>
<a name="0901219000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> Yes, to use that terminology, it is far less
scary, because it gives the business community the ability to become
involved. The worry with the other programmes that I have mentioned is
that they would be seen as an imposition.</div>
<a name="0901219000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000399"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> Is there a feeling that local authorities would
automatically look at the list of all the potential powers and use all
of them to get as much money as possible out of the business community?
Do you think that it is more likely that through consultation with the
business community&#151;and a ballot is integral&#151;there would
be a local decision on which model would be best for that area and that
that is a better way to
proceed?</div><a name="0901219000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I would like to think that that will be the
case. My concern is that over the next few years, as funding for local
authorities becomes tighter, they will seek every additional way to
raise money locally. The other concern is that there will be
substitution&#151;in other words, the funds for existing economic
development activities will be transferred to fund social services, for
example, and the business community will be asked to fund work that is
already being carried out.</div>
<a name="0901219000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000400"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> My questions arise from those put by Mr.
Raynsford and from your answers towards the end. There is the principle
of the business rate supplements and their detail. To be clear, you are
in favour of the principle of BRS, but have problems with the
detail.</div><a name="0901219000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> We do not oppose the principle of raising
additional funds from the business community at a local level. As I
said at the beginning, we think that some of the increases would do
that.</div><a name="0901219000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000401"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> That is excellent. It is a change from the written
submission, so good. My second question concerns your being in favour
of the principle of the BRS. I am not clear about your position. Are
you in favour of the principle of BRS for London and the rest of the
country, or just in favour of the principle of BRS for London and not
the rest of the
country?</div><a name="0901219000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No, we think that the concept of raising
additional funds from the UK business community is one that should be
explored.</div><a name="0901219000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000402"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> So you would not be in favour of a London-only
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="0901219000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No. Our concern is that the flip side is that
the BRS was introduced specifically to deal with the issue of
Crossrail.</div><a name="0901219000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000403"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> That leads me to my final question. You are in
favour of the principle of the business rate supplement. Is that the
case? You mentioned
Crossrail.</div><a name="0901219000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No, we are in favour of the principle of
allowing moneys to be raised from local communities, including the
business
community.</div><a name="0901219000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000404"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> Are you in favour of the business rate supplement
being used to make Crossrail a
reality?</div><a name="0901219000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I think that we have to
be.</div><a name="0901219000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000405"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> So you are. I will not go into verbal gymnastics. I
have a simple question. You are in favour of BRS in London for
Crossrail. We have established that. Does your concern about the detail
act as a veto to London getting the funding via the business rate
supplement or do you accept, even with its imperfections in your view,
that it is worth having and so that Crossrail can
succeed?</div><a name="0901219000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I think that Crossrail is too far down the
track. It is not an ideal way in which to fund a national project,
because Crossrail is not such a
project.</div><a name="0901219000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000406"></a> Mr.
Khan:</b> With its imperfections, it is fine. I like the pun.
Thank
you.</div><a name="0901219000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000407"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> I am a former business man. I had a business that
was based in the City, so I understand your critique or concern that,
as a whole, the Government often regard business as a cash cow. I would
have used that critique myself when I was on the other side of the
fence, before I joined the public sector. Do you not appreciate that
there is disbursement on different initiatives, whether BIDs, the whole
BRS thing or the accelerated development service, partly because of the
level of hostility, so we need small parcels with identifiable, quite
distinct benefits for business, otherwise business just thinks that it
is all more and more Government on its back. If business can see that
there are distinct benefits&#151;there are quite different benefits,
as we saw in our discussion about BIDs, for example&#151;do you not
accept that that concern is in the mind of any Government who are
trying to raise money for large infrastructure projects.</div>
<a name="0901219000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No, I just think that there is a lack of
coherence. I do not think that a debate is taking place about how much
money should be raised at a local level and how that can best be done.
There appear to be a range of different &#147;innovative&#148;
schemes to raise money at a local level, without any thought being
given as to how they dovetail together&#151;if at all. That is what
creates the worries in the business community. It signs up for one
business improvement district, which for the reasons I have given has
strong supporters, and then finds all of a sudden that the local
authority wants to run with workplace parking charging and the BRS,
whatever we have gone
into.</div><a name="0901219000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000408"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> But as I understand it, one of your objectives is
the transparency of the initiatives. The idea of value capture goes
back a long time. It is quite an historical idea, and an element of it
in a London context goes back to the Jubilee line extension, when there
were huge benefits to the community at large, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>specific large benefits to landowners that almost came as windfall
gains. There is an element whereby matters of Crossrail and elsewhere
have been trying as far as possible to balance out the issues. I
appreciate that this is difficult: if we had had this discussion a
couple of years ago, you might have found it easier going than now,
with the travails and tumultuous economic events of the past year and
the difficulties ahead. However, can you understand that there often
have been huge windfall gains for property owners, particularly in
large infrastructure projects, where they happen to own property
nearby, which seems to be at odds with some of the benefits that need
to be spread more widely across communities in such
projects?</div><a name="0901219000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I would also say that there will be much
greater and wider economic benefits to the area, in job creation and
regeneration of communities. I do not think that it should be simply
seen as a particular landowner getting a windfall. However, we are in a
very different economic climate
now.</div><a name="0901219000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000409"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> I do not entirely agree with what Ministers are
saying specifically about Crossrail. My party has some concerns with
elements of the legislation. I possibly have slightly fewer concerns
about the principles of the measure than one or two other members of my
party. However, regarding the benefits of Crossrail, the Bill will
raise only &#163;3.25 billion for a project whose cost of is
currently envisaged to be between &#163;16 billion and &#163;17
billion. That is a relatively small figure; it is less than a fifth of
the overall cost. Do you not think that within the context of those
overall benefits, which will be seen, too, by many generations of
businesses, to pay about a fifth of that cost is in the ball park of
equitability?</div><a name="0901219000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> As I say, I can see that, but what I want to
see when we have taken the London issue out is much greater
transparency, as you say, and much greater openness to the involvement
of the business community. It is not my role, nor should it be, to say
that business communities the length and breadth of this country should
not have the power to look at how to get new developments, particularly
new forms of regeneration in their communities over the coming years.
However, it is my role to reflect some of the very real concerns about
how we will ensure the survival of good projects such as the business
improvement district. Equally, we are not going to allow the business
community to be seen just as a cash cow and have the relentless
layering of one project after
another.</div><a name="0901219000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000410"></a>Paul
Farrelly:</b> Given the initial approach of your submission,
which is really to heap one possible charge on another, on another, on
another, with the implication that to your members the business rate
supplement is either the thin or the thick end of the wedge, I am not
surprised that lots of your members may have come back to chambers of
commerce around the country and said, &#147;We do not want it, and if
London wants it let it get on with it on its own&#148;. Of course, as
Mr. Raynsford skilfully probed, Crossrail is unique by
definition, because it is unique to London, but it is not unique as a
major transport or infrastructure project that might benefit different
parts of the
country.</div><a name="0901219000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not speak for Greater Manchester, Warrington or Wigan or even as
far as Runcorn, but in north Staffordshire for example, where there is
a very active chamber of commerce, some of our transport links are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>the worst in the country. If you can get into the centre of Stoke, you
will find that it is very difficult to get out. My constituency,
Newcastle-under-Lyme, has the distinction of being, post-Beeching, the
largest town in Britain without any form of railway. If a scheme in
north Staffordshire were to be constructed on the table, with different
innovative sources of finance, as was the case with Crossrail, which
has the support of many London Members, I suspect that the chamber of
commerce, given that it is screaming out for better transport in the
area, might take a different view. I suspect that that might be
replicated around the country. Have you considered
that?</div><a name="0901219000292"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> Having followed for many years the unravelling
debate about the great separation of the A500 through north
Staffordshire, I fully appreciate the interests of the area. I
come back to the point about what may well happen in the community in
north Staffordshire. I strongly suggest that because of the impact of
the downturn, not least on the ceramics sector, there will be a debate
about how that area is regenerated. It is about much more than building
roads.</div>
<a name="0901219000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The business
community wants an open and transparent debate about, first, what is
needed from a range of options and, secondly, what method will be used
to fund it&#151;and we want a vote on it, which is where the BID
comes in&#151;to get rid of the concern that, after we have paid for
something that will be in place for many years, the local authority
will propose yet another levy to do something else, so that business
communities, during an immensely difficult economic time, will find
that more and more costs are being ramped up on them.</div>
<a name="0901219000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">To talk
specifically about transport&#151;a question that is constantly
thrown at me as I go round the country to talk about congestion
charging, workplace parking and whatever&#151;that is why we are
expected to provide more money when we are already paying nearly
&#163;50 billion in road tax. People ask &#147;Why am I expected to
pay more money at a local
level?&#148;</div><a name="0901219000239"></a>

that you are right to moderate the stance that you have taken in your
submission, in response to the question from my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, because it is feasible that around
the rest of the country the proposal might be a goer, and the answer
&#147;Well you cannot have it because it is only for London&#148;
would not be
satisfactory.</div><a name="0901219000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ask one final counter-factual or hypothetical question. Given
that the business rate is nationally determined&#151;there is a
nationally determined pricing system&#151;and that, particularly with
the current slump, certain areas of economic activity could be spurred
by business rate reductions, has your membership given any
consideration internally to the question of whether chambers of

apply locally in different
areas?</div><a name="0901219000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

rate relocalisation. There is a view that there should be much more
local determination but, equally, many of our members and I have long
memories and remember the early 1980s, when local authorities were in
difficult times and levied substantial increases in the business rate,
often beyond 15 per cent. That acts as a drag on any debate about
relocalisation, which must be introduced if we are talking about
business rate reduction.</div>

attracted to the business improvement district concept, for reasons
that I have mentioned: transparency, the need for the community to sell
the concept, the twin track to getting a vote and the fact that a BID
is time-limited and must be renewed. For many of the programmes outside
London, that is the method and route that we should take. Our concern
is that if a BRS is introduced, the concept of BIDs will
dissolve.</div><a name="0901219000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000414"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> It seems to me that your strongest
objection&#151;you said that you do not have an objection in
principle&#151;is that there are several areas in which councils can
introduce charges, such as congestion charges or workplace parking
levies, and the BRS will be another one. I think that you said there
was no coherence, which surprises me. Those are the sorts of tools and
mechanisms that councils will have, but it will be for the local
authorities, working with business, to set out the strategies for using
them. Surely, the supplement would be a case in point. I could be wrong
and may be being too generous, but I cannot imagine a council suddenly,
off the top of its head, producing a scheme without talking to business
or trying to develop a strategy that has to have the support of
business to take it
forward.</div><a name="0901219000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some ways, are we repeating the arguments that we had in the
&#146;70s and &#146;80s, when there were loony left councils and
when businesses were seen as part of the capitalist world, so we just
stuck rates on them. We have moved on tremendously in the past 20 or 25
years. The <i class="I">Financial Times</i> made an important point that councils
have significantly raised their game in the past decade&#151;we are
in a new environment, a new culture. Some Opposition thinking seems to
be based on the old situation, which existed back in the &#146;70s
and &#146;80s, and not on what exists today. There are much more
forward-thinking councils, which like economic strategies that involve
business&#151;that closely involve business. Should we not be trying
to work this through, rather than saying, &#147;Well, we don&#146;t
believe it&#146;s coherent&#148;? It is for the local authorities,
with business locally, to make it
coherent.</div><a name="0901219000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I said at the outset, relationships between
chambers of commerce and local authorities are extraordinarily strong,
for the reasons I expressed. However, I would simply point you at
Nottingham. The business community has made it absolutely clear that it
does not want workplace car parking charging, but the local authority
is determined to drive it
through.</div><a name="0901219000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000415"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> But there is a difference between not getting the
agreement of business and saying that there is no coherence. Your
strongest argument seems to be that there is no coherence to the
measures. There is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>difference between that and agreeing or disagreeing. Local authorities
set out economic strategy, which you would be involved
in.</div><a name="0901219000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No, it is not just about coherence, it is
about involvement. The reason why the BIDs have been extraordinarily
well embraced by communities up and down the country is that
involvement.</div><a name="0901219000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000416"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> Involvement is not
agreement.</div><a name="0901219000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No, but engagement or involvement do not mean
simply saying, &#147;We&#146;ll talk to you, ticking the box, but
we shall go ahead whether or not you agree with
us.&#148;</div><a name="0901219000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000417"></a> Derek
Twigg:</b> But it does not mean, because you cannot agree on a
particular scheme, that the whole thing should fall. That is what you
are trying to
say.</div><a name="0901219000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> No, but what I am saying in terms of the
business improvement districts is that there has been a remarkable
amount of engagement and of agreement. However, I pointed out the
concern that, in Nottingham, the business community made it absolutely
plain that workplace car parking charges was not the way forward,
because they fall on one section of the community&#151;yet the local
authority is going ahead. That acts as a
warning.</div><a name="0901219000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000418"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> I would like to return to the question of
compatibility and the similarity between this sort of approach and
BIDs.</div><a name="0901219000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already discussed ballots, which are part of the BID process. In
the view of your members, were ballots to be part of the BRS process
too, that would improve the measure. However, is it not important to
distinguish between BIDs and what we are talking about here? BIDs are
not designed to set up and fund infrastructure projects on the scale
that we are talking about&#151;key projects to unlock economic
development across a whole county or area. Do you accept that that
purpose is a different one to that of a
BID?</div><a name="0901219000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> Not necessarily. If one looks, for example, at
Coventry, there is now a city-wide BID running there. BIDs are no
longer run purely for town centres or high streets. The vision included
in a lot of them is now far greater. I see no reason why the concept
could not extend county-wide, and certainly across borough
boundaries.</div><a name="0901219000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000419"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> That is interesting&#151;it is not something I
had heard before. I understood&#151;we have heard from Mr.
Raynsford, who was carefully stewarding local government matters when
BIDs were introduced&#151;that they had a different purpose. Perhaps
we shall hear later from British BIDs about how that moves
forward.</div><a name="0901219000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> It could well be worth while looking at some
of the sums that could be raised in some of the metropolitan boroughs
from a BID, as opposed to a business rate supplement. You may well find
that the funding was far greater, because of the &#163;50,000 minimis
on the RVs, which is not the situation with the BIDs. In certain areas,
it may be far more attractive to go the BID
route.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="0901219000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000420"></a> Dan
Rogerson:</b> On where a BID is already in operation and a BRS
might be imposed across a wider area over the top of it, where the BID
is focused on the town centre, what do you think should be the
interaction between the two? What do you think about
offsetting?</div>
<a name="0901219000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> There may well need to be an offset. Clearly,
businesses will be concerned if they have signed up to the idea of a
BID and they appreciate what it is trying to do, and then in the
interim the idea of a BRS comes in, which is a much bigger strategic
issue but without the local involvement. They might say, &#147;Well,
if we&#146;re already paying one levy&#148;&#151;the business
rate supplement&#151;&#147;we&#146;re not going to pay for a BID
next time round.&#148; There is only a limited amount of money in the
pot.</div>
<a name="0901219000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901219000421"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> May I come in on this issue, Mr.
Atkinson?</div>
<a name="0901219000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0901219000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="0901219000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000423"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> You are a kind man, Mr. Atkinson. I am
intrigued because, what you have described, Mr.
Frost&#151;perhaps you can tell us a little about how the scheme
operates in Coventry&#151;sounds counter to the way in which BIDs
were supposed to operate, which was a much more localised process. You
referred to a city-wide BID in Coventry. Does it cover the entirety of
Coventry?</div><a name="0901219000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> It covers all of the borough, the city of
Coventry. It started off as a city centre BID and then last year moved
out into the whole metropolitan borough or
city.</div><a name="0901219000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000424"></a> Mr.
Field:</b> I think that is contrary to what was intended by
BIDs, which was that they should be far more localised. Perhaps it is
just an appreciation for my own constituency, where locations are often
two or three streets from the new west end, Oxford street and Regent
street and on one or two small alleyways just off that. So it operates
through the whole city, and all businesses&#151;retail and
otherwise&#151;pay their supplement towards a city-wide
BID?</div><a name="0901219000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I can send you the details, but it is the
majority of
businesses.</div><a name="0901219000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000425"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> I am, in a sense, pursuing the point that has been
raised by Mr. Field and Mr. Rogerson. It comes
back to the question of coherence. Am I to believe that what you are
talking about is that local government bodies have a number of measures
to raise money, to which supplements will be an addition, and that what
you want to see is some connection with those measures to make
supplements a coherent choice for the local business
community?</div>
<a name="0901219000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> First, there has to be coherence. Secondly,
there has to be involvement. Thirdly, there has to be some form of
guarantee that having paid one charge, businesses are not going to end
up paying another one on
top.</div><a name="0901219000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000426"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> Tell me how you think that this should operate. If
we introduced a business rate supplement, how would it operate in
connection with the other measures? For example, if there was a small
BID in the centre of a much larger area where the local government
wanted to have a business rate supplement for a transport
infrastructure development, which would help the whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>area, are you suggesting that the cost of the BID would somehow be
netted off? How would it work from your
perspective?</div><a name="0901219000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> It may be some form of netting off, so that
businesses are not going to pay the whole of a BID and then the whole
of a business rate supplement; there would be some form of agreement
that they will pay not 200 per cent., but perhaps 100 or 150 per cent.
of the sum. The details can be worked out, but the concern will be that
already having signed up for a BID and paid for it, businesses will
then get another layer through being asked to come back for the
BRS.</div>
<a name="0901219000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000427"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> But what the business community has been saying to
us across the board is that there has to be some justification for the
things that it is being charged for.</div>
<a name="0901219000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i>
Absolutely.</div><a name="0901219000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000428"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> If you take a retailer in the BID area, one of your
members, whom you have already shown that the cost of the BID to their
business is worthwhile because of the benefits they receive, and you
can then do that with the BRS, what would be wrong with charging for
both, so long as it can be justified in business
terms?</div><a name="0901219000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> But that is what I am saying about why we are
so attracted to BIDs. The local authority will have to go out to the
business community, having asked it what it wants, and say,
&#147;Right, this is what we are proposing. You now get a vote on
this.&#148; If those two criteria are met, it happens. They have that
certainty. The BID is there for five years, they have been forced to
sell it and the business community gets on and does it. With BIDs is
that, far from saying to a local authority that business does not want
to pay more tax, when business sees real benefits from doing it and
when it is effectively engaged, business will participate
actively.</div><a name="0901219000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000429"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> But you must recognise that there is an essential
difference between a small localised BID area&#151;I am interested in
this idea that you can extend it through a whole city, but I think
would take it away from the original purposes, as Mr. Field
has already indicated&#151;where it may be possible to do all the
things that you are suggesting we should do, and a much larger area
covered by a BRS, where it would be much more difficult to do
that.</div><a name="0901219000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> I have never seen a BID purely as covering two
or three streets or just Rugby town centre, for example. I have seen it
ultimately as operating across a borough. I have no problems with that;
it seems a very effective way of raising
money.</div>
<a name="0901219000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000430"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> You must be able to think of many cases where a BID
could be successful in a town centre because all the businesses there
could see the great advantages, but expanding it out into a whole
metropolitan area would be a much more difficult
sell.</div><a name="0901219000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> Absolutely. It may be a more difficult sell
and that is where I think businesses can be galvanised and enthuse both
the business community and, importantly, the local authority to say,
&#147;Okay, this is the vision for this borough, this is the way we
want to take it. It is not just about building roads or a new railway
station. This is the economic development package. We appreciate that
we are not going to get all that money from central 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>Government. We need to raise more locally. Do you want to do it?&#148;
I am confident that if that is put in place, in many areas it will
happen because the business community is
engaged.</div><a name="0901219000280"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000431"></a> Mr.
Love:</b> Let me put a hypothetical case to you. I am sorry to
do this as I do not generally like hypothetical cases, but let us take
a small BID area where 10 per cent. of the businesses are sceptical of
the benefits. What is to stop them saying, &#147;Let us not have the
BID in this small area because we will lose. Let us have it in the
metropolitan area, where there might be a much better chance of being
successful in persuading the business community&#148;? What would be
lost is the essential part of the BID that should be developed in the
town centre. That would be lost because of the attempt to spread it too
far. Do you not see inherent dangers in that&#151;that you will lose
the essence of a BID in a town centre because you are trying to extend
it into a part where there is a much more sceptical business
community?</div><a name="0901219000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Frost:</b></i> To be honest, I do not. There are communities
up and down the country where we need seriously to raise the game.

it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000432"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> In your evidence, you are clear that you
strongly support the BID process, in particular the active engagement
of business because there will always be a ballot. With BRS, where the
business contribution is over 30 per cent., there has to be a ballot.
Is there any difference in such cases between BRS and the BID
mechanism?</div><a name="0901219000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

difference.</div><a name="0901219000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000433"></a> Mr.
Raynsford:</b> To pursue the question, do you think 30 per
cent. is too high and should it be lower? There is quite a strong case
that if business is asked to make a de minimis contribution, it should
not be in a position to veto something supported by a large number of
other people. We touched on that with Mr. Field&#146;s
questioning in relation to Crossrail. Are you unhappy about the 30 per
cent. or do you argue for a mandatory ballot in all cases, even
recognising that in some cases that might kill a worthwhile project
because, even though the business contribution was de minimis, it still
had a right to vote it
down?</div><a name="0901219000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

132</b><b class="B"><a name="0901219000434"></a> Mr.

there should be threshold and that 30 per cent. is probably the
right one. Thank
