						<a name="08011134000468"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Hood, I would like to place on the record that although
I thank the Minister for the briefing he has put before the Committee
on delegated powers in the Bill&#151;a briefing that I asked for at
the meeting we had after Second Reading&#151;it was unfortunate that
it only arrived on the evening of 7 January, which was less than 18
hours before the Committee started. In the briefing, the Minister
stated that on publication of the Bill he
also</div>
					<a name="08011134000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;published the
delegated powers memorandum for the Health and Social Care Bill by
placing copies in the House
Library.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
contacted the Library yesterday, I was informed that it did not have
the memorandum. On further investigation with officials and with the
Library, I was told this morning&#151;the information is rather
specific, so forgive me for quoting&#151;that:</div>
					<a name="08011134000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This was a delegated
powers memorandum which does not fall into the category of deposited
paper unless it is specifically mentioned by a Minister as being placed
in the Library, therefore it was not given a dep number. It was sent to
the library but was obviously rejected as a dep by our deposited papers
clerk.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand from
officials that they tried to deposit the paper in the Library but that
the Library refused to take it, presumably on the ground stated. This
morning, the Library has provided me with a hard copy of the
memorandum. The first mention of its existence was in the briefing that
I first saw just before the Committee met on Monday 7
January.</div>
					<a name="08011134000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand the difficulty, Mr. Hood, perhaps you could
assist me in ascertaining when the Committee was notified about the
memorandum and given access to it. Given that a quarter of the
Bill&#146;s clauses are dependent on secondary legislation, the
memorandum is a key document for the proper working of the Committee. I
am anxious that there should be a timely consideration of all such
documents, so that we can scrutinise the Bill. I would be grateful for
your advice, Mr.
Hood.</div>
					<a name="08011134000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000469"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Before I rule on the point of order, I invite
the Minister to respond to Mr. O&#146;Brien&#146;s
point.</div>
					<a name="08011134000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000470"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Ben
Bradshaw):
						</b> Yes, I can do so briefly. My understanding is
that&#151;and I apologise for this&#151;my officials were not aware
of the new Library rule requiring some public commitment on the part of
the Minister that he or she will place a document in the Library.
Although I think that we have e-mails from way back showing that it was
our intention to do so, my officials and I were not aware of the
procedure. As 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>the hon. Member for Eddisbury has graciously acknowledged, we tried to
place the document in the Library, but it did not happen because of the
new
rule.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000471"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I appreciate the point made by the hon. Member
for Eddisbury, but it is not a point of order for the Chair. Having
raised the matter and had the Minister respond to it, perhaps the usual
channels can resolve the problem. It is not a matter that I consider a
point of order.</div>

Care Quality
Commission</div>
					<a name="08011134000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000472"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in
clause 1, page 1, line 9, at
end insert</div>
					<a name="08011142000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;with the
totality of their quality inspection functions and duties passing to
the Care Quality
Commission&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the beginning of the first amendment, to clause 1, may I formally take
this opportunity in our line-by-line sessions to welcome you,
Mr. Hood, and your co-Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member
for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway), to the Chair to deliberate
over our
proceedings?</div>
					<a name="08011134000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
is patently clear to all of us who have been studying the Bill for some
time, clause 1 introduces the Care Quality Commission&#151;the body
that will take over from the Commission for Healthcare Audit and
Inspection, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and the Mental
Health Act Commission. Clause 1(2) states that those three predecessor
bodies are to be &#147;dissolved&#148;. We have proposed an
amendment that would add after the word &#147;dissolved&#148; the
phrase</div>
					<a name="08011134000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with the totality
of their quality inspection functions and duties passing to the Care
Quality
Commission&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is vital that I explain why the amendment is important. It is at the
beginning of the Bill and will, therefore, be important in relation to
many of the other things that we deliberate on. Most importantly, it
seeks to ensure that we leave as little doubt as possible for all those
who will have to put in place the arrangements contemplated under the
Bill&#151;assuming that it has safe passage through the House. I
commend the amendment to the Minister and hope that he will regard it
as constructive, helpful, positive and not at all partisan, and as
something that will help those who have to implement the Bill. I hope
that he contemplates accepting
it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would establish continuity with the previous regulators, thereby
smoothing the transition, and clarify the costs involved. We have heard
a lot about transition in the last three sittings, during which we
heard helpful oral evidence. All the regulators as currently
constituted and many third-party groups have expressed concern at the
silence of the Bill on their future function, as embodied in the new
Care Quality Commission. Both the Commission for Social Care
Inspection&#151;CSCI, as I shall abbreviate it for future
reference&#151;and MHAC, the Mental Health Act Commission, have
expressed concern that their work will be curtailed due to the
merger.</div>
					<a name="08011134000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">CSCI has asked
me to alert the Committee to a letter that it has sent, outlining its
opposition to the Minister&#146;s principled welcome to the Bill. It
might be helpful if we recall that, during the course of CSCI&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>evidence to us just a couple of sittings ago, it engaged in a dialogue
with the Minister. CSCI is concerned that an impression may have been
given about its public position in relation to the merger of the three
bodies that it does not feel necessarily fairly reflects its
position.</div>
					<a name="08011134000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">CSCI has
written saying that it has now had the opportunity to look again at its
statement of 24 October 2007&#151;it was quoted by the
Minister&#151;that was prepared following the publication of the
Department of Health&#146;s response to the consultation on its wider
regulatory review and its decision to proceed with the creation of a
new Care Quality Commission, bringing together the functions of this
commission and the other two. The letter from CSCI
says:</div>
					<a name="08011134000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It did
not make reference to the Bill now before your
Committee.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the
Bill was only published on 24 October and given its First Reading on 15
November. That statement was posted on the commission&#146;s website,
but it was not formally issued as a press release. CSCI, which is
relevant in respect of the way that amendment No. 1 works, notes that
in welcoming the overall policy direction, it also made it clear in the
statement that there was a &#147;great deal of detail&#148; yet to
be determined in the proposals. It
says:</div>
					<a name="08011134000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
commission has always been of the view that a structural change in the
regulation of social care and health services at this time is
premature, however desirable that end might be in the longer
term.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is important,
because the amendment is intended to ensure that we have some
continuity, rather than the pitfalls that might attend to something
that is seen, by those who have the greatest experience and expertise
in that area, as
premature.</div>
					<a name="08011134000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">CSCI also
said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The new
organisation must have parity between health and social
care.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading,
the Secretary of State
said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My hon.
Friend&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011134000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">he was
referring to the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood
(Mrs.
Humble)&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011134000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;raises
the crucial issue with regard to the plan to merge the three current
regulators. Social care must have parity in the new commission. That
must be reflected on the board of the new commission and in everything
that the commission does. I am pleased that she has given me the
opportunity to reassert that that is the case, and that it needs to be
the case. That point will be emphasised throughout the passage of the
Bill.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 26 November 2007; Vol. 468, c.
37.]</div>
					<a name="08011134000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here is the opportunity for
the Minister to ensure that that is given a true manifestation in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011134000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">CSCI also says
that if additional functions, such as around hospital cleanliness, are
not adequately funded by the Government, it fears that they will be
funded out of cuts to social care regulation. Moreover, it has been
asserted that CSCI has
already</div>
					<a name="08011134000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reduced its
recurrent operating costs by 33 per cent. in real terms between 2004
and 2009. The Government has also said that the new body will have to
operate on a substantially smaller budget than the combined current
budgets of CSCI, the Healthcare
Commission&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
MHAC.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>
					<a name="08011134000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
putting amendment No. 1 into the Bill after the word
&#147;dissolved&#148; would make it absolutely clear that in this
case&#151;rather than looking at the quality inspection
functions&#151;we are looking particularly at having the duties
passed to the Care Quality Commission, without there being a danger
that the things that CSCI has, over a relatively short period, worked
so hard to establish in the crucial areas of both care and inspection
fall through the gaps during what, as the Minister admitted, will
inevitably be a disruptive time as one goes through change. Disruption
attends upon any change.</div>
					<a name="08011134000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In support of this amendment, I
am aware that it is always nice to have short and crisp amendments.
However, I know that there has been some discussion, through the usual
channels, about the first few amendments inevitably being some of the
more lengthily debated ones. Much of the ground that will be dealt with
later will be covered by this very important first amendment, which
would clarify the transition, the inspection functions, duties and
costs.</div>
					<a name="08011134000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
move to the Mental Health Act Commission&#146;s comments to help us
chart our way through this. In its press release on the launch of the
Bill, it said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Mental Health Act
Commission is concerned that with the merger of its functions into a
large regulatory body with a wide variety of functions that monitoring
of the operation of the Mental Health Act and the protection of
vulnerable patients may not get the priority it
needs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chris
Heginbotham, the chief executive of the Mental Health Act
Commission&#151;whom we all saw the other day when he gave
evidence&#151;said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only by visiting
detained patients regularly and frequently can abuses be identified and
rooted
out&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence session, MHAC expressed the fear that their
focus</div>
					<a name="08011134000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will get lost in
a large organisation&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Health
and Social Care Public Bill Committee</i>, 8 January 2008; c.
8.]</div>
					<a name="08011134000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">MHAC submitted
that</div>
					<a name="08011134000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There are six
functions or sets of functions, and the way in which those functions
are performed, that the MHAC considers to be vitally
important&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">for the CQC.
Some are current powers; some are other powers that it would like.
Briefly and in short form, those six functions are:</div>
					<a name="08011134000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Visiting and
interviewing detained patients in private ... Engaging mental
health service users ... Adequate organisational and personal
accountability for monitoring and reporting on the needs and rights of
detained patients; Statutory notifications of admissions, discharges
and deaths of detained patients, and other relevant information;
Ensuring adequate and appropriately trained staff&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011134000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">and an equality and human rights focus.
That last will, of course, be the subject of a number of other
discussions as we proceed through the Bill, but of course it matters
even at this early stage.</div>
					<a name="08011134000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">A majority of third-party
organisations has also expressed concern about the merger, hence this
rather important approach to clarifying the purpose of the merger in
the amendment. Age Concern, in its submission on the Bill,
was</div>
					<a name="08011134000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very concerned that
overall funding for this super-regulator will be far less than existing
funding for the regulatory bodies that are being
replaced&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>
					<a name="08011134000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carers UK argued that
CSCI</div>
					<a name="08011134000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has built up
valuable expertise on carers&#146; issues and on social care more
broadly&#148;,</div>

that</div>
					<a name="08011134000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is essential
that the new body is given sufficient power and resources to maintain a
focus on social care and that it is not dominated by
health.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Help the Aged
said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;CQC&#146;s
budget must be sufficient to maintain frequency and quality of
inspection and to ensure that the new Commission builds on the work of
existing bodies &#151; doing more, rather than
less&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011134000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div>
					<a name="08011134000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Work on social
care must be given fair priority and resource allocation within the
Commission&#146;s programme ... We are also confused by the fact
that Regulatory Impact Assessment for this Bill sets out that the cost
benefit of having one regulator rather than three depends on the scope
and responsibilities of CQC, which will be set out in secondary
legislation. This would seem to suggest that it is, as yet, impossible
to tell whether the new Commission will be cheaper...We are
seeking assurances from Government that CQC&#146;s budget will be
adequate to maintain the quality and frequency of inspections and to
build on and develop the work of the previous organisations, rather
than reducing its
programmes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
General Social Care Council believes that</div>
					<a name="08011134000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is important that the
distinctive nature of social care and the values of social care
regulation developed by the GSCC and CSCI continue to be recognised in
the work of the
CQC&#148;.</div>
				
					<a name="08011134000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
an oral evidence session the Association of Directors of Adult Social
Services said that any loss of focus in social care would concern
them.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08011134000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would enable the commission to protect the current regulatory framework
and grow organically, rather than legislatively, out of that. It was
interesting that Which?, during oral evidence, commented that the Bill
does not set out a clear statement of purpose for the CQC. The
amendment would give protection against activities falling through the
gaps during transition or getting lost in a bigger organisation, let
alone defocused, because it is inevitable that priority is lost during
the admitted disruption and instability. We are already hearing
anecdotally of the inevitable recruitment and retention sclerosis that
is bound to attend upon the current proposals and the possible
demotivation of the people involved.</div>
					<a name="08011134000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will have
many specific questions over the course of the Bill so I will not tack
them on to the amendment. However, before the Minister contemplates his
response to the amendment, I want to highlight something that came out
for all us during the oral sessions&#151;visiting rights. The
visiting rights called for by the Mental Health Act Commission could be
distinguished from the kind of visiting undertaken by CSCI and the
Healthcare Commission. The Minister made clear in his evidence this
morning that the Government do not think it right to dictate now
who&#151;I interleave the commission&#151;should visit, and how
often.</div>
					<a name="08011134000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
amendment No. 1 would enable the Minister to underpin the assurance he
is seeking to give when addressing the very real concerns about those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>who are most practised, most knowledgeable and most pragmatic in making
sure that&#151;as managements and organisations&#151;they have the
continuing capacity to deliver for incredibly important, needy and
often vulnerable people in our society.</div>
					<a name="08011134000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point to highlight is
the ratings system. The CSCI is concerned that its quality ratings
system will fold&#151;in particular the star-rating system for
individual services that it plans to start rolling out during 2008. It
is telling that the official questioned this morning noted that it is
highly likely that the annual health check for hospitals will remain
annual, but that the CQC will not need to do that for all its
investigations; so despite Government statements about parity of social
care, this morning&#146;s oral evidence left us with the impression
that officials may consider that health care regulation is of prime
importance. I hope that the Minister can give us some genuine
reassurance about that.</div>
					<a name="08011134000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment covers the issue
of trying to identify the costs of transition, which I am sure are well
recognised. It is important that I try to get a handle on that as we
introduce the amendment. With regard to the costs of the merger, part
of the impact of the amendment would be to mitigate the variables in
the costings forecast for the CQC. A number of witnesses made
statements on costings during oral evidence. Dame Denise Platt pointed
out that this is framework legislation. Anna Walker noted that the
commission will need to be resourced to do the job that Parliament sets
for it and that the Bill is only a framework for that. The Minister has
made available to the Committee a briefing on the registration
requirements, which states that he is planning a formal public
consultation to inform the scope&#151;that is, which services fall
within registration&#151;and the requirements for registration. The
question must be put before the Committee, and again I hope the
amendment helps us with that. Without that information, how could the
Minister make the cost estimates that he has
made?</div>
					<a name="08011134000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulatory
impact assessment identifies that the net benefit range from a gain of
&#163;129.3 million to a loss of &#163;52.7 million over the next
10 years, with a probable estimated benefit of &#163;52.7 million
plus a net gain of &#163;3.3 million on the administration burdens
baseline, is at 2005 prices. On 13 December, the <i class="I">Financial Times
</i>reported that the Minister had confirmed wind-up costs of
&#163;140 million, and there were departmental claims that it would
save &#163;60 million per annum. We must try to identify whether the
amendment helps us to get a handle on that vital area of cost which,
given the claims made for the combination, must be understood.
Otherwise, we could be proceeding not only in the dark, but under false
assumptions.</div>

							<b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): The regulatory
impact assessment says, in paragraph 1, that the costs mentioned by my
hon. Friend are based on the framework, and that a lot of them will be
identified only when the details are known. We are being asked to
legislate on something with a set of figures that is extremely broad,
and I wonder if my hon. Friend is minded to invite the Minister to
provide, during the course of the Committee, more outline detail as to
where those costs will fall.</div>
					<a name="08011134000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000474"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I know that she
is very good at working with and using 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>costs and numbers, and I admire her for that as it is not a skill that
is overwhelmingly presented during parliamentary life. It is a serious
matter: costs matter, particularly in this case where so much is
claimed for the cost benefit of what is taking place. I have already
asked how the Minister was able to make his cost estimate, on the basis
that it was made only on outline frameworks, without the benefit of the
detail, and is still subject to consultation. Unless the consultation
is not meant to count for anything, and it is all done and dusted and
merely a question of going through the form, we are left having to make
assumptions.</div>
					<a name="08011134000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is quite dangerous in the circumstances. If something is to become a
successor body to three existing, high-performing bodies in the public
arena, certainty is required above all, as there are many vulnerable
people for whom this will not be the same as if something is invented,
where we have a clean sheet of paper. There will be people with needs
that continue today, tomorrow and the day after the organisation is
established. If we do not have clarity about the costs, we are in grave
danger of making errors as a legislature.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000475"></a>Angela

						<b class="B"> </b>We need to mix into the equation the
question of fees that come from sources other than the
Government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000476"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> That is an important question. I do not know
whether my hon. Friend has had a chance to look at the terms of the
money resolution that will be debated on Tuesday on the Floor of the
House. As I read them, they are narrowly drafted in relation to the
fees that are expected to be paid to the chairmen of the adjudication
panels under the new determination procedures for continuing in
practice. Apart from anything else, there are serious issues about the
fact that the money resolution has come up at this stage, rather than
being tagged on to Second Reading as one might have expected. It will
look as though there have been subsequent negotiations, perhaps with
the General Medical Council and others, which have led to that change
at this late stage, and we will have some interesting timetabling
issues as a result of that being dealt with on the Floor of the House
at the same time as the Committee should be sitting.</div>
					<a name="08011134000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend is right to
highlight the need to control, as well as understand, the external fees
required strategically to deliver the proposals into existence. The
fees are highly difficult to quantify but, if sufficient detail has
been produced, they should at least enable a realistic estimate rather
than a stab in the dark. It is important to put that point on the
record.</div>
					<a name="08011134000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Minister has listened to the exchange with genuine and sincere
concern, and will give a detailed assurance on the matter when he
addresses the issues. It is important for him to reconcile the cost
differences between the regulatory impact assessment and the
<i class="I">Financial Times</i> report, and the point raised by my hon. Friend.
He also needs to explain how those costs were reached given that the
work of the CQC is yet to be defined.</div>
					<a name="08011134000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government say that in the
long term, the merger will save &#163;60 million per annum. The CSCI
is concerned that the CQC will be on a challenging financial footing
from the outset&#151;most of us might accept that that is the case
with every organisation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>None the less, it will be challenging for the CQC, because the CSCI has
already had that experience. I mentioned earlier that it has already
demonstrably met its targets to trim costs and it should be publicly
congratulated for doing so in a graded way. It is always difficult to
pare down running costs, which it has managed to do without standards
or the scope of its activities suffering. It is particularly concerning
that, as some of the powers for the new commission are permissive
rather than mandatory, the CQC may not be able to allocate funds to
permissive powers. The Minister has confirmed that the wind-up costs
will now amount to about &#163;140 million. Will the Minister confirm
those wind-up costs&#151;clearly an important sum to
understand&#151;and, most important, tell us when the &#163;60
million of savings will be delivered? What is the projection for that
and how will they arise, not least by not impacting on the scope,
quality and delivery of services?</div>
					<a name="08011134000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now provide a final
round-up of the amendment. It is with some apologies that I take time
over it, but I hope that it sets the scene for an important amendment
that would help to encompass so much more of what we are trying to
achieve early on in our deliberations. Part of the impact of the
amendment would be to mitigate the impact of the upheaval of further
change and regulation. The Minister accepted, during the course of his
oral evidence this morning, that there is inevitably some disruption
when there are changes such as this. He said that we have to weigh up
the benefit of going through the process against the inevitable
disruption that we have to suffer. We have changes in the social care
regulation timeline, and I shall look at how they have
progressed.</div>
					<a name="08011134000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 1998
White Paper&#151;&#147;Modernising Social
Services&#148;&#151;proposed structural change. The Care Standards
Act 2000 created a single England-wide National Care Standards
Commission, which was launched in 2002; 17 days later the Government
announced that it was to be abolished. The Health and Social Care Act
2003 created the CSCI, which was launched in 2004, incorporating the
social care responsibilities of the NCSC, the work of the Department of
Health social services inspectorate and the SSI-Audit Commission joint
review team. In 2004, the Government&#146;s arm&#146;s length body
review ruled out a merger with the Healthcare Commission. In the 2005
Budget statement the Chancellor announced the merger. In his oral
evidence, David Rogers of the LGA noted:</div>
					<a name="08011134000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Organisational change
always causes some short-term disruption and some loss of focus for a
short period.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and
Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i>08 January 2008; c. 82,
Q193.]</div>
					<a name="08011134000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister was right to
point out, in his evidence this morning, that Mr. Rogers
thought that the long-term benefits outweighed the disruption, as I
indicated earlier. However, Mr. Rogers said that everything
must be attempted to minimise the disruption and loss of focus. The
amendment would do that, but the Minister, unfortunately, has not yet
told us how he would do it, so I hope that he will find our proposal a
convenient way to short-circuit the concern that we would otherwise
have, and will accept our amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011134000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister wants a list of
questions to address, perhaps I could usefully summarise the questions
that I hope he will be able to address, as well as giving us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>some comments on the general arguments that I have advanced to underpin
and substantiate the merits of the amendment. Will the Minister outline
what quality inspection functions and duties the new regulator will
lose from the sum of its parts? Would it not be better for the current
regulators to be brought under one roof and one brand in the
legislation, but for their functions to remain unchanged by Parliament
at this stage and joint working delivered organically? Does the
Minister agree that the constant restructuring of regulation has been
disruptive, and will he tell us why the Government will get it right
this time, and why the Committee should give them another
chance?</div>
					<a name="08011134000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
having information on the scope and content of registration, how did
the Minister make the cost estimates that he has made? Will he first
reconcile, as I asked earlier, the cost differences between the RIA and
the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> report and, secondly, explain how those
costs were reached, given the fact that the work of the CQC has yet to
be defined? What percentage of the savings is due to organisational
costs and what to regulatory costs? That distinction is of key
significance, particularly remembering CSCI&#146;s evidence that it
has managed to pare to the bone the organisational costs. One must be
careful in any walk of life&#151;this certainly compares to my own
business life&#151;not to aim to achieve things that are
unattainable. If one already asked management to reduce costs to the
bone, one does not need to start chipping away at the bone itself. That
is a recipe for disaster. When will the &#163;60 million a year
savings be achieved?</div>
					<a name="08011134000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister accept that
there has to be some acknowledgement of, and even culpability for, this
constant restructuring, which is hardly motivating for all those who so
dedicatedly give their lives and careers to the public services that we
depend upon? With that set of arguments, I commend the amendment, and I
hope that the Minister will feel that the arguments are compelling
enough to accept
it.</div>

					<a name="08011134000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a brief amendment to a
brief clause. In some ways we have had a stand part discussion as well,

repetition for the sake of it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberal Members have supported
the principle behind the merger, but it is right to ask questions: why
now, when the existing the existing regulators are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>starting to work extremely effectively? Is it worth the upheaval and
extra cost&#151;&#151;and to achieve what, really? Reorganisations
are always costly, not just in money but in staff time. We all suffered
the pain of the reorganisation of the primary care trusts, where people
were demotivated because they did not know whether they had a job and
were unsure of their future role. When our regulatory system is
beginning to work so well, there are concerns about putting the brakes
on, and some things possibly not going as well as they could. The
regulatory impact assessment has been mentioned, mainly in the context
of costs. Costs are important and we all want to make maximum use of
public money, but I must stress the point raised the hon. Member for
Eddisbury.</div>

it was pertinent to ask those questions. Just because a principle is
agreed, it does not mean that the detail is agreed. We would not be
doing our job properly unless we ensured that whatever replaces the
current regulators does the job as well, if not better. That is a
public responsibility that we all have. We have to make sure that we
get the detail right. That, I thought, is why we were on this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08011134000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem of costs has been raised, and it is not clear what they should
be. The biggest problem, as highlighted by the hon. Member for
Eddisbury, is that we do not yet know the full scope, breadth or detail
of what the new body will do. It would be useful to have more detail
when we discuss that.</div>
					<a name="08011134000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want to echo the
concerns raised by the Member for Tiverton and Honiton about costs
being passed on to hospitals, nursing homes and other bodies. There has
been a drift in that direction to some extent already, but it is
robbing Peter to pay Paul, because in some cases those costs are just
picked up by a different part of the NHS. Some clarity on that would
help.</div>
					<a name="08011134000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as the
costs, the regulatory impact assessment pointed out other risks. It
said that the key risks would be</div>

assurances from my hon. Friend the Minister about costs and budgets.
Clearly, there will be some economies of scale that will no doubt
reduce costs overall&#151;a figure of 40 per cent. has been
mentioned. But there are concerns that this might put budget pressures
on the inspection system. I would like my hon. Friend to give
assurances that inspection will not be damaged by budget pressures
because, particularly as I have mentioned previously, this is largely
private sector now, especially long-term care for the elderly. It is
important that there is a rigorous inspection system to ensure that
care standards are maintained at a high level and nobody in a care home
suffers as a result of inadequate performance by the providers because
they are not being inspected. Can my hon. Friend could give some
assurance on

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000483"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> May I make two general remarks before moving on
to address some of the points made by hon. Members speaking to
amendment No. 1? As I said in the evidence-giving session on Tuesday,
when a new, independent, flexible and integrated regulator is
established there is always tension between the desire to get those
elements right, a desire to take as much as possible from the status
quo and the desire to be prescriptive about what that new regulator
should do in advance of its establishment. I put that tension out there
because I suspect that tension is going to run through quite a lot of
our discussions this afternoon, not only on this amendment but on
others. Hon. Members ranged widely to discuss issues such as cost and
transition, so I want to clarify them before speaking directly to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011134000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
we did not go ahead with the integration before was that it was only
under this Government, in 1999, that for the first time we had the idea
of any kind of independent regulation of the health service and there
was still a feeling that that culture and system needed to be given
longer to bed down. The hon. Member for Romsey reminded us on Second
Reading that her party argued then in favour of integration, although
if she has not gone off the principle, she would rather have done it
then than three years thence, which is odd. But I leave that
there.</div>
					<a name="08011134000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
discussion about it and we reached the general view that the system we
had there needed longer to bed in. There is never an ideal time to
integrate regulators, which I accept are working extremely well and
have a very good reputation, however good the principles and however
much all of us may support the principles of doing so. There are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>transitional challenges to deal with. There has been some confusion on
cost because many people interpreted the &#163;7 million figure that
we included in the regulatory impact assessment as the total figure for
all the costed transition. That is only the figure for the cost of
establishing the new care quality commission. The much bigger figure of
&#163;140 million, which was in the explanatory notes, is our
estimate of the transition costs, many of which are already being
realised, as the hon. Gentleman recognised in his acknowledgement of
the savings that have already been made by the existing regulators, not
the set-up costs for the new commission. The &#163;140 million
includes the cost of redundancies, estates rationalisation and planned
reduction of the operating costs. The savings are the result of the
commitment that we have made, which we will realise through this Bill,
to reducing the costs of all public service regulation by a third and
that will mean &#163;60 million a year. The answer to his question is
that within three years, we anticipate that we would more than recoup
the overall costs of transition, many of which have already been made,
as the existing bodies have already managed to reduce their costs
without, I think, reducing their effectiveness in any
way.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000484"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> It is helpful that the Minister is going through
the costs. I think I understood him to say that some of the amounts
encompassed within his declared figures, either in the RIA or in other
figures, include costs that are already being saved or are being
incurred by the existing bodies that will be succeeded by the CQC. Will
he confirm that and help the Committee by indicating how much he is
talking about as a proportion of what to expect to save or to incur the
cost of? That would help us to know where we are on the
timeline.</div>
					<a name="08011134000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000485"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. I am afraid I
cannot give him the exact figures, but I can tell him we have been
working with the existing commissions to help them achieve those
savings and that means, we estimate, that by the time the new
commission is established, the Healthcare Commission and the CSCI will
be operating within a combined budget of &#163;145 million. We expect
the new commission to operate within the same budget. Including the
MHAC functions, that will mean a total budget for the new commission of
&#163;151 million and that process is already well under
way.</div>
					<a name="08011134000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Luton, North mentioned Unison, with whom I had a very
good session just before Christmas in which we went through a lot of
its concerns on the Bill in detail. I hope that I managed to reassure
it on most of them, but I am happy to write to him, if he would welcome
that, in more detail. I think I could even allow him to have a copy of
the letter I wrote to Unison after that meeting and the issues we
discussed. If he wants to come back to me later in this process and go
through that, I would be very happy to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08011134000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">My problem with
amendment No. 1 is that we are establishing a new body and the
amendment&#146;s practical impact would be to move all the current
functions and duties of the existing three bodies lock, stock and
barrel on top of the ones we are establishing in the new one. That
would be duplicative and create a lot of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>confusion. Many of the facets of the new commission&#146;s functions
are drawn directly from existing legislation, but there are
changes.</div>
					<a name="08011134000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the new commission&#146;s registration functions build on provisions
for the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care
Inspection under the Care Standards Act 2000, but have been made more
flexible to allow for future changes in service provision. For the
first time, they cover NHS services, as a result of which those
services that have not previously been subject to the registration
requirement now will be. In addition, CSCI has said, in particular,
that the current regulators do not have sufficient powers to act
directly when they find serious failings. We are giving the new
independent regulator a range of tougher enforcement powers to enable
that to be
done.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08011134000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
areas to which the hon. Member for Eddisbury referred that will not be
carried forward is complaints. We are not requiring the new body to
deal with second-stage complaints. Such issues have already been
extremely burdensome for the Healthcare Commission and it is much more
important that we improve the quality of complaints handling by health
care providers. I think that it was Dame Janet who said in her evidence
that that was a real mess at the moment and that it was too
slow.</div>
					<a name="08011134000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most
important thing is to give powers to the new Care Quality Commission,
as we are doing, to ensure that health care providers have proper,
decent and satisfactory complaints procedures for patients rather than
burdening the independent regulator with a second-stage complaints
responsibility. There will still be a second-stage complaint, which
will be dealt with by the health ombudsman, but we did not consider it
a good idea to burden the new regulator with such matters. We wanted it
to concentrate on its core functions of quality and
safety.</div>

							<a name="08011134000486"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister, not least for
having delayed giving way so that he at last referred to the ombudsman,
which is the point of my intervention. He will be aware that it has
been said on Second Reading and subsequently that, as a result of this
approach, concern has been expressed about whether the ombudsman will
have the capacity to deal with the anticipated number of further
complaints by way of the final court of appeal coming to him. It would
be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would undertake, now or later, to
ensure that we have a better handle on such matters because, for the
proposal to work well, we must have confidence that the ombudsman is
configured with the right capacity to deal with the anticipated
increase in the number of
cases.</div>
					<a name="08011134000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000487"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I should certainly welcome a discussion about
that at a later stage. I emphasise the fact that, by making the quality
of the complaints procedures of health care providers a priority for
the new Care Quality Commission rather than giving them such a
responsibility, our aim is that the quality of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>complaints procedures becomes much better at provider level. That will
mean that fewer complaints will need to go to a second
stage.</div>
					<a name="08011134000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ombudsman
will be dealing with more complaints than at present, but it is
desirable first and foremost that we improve the quality of complaints
procedures at provider level. As members of the Committee know, our
constituency surgeries are full of people who consider that their
complaints have not been dealt with properly. Many times, if the
complaints had been dealt with properly by the provider, even if just
by way of an apology, matters would often not have escalated and
overburdened the Healthcare Commission. If matters are dealt with in
that way, they will not overburden the
ombudsman.</div>
					<a name="08011134000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011134000488"></a>
							<b class="B">Anne
Milton</b> (Guildford) (Con): I might have missed something,
but my understanding of the office of the ombudsman is that it cannot
investigate quality of care, but only the process. Will the Minister
clarify
matters?</div>
					<a name="08011134000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000489"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> My understanding is that, if we ask the office
of the ombudsman to take sole responsibility for second-stage
complaints, it will be able to investigate them and how they had been
dealt with. That would involve quality, but I shall clarify matters for
the hon. Lady as I am not absolutely certain whether we shall change
that or whether it needs to be changed. It is something that I shall
happily clarify for her as we
progress.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000490"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> We heard in the oral evidence session that the
Healthcare Commission finds it useful to identify emerging trends that
might be the subject of a more detailed analysis on its part. Surely
that also applies to the complaints procedure. If it is now to be
divorced from the complaints procedure, emerging trends that might be a
worthy subject for a more detailed analysis and report will be lost to
it. If the office of the ombudsman does not initiate its own reports
because of emerging trends, who will plug that
gap?</div>
					<a name="08011134000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000491"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The Care Quality Commission will still have
access to trends and types of complaints, so it will still be able to
track them to see whether there are an unusual number of complaints
about a particular issue or against a particular provider, but it will
not deal with and investigate second-stage complaints itself. It will
still have that responsibility and still be able to act on that. In
fact, that will be very important. It will remain a very important part
of its job. With regard to an area in which I know she has a special
interest&#151;&#151;learning disabilities in
Cornwall&#151;&#151;that is exactly how the Healthcare Commission,
as it now is, got involved in its investigation there. That will not
change. It is just that it will not be burdened by the actual
investigation of the individual complaint. That will be the
responsibility of the ombudsman, if it has not been dealt with
satisfactorily, which we hope it will have been, by the original
provider. Did the hon. Member for Guildford want to intervene? We are
having an extended debate on the complaints process, Mr.
Hood, but I will take your guidance.</div>

						</b> Thank you for the clarification, Mr.

the complaints procedure is crucial, as the Minister said, for his own
postbag and for us all. Can he confirm that he will write to us to
clarify exactly what remit the ombudsman will have because my
understanding is that this will be a significant departure in the role
of the
ombudsman?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000495"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The Minister has very rightly said that he will
seek to help the Committee in relation to complaints, which bear very
much on amendment  No. 1 as one of the issues we are concerned
about, and whether we will lose stuff through the gaps. He will be
aware&#151;and it may be useful when he comes back to the Committee
to make sure that he gives a complete response to us and to think the
issues through&#151;that about 7,000 complaints a year are dealt with
by the Healthcare Commission. Can he confirm the current backlog, for
which, I understand, anecdotally, that estimates range between 30,000
and 80,000? Perhaps that will help by giving us a handle on what the
capacity issues for the ombudsman are, even taking into account the
improved quality of process. What about complaints in relation to
privately funded social-care
users?</div>
					<a name="08011134000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000496"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I will come back to the hon. Gentleman, as I
said, but I think he helps make my point: our prime concern is to
improve the quality of complaints-handling at provider-level in order
to avoid this burden and to improve patient satisfaction.</div>
					<a name="08011134000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having a good complaints
procedure and making senior managers of providers responsible for the
quality of that complaints procedure will be a requirement of
registration under the new Bill and the new regulator will make sure
that that happens.</div>
					<a name="08011134000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">This direction of travel has
been welcomed by patients&#146; groups, who share our frustration
that the current system complaints-processing is not satisfactory, by
and large. There are some very good examples of good practice but I am
afraid that that does not apply throughout the piece.</div>
					<a name="08011134000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall turn to some of the
other questions raised by the hon. Member for Eddisbury, particularly
on visits. He asked about visits both in the context of MHAC and CSCI
and I reassure him&#151;this was raised by MHAC in its evidence on
Tuesday and on Second Reading&#151;that visiting powers are retained
in the Bill as far as the existing visiting powers of MHAC are
concerned. Schedule 3(8) proposed new section 120(3) states that
it</div>
					<a name="08011134000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must make
arrangements...to
visit&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I am reluctant to try to put the new regulator in a straitjacket in
advance, we envisage that, in areas of particular concern to MHAC,
visits would continue with their current regularity.</div>
					<a name="08011134000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to a question raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. On Tuesday, even Sir Ian

<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>Kennedy, in critical mode, said that one of the areas of the Bill that
he was prepared to openly support was the idea of modern, precautionary
and risk-based regulation. That includes not having a straightjacket
where someone has to visit every institution once a year, every six
months or even every 18 months, but instead, having a visiting policy
that can be based on an assessment of risk. Facilities or institutions
that are a greater cause of concern can be visited more regularly than
those that have held an exemplary record for a number of years. Spot
checks can be made whenever required, and so forth. It is important to
allow the new regulator to build on that process, rather than trying to
put them in a straightjacket in advance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000497"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> On that point, we were given a specific example
yesterday with regard to the Mental Health Act Commission implementing
the Mental Health Act. For example, when an inspector goes into a
secure unit to do a mental health inspection, sometimes they come
across things that are happening to patients who are not detained under
the Act against their will, but who are there as voluntary patients.
The example was given of somebody tied into a chair who, because they
were a voluntary patient and not sectioned, the inspectors could do
nothing about. Does the Minister intend to amend the Mental Health Act
and to extend the scope of that
inspection?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000498"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> My official is shaking her head, but I
understood that one of the things that MHAC welcomed about the Bill was
that its provisions would allow the commission to take action if it
came across a similar case. We may not need to amend the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000499"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I want to pick up on the risk-based assessments
and visits, which I think are a worthy principle. However, we need to
take account of situations where a nursing home, which previously has
had a good record, has a change of hands. I have seen some dramatic
changes after a change of hands.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000500"></a>Mr.

						</b> I agree. A change of management could be a
trigger point for the new regulator to want to carry out an inspection.
However, it is not something that we need to prescribe&#151;they will
be the experts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000501"></a>Kelvin
Hopkins:
						</b> This is a specific comment on my earlier remarks.
My point was that, whatever the inspection regime, if there are budget
pressures, there is a temptation to reduce the level of front-line
work. To take a distant parallel, when water was privatised, many water
authorities immediately cut their inspections to save costs&#151;it
rained a lot and they did not need to worry about leaks. I do not
suggest that there will be immediate cuts, but budget pressures clearly
impact upon the level of service that can be provided. There are
inherent dangers if that is not specified.</div>
					<a name="08011134000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000502"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend is as happy as I
am that we are not privatising anything under this Bill. I recognise
the danger, and I assure him that the last thing that we want to do in
setting up a new regulator, is to create the risk that in five or 10
years we will face horrendous headlines of scandals, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>which could have been avoided, because of what we have done. The savings
that we are talking about&#151;I hope the hon. Member for Eddisbury
who asked the question will forgive me, I do not have the specific
ratio&#151;will be made, for example, by the amalgamation of
back-office functions or a reduction in duplication. Some of the new
inspection procedures and policies that existing organisations are
undertaking, have already led them to make most of the savings that
they needed to, in time for the integration of the three agencies. I
suggest that, unless he has evidence to the contrary, as far as I am
aware, that has not led to any serious problems in inspection or
resulted in a lack of inspection. I hope to reassure my hon. Friend the
Member for Luton, North on that.</div>
					<a name="08011134000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the ratings question that
the hon. Member for Eddisbury asked, the quality ratings that the CSCI
does will be able to continue under the legislation, and we anticipate
that they will. Again, that is not something that we are laying down
the law about, but that is certainly our
expectation.</div>
					<a name="08011134000440"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="08011134000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make
the point that I made before about integration. As health and social
care provision become increasingly integrated, it may not be obvious,
or even meaningful, to the new commission whether it should be
following its functions and duties for health as the current Healthcare
Commission or Mental Health Care Act Commission, or those for adult
social care as the current CSCI. That is why, rather than transferring
them lock, stock and barrel in their current legislative form, as the
amendment recommends, we are creating integrated functions for the new
commission. The amendment, rather than protecting the current
provisions, would lead to fragmentation and confusion within the new
commission. It would unbalance the coherent provisions that we have set
out in the Bill and detract from its purpose. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will agree to withdraw it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000503"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful that the Minister has sought to
take seriously the issues that we have raised. I note, with some
enthusiasm, that he has undertaken to burn a bit of midnight oil to let
the Committee have more information on some specific areas that we have
identified.</div>
					<a name="08011134000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that it was a long introduction, but it did cover a lot of
points. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have found it
important to raise those important issues about transition, where so
many of the questions are arising, as well as some of the more focused
points, which no doubt we will come on to in our
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="08011134000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of what the Minister said, it would be false to suggest that I
feel either completely assured or satisfied. I dare say that those who
observe our proceedings from outside will be concerned that the measure
does not necessarily give us more of a handle on how this is all going
to happen, or provide the safeguards. I am also concerned that we have
not necessarily bottomed out all the costings, which would have helped.
The Minister was reintervened upon before he had the chance to say that
he had tried to put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>in the Library the estimates and the costs. Perhaps some savings have
been secured before the CQC comes into existence. That may be
information that he would like to share with the Committee. He gave us
some assurance on the record, but if there were a possibility of
showing us some of the financial information as regards the figures in
the regulatory impact assessment, that would help us to understand
where the flow of moneys is and what is already being worked on by
those, as he rightly says, admirable and high-quality working bodies
that will be succeeded by the CQC, which will then be challenged to
make further organisational efficiencies without sacrifice to
services.</div>
					<a name="08011134000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is with
those thoughts that I think that it is appropriate to withdraw the
amendment. In addition, I think that a lot of these matters will be
reconsidered during the passage of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

precedents upon which I have sought to draw are from the Equality Act

Dame Denise Platt noted
that:</div>
					<a name="08011134000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it may be
necessary to have some specific structural safeguards to ensure that
the social care aspects of our commission&#146;s work are not

					<a name="08011134000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 158 provides for a separate commission to which putative business
directors of the CQC would report: that is, a management board and a
reference board. That is similar to the current set-up of the
Commission for Social Care Inspection. It would provide for an added
tier of independence between the day-to-day running of the commission
and the oversight of that operation. There is an obvious conflict of
interest if the board is responsible both for overseeing good
regulation of services and the use of resources in interaction with the
political and indeed media spheres in what are often extremely fraught
areas. It may be important to have a small number of commissioners to
ensure a collective and cohesive commission acting as one.</div>
					<a name="08011134000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would

					<a name="08011134000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would put
in the Bill the requirement for appointments to that board to be
properly qualified. The legislation as it stands leaves to regulations
any conditions to be fulfilled for appointments. Not only should that
be in the Bill from the point of view of parliamentary scrutiny, but
the qualifications for the board should, at the very least, be
established by Parliament, rather than by Ministers if the CQC is to
have the genuine independence which is claimed for it and which the
Minister asserts. A third of the clauses in the Bill are dependent, of
course, on secondary legislation&#151;a point that was emphasised in
the point of order at the outset of this afternoon&#146;s
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08011134000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment further introduces a vetting procedure through the House of
Commons Select Committee. That is a procedure suggested under the
governance of Britain Green Paper, which proposed that certain senior
public appointments should have parliamentary Select Committee
scrutiny. Given that the new commission will be responsible for
assessing and inspecting the safety and quality of services that
together account for some 30 per cent., around &#163;105 billion, of
discretionary public expenditure in 2007-08&#151;there is also
significant private expenditure on adult social care and health
care&#151;it could be argued that that process would seem highly
applicable.</div>

No. 159 establishes that the commission must appoint directors for
adult social care, health care and mental health. Lord Kamlesh Patel,
in response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton

people dealing with Mental Health Act issues,
said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would
probably want to see a separate team that influences the rest of the

					<a name="08011134000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think all of us who have
worked in and been responsible for large organisations&#151;I can
certainly put my hand up to that&#151;know that there is a massive
drag on organisations and a motivational negative effect if they work
in silos, rather than have open cross-fertilisation, so that expertise
runs freely across and information, above all else, is seen to be an
opportunity and not a power for
individuals.</div>
					<a name="08011134000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 159, there is a question as to whether the director of
mental health would oversee only the responsibilities formerly taken by
the MHAC, or whether he or she would oversee the regulation of mental
health provision. I hope that the Minister may be able to help on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08011134000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the Secretary of State
said:</div>
					<a name="08011134000144"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Social
care must have parity in the new commission. That must be reflected on
the board of the new commission and in everything that the commission
does. I am pleased that she has given me the opportunity to reassert
that that is the case, and that it needs to be the case. That point
will be emphasised throughout the passage of the

					<a name="08011134000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 160 would provide
for committees to be established that cover adult social care, health
care, mental health and human rights. They would consist of a mix of
members of the commission proposed under amendment No. 158, employees
of the paid service and, if necessary, individuals who are external to
the CQC. The committees would both support and interrogate the work of
the different areas of the commission and go some way to calling it to
account in addressing each area of its
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="08011134000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now
wish to touch on the Joint Committee on Human Rights and a matter that
has been of some concern to other hon. Members. Much has been made of
the broad issue of a human rights focus for the commission. In its
submission, the CSCI says that
it</div>
					<a name="08011134000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;believes, in line
with general Government policy, that the new regulator should take a
strong rights based approach towards the people who use social care and
health services...and their
carers&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011134000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that it has
a desire for that to be reflected properly in
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08011134000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its
recent report &#147;The Human Rights of Older People in
Healthcare&#148;, the Human Rights Committee
recommended</div>
					<a name="08011134000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the
forthcoming merged inspectorate for health, social care and mental
health adopts a human rights framework with the intention that the
framework informs all of the inspectorate&#146;s work and so makes it
more effective in fulfilling its statutory
duties.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It noted
that</div>
					<a name="08011134000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many witnesses,
including the inspectorates, providers and organisations supporting
older people, expressed concern about continuing poor treatment of
older people in
healthcare&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
charted the failings under articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European charter
of human rights on malnutrition and dehydration; inadequate assessment
of a person&#146;s needs; abuse and rough treatment; neglect;
carelessness, poor hygiene and bullying, and patronising and
infantilising attitudes towards older people. Article 8 covers the lack
of privacy in mixed sex wards&#151;another broken commitment by the
current Government&#151;and lack of dignity, especially for personal
care needs; insufficient attention paid to confidentiality;
inappropriate medication and use of physical restraint; too hasty
discharge from hospital; fear among older people of making complaints
and eviction from care homes. Article 14 makes two further points that
concern discriminatory treatment of patients and care home residents on
grounds of age, disability and race and communication difficulties,
particularly for people with dementia or those who cannot speak
English.</div>
					<a name="08011134000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the Human Rights Committee, in its report, praised the MHAC&#146;s
approach to human rights. In a ringing endorsement, it said
that</div>
					<a name="08011134000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in our view,
lessons can be learned from the more systematic approach pioneered by
the Mental Health Act Commission...We are aware of the recent
publication on implementing human rights by the MHAC in partnership
with the Department of Health and what was then the Department for
Constitutional Affairs. MHAC state their purpose was
&#145;incorporate a human rights framework fully in the work of the
MHAC, so that it becomes a recognised part of regular activity across
the organisation&#146;...The MHAC publication contains
accessible and practical information on the steps that it took to
complete the project and it identifies what people working within the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>commission learned from it. We are encouraged by the fact that the MHAC
is to be merged with the Healthcare Commission and CSCI and urge that
the highest common denominator should
prevail.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its submission, the Mental Health Act Commission called
for</div>
					<a name="08011134000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an overarching
principle of equality and human rights, focussing at all times on the
civil, legal and human rights of
patients&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment,
building on the two with which it is grouped, would make matters clear
in the context of human rights. The commission&#146;s figures make it
clear that black African and black Caribbean patients are more than
three times as likely as the average to be admitted to and detained in
hospital. The commission says that the black other group, especially
men&#151;largely second and third-generation black British
patients&#151;are over 10 times, and as high as 18 times in the 2005
results, more likely than the average to be admitted. It says that
there is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that black people are
10 times as likely to have mental illness. MHAC also notes that it has
found a surprising and shocking number of very serious breaches of the
right to respect for human dignity and privacy, which on occasion may
have amounted to serious ill-treatment of women
patients.</div>
					<a name="08011134000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">While on our
first outing on human rights, an issue that will be covered extensively
by others, I want to highlight an area that I hope will give the
Minister the necessary food for thought in respect of the amendments.
The human rights issue is naturally all encompassing, but political and
public interest has recently been most exercised by the human rights
loophole under which private care homes are not bound by the
legislation and can therefore evict residents without breaching article
8. Their public sector counterparts cannot do so.</div>
					<a name="08011134000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are sorry that the
Government are dragging their feet over this. During the 15 June 2007
debate on the private Member&#146;s Bill introduced by the hon.
Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) to clarify the Act, the hon.
and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), the former Under-Secretary
of State for Constitutional Affairs, herself a human rights lawyer,
talked the Bill out rather than bringing it before the detailed
scrutiny and consideration of Committee. It is something that we would
have welcomed. On that occasion it was something that we did not
resist; indeed, we would encourage it. We were therefore disappointed
to see that that was the official view of Government on that
occasion.</div>

have decided that the appropriate time to do that is when we consult on
the new rights and responsibilities Bill, in the context of a new
constitutional settlement, on which the Ministry of Justice will
lead.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 11

					<a name="08011134000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rather hoped that there may be an
opportunity for Government to do some joined-up thinking and even some
joined-up working here, and contemplate that this is an area where, at
the very least, as it was not possible under the private
Member&#146;s Bill procedure, we could have the discussion on the
issue in Committee and under its rules. Even if the Minister were to
say that he is not minded to proceed with amendments that deliver the
human rights angle&#151;I cannot be sure, and I hope that he might
find himself persuaded by arguments produced by others&#151;it would
none the less be extraordinarily helpful for the Committee to place on
record some of the arguments which would otherwise have been
considered, had the hon. and learned Member for Redcar enabled the hon.
Member for Hendon&#146;s private Member&#146;s Bill to proceed to
Committee. I am pleased to note that that view is shared across the
House as the amendments that relate to some of the human rights have
been supported by
others.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000507"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> On first glancing at these amendments, I thought
that it was useful to have greater clarity about the composition of the
board. I would have hoped that that was an automatic consideration. I
was interested when the hon. Member for Eddisbury referred to the
Equality Act 2006 as I think I might be the only person here who had
the pleasure of serving on that particular Bill Committee. During the
progress of that Committee, numerous attempts were made to prescribe
the detail of the board even more. Those were largely resisted because
the underlying assumption behind the Equalities Act was that a
rights-based approach should be at the heart of everything and that it
did not help to continue some of the silos that existed with the
separate equalities bodies.</div>
					<a name="08011134000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously we are now in a
situation that is not quite the same. A large number of legitimate
concerns have been raised about whether social care may be diminished
in some way. I have a lot of sympathy with that argument because social
care has always been a second cousin and it was pointed out in the
evidence on Tuesday that the bulk of the inspection will be in the
social care sector. Something will have gone badly wrong if the social
care sector does not have a fair share of the
action.</div>
					<a name="08011134000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
hope that such considerations are automatic, it is useful to think
about new sub-paragraph (1B), which mentions</div>
					<a name="08011134000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;collective experience and
knowledge relating to all of the Commission&#146;s
functions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
hope that, when a board is appointed, care is taken to ensure that all
functions are represented in some way. To draw a parallel with the
Equality Act, we had interminable discussions about whether there would
be enough women on the board, whether there would be enough people from
ethnic minorities, and whether people with disabilities would be
adequately represented. Most people reluctantly decided to go with the
flow to a certain extent and to trust that it would happen in practice.
So far, there have not been any problems, but I can well understand why
there were
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08011134000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an
earlier new sub-paragraph, there is an attempt to beef-up public
participation and involvement. Because concerns were raised on Second
Reading, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>would welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on that subject. I also
query what new sub-paragraph (1A)(e) means. It seems to be a catch-all
measure. I can understand why it was put in, but I wonder whether there
are any circumstances in which the hon. Member for Eddisbury envisages
that it would be used. On new sub-paragraph (1D), as a member of the
Select Committee on Health, I understand that there have been a number
of recommendations about Select Committees taking on extra powers, but
more time will be needed if that is to happen because it is hard to
keep on top of the relevant legislation.</div>
					<a name="08011134000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall briefly discuss
amendment No. 160. I fully support the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
but am yet to be convinced about the merits of separate adult social
care committees, health care committees and mental health committees.
Again, it is particularly important that there is greater awareness of
mental health throughout the commission because one of the problems in
society as a whole is that the issue of mental health is often
parked-off to another Department. Even in the health service, there is
often a separate mental health trust and that does not help the wider
understanding of mental health issues in society. Rather than having a
separate committee that seems to have responsibility for mental health
issues, I would prefer the Bill to establish a way of underpinning
everything else. Because so many people are affected by mental health
issues and there is so little understanding, it is important to make
that subject almost a core value of the
commission.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000508"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am rewinding slightly to the hon. Lady&#146;s
question about why new sub-paragraph (1A)(e) is in the amendment. It is
indeed intended to be a catch-all, but we should recognise that the
commission intends not to set itself up against the Government or the
Secretary of State, but to ensure that it runs with the grain of what
is trying to be achieved cross-government and independently by those
experts in the sector who are at a supervisory rather than operative
level. That is why the catch-all is there: to ensure that the Secretary
of State&#146;s influence can genuinely be applied in that
area.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000509"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
I would question the need for all the committees, but I recognise the
spirit in which the amendments were tabled, which was to try to deal
with those legitimate concerns.</div>
					<a name="08011134000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman referred to
various groups that were discriminated against and mentioned
Afro-Caribbean men. Under the Equality Act, there is a race equality
duty within the health service, so again that should be a core function
at the heart of the commission anyway. If we have got the processes
right and everything is working, I wonder whether this is absolutely
necessary and whether we need an internal body to scrutinise that, or
whether it is best left to the equality body. As someone who has taken
a great interest in equality issues, I am trying to avoid unnecessary
duplication.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000510"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The best I can do by way of intervention is
simply to say that, in the running and supervision of the processes and
governance of a large 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>organisation, anything that helps at a very economic cost&#151;and,
hopefully, a commission of this nature would not be high-cost&#151;is
where one gives priority and focus.</div>
					<a name="08011134000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The easiest example is that of
a large company manufacturing in many countries all over the world. If
the board that is overseeing all the operations has as agenda item No.
1 every single time health and safety, particularly safety breaches, it
is likely that the whole organisation culturally will come to know that
the board focuses on and values that and it is not just an add-on in
order to tick a box and satisfy the culpability-avoidance of others.
That is what the proposal is intended to achieve. It is to get focus at
an economic
cost.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000511"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point but I
question whether we need a specific person with a specific role to do
that, and whether that should be a core function of that particular
board. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments on the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000512"></a>Kelvin
Hopkins:
						</b> I will speak briefly to make two points. The hon.
Member for Eddisbury raised, at least implicitly, the question of human
rights and my amendment to a later clause, which I will not discuss
now. It clearly is necessary to have a capacity to monitor human rights
within the structures that are set up. One does not want to be
specific. I am not being specific, but clearly that is
needed.</div>
					<a name="08011134000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
raise another issue, which was touched on by the hon. Member for
Romsey: racism within the care services. That has been raised strongly
with me by people who work in the industry. Racism shows itself in a
variety of ways and circumstances, both with staff and those in receipt
of care. It is important to have representation at every level,
particularly of groups of minority ethnic people because these are such
sensitive areas. It does happen where management bodies are all-white,
all-middle-class and all-professional and do not have sufficient
sensitivity to the concerns and to what goes on at the grass roots, at
the basic service level.</div>
					<a name="08011134000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that there are serious
concerns about racism towards staff and towards patients and, of
course, a lack of sensitivity between the different minority groups. I
represent a constituency with tens of thousands of people from a range
of ethnic minority
backgrounds.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000513"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I was a little concerned about the comments about
racism. I am glad to clarify a little because my experience is that
there are instances that are often regarded as racist but are
unintentional. It is a lack of understanding, rather than something
that needs to be dealt with by a heavy hand. It is more about getting
the processes and the understanding right in the first place, rather
than coming in
afterwards.</div>

agree that it is a matter of sensitivity and that people sometimes
misunderstand each other, yet there are definite instances of racism as
well, which I have been informed
about.</div>

							<a name="08011134000515"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is raising a vital point. I am
glad he is taking the opportunity to do that now, as I am absolutely
sure that the whole Committee will know of people in care settings who
are perhaps of a generation or personality that has not really caught
up with how the modern world, quite properly, now treats all its
citizens. They might say that they do not wish to be cared for by
someone not of apparent Caucasian origin. It is absolutely vital that
we recognise that existing laws and management processes are intended
to ensure that that is addressed in a sensitive and properly managed
way. The vital question that the hon. Gentleman raises is whether our
Committee should be considering whether there is any additional
legislative requirement to help reinforce what now needs to happen to
try to address such extremely difficult and sensitive
problems.</div>
					<a name="08011134000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000516"></a>Kelvin
Hopkins:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes valid points; I am not
suggesting anything specific for this stage of the Bill. There are
other aspects; for example, those from religiously conservative origins
from outside Britain may be sensitive about being cared for by people
not of their community or gender. Such matters are of serious concern
in my own constituency, and over time one hopes one becomes more
relaxed about them. The way to deal with that sensitivity is to make
sure that there are representations from minorities at every
level&#151;including the highest level&#151;so that we do not just
gloss over the difficulties and that people are sensitive to them. It
is not about having just one representative from a particular group who
may perhaps be more liberal and relaxed. Lord Patel, for example, is
urbane, sophisticated and westernised, but some people are not quite
like that. One wants a form of representation at every level, although
not necessarily with reserved seats. It is about Ministers being
sensitive to these matters and making sure that there is a balance on
all bodies at every level.</div>

That is absolutely crucial, and always a concern. When there is change,
there is even more concern about budgets getting tight&#151;I know
that has been mentioned already&#151;and one thing that goes is
training, particularly cultural training, which is seen as a soft

					<a name="08011134000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments seek to specify
a great deal more prescriptive detail than we feel happy with in the
Bill. They refer to appointments, board responsibilities and the
advisory committee make-up for the new Care 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>Quality Commission. As I have said already, we are establishing a
commission to be an independent voice on health and adult social care
matters. We believe it should be for the commission itself to establish
the organisational structures and split of responsibilities that it
determines it needs best to carry out those functions and deliver its
aims. That should extend to the executive team it chooses to have, the
committees it feels are appropriate and whether those committees are
chaired by a member of the commission or by someone else. I remind the
Committee that the new commission will be under statutory duties to
fulfil the functions of the existing regulators, and will be answerable
through Ministers to Parliament, so there is that guarantee.</div>
					<a name="08011134000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we are establishing a
single regulator to reflect the greater integration of services taking
place across previous boundaries between health and adult social care.
An integrated regulatory system, where all providers are assessed
against the same standards by the same body, will provide the
consistency and assurance that we believe the public expect. Specifying
that the commission must have executive officers and committees that
lead on different client groups could undermine the commission&#146;s
ability to adopt that integrated approach; it could serve only to
invite calls from other groups that would also like their specific
interests to be represented at a high level in the
organisation.</div>
					<a name="08011134000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point extends to how the commission determines that it should address
its responsibilities under the Human Rights Act 1998. I will say a
little more about that in a second, but as a public body, the
commission&#151;I emphasise this&#151;will be subject to the Act
and will have to carry out its functions in ways that are compatible
with it. There is nothing to prevent the commission from appointing
expert advisers to give specific advice, where it considers that
necessary. We believe that it is better to give the body the freedom
and powers to determine that, rather than trying to impose something
centrally.</div>
					<a name="08011134000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">To clarify
things in a little more detail&#151;I know that we will discuss human
rights later, but this was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for
Luton, North and the hon. Member for Eddisbury&#151;the Bill makes it
clear that decisions on registration can be taken by reference to the
registration requirements and the requirements of any other piece of
legislation that the commission thinks relevant for registration
purposes. That means that if the commission is satisfied that a
registered provider is not meeting its obligations under the Human
Rights Act, it will be able to take appropriate enforcement action. As
the hon. Member for Eddisbury acknowledged, the Government are
committed to ensuring that independent sector care homes are covered by
the Human Rights Act. We hope to address that in the forthcoming
British Bill of rights and responsibilities, which will allow us to
deal with it in the wider context of the public authority definition.
In the meantime, this Bill will ensure that the Care Quality Commission
can enforce regulatory requirements, in line with the relevant
provisions of the Human Rights Act, in its current form and as it may
change in the future. The reason we feel that it is better to wait for
the forthcoming British Bill of rights is that the meaning of public
authority goes much wider than care homes and it is important that we
find a lasting and effective solution. As has already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>been acknowledged, the Ministry of Justice will address the issue in its
consultation on the British Bill of rights and responsibilities, and
draw on a wide range of expertise during that process.</div>
					<a name="08011134000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
it is clear that we see the independence and effectiveness of the chair
and board as crucially important in establishing an effective
commission. We will ensure that the commission is a model of
independence in that respect, as we did when establishing the
Healthcare Commission and the CSCI. Amendment No. 158 specifically
proposes that the appointment of the chair be subject to
pre-appointment scrutiny by the Health Committee. I am pleased that the
Opposition are supporting our proposals for strengthening the role of
the House of Commons in public appointments, which the Government set
out in the Green Paper &#147;The Governance of Britain.&#148; That
includes proposals to involve Select Committees in certain public
appointments; however, it suggests that appointments already subject to
independent scrutiny and regulation are probably not suitable for
additional pre-appointment scrutiny by Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08011134000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appointments to the Care
Quality Commission will be made by the Appointments Commission and
regulated by the independent Commissioner for Public Appointments. I do
not, therefore, believe that it is necessary for the Select Committee
to have an additional scrutiny role. However the Government are
currently preparing a list of appointments that would be suitable for
pre-appointment scrutiny. The list will be agreed with the Liaison
Committee and, where appropriate, with the Commissioner for Public
Appointments, and we should await the outcome of that process. I
therefore ask the hon. Members to withdraw the
amendments.</div>

							<a name="08011134000521"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I just want to be absolutely clear that the
Minister&#146;s final statement about the use of the public
appointments commission is intended to be the definitive position, in
light of the comments of the Secretary of State on Second
Reading.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000523"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I have listened carefully to what the Minister
has just said and to the other hon. Members who spoke, on both sides of
the Committee. It is important to recognise how the concept applied in
the amendments is intended to highlight the need for independence. The
words used by the Minister in response to that may be helpful in our
forthcoming discussions on independence. I hope that we will be able to
reflect on the ability to reinforce that through the way in which it is
intended that the Bill will operate.
</div>
					<a name="08011134000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the concepts in the amendment, however it seems to me that as
we develop our scrutiny of the Bill, if the balance the Minister
identified between the underlying tension between prescription and the
freedom to act independently becomes clear&#151;including the
conceptualisation of the establishment of bodies and recognising also
the danger of insufficient prescription&#151;there will not be
continuing organisational confidence that things would not fall through
the gaps. This ties into the previous discussion. Looking at the
question holistically, if we feel that the whole scrutiny of the Bill
does not satisfy the concerns that underpin a serious set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>of amendments in this group, either we would be able to come back to it
on Report, or possibly we would want it to be considered in another
place.</div>
					<a name="08011134000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
reassurances have been helpful, and give us a clue as to where the
debating points are as we proceed. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

a sceptic, I take this opportunity to say that I felt the evidence
sessions were extremely worth while in allowing the Committee to probe
this very important issue. My only complaint would be
that&#151;unlike this Committee Room where we have space to stretch
out&#151;there was not enough room, so there should be a larger room
for future events. I thank the hon. Gentleman for Wirral, West for his

I have been overruled.</div>
					<a name="08011134000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments relate to an ongoing theme, which has already been
mentioned, and amendment No. 160, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>tabled by the hon. Member for Eddisbury and his colleagues, actually has
precisely the same recommendation as our amendment No. 133. We will
hear more about human rights when we get to clause 5 and new clause 3
and in amendments Nos. 81 and 82, tabled by us and the hon. Gentleman
for Luton, North. The point of the amendments is that a lot of
us&#151;and a lot of organisations&#151;feel that the need to put
human rights at the heart of the new commission is not sufficiently in
the Bill currently.</div>
					<a name="08011134000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint Committee on Human
Rights in its recent report made the following
recommendation:</div>
					<a name="08011134000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recommend that the forthcoming merged inspectorate for health, social
care and mental health adopts a human rights framework with the
intention that the framework informs all of the inspectorate&#146;s
work and so makes it more effective in fulfilling its statutory
duties.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fairly
clear that there needs to be human rights compliance, and of course the
Bill is compliant in strict terms with the Human Rights Act, as it has
to be. Nevertheless, I feel that at this stage&#151;certainly on the
face of the Bill&#151;regard for human rights and human rights
legislation has not been given central importance.</div>
					<a name="08011134000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
amendments that apply to clause 1, amendments Nos. 131 to 133 are
clearly organisational, amendment No. 131 introduces a deputy chair
with responsibility for human rights, amendment No. 132 would appoint a
human rights director and amendments Nos. 133 and 160, a human rights
committee. Amendments Nos. 130 and 79 apply to clause 2 but are
relevant at this stage, hence the grouping. They deal with the
functions of the commission, and would ensure that actions and
decisions taken by the new commission have full regard for human rights
and human rights
legislation.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08011134000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the
comments made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury, I want to say how
strongly we feel that the loophole that currently excludes private care
homes must be closed, and I note the Minister&#146;s remarks on that.
However, that must not be used as an excuse for not putting human
rights legislation and a regard for human rights at the heart of the
Bill. I would be concerned were that the case, and I ask the Minister
to respond to that point.</div>
					<a name="08011134000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments ensure that
human rights are at the heart of the new commission and its functions,
methodology and, most importantly, its work. I believe that that needs
to included in the Bill. I would be delighted if the Minster accepted
some or all of the amendments&#151;it would be a wonderful start to
the Committee. If he will not, I hope that he will reassure the
Committee that that approach and regard for human rights is there, even
if it will not be in the Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000532"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> In his response to the amendments tabled by my
hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury, the Minister made it clear that
he does not want to be&#151;in his terminology&#151;prescriptive
with regard to the Government&#146;s setting out in the Bill the
specific responsibilities of, for example, the deputy chair or
individual commissioners. Further on in the Bill, we will find that he
has departed from that just a little, but that is for other
clauses.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>
					<a name="08011134000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">In public appointments, it is
common to see boards advertise vacancies with particular emphasis on
the disciplines that the board or organisation is looking for. I hope
that as the first group of new regulators is put together, it will be
easy to pick up early on whether there are any glaring omissions, such
as the failure to identify in the job &#147;spec&#148; people who
have knowledge of human rights. In the same way, one would expect to
see the appointment of someone to take responsibility for governance
throughout the organisation. That is par for the course in many cases.
However, in light of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats and
those already dealt with on behalf of my hon. Friends, I wonder whether
the Minister, who will monitor how these jobs are initially defined,
would be minded to intervene were he to discover a glaring omission,
and that the organisation had nobody with human rights expertise or
governance to guide it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000533"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> All I wish to do with these amendments is,
without repeating, to reread my comments from the previous session as
they are pertinent. That gives the Minister a second opportunity for
reflection even in this short period of time.</div>
					<a name="08011134000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton is important. During the
scrutiny of the Bill it is worth making such points, because many
people who operate the CQC and think about how to appoint the
appropriate people will read the proceedings as part of their job
briefing. For anybody who is sufficiently motivated and committed to
apply to be in the CQC, one of the tests will be whether they have had
the initiative to read our proceedings, and they will have picked up on
the sort of operational experience that my hon. Friend has put on the
record. I hope that that meets the Minister&#146;s concern about
prescriptive legislation, while benefiting from the parliamentary
scrutiny process.</div>
					<a name="08011134000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000534"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has kindly answered the hon.
Member for Tiverton and Honiton&#146;s question. In the meantime, I
was hurriedly trying to find out about existing protocols for
ministerial interference in appointments made by the Appointments
Commission, but I did not get the answer quickly enough. All that I can
tell the hon. Lady is that so far in my ministerial experience, I have
not, as far as I am aware, ever intervened or taken a critical interest
in appointments made by the Appointment Commission because I felt that
they did not reflect the sorts of needs and balances that she desires
to see.</div>
					<a name="08011134000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
general view that the Appointments Commission has done an extremely
good job, and the hon. Member for Eddisbury is absolutely right: I
would expect that one of the first things that the Appointments
Commissioner or commissioners responsible for appointing members to the
new regulator would do&#151;and, once the new chief executive or
chair is appointed, one of the first things that they will also
do&#151;is to read the proceedings of this Committee and take into
account the comments that have been made by hon. Members. I imagine
that that is something that they would do
diligently.</div>
					<a name="08011134000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000535"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> One of the things that one observes from time to
time&#151;not in every case, of course&#151;is that a specific
board appointment is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>advertised and certain disciplines and expertise are looked for. It may
well be human rights or, quite commonly, as I mentioned earlier,
governance. That has been precipitated because of a breakdown and
because of problems having emerged through a lack of existing expertise
on the board. We want the Minister to do well with this commission; we
want him to get off to a good start because whether or not he is
detached from it, this will be his baby. He should face up to that, and
I am trying to be helpful to him. It is far better that some guidance
be given as to the balance of expertise at the beginning, rather than
waiting for something to go pear-shaped and then deciding that
expertise is needed on the board.</div>
					<a name="08011134000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000536"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I know that, sadly, the hon. Lady may well no
longer be in this House when the new organisation is up and running, so
perhaps she would like to consider potential future activity herself in
this regard. I suspect that that is not the first or the last job
application that we will encounter&#151;or may already have
encountered in our evidence-taking
sessions.</div>
					<a name="08011134000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000537"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Would the Minister be able to encounter anybody
who is a freer spirit and more independent to get us off to a good
start?</div>
				
					<a name="08011134000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000538"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The point is well made, but rather than being
prescriptive personally&#151;I have already sought advice from my
officials because I would like the answer to this question
myself&#151;if at the same time we are stressing the importance of
the independence of the Appointments Commission, it would be
inappropriate for me as a Minister to intervene or prescribe in that
way. However, we are making it clear in the Bill that we expect the new
Care Quality Commission to fulfil the statutory functions of the
existing regulators. It is inconceivable that the commission will not
take great care in ensuring that it appoints a board whose balance
reflects an ability to fulfil those statutory functions and the human
rights requirements that the amendment refers to, which I would like to
come to now.</div>
					<a name="08011134000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
repeating too much of what I said in response to the previous set of
amendments tabled by Conservative Members, we already make it clear in
clause 2 that the commission must, in everything that it does, pay
particular heed to safeguarding the rights and welfare of vulnerable
people. As a public body, the commission will be subject to the Human
Rights Act and will have to carry out its functions in a way that is
compatible with that Act. It will be able to look at the performance of
providers against registration requirements that follow the spirit of
the European convention on human rights. Providers that fail to protect
the dignity and human rights of individuals in their care will be
liable to the appropriate enforcement action, which could include
prosecution or the cancellation of registration.</div>
					<a name="08011134000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 131 and 133 would establish particular roles within the structure
of the new Care Quality Commission, each with the responsibility for
human rights issues specifically. Our view is that we should not be
over-prescriptive regarding the make-up of the board, and the board
should not be made up of delegates. We fear that other groups would
then claim that their voices have as much right to be
heard&#151;consumers, professionals being regulated, for
example&#151;as those set 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>out in the amendment as &#147;human rights&#148; specialists. In her
questioning of the previous amendments, the hon. Member for Romsey
alluded to the fact that in some cases, having a specialist board
appointment could lead to a silo mentality or ghettoisation of a
particular issue, and serve to prevent that issue from being integrated
properly into every aspect of the board&#146;s&#151;and, indeed,
the organisation&#146;s&#151;work and culture. As I said earlier,
there is nothing to prevent the board from appointing expert advisers
to give it specific advice where it needs additional
expertise.</div>
					<a name="08011134000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, there
is a requirement in the Bill for the commission to establish an
advisory group and other committees that it sees fit. There is tangible
protection for all interests served by the commission in its public
accountabilities. It is required to report annually to Parliament, its
accounts will be independently audited, and it will be dealing with
high-profile and intractable issues that will keep it very much in the
public eye. Therefore, we believe it right that the new organisation
itself establish its structures and the split of board-level
responsibilities. We believe it better to give it the freedom and
powers to do so, rather than imposing something
separately.</div>
					<a name="08011134000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the question from the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton,
I am advised that the Secretary of State delegates all the functions to
which the hon. Lady refers to the Appointments Commission. Technically,
the Secretary of State could take them back and intervene, but we are
not aware of that ever having happened. For the reasons that I have
outlined, I hope that the Members concerned will withdraw their
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011134000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000539"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> This is the second time that I have served on
a Committee with the Minister. Last time, we considered the rights of
goldfish in fairgrounds and dogs having their tails cut up or not; this
time, it is human rights. As ever, I accept some of what the Minister
has said, but I do not think that the intention of the amendments is
prescriptive. Clearly, some suggestions are intended to probe the
general principle, but it is more fundamental than that; we are talking
about the key guiding principle that I and many others believe firmly
should be at the heart of setting up the commission. There are many
people and organisations, including CSCI, that believe that human
rights could be strengthened in the Bill in organisational terms.
Frankly, it is too important to leave until the stage when the
commission is, rightly, looking at the best way to set itself up. I
will accept that the particular organisational suggestions may not be
the right ones, but I still feel that the principle is right.
Therefore, perhaps we can come back to that again, following the Bill
going through the House.</div>
					<a name="08011134000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was hoping for more
supportive noises from the Minister on the actions and decisions taken.
It is fundamental that everything that the commission does has regard
to human rights and to human rights legislation. Let me clarify one
point: my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey was talking not about the
human rights committee but about social care, health and mental health.
She fully supports the idea put forward by both parties on this side of
the Committee regarding a human rights committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>
					<a name="08011134000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, I am slightly disappointed
that the Minister did not address the specific concern that I raised
with him&#151;my hope that the loophole regarding private care homes
being dealt with later does not mean that the human rights focus is
being dropped from the Bill. I believe that that is very important. I
hope that we will come back to this issue, but on the basis that this
is an early amendment and there has been a useful discussion, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000540"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 156, in
clause 2, page 2, line 1, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The
Commission has the general function of encouraging improvement in the
provision of health care by and for NHS bodies and in the provision of
adult social care in
England.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
move to the commission&#146;s functions in clause 2. Even as a
trained lawyer, I would have surpassed myself to come up with this.
Subsection (1)
states:</div>
					<a name="08011134000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission has the functions conferred on it by or under any
enactment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
obviously does not improve our general understanding. If this is a
legislative catch-all, it is unnecessary. Alternatively, perhaps it is
based on a concern that the legislation is so framed that we do not yet
fully understand the purpose, and that the ability is therefore
required to throw at the remit of the commission anything that not just
this but any Government might choose to throw at it. That does not seem
quite the thorough and rigorous approach to legislation that we would
expect of the House, particularly given that the commission is designed
to be the successor body to organisations that, it is admitted, already
function well. They deserve a little more respect than subsection (1)
indicates.</div>
					<a name="08011134000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 156 thus puts a general function in the Bill. It really is
unobjectionable; I would like to think that the Minister will have no
difficulty whatsoever with it. I wish to place on the record that I
will not hold him guilty of an overweening pride of
authorship&#151;as I frequently have with many of his
colleagues&#151;if he will sincerely take points on board in a
meretricious way, rather than regarding them as unacceptable simply
because they happen to be proposed from this side of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08011134000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="08011134000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to see,
through this amendment, Parliament&#146;s will reflected in our
purpose of considering this legislation. It is not merely because the
amendment builds, as I was describing, on the well-established
practices of highly dedicated people who have already committed
themselves to doing good work in those predecessor bodies. After all,
we are not here just for the purpose of enacting further legislation,
but for our service users&#151;our constituents&#151;to ensure that
we are their interface regarding what works best for them. This
amendment will give service users the explicit assurance that they need
that the regulator is acting on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>their behalf and not on the state&#146;s&#151;as if the state were
somehow more important than individuals. I can think of no Bill dealing
with a wider or more vulnerable group in society. Therefore, it is
important to ensure a clear purpose here.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000541"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> When I first saw this amendment, I wondered
whether such things did not happen automatically. Then I recalled Anna
Walker&#146;s saying on Tuesday that she would sometimes take a
provider to task, who then said, &#147;Look, we are just not funded
for that service&#148;. She felt that the providers had few powers to
affect that. Bearing that in mind, the amendment is probably more
useful than I first anticipated.</div>
					<a name="08011134000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000542"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am extremely grateful to the hon. Lady for
highlighting that aspect of this amendment&#146;s merit. She has done
us a service by drawing on the evidence of Anna Walker, whom members on
both sides of the Committee have dealt with and whose evidence deserves
the respect that it has generated.</div>
					<a name="08011134000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
draw in some additional support for this idea. In its written evidence
on the Bill, the Picker Institute&#151;whose strap-line is
&#147;Making patients&#146; views count&#148;&#151;notes that
such an amendment would
also</div>
					<a name="08011134000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clarify
what Parliament wants the Commission to achieve, not just what
functions are assigned to it: Parliament should say what the Commission
is for, not just what it does&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is hardly as if my amendment is one of
great or extensive verbiage; it is concise and to the point, but
equally importantly, it goes beyond the long title. The institute notes
that the amendment would</div>
					<a name="08011134000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;give the Commission a clear
mandate to act on behalf of patients, service users and the public
... enable the Commission to resolve conflicts of interests
between
stakeholders&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011134000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
					<a name="08011134000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;protect
the Commission's user-focused decisions from legal
challenge.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
of us who have had the privilege at some point in our lives of spending
many hours studying the law recognise that nothing frustrates more than
the ease with which legislators could have rephrased basic wording so
that a whole raft of expensive litigation, challenge and
uncertainty&#151;because of the ease with which lawyers can use the
ultra vires or intra vires point in their arguments&#151;could have
been avoided. When looking at legislation, at this point our
discussions cease to be of great value; such Committees are often
regarded as being informative but not decisive when it comes to the
law. The law is what is on the statute.</div>
					<a name="08011134000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to be
over-legalistic in my approach, but that is why this amendment is a
matter of legal as well as political principle. I hope that it is
consistent with reinforcing what the Government seek to achieve. Far be
it from the official Opposition to want to help a Government to deliver
their programme&#151;it suits us politically should they
fail&#151;but it is incumbent on us all to try to make this
legislation better and fit for purpose.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000543"></a>Stephen
Hesford:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman says that the proposal is
extra to a list of functions, but the amendment refers to
&#147;function&#148;. It is therefore another function, rather than
a general philosophy. That is the flaw. Will he highlight one instance
when any of the bodies that the successor body is to take over from has
been judicially reviewed for acting ultra
vires?</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>
					<a name="08011134000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000544"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I cannot give such an example because, as far as
I am aware, no such action has taken place. However, there could be a
reason for that. It is 19 years since I practised professionally as a
lawyer and, although I have been a qualified solicitor for some time, I
accept that we must all be careful to recognise that, in respect of
more well-defined bodies with functions, it is less likely that a
judicial review for being ultra vires will take place because their
specific responsibilities are more
defined.</div>
					<a name="08011134000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
discussing a much larger organisation that must encompass the interests
of many constituent groups. There will be a danger that the definition
is therefore more generic and that it is more likely, when specific
circumstances arise, for lawyers to find an argument in respect of
ultra vires. I am not saying that is right, but the answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention is that I am not aware of such an
example, but when trying to analyse what we are moving to, it is
incumbent on me to understand the risks of incurring something that we
could avoid by simple
drafting.</div>
					<a name="08011134000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
&#147;function&#148;, the main thing is that it is difficult to
come up with a different word to describe the ambit of operation.
Parliament sets the policy framework&#151;the Minister&#146;s
point&#151;but it is then up to those who are establishing the
organisation to know precisely the ambit of its functions. What will
help the hon. Member for Wirral, West is to understand that I am not
making a grand, theoretical point. A regulatory body that is no doubt
of great importance to the hon. Gentleman and his constituents, and of
which we have had a good four years&#146; experience, is Ofcom. It
has a similar principal duty under section 3(1) of the Communications
Act 2003, which states
that</div>
					<a name="08011134000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It shall
be the principal duty of OFCOM, in carrying out their
functions...to further the interests of citizens in relation to
communications matters; and...to further the interests of
consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate by promoting
competition.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
absolutely clear at that point about the organisation&#146;s overall
remit and ambit. We have no difficulty with it because it has made it
much easier for all of us, both as legislators and as representatives
of those who sent us here to speak for their interests, to understand
its ambit and remit. It is clear that the amendment has a good
provenance and a good precedence, which is why I feel with some
conviction that it should commend itself to the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08011134000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider clause 105(3) of the Bill in respect of the Council for
Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. It states that the</div>
					<a name="08011134000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;main objective of the Council in
exercising its functions...is to promote the health, safety and
well-being of patients and other members of the
public.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we can see
from clause 129, the National Health Service Act 2006 imposes a duty on
primary care trusts to</div>
					<a name="08011134000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;secure continuous improvement in
the quality of health
care&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their response
to consultation on &#147;The future regulation of health and adult
social care in England&#148;, the Government stated
that</div>
					<a name="08011134000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Care
Quality Commission(&#145;s)... priority will be to safeguard
service users and help improve their experience of health and adult
social care services.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>
					<a name="08011134000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
expect:</div>
					<a name="08011134000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Patients,
service users and the public as a whole therefore look to...
regulators to ensure the services they use are safe and of good
quality.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could not
have drafted it better myself. There would be no difficulty in adding
that to the underlying concept of the Bill. I hope that my amendment in
its very crisp form can pick out what the Government have already said
that they regard as the primary function and overall ambit of the
commission.</div>
					<a name="08011134000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Picker Institute called for the Bill to have a mandate that the Care
Quality Commission contributes to the continuous improvement of the
quality of health and adult social care services, and the role of the
CQC in improving standards is flagged up explicitly by the Secretary of
State in his foreword to the response to the consultation. Although
commissioning is the principal mechanism that continually drives up the
quality of health and adult social care services there is a role for a
regulator.</div>
					<a name="08011134000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">A general
statement of function&#151;the word was put into issue by the
intervention by the hon. Member for Wirral, West&#151;would give some
indication of what the Government expect to lie within, and without,
the remit of the CQC. Such an understanding would aid the Committee and
both Houses in their deliberation of a Bill that leaves so much to
secondary legislation. It would also, to some degree, restrict the
ambit of those who might seek to put new responsibilities on the
commission at a later date. When all this is done and dusted and we
have some years of experience, people might regard this as being an
area where they could shuttle in something they did not think of
originally.</div>
					<a name="08011134000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
more evidence that I could adduce and perhaps I will have another
chance to put it before the Minister, if he finds himself so far not
persuaded by what I regard as an unobjectionable case. I hope that he
is willing to accede to the amendment, and I also hope it will not
concern him that, in the end, he did not author
it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000545"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I certainly do not find the amendment
objectionable; I just find it rather puzzling, because clause 2(5)
makes it quite clear that we expect the commission to perform its
functions in a way that will encourage the improvement of services. The
amendment is therefore not objectionable in the least, but it is
unnecessarily duplicative.</div>
					<a name="08011134000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
concern is that I think it important that we do not send out a message
from the Committee that the commission alone is tasked with improving
services. We are establishing the commission to perform a specific role
as part of a wider framework for delivering, managing and regulating
health and adult social care services. Service providers themselves
have a fundamental responsibility to improve services. In addition,
PCTs, local authorities and strategic health authorities will have a
role in encouraging improvements, as will Monitor, the Independent
Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts and the Audit Commission. Patient
choice will increasingly serve as a driver for improvement of
services.</div>
					<a name="08011134000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
object in any way to the amendment, but it is unnecessary and
duplicative. I am satisfied that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>Bill provides the commission with the improvement functions it requires.
I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011134000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<b class="B">Mr.
</b>
							<b class="B">O'Brien:</b>
						 I hear the Minister&#146;s request and I
am filled with disappointment. I thought that I was not going to have
to consider even the idea of a magnanimous victory because I would not
claim a victory&#151;it would be a case of common sense having
prevailed. I am somewhat disappointed. Further, I am dumbfounded as to
why we need clause 2(1), which states:</div>
					<a name="08011134000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Commission has the
functions conferred on it by or under any
enactment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without an
amendment giving it some kind of ambit, why do we need it in the first
place? Surely that is what we are doing&#151;that is why we are here.
If we need to make any enactment, I very much hope that we would come
back to the matter if it was of primary interest. The powers for
secondary legislation are already constitutionally within our rights
and within the normal context of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011134000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I feel disappointed, but to
push the amendment to a vote would result in an equally disappointing
outcome. One of the few things I can be accused of is being
occasionally numerate. I have just counted heads and it is a fairly
forlorn cause, so it is prudent to withdraw. I hope the point is well
made and that the Minister and his officials will reflect on the fact
that it does no harm to be specific, not least because the clause looks
pretty odd without any further qualification. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

I hope it could be a demonstration of their earnest, rather than mine,
to decentralise and not be so prescriptive from Whitehall and on high,

accountability in our British
polity.</div>
					<a name="08011134000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the amendments will make the commission pay heed to the patient and
service user voice through local involvement
networks&#151;LINks&#151;and HealthWatch. HealthWatch is an
organisation that we proposed and argued for. I hope that during these
Sittings we shall introduce our own Bill, which encompasses the
establishment of HealthWatch. We are desperately keen that the
Government should continue the practice that they have been all too
keen on recently, which is to copy our excellent
policies.</div>
					<a name="08011134000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have long sought to undermine the strong patient voice. I
take that very personally. The Government used the example of just one
or two underperforming community health councils in 1999&#151;when I
was first elected at a by-election&#151;to put together the NHS
10-year plan. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and
Honiton recalls that during a Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time I
asked the then Prime Minister whether he was aware of the outrage that
he had caused by saying that he wanted to axe community health
councils. People up and down the land were really cross. He said that
it had been decided by consultation, and then realised that it had not
been, so I received a very nice three-page letter. It started with
&#147;Dear Stephen&#148;. It did not, however, end with a
&#147;Love Tony&#148;, but a &#147;Yours ever, Tony&#148;. I
had only been in the House a few months. The whole point is that I had,
somewhat fortuitously, tripped him up.</div>
					<a name="08011134000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was appalling that community
health councils were axed without consultation. They had a stay of
execution for a year, and they lost. Surely that is a lesson that we
have all learned. We lost the expertise that comes from deeply
committed people who care for those with health and social care needs.
They knew that what was really required was the trust that comes
through independence, and being able to help people, to hold their
hands and chart a route when they feel vulnerable and still need to
rely on the services about which they might have a genuine
complaint.</div>
					<a name="08011134000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">That local
involvement is vital. The shadow Health team has been exercised about
the successor bodies to community health councils, none of which has
been able to settle down. We have LINks, and we had the Commission for
Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) before that. It has
been a difficult process. Following the axing of the community health
councils, the patient and public involvement forums, through the CPPIH,
were deemed to be too outspoken so the Government have done away with
them as well. The Government must be honest and say that they are on
the back foot with regard to public perception, and that they would
really like to see patient voice having an influence on the delivery of
health and social
care.</div>

						<a name="08011134000550"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Ashok Kumar</b> (Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland)
(Lab): I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said
about community health councils. He painted a glowing picture of
community health councils and I agree that in certain areas, they were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>very good. However, that was not the case universally. There were some
good councils and some bad and disastrous ones. In my area the councils
were very good. The Government tried to introduce a new mechanism,
hopefully universal, which was to be better than the community
councils. We should not say that everything was great, it was
not&#151;it was good in some areas and patchy in
others.</div>

							<a name="08011134000551"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as we must
be careful not to stray out of order. I recognise that, but we are
talking about how to get genuine public patient involvement in a
process that matters to those vital services. If I recall correctly, of
107 community health councils, four were recognised as performing
extraordinarily badly and another 11 needed improvement. The rest were
regarded as performing extraordinarily satisfactorily&#151;a point
that has been finessed and overlooked by the Government. I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman will want to check the record, but I think those
numbers are right.</div>
					<a name="08011134000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result, once that argument had been lost, what happened with the
successor bodies was that not only did we lose their expertise and
experience but we also lost their independence. The successor bodies
were within the NHS ambit, which meant that complaints and
vulnerabilities were kept within it, too. It was part of there being no
more public complaints about the NHS, which is a more political
approach. Trust comes from knowing that you have an independent body. I
have strayed as far as I dare, to ensure that I answered the
intervention, but I want to stay within the ambit of amendments Nos. 2
and 134.</div>

to pay tribute to the fact that, during the course of the Local

peers in another place, the noble Lords on my party&#146;s Benches,
who secured Government concessions, in particular under section 223
which enabled LINks to come together for the purpose of making reports.
We should not forget&#151;we have already had one example&#151;how
important this more generic collective analysis and information is. The
old community health council Bed watch is one of the best examples, as
it drove improvement and highlighted the complexity of issues that were
prevalent in the health service at the time. That would not have
happened otherwise, as it was perceived as objective rather than part
of the vested interest of the health care providing

it is seen that I am not arguing in an opportunistic way, simply
because the point has arisen. As the Minister knows, because we have
published a document that I would like to believe he has read, as the
Official Opposition and as a party we have committed to establishing a
national consumer voice for patients called HealthWatch, to provide
local support to patients at national level, and leadership to LINks at
local level; to incorporate the functions of the independent complaints
and advocacy service; to make  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>representations to the NHS board on, for example, the closure of NHS
services, and, subject to consultation, have statutory rights over
guidelines issued nationally concerning the care NHS patients should
receive and decisions affecting the provision of NHS care in an
area.</div>
					<a name="08011134000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conveniently
for the Minister&#151;I hope this is not too
tongue-in-cheek&#151;the drafting of the documentation, the concept
and the policy are there to pick up. I would like to have private
authorship, but actually it would suit us and everybody if the
Government were prepared to pick up that policy. The Bill is a vehicle
suitably available to make that happen sooner, rather than waiting for
a change of Government, although of course I hope that will be in
rather short order. Most important, we need to ensure that we deliver
on what has already been the Government&#146;s own response to the
consultation, which was overwhelming in wanting to see the proposals
delivered in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011134000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why have the Government not
sought a statutory relationship between the CQC and LINks? What
assessment has the Minister made of the CSCI&#146;s contention that
there should be such a relationship? Does he see a place for a strong
national patient and service user voice in the provision of health care
in this country, and in the CQC? What assessment has he made of David
Currie&#146;s conclusion of the need
for</div>

the Department noted in the response to consultation the desire for
patient and user involvement, and itself committed to the CQC being a
user-focused organisation, has it not made any mention of such
users?</div>

those arguments, which I would like to think are reasonably cogent,
that I press the amendments. We have an absolutely vital
opportunity&#151;something which the Minister could, with some of
that critique, be keen to take up&#151;to ensure that the Bill is
grounded in the interests of patients and service users, which I am

Gidley:
						</b> I shall speak briefly because many of the points
that I wanted to make have been comprehensively covered. I want to
express support and put on record my concern, which is obviously shared
by the hon. Member for Eddisbury and other colleagues, that an
overwhelming theme from some of the submissions we received is the lack
of a duty to consult the public, and concerns about how the public and
patients will link with the proposals.</div>
					<a name="08011134000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a welcome amendment, to
try to deal one of the concerns raised by Members on both sides of the
House on Second Reading. Given the direction of Government thinking and
the increasing amount of patient and public pressure, one almost hopes
that it would be superfluous, but it sends a useful signal to put
something like that in the Bill itself. It would reassure, at the
outset, all the bodies that have raised concerns. They can then
concentrate, perhaps, on other aspects of the Bill or health
care.</div>
					<a name="08011134000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is useful to
have a specific link with LINks. My one reservation would be that we
have yet to see how that will pan out in practice and what the local
variations will be.</div>

Committee raised a number of concerns on that very matter. I note that
one of the final questions to the Minister was, &#147;Why have the
Government not sought a statutory link?&#148; I think that the hon.
Member for Eddisbury has answered his own question, because, as he
alluded to, there are the community health councils, the patient forums
and also LINks.</div>
					<a name="08011134000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
to ask how long it will be after the legislation is enacted before
having to amend it, for the very reason that LINks may not have worked
and we will be faced with looking at yet another replacement. I hope
that that is not the case. I do not want to be accused of being overly
cynical but, given the doubt about the future of LINks and how it will
work in practice, that it is a legitimate
concern.</div>

							<a name="08011134000553"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way,
and I am again grateful for her endorsement of and support for this
idea. Not least because of her personal involvement in the health-care
related field of pharmacy, does she not agree that the independence of
those who are probably the best route-finders and hand-holders for
vulnerable groups is the best guarantee of their trust&#151;the fact
that someone is available to work in their interest? We are still
somewhat sceptical&#151;rather cynical, I dare say&#151;about the
effects of the Government&#146;s proposal because of that absence of
independence for community health councils. Even though, admittedly, 14
of them were not up to snuff, the fact that they were independent gave
them that
trust.</div>

							<a name="08011134000554"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I agree that independence is essential, but
the public perception point of view can be even more important. Some
organisations that are not ostensibly independent have done a
reasonable job, but public perception should not be ignored easily and
independence gives greater public confidence. I support the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
comments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000555"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I make it clear from the outset to members of
the Committee that I entirely agree that involving and listening to
users, patients and the public will be a central responsibility for the
new commission. Clause 2 ensures that the commission, in everything
that it does, must have regard to the public&#146;s views on the
services that fall within its remit, and to their levels of
satisfaction with
services.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000557"></a>Mr.

						</b> In a moment. The hon. Lady may be interested in
what I am about to
say.</div>
					<a name="08011134000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
schedule 1(6) makes clear that the commission has a duty to establish
at least one advisory panel. We would expect that mechanism to cover
patients&#146; and users&#146; views. The commission may choose to
establish further panels, but it will be able to decide. Given the
views expressed by Committee members today, and by Committee members
and witnesses during Tuesday&#146;s evidence session,
regarding  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>these and subsequent amendments that we will be debating on the duty to
consult, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, I am still reflecting on that
issue.</div>
					<a name="08011134000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I do
not think that the amendment requiring a statutory relationship with
LINks is the right way to go about the matter. I made it clear on
Second Reading that I believe it important that the current
commissioners and the future commissioner work very closely now and in
future with LINks on their inspections and how they go about their
work. However, I am not sure that singling out LINks, as opposed to
other organisations, for special treatment in the form of a statutory
relationship is necessarily the right way of going about it. I hope
that, in the light of that statement and of the assurance that I have
given that we are still reflecting on this
issue&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

							<a name="08011134000558"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s assurance that he
is still reflecting, but I think that the main concern is that although
the commission must have regard to the views expressed, the wording in
the schedule is &#147;may consult&#148;. There seems to be no
compunction to consult, if we end up with a commission that feels that
that is something it cannot afford. Given the financial constraints,
there are also concerns that this might be something that the
commission wants to do but cannot afford to
do.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000559"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The hon. Lady puts her finger on exactly the
problem that we face. The advice that I received from lawyers suggests
that it is quite difficult to frame a broad duty to consult&#151;we
will come to this later in detail, but we are dealing with it
now&#151;both legally and in terms of burdens that that duty might
place on the commission that it does not feel are justified in a
particular instance. However, it is an issue that we are looking at
carefully and I will undertake to come back to the Committee at a later
stage with clearer thinking on it. I simply do not think that this
amendment is the best way of going about
it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000560"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am encouraged by the Minister&#146;s saying
that he is still reflecting, and I think it right that he do so. I am
equally encouraged that he recognises the importance of this matter,
and I thank him for saying that he will come back to the Committee with
further thinking, once he has had an opportunity for his thought to
gestate somewhat.</div>
					<a name="08011134000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the course of his reflection, I hope that the Minister might also give
thought to what he has just said&#151;I dare say that we are about to
hear it again when we come to the broad duty issues&#151;about the
advice that he has taken, which may well be based on the approach that
the parliamentary draftsmen have taken, or on the external legal advice
that may be available to him about the difficulty of framing these
duties. Perhaps he could also look at the issue the other
way&#151;not so legalistically&#151;and consider, however it might
be done, how to require this organisation not just to consult and
listen to the views of the public and service users in a discretionary
way, as a matter of good practice and management, but to be actually
auditable by them.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>
					<a name="08011134000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
better example on this occasion is to draw from what the Government
themselves have been doing about the expectations that they believe are
incumbent on private sector operators in the commercial sector
regarding their public duties and community roles. For instance, in
corporate social responsibility, one would expect to see a useful
programme of such responsibility properly reported and commented
on&#151;audited, even&#151;in an annual report.</div>
					<a name="08011134000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am the last person
to want to be over-prescriptive by giving anybody more regulation to
contend with, because these are unrecoverable, burdensome,
non-operational costs, it is none the less important to raise the
expectations and priorities of those who will be charged with
delivering this service. So I hope that, rather than just looking at
this matter as a legislative, framing or drafting issue&#151;the
difficulties of which I have some sympathy with, such that, as the
Minister has probably perceived, I am likely to withdraw the
amendment&#151;the report that we will receive from him once he has
had time to reflect will consider how to ensure that the expectation
posited of an audit and report takes place, and will consider the
consequences in terms of the decision making and operation of these
bodies. I hope that that is seen as a constructive proposal.</div>

&#147;vulnerable&#148; is used in the clause, it encompasses a
larger span that might in other people&#146;s terms become part of
the all-adult group. Furthermore, carers are a group of people about
whom we are all very exercised and for whom we want to achieve better
support, and who are so vital to the interests of those for whom they
care. While being seen as partners in care, Carers UK wants them to be
given the recognition and support&#151;practical, financial and
emotional&#151;that they need. The strength of the amendment turns on
the meaning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>of &#147;vulnerable&#148; and, while vulnerable groups can be

						</b> I do not believe so. If I had, I would not have
tabled the amendment. The best way in which to describe it is to track
back all the way to our maths lessons and the Venn diagrams. Let us
imagine that the first circle is all adults and there are then
vulnerable adults, and that the amount of the shared bit in the middle
can change according to how some people define vulnerability. It is
important for us to recognise that temporary illness is an obvious
place where people can move from being a vulnerable adult to a
invulnerable adult. We must be careful to make sure that we encompass a
duty in respect of all adults, but that we rightly focus on those who
are particularly vulnerable, without excluding those who are
not.</div>

achieve by the amendment is that the duty is for all adults. Some of
them might be regarded as not currently vulnerable, but their needs
should become part of what the duty of care and the services cover. I
hasten to say that he was being supportive because, if the provision
leads with vulnerable adults, lawyers have to say, &#147;Are you in
the class that was intended by Parliament to be covered under the
Bill?&#148; I am sure that the Minister will agree that the last

move around, which is why I am suggesting that the duty applies to all

We know that, when pressures are placed on either capacity or finances,
it is eligibility criteria that are looked at first. I am sure that all
of us know of many examples in our constituencies where local
government has sought to tighten the eligibility criteria for social
care services. The matter under discussion is such an
area.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend will not be surprised to know
that I am delighted, in our first day in this Committee Room, when
picking up on his argument, to be able to mention the group of people
diagnosed with Asperger&#146;s syndrome. They are a classic example
of the point that he is making. Most social services departments regard
those with learning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>disabilities as people with IQs of under 70. With Asperger&#146;s
syndrome, people can have exceptionally high IQs, but face
vulnerability in some pretty basic core issues, such as looking after
themselves and being safe in certain situations. There is a dichotomy
of sometimes high intelligence and vulnerability in the same person. It
is often the case that social services will deny appropriate services
and care to that group of people purely because they do not meet the
artificial IQ of learning disability tests. In fact, the
Minister&#146;s Department has actually put out a circular advising
social services departments to examine such issues and to at least give
an assessment to people with a diagnosis of Asperger&#146;s. This was
picked up in

							<a name="08011134000569"></a>Mr.
O&#146;Brien:
						</b> Indeed you have been generous,
Mr. Hood, but the whole Committee was listening to the point
with respect as well as care, because no one in the House has been more
assiduous than my hon. Friend in attending to the arguments on behalf
of, and the needs of, those who have conditions on the autistic
spectrum, particularly Asperger&#146;s. We pay tribute to her on that
score. If she had not quite finished her point, she might need to catch
your eye, Mr. Hood, if she gets the chance, at a later
point.</div>
					<a name="08011134000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">What my hon.
Friend says is absolutely right and I hope that it reinforces the point
that the dialogue between the hon. Member for Luton, North and me was
seeking to wrestle out. One can be over-exercised by the legal terms,
but this provision is likely to be used by those who are not lawyers,
who will be thinking, &#147;What does this mean? What did Parliament
intend by putting an adjective in front of the word
&#145;adults&#146;? It must have meant something. It can&#146;t
be nothing.&#148; Therefore, we have to react in some
way.</div>
					<a name="08011134000447"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011134000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister
says that he will accept the amendment, I will quietly give three
cheers. If, however, he seeks to resist it&#151;I always worry that
he has a white piece of paper that has only the words &#147;Resist
this&#148; on it&#151;I hope that this discussion will lead to some
reflection. I hope that people will use the experience that is
obviously within his Department, given the circular that my hon. Friend
mentioned, and borrow from that experience to give this a better
legislative intent and to ensure that we do not give a hook to those
who might be looking to restrain the eligibility criteria as to where
the services should bite. All that said, I hope that the Minister has
been
persuaded.</div>
					<a name="08011134000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011134000570"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Resist and reject, as I was advised earlier by
my officials, are synonymous, although the spirit of our discussion
about the previous amendments, and future ones on patient involvement,
shows that I am always willing to listen and reflect where I think that
that is justified. I shall explain my problem with this
amendment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>
					<a name="08011134000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 is intended to make
particular provision for those vulnerable groups that are less likely
to be able to act as advocates for themselves. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would extend particular provision to
everyone, in which case it would no longer be particular. If we extend
particular provision to all adults and children, that is everyone, by
my reckoning, it can no longer be defined as particular, which negates
the whole point of
it.</div>
					<a name="08011134000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Age
Concern&#146;s mental health advocacy project and the CSCI were very
keen on ensuring that the vulnerable adults and children whom they deal
with at the moment were given this particular recognition and provision
in the legislation in relation to the new commission. The difference is
that they have particular needs. It would not be appropriate to extend
the provision to all patients and service users, many of whom are more
than capable of self-advocating and who would have no difficulty in
exercising the increased levels of choice and participation that we are
introducing to the health and adult social care system. That is the
reason for our position. What I have described is probably not the
intention of the amendment, but it is certainly our interpretation of
what it would
mean.</div>

							<a name="08011134000571"></a>Mr.
O&#146;Brien:
						</b> Naturally, I am disappointed that we have
now found two words&#151;resist or reject&#151;but there we are.
The dialogue that we have had on this issue has probably served its
purpose. I am confident that the Minister and his officials will use
the process of our proceedings to ensure that they reflect carefully on
the arguments that have been adduced, and perhaps the issue will be
considered again. I take the point about the later clause that is
intended to focus on the advocacy point, if I can put it that way. I am
trying to be inclusive rather than exclusive and I think that that is
precisely what the hon. Member for Luton, North was also trying to
flush out, but at the same time we cannot have a Venn diagram where, in
effect, there are no sides. I accept that this is a somewhat difficult
point, but I hope that the Minister takes the point as being well
meant. Given that we may see something at a later date, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 92, in
clause 2, page 2, line 20, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(g) the need to
promote co-operation between the Commission, the Health and Safety
Executive, the Food Standards Agency, police forces and other bodies
authorised to enter and inspect registered premises, including local
authorities.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are making rapid progress towards the end of clause 2(3). Paragraph (g)
would add another matter to which the commission must have regard in
performing its functions. It is patently intended to promote
co-operation between relevant public bodies, on which I think we all
aspire to see much better
performance.</div>
					<a name="08011134000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
count on local agencies to work together, and they often do not care
where something comes from; they just want to see it work. That
requires the fantastically difficult business of joint and co-operative
working, across Government and Whitehall as well as at ground level,
between the various public bodies and agencies. That is often about
sharing information for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>the better protection of vulnerable people. Although we can often
imagine how that might work, it gets difficult when agencies are
dealing with vulnerable people, as there is highly sensitive and
personal information involved. Need I say more than that we have had a
couple of months when the sharing of information by Government has
often been with people whom we might not have
wished?</div>
					<a name="08011134000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
argued, the commission cannot and must not allow itself to operate in a
regulatory silo. I am sure that the Minister has picked up from both
its representations and oral discussions that the Local Government
Association believes that the Bill should be amended to ensure that at
national level, the new regulator takes into account the roles and
responsibilities of other bodies when issuing guidance and developing
policy, and at local level shares information with other enforcement
agencies such as the police and local authorities. The rationale is to
work against another Climbi(c)-type event. We all feel seized to
do everything that we possibly can to limit the risk of that ever
happening again. I know that I speak for everybody across the House on
that. There is also a role for the CQC in supporting and working
alongside councils on their ambitions for local communities.</div>
					<a name="08011134000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LGA has also been concerned
that the CSCI has not joined other statutory agencies in developing
national protocols for the investigation of deaths, nor has it
consistently taken part in local enforcement co-ordination meetings.
Paul Snell, who spoke for the CSCI, asked in his oral evidence whether
the Bill sufficiently encouraged the co-operation of local authorities
in support of the new commission&#146;s work. I do not want to get
into an argument of merit about who has been co-operating, but there
has clearly been a problem. As we have been advised of it, we are on
notice, and as a legislative body we have an obligation to make it
better and fix it while we are addressing the matter and have an
opportunity through the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011134000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">What assessment
has the Minister made of the cross-agency work of the three current
regulatory bodies, and what guarantee can he give the Committee that
the CQC will not operate in a regulatory
silo?</div>

							<a name="08011134000573"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I certainly agree with the sentiments behind the
amendment, but I draw Committee members&#146; attention to clause 63
and schedule 4, which we believe deal adequately with co-ordination and
interaction between the new regulator and other bodies and
institutions. Clause 63 requires the commission
to</div>
					<a name="08011134000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promote the effective
co-ordination of reviews and assessments carried out by public bodies
or other persons in relation to the carrying on of regulated
activities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011134000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">As that
covers all public bodies, it includes all those mentioned in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011134000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 4
deals with the Care Quality Commission&#146;s interaction with other
authorities. In particular, it requires the commission to produce an
inspection programme and framework from time to time, on which it must
consult a number of other inspection authorities as set out in
paragraph 1(2) of the schedule. They are the main public sector
inspection authorities, but there is nothing to prevent the commission
from consulting other bodies that enter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>and inspect premises if it believes that that would be beneficial. I
entirely agree with the sentiments behind the amendment, but the matter
is adequately dealt with in other parts of the
Bill.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) In
determining the views expressed by members of the public the Commission

specify.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me start by apologising for the two typographic errors, which I noticed
only yesterday. The most important one is that the last line should
read &#147;may by regulation specify&#148;. I put it down to being
human.</div>
					<a name="08011134000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
preliminary discussions about the need for greater clarity regarding
the commission&#146;s duties to consult with the public and various
groups. The Minister has said, rather reassuringly, that he is still
thinking about these matters. That is heartening. The purpose of the
amendment is to clarify clause 2(3)(a), which states that the
Commission must have regard
to</div>
					<a name="08011134000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;views expressed by
members of the
public&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011134000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful to tease out the Government&#146;s thinking on
that.</div>
					<a name="08011134000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the purpose
of the clause merely for the Care Quality Commission generally to have
regard to public reaction, or is it intended to be something a little
more meaningful? Obviously, the views of the wider public are
important. The amendment attempts to provide a mechanism that will
place on the commission a direct duty to pay regard to the people who
use the services that the commission will regulate. The specified
groups could include&#151;I am not being prescriptive at this
stage&#151;patients, service users and informal carers. It is easy to
forget carers, and they often feel that they are not given due regard.
I think that we, as Members of Parliament, are aware of what they do
and are very grateful for it, but there are not always mechanisms in
place to find ways of automatically engaging with them. The nature of
what they do means that they are very busy doing other
things.</div>
					<a name="08011134000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
could also include professional groups. Such groups are not usually
backwards in coming forwards, but there are cases in which they should
be consulted. It could be said that the Government&#146;s wording is
a catch-all, but it would be useful to have more clarity in the Bill
about the range of people who should be consulted on a given matter.
That would help to ensure that no one is forgotten and that any future
commission would automatically ensure that it has the widest range of
views at its disposal.</div>
					<a name="08011134000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a certain amount of
inconsistency in the Bill, in that the Council for Healthcare
Regulatory Excellence and the Office of the Health Professions
Adjudicator will have a duty to consult. In the interests of
consistency, is there any reason why that laudable principle should not
also apply to the Care Quality Commission?</div>

Romsey. We risk returning to the tension, touched on throughout this
afternoon&#146;s proceedings, between prescribing a list of whom the
new Care Quality Commission would have a duty to consult, and providing
that they should have a broadly drawn duty, which might present them
with unlimited demands from all sorts of people and organisations
wishing to be consulted. I can assure the Committee that I am still
reflecting on that. In the light of that, I hope that the hon. Lady
