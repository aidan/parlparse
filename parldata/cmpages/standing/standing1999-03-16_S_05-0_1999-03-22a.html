<H4><center>Memorandum from the Immigration Appeal Tribunal</center></H4>
<H4><center>1. Introduction </center></H4>
<P>
1.1 The members, both legal and lay, of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal have reservations about the changes to the Tribunal proposed in this Bill. These concerns centre on the proposal that the Tribunal should in future consist only of legally-qualified members, who would normally, if not invariably, sit alone and probably in private, dealing with appeals `on the papers' without hearing representatives or appellants in person.
<P>
2. Human Rights 
<P>
2.1 We do not believe that such a Tribunal will command the necessary public confidence, however well qualified its members may be. Some of the appeals that come to the Tribunal certainly raise complex legal issues. However, issues of the credibility of appellants, or assessment of the risk they may face if returned to their countries of origin, or of socio-economic-political issues in third world or former Soviet states are often more significant. If it is alleged that an Adjudicator has made a mistake, these cannot readily be assessed other than by oral hearing.
<P>
2.2 Further, this Tribunal deals in matters of personal liberty and human rights. It is not appropriate for such issues to be decided in private or in the absence of the appellants: and arguably not in accordance with Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Other Tribunals considering serious issues, such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal or VAT and Duties Tribunal, sit in public (and both sit with lay members where grave personal matters such as loss of a job or a business or bankruptcy may be involved.).
<H4><center>3. Current Position</center></H4>
<P>
3.1 The role of lay members has always been important in immigration appeals. The present Tribunal is visibly different from the Adjudicator of first instance sitting alone. It is different because it has three members, two of whom are normally lay people bringing a broader perspective to the decision. When difficult legal issues are at stake, it is already customary for three lawyers to sit and such legal tribunals are of great importance in setting precedents on difficult questions&#151;but numerically they involve only a small minority of hearings.
<P>
3.2 It is unfair for the judiciary to be characterised in the press as `white, middle-aged and middle-class', for there have been big changes in both its composition and outlook. None the less, the Tribunal's lay members remain more representative of the wider community than are the judiciary generally and the Tribunal commands confidence accordingly, adding to its credibility. For example, more of our lay members are women than would be the case with the judiciary as a whole (and many cases concern women and children). About a third of lay members are from the minority ethnic communities, others are senior magistrates in areas with substantial ethnic minority populations. Others have long experience&#151;for example as crown servants overseas or with United Nations agencies&#151;of living and working in countries from which many appellants come. This experience adds credibility to the Tribunal, attracts the support of the community and fulfils stated Ministerial objectives.
<H4><center>4. Effect of proposed changes</center></H4>
<P>
4.1 The proposed changes do not seem calculated to make the Tribunal the `last stop' in an individual's immigration history. This is perhaps their most serious defect. By lessening the visibility and credibility of the Tribunal, and by making it unusual for it to make its own assessment of appellants, they seem more likely to increase both remittals to Adjudicators for rehearing and applications for Judicial Review of decisions&#151;in short, to prolong rather than shorten the process and thus to fall short of two of the main targets government said it was aiming at in its review.
<P>
4.2 Three criticisms were made of the Tribunal during that review: that there were too many remittals (but that changed some time ago), that there had been inconsistent decisions (hopefully no longer so, with legal members working in a more collegiate way) and that too many appellants sought Judicial Review when leave to appeal to the Tribunal was refused (see above). None of these criticisms had anything to do with the Tribunal's composition; they were matters of practice that, in the first two cases, were already well on the way to being rectified.
<H4><center>5. Conclusions</center></H4>
<P>
5.1 It is suggested for consideration, that a more satisfactory solution would be to adapt the pattern of the Employment Appeal Tribunal. This should reduce successful applications for Judicial Review and reduce the serious pressure that has built up on the High Court. Lay members should be retained, but there could be more flexibility in the pattern of hearings. In some cases it might be appropriate for the President to ask a legally qualified member to sit alone. In others, three lawyers might sit; in others, a judicial chairman with two (or sometimes one) lay member. If both parties agreed, a case could be decided&#151;as it can now&#151;on the papers, but it would be unrealistic to expect this to become common. In short, the Tribunal could be more tailored to the case in hand, while retaining its basic credibility of public hearings and a mixture of legal and lay members.
<H4><center>Memorandum From the Immigration Appellate Authority</center></H4>
<H4><center>Under clause 7 and 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Securities</center></H4>
<P>
1. The immigration rules are to make provision for the taking of a security and adjudicators will no doubt be invited by applicants and their advisers to rule on the requirement of securities&#151;it is not apparent whether it is intended that any issues relating to securities are to be justiciable before the appellate authority and we would welcome any clarification of this matter.
<H4><center>Part III</center></H4>
<H4><center>Bail</center></H4>
<H4><center>Under clause 29</center></H4>
<P>
It is noted that automatic bail references could be made as late as one day prior to the date when the matter had to be determined. At present bail applications are listed some three to five days after the lodging of the bail forms.
<H4><center>Under clause 30(2)(c) and (d)</center></H4>
<P>
In order to emphasise the independence of the appellate authority, we do not feel it is appropriate to hold bail hearings in detention centres and prisons.
<H4><center>Under clause 31(2)</center></H4>
<P>
Once an appeal has been lodged, we consider that the appellant should appear before the appellate authority, but the clause makes an appearance before the immigration officer mandatory.
<H4><center>Part IV</center></H4>
<H4><center>Under clauses 39, read with sechedule 3</center></H4>
<P>
We feel that a provision should be included requiring adjudicators to be legally qualified, with a saving for existing appointments. Ninety-nine per cent. of adjudicators are, in fact, already legally qualified. We no longer feel that it is necessary to designate adjudicators to be special adjudicators for the purpose of determining asylum appeals.
<P>
Provision should be made for a Deputy Chief Adjudicator and for Regional Adjudicators.
<P>
The term ``adjudicator'' is likely to cause confusion given that asylum support adjudicators are to be appointed by the Home Office under clause 83. We would welcome urgent consideration to giving a title to adjudicators which would emphasise their independence from the Home Office and the judicial nature of the post.
<H4><center>Under Schedule 4, paragraph 4 (d)</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to set aside</center></H4>
<P>
The power to set aside is reserved to the Tribunal. We consider that in certain circumscribed circumstances the power to set aside should be conferred on adjudicators and that this would save unnecessary judicial review applications. For example, in certified appeals, where, if the certificate is upheld, no appeal lies to the Tribunal, a power to set aside would offer a speedy resolution of procedural problems such as result from defective service. Rules would no doubt confine the exercise of the power to the Chief Adjudicator and to those authorised by him. The amendment could be achieved by simply substituting the words ``appellate authority'' for the word ``Tribunal'' in lines 21 and 22.
<H4><center>Under paragraph 10</center></H4>
<P>
Under the corresponding provisions of the Immigration Act 1971 the Secretary of State was under an express duty to comply with directions given by adjudicators when an appeal was allowed and we feel that words similar to those used in section 19(3) of the 1971 Act should appear here.
<H4><center>Under clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Human Rights</center></H4>
<P>
We have the following observations:
<P>
1. We note that the clause refers to past breaches of human rights: the majority of appellants will be concerned about the future, the effects of removal.
<P>
2. The Human Rights Act contemplated any ambiguity about jurisdiction to be dealt with by subordinate legislation: see section 7 (11) of the Human Rights Act 1998. It is unclear whether clause 47 is designed to bring into play section 7 (1) (a) of the Human Rights Act as opposed to section 7 (1) (b).
<P>
3. If this clause is to be brought into effect on commencement, it will have important training implictions. At present, we are assuming that human rights training will take place shortly before the relevant provisions of the Human Rights Act come into effect.
<H4><center>Under clauses 55 to 58</center></H4>
<H4><center>One-stop appeals</center></H4>
<P>
At present adjudicators for the most part determine appeals following applications that have been considered by the Home Office. Typically, there will be an explanatory statement or refusal letter setting out the facts and the reasons for the decision.
<P>
As we understand the procedure envisaged, there will be cases where the issues have not been examined by the Home Office prior to the hearing. The interview will not necessarily have covered the claims being advanced subsequently which might include cases based on human rights, asylum or a prescribed concession.
<P>
If we are correct in our assumption that the issues will not always have been crystallised in advance in an explanatory statement or similar document, we feel that hearings may take longer than at present. This is because neither the parties nor the court will have as clear an idea of the points in contention as hiterto.
<P>
His Honour Judge Dunn QC, Chief Immigration Adjudicator; Mr. Ian Magee, Court Service; Mr. George Warr, Immigration Appellate Authority; Mr. Mark Ockelton, Immigration Appeal Tribunal; Mr. Naresh Kumar, Immigration Appeal Tribunal, called in and examined.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Judge Dunn and gentlemen, may I welcome you to the Committee. Thank you for attending. As you know, we do not intend to have opening statements. We have already received written evidence from you. I should like each of you to introduce yourselves and explain briefly who you are and why you are here.
<P>
<B>His Honour Judge Hubert Dunn:</B> I am the Chief Immigration Adjudicator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Magee </B>(Court Service): I am Chief Executive of the Court Service, which is responsible for courts and tribunals. Tribunals is a jurisdiction of great importance to us.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Warr </B>(Immigration Appellate Authority): I am full-time adjudicator and part-time tribunal chairman, Immigration Appellate Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Ockelton </B>(Immigration Appeal Tribunal): I am adjudicator and part-time tribunal chairman, Immigration Appeal Tribunal. I am here specifically to answer questions on the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Naresh Kumar </B>(Immigration Appeal Tribunal): I am a lay member of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): You say, Judge Dunn, that the term ``adjudicator'' is likely to cause some confusion, given that the asylum support adjudicators are likely to be appointed under clause 83 of the Bill. What alternative name do you suggest?
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> There is support for the name of immigration judge. We are not particularly enthusiastic to retain the title of special adjudicator. Special adjudicator details an entitlement to hear asylum appeals and, until qualified and designated as special adjudicator, an adjudicator cannot hear asylum appeals. That can take time. The central thrust of the work is asylum appeals and we would prefer that, once an adjudicator&#151;however called&#151;is appointed, he should be able to hear all classes of appeals. It would also help us in training, because it would be possible to train adjudicators both in general immigration and in asylum work, as opposed to training sessions.
<P>
Basically, the reason why we want one name is that we want all hands on deck, and everybody to be able to try all cases as soon as appointed and trained; not held back for perhaps three, six or nine months to be designated ``special adjudicator''.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Faber </B>(Westbury): Mr. Kumar, I should like to ask you a question. I understand that under schedule 2 of the Bill, you will cease to be a member of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Could you tell us a little about your own background, your professional background, why you became a lay member of the IAT, and what you feel you bring to the tribunal as a lay member?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kumar:</B> As far as my personal background is concerned, I am, by training, a former teacher and headmaster. I came from Uganda. For 17 or 18 years, I worked as a community relations officer in Westminster. I have been a member of the Bench for the last 15 years. I was appointed to the tribunal as a lay member about 10 years ago.
<P>
The value, I think, that lay members bring to the tribunal is a general credibility, or a public credibility, which is essential on a tribunal with such a high profile&#151;very sensitive, very emotional&#151;where the lives of people are to be decided not only from the point of human rights and the exercise of broad humanity, but in the assessment of fact. This is a very special exercise to which, I think, the lay members bring a kind of expertise which is not necessarily legal.
<P>
Having been on the Bench for many years myself, I&#151;and many of my colleagues who have been on the Bench&#151;bring in the kind of knowledge that is very helpful in the decision-making process of the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Than you. Could I ask the other witnesses&#151;in particular, Mr. Ockelton, but the others as well&#151;what they feel about this feature of the Bill, under which lay members, gentleman and ladies, will no longer be part of the tribunal process?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> The tribunal has put in a submission to the Committee, which you will have read. So far as the legal members of the tribunal are concerned, I think it is right to say that we all recognise that there are cases which are better decided by a body consisting of lawyers, but there may well be other cases where a lay input remains of great value. For that reason, we wonder whether the proposals for the tribunal are doing too much at once.
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> I do not sit on tribunals, but Mr. George Warr sits as a chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Warr:</B> Last week, you heard from two very experienced representatives&#151;Mr. Nicol and Mr. McKee. Mr. Nicol said something that I might have said when I was at the Bar and used to appear in front of the tribunal from time to time: your interchange was more with the chairman, but behind the scenes the lay members might play a part. Having been appointed, I would agree that the lay members play a part behind the scenes. Mr. McKee, who appears regularly in front of us, is a very respected representative and who gave evidence to you last week, made it clear that he felt that it was an important part of the tribunal's jurisdiction that they should remain and that they should have the benefit of those two very experienced representatives who gave evidence before you last week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): May I first ask the Immigration Appellate Authority and the Court Service about your comments on one-stop appeals. You suggested that, whereas at the moment explanatory statements generally form the basis of the appeal consideration, you can see the possibility in the future of other issues being raised, which would not have been considered prior to the appeal by the Home Office. How big a problem do you think that is likely to be? If it is a problem and more time is spent on appeals, will the time spent on a single one-stop appeal be any greater than can happen at the moment, where one person may have more than one appeal at different times on different aspects of the case?
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> To answer the second part of your question first, I caused some inquiries to be made about that and the result of those inquiries, from the best expert that I could find, is that one-stop appeals would, working on present figures, cut our work by 10 to 20 per cent. That is, if one-stop were running now&#151;instead of the one, two or three bites at the cherry system&#151;our work would decrease by 10 to 20 per cent. That is the extent to which there are more than one or two bites at the cherry. So, speaking for myself, I would be strongly supportive of the one-stop appeal.
<P>
The reservation&#151;this relates to the first part of your question&#151;is that if the appellant, on being served with the notice suggested in clause 55, puts in grounds B, C and D, having initially at his interview put in ground A, we consider it totally essential that the Home Office answer any new grounds. Otherwise, when the appeal comes before us, we will not know what the Home Office position is if the grounds of appeal start off as asylum and then human rights and various other things are thrown in&#151;B, C and D&#151;at grounds of appeal. We think that as long as the Home Office answers those grounds, the one-stop system is a good idea and should work. But I do not think one should regard it as revolutionising the whole jurisdiction. My inquiry showed 10 to 20 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Magee:</B> I do not think it is a policy question for the Court Service, because it is a Home Office matter. But as the judge has pointed out, if it leads to speed and efficacy of disposal of cases, it is perhaps an issue that we ought to think seriously about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> You also said you had some doubts about the appropriateness of bail hearings held in detention centres and prisons. Could you tell us a bit more about that?
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> We do not think it is appropriate for adjudicators to go up and down the country to prisons and detention centres. We think that if there is a bail application, it should be in one of our courts. The only point on bail under clause 29 which we think will cause a problem is that, under subsection (4)(b), the Secretary of State must secure a first reference no later than the ninth day and, under subsection (5)(b), the 37th day. But if we then read the court's duties under clause 29(7), we see that the court must determine before the 10th day&#151;that would give us only one day and that is not enough. At the moment it takes us four to five days to turn a case over, because we have to give notice to the Home Office. The Home Office should appear and give grounds of opposition. So the timing under subsections (4)(b) and (5)(b), collated with (7)(b), will put us into difficulties. But we are supportive of the routine bail hearings being heard by magistrates and not by adjudicators&#151;for a variety of reasons, which I will go into if you want. We think the routine bail hearings are a good idea and that it is a good idea that the Bill allocates them to magistrates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> One final point, to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. You have talked about some of the proposed changes and suggested that this might make the process longer and more open to challenge. Your evidence in paragraph 4.2 seems to suggest that that might be as a result of criticisms made of the Immigration Appeals Tribunal during the review&#151;of there being too many remittals, of inconsistent decisions being made or of too many appellants seeking judicial review. It suggested that those problems were well on the way to being put right. Is there a problem with someone seeking judicial review? Is not the problem rather that too many people might obtain leave for judicial review? We cannot stop people seeking it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> The problem is well put. One of the main difficulties with the immigration appellate system at the moment is that the Immigration Appellate Authority is not closed; there is what is sometimes called leakage to judicial review.
<P>
The main types of decision that are judicially reviewed are refusals by the tribunal to grant leave to appeal and questions as to the proper certification of cases that carry no right of appeal to the tribunal. In each of those cases, the last right of appeal will already have been exhausted within the system. However, strong appellants will out, as it were, and they often go to the High Court.
<P>
The problem is that the High Court is not necessarily concerned with the substantive merits of the question. It will be concerned with looking to see whether a procedural challenge can be made on the decision of the adjudicator or the tribunal. Indeed, in answer to a question that I understand has been put down&#151;which is whether we had any comment to make on the Home Office notes&#151;we would have noted that nothing in the Bill, so far as we can see, would tend to reduce the amount of judicial review.
<P>
There are a number of further proposals for decisions that would be made at various levels which would be reviewable, thus potentially increasing the amount of judicial review, but nothing that would substantially reduce it. It is not a matter for us, but looking at the system that we see in action, that seems surprising.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): The main thrust of the Bill is about speeding up the system and reducing the opportunity for challenge. We have just spoken about one sort of challenge. Reverting back to the question of bail hearings, would people be better off with legal representation at the bail hearing so as to get the decision right first time? Do you have a view on whether people would be better off with legal representation at the bail hearing or without it?
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> With it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Would that speed up the process and make it less open to challenge?
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> Bail is very important. If possible, people should be entitled to bail; otherwise, it is deprivation of liberty. They should be represented, in my opinion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I move on to clause 59 and appeals without merit. It is proposed that if the IAT should decide that an appeal is without merit it can impose a penalty if the appellant proceeds with it. First, is that necessary? Secondly, is it desirable for you to have that power?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> As I understand it, that power is proposed to arise only in cases in which no leave to appeal to the tribunal is required. It would be, as it were, an alternative to being required to have leave. One would be at risk of a penalty if one proceeded with an unmeritorious appeal. As drafted, the tribunal regards it as posing a number of procedural problems, if nothing more. It would presumably be improper for a chairman formally to warn an appellant that his or her appeal appeared to have no merit and then to proceed to hear it.
<P>
One would have to have a process whereby, instead of considering whether leave should be granted, files would be reviewed to consider whether a warning should be given; and they would be passed to another tribunal to hear the case. Whether that would be particularly effective as an alternative to reviewing the file to see whether leave should be granted is a matter that might bear examination. Apart from that, we note that the penalty is apparently to be of a fixed amount, regardless of the arguability of the case or of the merits or demerits of the appellant or the appellant's representatives.
<P>
Lastly, though this is perhaps not a matter that will concern this Committee, we have no procedure for enforcing penalties. Even if bail is forfeited, we send off to the magistrates courts for the collection of the amount. It is not for me to comment on whether it is necessary or desirable. However, at the moment the filter is for granting or refusing leave.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): I have a question for Mr. Ockelton and Mr. Kumar. Paragraph 2.2 of your submission concerns hearings in private. What purpose does a public hearing serve, if the papers that are submitted clearly reveal that there are no grounds for appeal? Such hearings are associated with delay and expense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> If the papers that are submitted clearly show that there are no grounds for appeal, leave to appeal to the tribunal will not be granted. At present, that matter is dealt with in private by a single chairman on the papers.
<P>
The Bill proposes that a single chairman should deal with certain cases on the papers. Those are cases in which leave is to be granted or in which leave that is currently granted would, in future, be unnecessary. The chairman will deal with such cases on the papers even they they proceed to full consideration.
<P>
Our interpretation of the Bill is that that will not affect the process of getting through the gate to the tribunal, which&#151;as I indicated&#151;is covered. However, it will affect the process of the full consideration of an appeal with substantive issues to be decided. We have expressed concern about such cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> In view of the time, I will ask Judge Dunn one more question concerning one-stop appeals.
<P>
Your submission states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issues will not always have been crystallised in advance''. That refers to the stage between the asylum seeker's interview with a Home Office official and the report to the adjudicator. In the new system, that is when the first decision will take place, and may possibly be followed by an appeal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are you saying that the adjudicator's first decision will not be comprehensive? If that is so, what steps could be taken to ensure that it is comprehensive?
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> It will be comprehensive, as long as all of the points raised by an appellant are answered by the Home Office. We are concerned that, under clause 55, should the appellant raise further grounds of appeal in his notice, those grounds will not be dealt with by the Home Office. Therefore, when the matter comes to the Immigration Appellate Authority, it will be difficult to crystallise the issue. We have no problem, as long as the Home Office deals with all points raised in the appellant's notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> If that were to be achieved, the Home Office would have to deliver.
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> Yes. That is our opinion. The Home Office would have to give their side of the story. The issues would then be clear, and not open-ended, as they would be if, for example, three new grounds were raised in the notice which had not been raised in the interview.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Do you want a provision in the Bill to ensure that the Home Office answers the points raised as a result of clause 55?
<P>
<B>Judge Dunn:</B> Yes, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Good.
<P>
May I move on to the matter of appeal, when leave to appeal has been granted by the tribunal. You express concern about appeals being dealt with on the papers. If the tribunal does not hear oral evidence, how will that affect its ability to administer justice and to be seen to be administering justice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> At the moment, the tribunal rarely uses its powers to hear oral evidence. Such evidence is heard in only a small percentage of cases. However, the tribunal sits in public, subject to a power to exclude the public on a party's application. It sits in a group of three, or sometimes more, to consider a particular case at a particular time, of which the parties are aware.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The work of the tribunal will clearly be affected by the proposed change. I do not know whether more or fewer cases will be dealt with in a day. However, the appearance of the tribunal would be quite different. One of our concerns&#151;I am not sure what the answer could be&#151;is that under article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which will soon become part of the law in this country, there is a right in most cases to have one's civil rights determined by a public hearing. It is sometimes assumed that the work with which we in the IAT deal is not covered by article 6(1). It appears to me unsafe to assume that the Strasbourg jurisprudence would uphold that exclusion as regards all the work that we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> So in your opinion there is a risk that it could be susceptible to a challenge in the European Court of Human Rights?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> In my opinion, yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Taking together the change to more hearings on paper and the very important change in the tribunal's composition, what do you think will be the overall outcome of the tribunal's public standing and perception?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> I am afraid I am not competent to answer that simply because I do not know what the public standing of the tribunal is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In your submission, you refer to concern about diminution in public confidence. I wish to ascertain what you meant by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ockelton:</B> Yes, in paragraph 3.2 of the tribunal's submissions, some features are identified which perhaps lay members add to the tribunal at present: they are identified as adding credibility in two respects. I suppose that without the lay members, those aspects would be lost, although there might be gains&#151;but it is not for me to say.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you very much for coming this afternoon. I am sorry that it was a rather brief session but, as you know, we have a very busy schedule for the rest of the three hours. I am sure that the Committee will pay full heed to your evidence.
<P>
The witnesses withdrew.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Immigration Service Union</center></H4>
<H4><center>Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
It was noted during the second reading debate that the Bill gives to the Secretary of State wide ranging powers to create delegated legislation and that much of the important detail remains to be decided.
<P>
Nowhere are the powers wider, or the details less in evidence, than in Part 1 which deals with the immigration control. It is of concern to the ISU that other than the quotation reproduced below, neither the Home Secretary, Shadow Home Secretary or any other Member of Parliament made any comment upon this part of the Bill, even though it contains wide ranging powers to transform the nature of the control of immigration to the United Kingdom.
<P>
Given the lack of detail contained in the Bill any attempt to understand what is intended by the changes must rely on the White Paper ``Fairer, Faster And Firmer&#151;A Modern Approach To Immigration And Asylum'', the explanatory notes which accompany the Bill and the statement made by the Home Secretary during the second reading debate which was as follows:
<P>
``Part 1 of the Bill contains important provisions to make the operation of immigration controls more flexible and effective. For example, the Bill will enable a visa itself to confer leave to enter so as to streamline procedures at ports. The Secretary of State, as well as immigration officers, will be able to grant or refuse leave to enter and so minimise duplication of effort in handling certain types of casework. The current power to charge for settlement applications is widened to other after-entry applications and the powers of the immigration service to require passenger information are strengthened to enable better targeting of resources and improved inter-agency co-operation. However, those provisions will not change the fundamental basis on which our immigration control operates. All arriving passengers will continue to be seen by immigration staff and may be refused entry if they do not qualify.''
<P>
In discussions with the Home Secretary and Mr. O'Brien, the ISU has been reassured that they are genuine in their statements that they intend to maintain a firm, effective and responsible control over immigration to the UK. We welcome their view that the control needs to be modernised, particularly through the use of new technology. Where we have doubts is as to the degree of support for these objectives that exists amongst the senior management of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, particularly should the objectives conflict with considerations of economy and the pragmatic avoidance of the difficulties of maintaining such a control.
<P>
Such fears might be thought to be little more than the parochial reaction to be expected of a trade union which represents the majority of Immigration Service staff. However, the abandonment of the embarkation control, whereby all passengers leaving the UK were seen by immigration officers to check that conditions placed on their stay in the UK had been observed, has served to reinforce these doubts.
<P>
In the mid 1980s an internal IND report concluded that the embarkation control should be abandoned. In 1993 Ministers were persuaded to abandon control of passengers departing for EU destinations. In 1997 Ministers assured the ISU that they would not be rushed into any hurried decisions regarding the embarkation control. During a subsequent minor financial crisis, senior management identified the closure of the embarkation control as a means to produce the required savings. In this way by the steady ratchet effect of neglect and slow emasculation, a valuable part of the UK immigration control was destroyed. We fear that as one part of the control has been removed the attention of senior management will now fall on the on-entry control.
<H4><center>Areas of ISU concern</center></H4>
<P>
The areas which are of concern to us can be divided into:
<P>
--The failure to introduce new technology into the Immigration Service
<P>
--The move toward a European immigration control by:
<P>
	    &#151;The granting of `leave to enter' by the issue of a visa.
<P>
	    &#151;The granting of leave to enter by staff who are not `immigration officers' as specified in the 1971 Immigration Act.
<P>
	    &#151;The downgrading of the on entry immigration control by the replacement of immigration officers by other staff.
<P>
--The danger of `institutionalised racism' being created by the development of an intelligence-based, selective immigration control.
<H4><center>New Technology</center></H4>
<P>
Chapter 6 `On-entry Controls' was one of the weaker sections of the White Paper, having little to say about what had been achieved and few constructive suggestions to make. The lack of real content was to some extent made up for by frequent, if non specific, references to new technology.
<P>
The ISU has taken an interest in developments such as biometric identification and smart cards which may have an application in the automatic processing of passengers at the on-entry immigration control. We believe that these technologies represent the best way to deal with ever rising number of passengers without greatly increasing staff levels or diluting the effectiveness of the control.
<P>
Employing technology to monitor the automatic entry and departure of frequent visitors, while using experienced immigration officers to provide a `one-stop' on-entry to first time and long stay passengers would provide the most cost effective service to travellers and the taxpayer.
<P>
Our efforts to introduce this subject with management have been met by indifference on the basis that such technology will not be a reality within the next ten years and that it will play no part in the UK immigration control system. This appears to be contradicted by the statements in the White Paper.
<H4><center>The move towards a European Immigration Control</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Clauses 1-3 `Leave to enter, or remain in, the United Kingdom).</center></H4>
<P>
Although introduced under the cover of apparently minor administrative alterations, these clauses involve fundamental legal changes which only make sense as an enabling device to create a European style internal immigration control requiring national identity cards, police check points etc. The Explanatory Notes make clear what is intended to flow from the enabling legislation contained in the Act. This will be achieved by delegated legislation subject to negative resolution procedures. In effect any future changes can be made with little chance that the public will be aware that the immigration control is being degraded.
<P>
Measures to allow staff other than immigration officers to grant or refuse entry to the UK opens up the prospect of the administrative control of immigration by remote officials employing pre established criteria to replace the in-person individual assessment of each arriving passenger.
<P>
The grant or leave to enter by visa officers will reduce the on entry control to dealing with nationalities which are not considered ``immigration problems'' and even this may in due course be diminished or abolished by the introduction of general grants of deemed leave. The concept of on entry immigration control which the Prime Minister promised to defend at the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty will be progressively and unobtrusively abolished in the same way that the control on embarking passengers was quietly dispensed with. The proposed measures are an acknowledgement by the Home Office that it has abandoned the struggle to prevent illegal immigration and has embarked on a policy of damage limitation.
<P>
The ISU has long maintained to senior management that much was wrong with our immigration control and that we recognised and were willing to embrace change. What is now proposed is the acceptance and institutionalisation of failure in such a way that no future reform will be possible.
<P>
Rather than setting out the intentions of the government, these parts of the Bill, and the White Paper which preceded it, have caused confusion and disillusion amongst our members.
<P>
The ISU is seeking a clear and unequivocal statement from the Secretary of State setting out the future of the on arrival immigration control.
<H4><center>Grant and refusal of leave to enter by staff other than immigration officers</center></H4>
<P>
It is proposed that civil servants in the Integrated Caseworking Directorate serve letters detailing refusal of asylum applications by post and that the law be changed to allow them to also grant or refuse applications for entry on non asylum grounds. The following points should be noted:
<P>
An asylum application does not prohibit an application for leave to enter on other grounds. The ICD will have to provide in its asylum refusal letters an opportunity to make an application on other grounds. At present any additional application by a failed asylum seeker is simply resolved by the immigration officer at the same time as the asylum refusal letter is served in person. A postal asylum refusal which can be returned with a non asylum application will create another opportunity for delay. Every bogus applicant will take advantage and a new backlog of thousands of fresh applications will be created.
<P>
The proposed changes to legislation are unnecessary. Port asylum applicants can be asked if they wish to apply under any other provision of the rules, and that application resolved, on the day of arrival. Any further action is then suspended until the asylum application has been decided. This already applies where an asylum application is made after a person has been refused entry on other grounds.
<P>
We suggest that clause 1 (new 3A) section (7) be deleted from the Bill.
<H4><center>Grant of limited leave to enter and settlement by visa officers overseas</center></H4>
<P>
The position now is that an immigration officer may ask the holder of a visa questions and refuse entry if he discovers that material facts have changed since the visa was issued or that the visa officer was deceived. The proposal is that the act of issuing a visa at a British Embassy abroad will also constitute the granting of leave to enter the UK. Action by immigration service `staff' on arrival in the UK will be limited to checking that the photograph resembles the holder and that the visa is not forged. The target time for this is three seconds!
<P>
Many forgeries, `look-alikes' and substituted photographs are only discovered when questioning raises suspicion that the passenger is not the rightful holder of the document. Forgery detection relies on examination with specialised equipment in a dedicated examination room. Such examinations will never take place unless questioning by an immigration officer raises suspicions about the passenger. The three second target will not allow any proper examination of the document.
<P>
There is no logical reason to introduce this change&#151;it is acknowledged that the standard of visa issue will have to be raised considerably and the current quotas for visa issues removed if the control is not to be downgraded. Even with a vast expansion in the numbers of visa officers and much longer and more detailed visa interviews, bogus applicants will still get through (the number of visa nationals who gain visas only to claim asylum in country is evidence of this). If the standard of issue is improved immigration officers will naturally spend less time interviewing holders of visas from posts abroad which have good reputations. The time savings can be achieved by an evolutionary improvement. Changes in procedures are only needed if the true objective is to downgrade the immigration control.
<P>
We suggest that Clause 1 (new 3A) section (3) be deleted from the Bill.
<P>
The argument is put forward that few visa holders are refused entry. When the 1971 Immigration Act was passed visas were not imposed on countries because of immigration problems but rather due to reciprocal arrangements or to international tensions. Visa officers were never intended to seek out potential illegal entrants and the right to an appeal before removal and the presumption of a right of entry reflect this. The visa system has been adapted to deal with matters of settlement, but has always worked badly as a means of controlling bogus visitors etc. To abandon the main line of defence leaving only what was intended to be a preliminary check highlights the defeatist attitude behind these initiatives.
<P>
The transformation of the in country appeal (S.41) to an appeal after removal would end the anomalous situation where a person who has employed deception to obtain a visa has to be released only to abscond, because of the delay in arranging an in country appeal.
<P>
We suggest that section 13 (3) of the Immigration Act 1971 be amended by deleting the words:
<P>
``unless he was refused leave at a port of entry and at a time when he held a current entry clearance or was a person named in a current work permit.''
<H4><center>The downgrading of the on-entry immigration control</center></H4>
<P>
It will be noted that the Home Secretary's remarks quoted at the beginning of this submission, although specifically mentioning immigration officers, goes on to say ``All arriving passengers will continue to be seen by immigration staff.''
<P>
The use of the term `staff' rather than `officer' is not a slip. The same phrasing was used in the White Paper and IND senior mangement has refused to deny that the immigration control will be downgraded by the replacement of immigration officers, as designated by the 1971 Immigration Act, with other less qualified and experienced staff.
<P>
This would reduce the function of the control to a date stamping exercise such as is employed in continental immigration systems, with its other features such as National Identify Cards and random street document checks an inevitable long term consequence.
<P>
Clause 3 (1) introduces the power to make a charge for leave to remain and the variation of leave to enter. There is no mention of the possibility of a charge for leave to enter itself. The work of the Immigration Service, and its potential to raise significant sums for the relief of the UK taxpayer, has been neglected in the drafting of these measures.
<P>
We suggest that clause 3(1)(a) be amended to read:
<P>
``leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.''
<H4><center>The `intelligence led approach', selectivity, stereotyping and institutionalised racism</center></H4>
<P>
The ISU has serious doubts concerning the growth of concepts such as `risk assessment' and `intelligence led passenger profiling'. Our belief is that each passenger should be dealt with as an individual on a one to one basis by a fully professional immigration officer. Any intelligence information or previous experience of immigration problems relating to specific points of departure, economic problems of given areas etc. should only be taken into consideration to the extent that they are relevant to the individual passenger.
<P>
Selectivity in immigration control amounts to stereotyping and little else. Given that any intelligence information available will often be that persons of nationality X are known to be involved in a given method of gaining illegal entry and may be expected to travel from departure point Y, there is considerable scope for accusations that immigration officers are picking on individuals for inspection on the basis of race. This is precisely the kind on institutionalised racism as defined by the Macpherson report and it is the manner in which IND senior management are attempting to force ISU members to operate the immigration control.
<P>
The introduction of `selectivity' to the control of passengers using the British and European Union passports channel has already caused a number of justified complaints by black and Asian British nationals who find that they are constantly selected for inspection. With insufficient staff to make proper checks on all passports prompting the instruction regarding selectivity, immigration officers are placed in the invidious position of abandoning any attempt to detect forged documents or of operating a policy which is inevitably racist.
<P>
The problem is compounded by a number of measures which have and are to be introduced under the promise of better targeting of resources and risk assessment. However these policies may be described as not paying much attention to, or even ignoring, flights which do not carry `aliens'. Given that in some cases surveillance will be by closed circuit television this means that flights which carry people who `look' British will be risk assessed as non problematic.
<H4><center>Appendix one</center></H4>
<H4><center>Part II Carriers' liability</center></H4>
<P>
S.20 (3)
<P>
From the explanatory notes published with the Bill it appears that the defence for a carrier is that he has satisfied each of the three subsections (a) and (b) and (c).
<P>
However, the Bill as drafted does not make it clear that (a) is not a self contained defence even where (b) and (c) do not apply.
<P>
Given that subsection (a) states:
<P>
``he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that a clandestine entrant was, or might be, concealed in the transporter.''
<P>
a defence to all carriers in all circumstances is provided.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Public and Commercial Services Union</center></H4>
<P>
As the main union representing those who will be charged with implementing the provisions of the new legislation, PCS have identified 3 main areas on which to concentrate its submission to the Committee.
<H4><center>Part I&#151;Clauses 1 and 2</center></H4>
<P>
The provisions for greater flexibility in the granting of leave to enter and remain, refusing and varying leave, which currently can only be by way of written notice. PCS are concerned that these give scope for future changes in the operation of immigration controls which will remove the key element of consistency. As well as compromising the Firmness of controls, there is a clear danger that the essential perception of Fairness will be lost, particularly if the targeting of resources is viewed as discriminatory.
<H4><center>Part VI&#151;Clauses 73 to 103</center></H4>
<P>
One of the main aims of the Bill is that of countering abuse of U.K. asylum procedures by foreign nationals whose primary motive is economic rather than a well-founded fear of persecution as defined by the 1951 Convention. The introduction of complex new arrangements for the accommodation and support of asylum seekers, overseen by a new Home Office agency, has understandably attracted widespread comment from interested parties. The debate as to the relative deterrence value of the proposals for the geographical dispersal of asylum seekers into `clusters' and the removal of access to cash benefits (in favour of benefits in kind such as vouchers, is not one which PCS feels particularly qualified to enter.
<P>
Whatever reforms are proposed, however, it seems to be generally acknowledged that their effectiveness will depend on the avoidance of lengthy delays and backlogs, both of which have dogged the asylum process in recent years, often to the detriment of those with a genuine claim. PCS sees the Faster principle as being absolutely vital to general acceptability of the radical proposals for the support of asylum seekers. The arrangements for minimal support and denial of the right to take employment will be regarded as inhumane and unacceptable if the asylum decision-making and appeal process results in the support arrangements being anything other than short-term. Accordingly, Ministers have set targets for the resolution of cases: two months for the initial decision and a further four months for any appeal to be resolved. PCS believes that the Commitee's consideration of these provisions needs to be fully informed as to why the time limits set appear to be wholly unrealistic. The grounds for this belief include:
<P>
--the rise in the asylum backlog during 1998
<P>
--the reduction in IND staff during the same period, in preparation for the `computerisation' of casework in IND under a PFI contract
<P>
--the delay in the delivery of the I.T. system
<P>
--the transitional problems currently being experienced in IND and their repercussions in the medium-term
<P>
--doubts about the anticipated longer-term efficiency gains to be derived from the new I.T. and the re-structuring of IND's work
<P>
--the insufficiency of the additional funds made availabe to IND following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review
<P>
PCS firmly believes that unless the implementation of these provisions are accompanied by the investment of significant additional resources in the form of extra staff, further delays and backlogs are inevitable, jeopardising not only the viability of this particular strategy but the main aims of the Bill, in general.
<H4><center>Part VII&#151;Clauses 104 to 107</center></H4>
<P>
The provisions to extend immigration officers' powers of arrest and search. A number of issues arise here, including those of training and support, the real effectiveness of this initiative and potential for a negative impact on race relations.
<P>
Mr. Martin Slade and Mr. John Tincey, Immigration Service Union; Mr. Peter Roberts and Mr. Andrew Fleming, Public and Commercial Services Union, called in and examined.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Welcome to this session of the Special Standing Committee, and thank you for attending. As you know, we are not asking for opening statements because we have written evidence from you. I should like each of you to introduce yourselves, and to say which union you come from and what your interest is.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Tincey </B>(Immigration Service Union): I am John Tincey. I am the director of information research from the Immigration Service Union.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Slade </B>(Immigration Service Union): I am the general secretary of the ISU.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Roberts </B>(Public and Commercial Services Union): I am Peter Roberts, Secretary of the Home Office Croydon and Outstations [Executive and Support Grades] Branch of the Public and Commercial Services Union. That is the grade that decides asylum applications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Fleming </B>(Public and Commercial Services Union): I am the Chair of the Home Office Croydon and Outstations (Administrative and Allied Grades) Branch. I also represent administrative and allied members in the presenting officers units, and regional public inquiry officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I should like to ask the ISU about clauses 1 to 3 which, as you say in your submission, have not been much mentioned elsewhere but which you think are very important. Taken together, do you think the clauses will leave immigration control strong or weaker if they are enacted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> That very much depends on how they are used. We have been impressed by how the current Government have taken up the problems of immigration and asylum. We are happy with the consultation and that they mean what they say when they say that they will take proper measures to deal with those problems.
<P>
The difficulty is that once the measures are on the statute book, they will remain there for many years: the Immigration Act 1971 is still with us. Our concern is how they will be used by future, especially senior, civil servants. We already have some experience on the control of people leaving the country. A report written by civil servants in the late 1980s suggested that that control should be abandoned. Over the years, it was hacked away bit by bit. A giant lump was taken out in 1993, when we dropped our controls on people going to Europe. Finally, last year, on the basis of a need suddenly to raise &#163;3 million to keep the rest of the control going, it was effectively put in cotton wool. We are therefore concerned that in the future, under different Minister, or perhaps even a different Government, there might be a similar process, whereby senior civil servants will pursue what seems to be their long-term objective&#151;to do away with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In that case, that process would effect on-entry controls.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> And you are concerned about leave to enter. Do you think that an immigration officer's granting leave to enter, even when visa or entry clearance has been granted overseas, still performs a valuable function?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> A visa was always seen as a second line of defence. There are certain things that you can ask a person, and certain things that you can do, when he or she applies for a visa, that you cannot do when he or she arrives in the country. However, on the other hand, there are many things that you can do when someone arrives in the country that you cannot do when he or she applies for a visa. Most obviously, you can look in his or her suitcase, and see what he or she has brought. You can ask to see what money he or she has brought. It is common for visa officers to mark notes presented to them. The same five $100 bills appear time after time because a man outside is hiring that money for the purpose of the interview. You cannot do that when you arrive in Britain. You cannot hide the fact that your baggage contains a letter from your brother, saying, ``The job is ready for you.'' That would all be lost if we simply relied on people on the visa issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Is it your understanding that, under the new dispensation, what immigration officers will be expected to do when someone arrives will be limited to checking identity and documents, and that that will be expected to be done in a limited time&#151;three seconds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> Three seconds has been suggested to us. Some figures seem to have been produced&#151;I am not entirely sure where they have come from&#151;suggesting that it takes an immigration officer 100 seconds to deal with someone who holds a visa. I am also an immigration officer, in my spare time. It does not take 100 seconds to deal with a visa holder if that person is perfectly all right. It takes as long as it takes to deal with the individual person in his or her individual circumstances. That can be anything from 10 seconds to the rest of the day.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not want to interrupt, but if at any point Mr. Roberts or Mr. Fleming want to add anything, please feel free to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have just one more question, which either of you may answer. Do you think that the task of granting leave to enter should be carried out by an immigration officer or other staff?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> The suggestion is that leave to enter will be refused in conjunction with the refusal of an asylum application. At the moment, that is done by an immigration officer in person. Because it is done in person, applicants tend not to make additional applications. Once they have been refused asylum, they do not also ask to stay on as a visitor, because they know they would be refused at that point. If it is done at Croydon, it would have to be done by post. Our fear is that, once that extra element of things going backwards and forwards in the post is introduced, there will be a delay. Our experience is that people always take advantage of a delay. Effectively, yet another backlog could build up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Do the witnesses from the Public and Commercial Services Union want to add any points?
<P>
<B>Mr. Roberts:</B> In the absence of a representative from the Immigration Service branch of the PCS, we do not have any comments to add about the entry control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Do you believe that this legislation is, as alleged by some witnesses, much too tough? Also, do you support the removal of benefits? I put that to both of you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> We see it as a firm foundation for moving forward. I noticed in the Second Reading debate that many Members said that they hoped that the Bill would be the solution to the problem. Clearly, it will not be the solution to the problem; but it could be a good basis on which to move forward. It is the sort of problem that has to be tackled every day, because every day, the criminals who are making vast amounts of money out of bringing people here to make applications are adapting their procedures to meet what we do. The Bill can only be a foundation.
<P>
On your second point, there is good evidence that where benefit measures have been changed in the past&#151;I know that many people disagreed with the way they were made&#151;there was a marked response on the part of people claiming asylum. Not only did numbers drop but people reacted by going where the money was. Only 30 per cent. of people arriving in the country used to apply for asylum through an at-port application when there was an advantage to applying in country. As soon as benefits were taken away and could be got only by applying at-port, instead of 30 per cent., it immediately went up to 75 per cent.
<P>
When various changes were brought in by judicial decisions, matters drifted back. It went to 60:40 and is now back to 50:50. Where there are benefits, people will go where the money is. We believe that it is a very sound measure to take, provided that it does actually give people a proper means of sustaining themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roberts:</B> Provided that people are supported, and the perception of fairness is maintained&#151;in terms of not keeping people on the voucher system for an extended period&#151;that is a possibility. However, if withdrawal of benefits leads to extended periods without access to any means of support, obviously our members would have a problem with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May I return to the question of entry controls with the Immigration Service Union. You talked in your evidence about the need for an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in-person individual assessment of each arriving passenger''
<P>
</UL></FONT>and suggested that it was going to disappear. You also said that you would never examine for forgeries and so on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless questioning by an immigration officer raises suspicions''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>How much in-person individual assessment takes place now? Is it not the case that for most people arriving with a visa, there will be a quick look from the immigration officer to establish that it is the right person and then he will stamp it. You say yourself that it could be 10 seconds for a case and that you are going to pick the ones that you think need further questioning. Is that not what happens now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Slade:</B> The figure of 100 seconds&#151;just over a minute and a half&#151;is suggested by the Home Office. People with a visa are presented in the normal manner like every passenger who is not a British or European national. They come to an individual immigration officer who can ask them any question that is thought necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Does he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Slade:</B> Yes, certainly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Every single person?
<P>
<B>Mr. Slade:</B> Yes. If you do not ask questions, you do not know what stamp to put on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> When I spent a day with the immigration service at Heathrow, I must say that I did not get the impression that every single person was being asked detailed questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> The officer will start talking to the passenger before he knows whether he has a visa. He probably has five seconds before he opens the page that has the visa in it and it sometimes takes longer. Two or three questions will have been asked in that time and a preliminary impression will have been formed.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> So what will change?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> What will change is that there will be no opportunity for immigration officers to ask questions, if an immigration officer is doing that work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Let me take you to another point about the grant and refusal of leave to enter by staff other than immigration officers. There are two issues: first, if a decision is taken by a case worker in IND on a person who is already in-country, why should it be returned to an immigration officer simply to administer it? Why should not the case be dealt with by some other mechanism?
<P>
Secondly, you said that at present any additional application by a failed asylum seeker is resolved by the immigration officer at the same time as the asylum refusal letter is served in person. I understand that you are trying to give the impression that if you take a decision on an asylum case that is the end of it. But it does not really happen like that, does it? There are plenty of people now who make further applications of one sort or another after asylum refusals.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> The situation is that people essentially make marriage applications, which tend to be considered and very often are successful. It is difficult to see how someone will be accepted as a visitor, for example, when one of the reasons that they have given to justify being a visitor is that they will leave at the end of their visit. It is difficult to see how they would be accepted having made an asylum application. So, to some extent, people do not bother to make those applications because they know they will be refused. If there is an immigration officer there they know that it will be refused at that point. If it is to be done by a case worker in Croydon, the case worker will have to write a letter&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> At the moment, what is to stop someone making such an application a fortnight, a month or three months later?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> Because at the moment he or she is doing so in person to an immigration officer and will know that if he asks that question the immigration officer will take a decision at that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> My point is that the immigration officer says, ``I am refusing you asylum''; what is to stop that person making some other, different claim to stay in the country a few weeks later?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> What happens is that the immigration officer says, ``The Home Office has rejected your asylum application. Do you wish to seek entry on any other grounds?'' If the person says no, or if he says yes and his application is refused, he has been refused entry under immigration powers as well as under the asylum process so he is not able to make another application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I have one last, quick point. You talked about the removal of embarkation controls. How did they keep any sort of check on who might have overstayed? Did not they just tell you that somebody had left; they did not tell you anything about somebody who might not have left.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> No, what happened was that there were immigration officers or assistant immigration officers checking people's passports. They were looking at the stamps that had been put in people's passports when they arrived, from which one could tell whether someone had left within the period that they were given. We were also quite successful in discovering that people were leaving the country and continuing to make benefit claims. Things certainly were being produced by that control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to ask the Public and Commercial Services Union representatives some questions. You have already stated your concern about the proposed support system being in place for too long. Your written evidence is disturbing in stating that you consider the time limits, which are at the heart of the Bill, to be wholly unrealistic.
<P>
I should like you please to elaborate on two points: first, the new information technology system. All Members of Parliament are sensitive to the current problems at Croydon as we see a stream of constituents about the matter. You are saying that you believe that the anticipated longer-term efficiency gains will not come from restructuring the IT, which is worrying because that suggests that the problems will be permanent.
<P>
Secondly, you are saying that there are insufficient funds in the Government's spending review for IND. Both those matters suggest that the system will continue to be slow rather than speeding up. What is your view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Roberts:</B> There is rather a lot in that question. Our members doubt whether the IT will deliver the sort of efficiency savings originally envisaged. The IT system was designed not to take decisions but to pull together the information reference sources previously available as hard copy, and to present on a screen the case papers which were previously dealt with as paper files.
<P>
The core tasks of dealing with asylum claims&#151;interviewing applicants, assessing the evidence and drafting decision letters&#151;will remain unchanged.
<P>
There is also the point that Judge Dunn raised in relation to this: we are trying to stick to the time limits of two months for a decision and a further four months until the appeal is resolved. At present an application can be decided but there is no time limit as to how quickly the post-decision representations can be dealt with. If all the representations are going to be made with the grounds of appeal to the asylum decision, significant extra resources will be needed to ensure that those are dealt with promptly. At present there is no realistic prospect of that.
<P>
The comprehensive spending review funds have also been mentioned. It is difficult to predict accurately how quickly the intake of asylum applications is rising, but clearly the latest Home Office statistics show that there is a rising trend. In view of the rundown of staffing resources prior to the expected launch of the computerised system, the intake of asylum applications is about 4,700 per month whereas the average output throughout 1998 was only 2,750. We should add to the 2,750 applications the decisions by the new staff allocated by the additional comprehensive spending review funds.
<P>
I have done a rough calculation and if you say that each case working officer deals with 170 applications per year, on average, 100 extra officers, which is basically what the CSR funds envisage, would only increase the monthly output to a total of 4,150, which is below the current intake of applicants. Unfortunately, that was if they were up to speed immediately. In fact it takes perhaps six months for an asylum case working officer to settle in. It is not even envisaged to have all those 100 or so staff in place until early next year.
<P>
So clearly, in view of the rising output, the additional requirement of this Bill and the one-stop appeal system to ensure that the representations are thoroughly dealt with and addressed prior to the appeal being heard, the resources do not seem to add up. There are not enough at present. If they were in place at present we would still be dealing with 500 fewer cases per month than are coming in. Clearly, we would just be creating an additional backlog.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Could I just ask you for the figure of output? It was under 3,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roberts:</B> It was 2,750, the average figure for 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Pickthall </B>(West Lancashire): Mr. Tincey, I appreciated the measured way in which you introduced your evidence this afternoon. You spoke about the Bill being a firm foundation for moving forward and said that you were happy with the consultation. Did you write the submission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> It says at the top of page 4:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The proposed measures are an acknowledgement by the Home Office that it has abandoned the struggle to prevent illegal immigration and has embarked on a policy of damage limitation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the same paragraph you say that the Government are planning that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Amsterdam treaty will be progressively and unobtrusively abolished''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and in paragraph 5 on page 3 you state that the explanatory notes make it clear that the Government are out to deceive the public. That is a matter of public record, but it sounds very different from what you have said this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> We think that there is a long-term view or culture in the immigration and nationality department of immigration control as being too difficult. We think that the attitude is that it is not possible effectively to maintain immigration control and that the department is attempting to ameliorate the situation, to limit numbers where possible and, if you like, to get illegal immigrants settled in the country as easily as possible. Obviously, that is not what we see immigration control as being about.
<P>
We do not see anything contradictory in what the Government tell us directly, but what comes down through the management of the immigration service and IND somehow never seems to be quite what the Government say. As with many things in life, we support what the Government say, but that does not seem to be the same as what actually happens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> You seem to be saying that the Government intend that that should happen. Your argument is a floodgates argument, is it not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> I am sorry if I gave that impression. I did not intend to suggest that the Government intended it to happen. We fully support what the Government say they intend, but we continually find that those measures are watered down by senior officials once they reach our members who are trying to do their jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> I see&#151;a sort of unintentional hypocrisy. May I just ask a separate question, with reference to page 6, where you discuss the intelligence-led approach? You say that it will lead to ``institutionalised racism''. The last few lines read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any intelligence information or previous experience of immigration problems relating to specific points of departure, economic problems of given areas etc. should only be taken into consideration to the extent that they are relevant to the individual passenger.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Quite honestly, I do not really understand that. I should have thought that an intelligence-gathering exercise would be intended to reveal problems before they occurred, isolate them and deal with them before they developed. They would have to be related to individual passengers. Can you explain to me how you fear institutionalised racism would result?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> You are suggesting that intelligence comes down to looking out for Mr. X. Is that right?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> Ultimately, yes. I should say that it was bound to look at groups and problems in certain parts of the world, and so forth, but would come down to the people whom one would confront.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tincey:</B> My experience, and that of our members, is that intelligence with respect to immigration tends to be rather more generalised; that certain criminal gangs are operating in certain countries, using certain routes to bring people into the country. So one is not then looking for a named individual. Rather, there is a suggestion that certain people who fit certain profiles might be of more interest than others. Very often such profiles will be that a person is a national of a particular country, because someone is forging the passports of that country.
<P>
Already, people in the European Union and British entry queue are not individually examined&#151;they are not stopped and required to speak to an officer. A fast-flowing track of people goes through. Immigration officers working on that queue who are reacting to the kind of intelligence that I mentioned must look out for people who fit certain profiles.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our concern is that if for example the profile happens to be that there are Nigerians using and selling British passports, we may end up looking for people who happen to look like Nigerians. I do not find that acceptable and nor do my members, but we are concerned that we may end up in that position if such an intelligence approach is followed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you. If you do not mind, Mr. Bottomley, you may ask only one question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B>(Worthing, West): My question links current events with the timetables proposed in the Bill. Many of us have constituents who were granted, say, four years' leave to remain, and were told that they could not apply for extension until four weeks of the expiry of their leave to remain, yet sadly, six months later, their documents are still unavailable to them. As a result, they are not entitled to work here or travel.
<P>
Can we perceive such circumstances to be a temporary blip, or will the matter take a long time to unwind? Are we at risk of the same applying to the timetables that are envisaged under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fleming:</B> I shall answer the first part of the question. Whether or not it is a temporary blip depends on whether additional resources are deployed within the decision-making arm of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon and, to some extent, in Liverpool. As you see from our submission, we believe that the position is crucial. A system of team caseworking has been rolled out, which is a part-IT solution and the difficulty is that we do not have the full information technology that was promised originally.
<P>
Since we have changed our accommodation, several problems have arisen. Some, as you have suggested, Mr. Bottomley, may be temporary problems that will settle down in time. Clearly, others will not settle down unless additional staff are brought in and members of staff who are making the decisision are given additional training because some staff currently only have experience to deal with particular applications.
<P>
With additional staff, we shall need more accommodation because our present facilities have already reached capacity. It is evident, even with the additional staff that we receive under the CSR settlement, that they will be dealing only with the application-decision side, and will not have the support to bring about such decisions. There will not be sufficient space to house the additional staff that we are promised under the CSR settlement.
<P>
The view of the Public and Commercial Services Union is that we will require significantly more staff if the current situation, as experienced by your constituents, Mr. Bottomley, is not to continue for longer than anyone would wish.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you gentlemen for attending this afternoon. I am sorry that it was a short session but, as you know, we are working to a tight timetable. I am sure that the Committee will pay full heed to everything that you have told us this afternoon.
<P>
The witnesses withdrew.
<P>
Mr. Jack Straw, Secretary of State for the Home Department; Mr. Chris Hudson, Home Office; Mr. Bob Eagle, Home Office; Mr. Bob Whalley, Home Office; called in and examined.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Secretary of State, thank you for attending this last part of the evidence-gathering session of the Committee stage. As you know, we are not taking opening statements. If you would first like to introduce to the Committee those officials who are with you, we shall then move to questions.
<P>
<B>The Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Jack Straw): I have brought some officials with me. They are Mr. Bob Whalley, who covers a large part of the policy on the Bill; Mr. Bob Eagle, who is in charge of policy in respect of the support arrangements; and Mr. Chris Hudson, who has the happy task of bringing all this together and serving up us, and you, with a coherent Bill. Mr. Hudson heads the Bill unit, which ensures smooth progress in getting through these major legislative proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> It is not often that one has an opportunity to cross-examine one's boss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> That is not true.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Home Secretary, the Bill has been described by previous witnesses as being much too tough, particularly in relation to the proposals for asylum support. How do you respond?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I do not accept that. It is inevitable that witnesses who come before the Committee will criticise propositions because it takes much less time to support them. I strongly supported the setting up of a Special Standing Committee because it genuinely adds to the way in which Parliament scrutinises a Bill of this nature.
<P>
In the White Paper published at the end of last July, we said that we wanted a system that was faster, fairer and firmer. There has been no dubiety about that. I do not believe that the Bill is too tough. Examination of practice in this country shows that compared to that in many other countries, we are consistent with our legal system and traditions. We are very accommodating, but it is beyond peradventure that the asylum system in particular has been, and still is, open to very serious abuse. My guess is that colleagues around the table who have a substantial Afro-Caribbean or, in particular, Asian constituency&#151;as I do&#151;will be familiar with the way that these abuses have grown and that, for example, even five years ago, a person coming here as a visitor, and wanting to stay but who was refused permission for perfectly good reasons, simply accepted that. These days they may be routinely put up to inventing an asylum case, or have one invented for them right from the start; and so it goes on. That inevitably has meant that the old defences in the system have proved inadequate.
<P>
Also, Mr. O'Brien, the basic Act controlling immigration is now getting on for 30 years old, and is in need of reform. The appeal system, which was recommended by the Wilson committee in the mid-1960s, had not kept up with the pressure or the pace of applications. Bear in mind that throughout the 1980s until, essentially, the collapse of the Berlin wall, asylum applications were running at about 4,000 a year; principal applications&#151;excluding dependants&#151;are now well over 40,000 and rising. We had to change the system.
<P>
On the support issue, what any genuine individuals who seeks asylum here wish for is proper sustenance and board; they have not come for cash benefits. Provided that we are able to process their applications with relative speed, there is no reason at all why the main burden of support to them should not be in kind, bearing in mind the substantial&#151;in our judgment&#151;pull factor which the cash system provides for people with unfounded claims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> My questions are unlikely to hit the headlines but they are important to the one million international students who come to this country each year&#151;the point may also have been made by the United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. If potential students are asked to re-apply for leave to remain&#151;if initial leave to remain does not cover the whole course&#151;will they be required to pay extra because they have been told to apply a second time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Hudson </B>(Home Office): This is the charging for after-entry applications?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hudson:</B> The Bill allows for those provisions to be brought in by secondary legislation. I do not think that the detail of that has yet been resolved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Is it possible then to assume that there will be consultation&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> There will be consultation in advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Will the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, UKCOSA and the NUS be consulted? We cannot ask you to go further on that today, but it is an important point, especially given the economic contribution that we derive, as well as the educational influence from around the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> As was made clear in the White Paper and as I made clear on Second Reading, part of the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we are more welcoming to genuine travellers into this country. We want a faster, fairer system. We gain hugely from people visiting this country for various purposes&#151;family visits, tourism and education. A large part of our economy is supported by people from overseas coming to make use of our excellent education facilities, and we want to facilitate the entry of those people and their remaining here when it is lawful for them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Will students be asked to provide financial security for themselves or for visiting members of their family; or is that, too, a matter for secondary legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Are you talking about the bond scheme?
<P>

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> The bond scheme arose because a number of our constituents said that they were frustrated with the fact that there was no appeal against refusal for visitors' entry clearance, which was ended under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. Moreover, they said that they cannot show their good faith&#151;for example, by depositing a security of a certain number of thousands of pounds, which they would be ready to forfeit if the visitors whom they were sponsoring did not do what they said they would do. If that happened, the visitors would go back.
<P>
As you will be aware, the Bill contains two sets of provisions: one is to set up a proper system of appeals for family visitors, and the second is to pilot the bond scheme. This is new territory; Ministers in the Home Office thought that it was worth trying, and I am certainly very committed to it. The detail must be worked out, but that is in the nature of pilot schemes.
<P>
Although not everyone in the world agrees with every last dot and comma in the Bill, I hope people accept that we have been very open about the process. We have provided a huge amount of information and generated a public debate, and we intend to continue to do so.
<P>
I know that my reputation for freedom of information goes before me, so I might not need to mention this, but, shortly after taking over, I ensured that all the caseworker instructions were made public, apart from those relating to law enforcement. So they are all out in the open, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Assuming that that answer applies to emergency welfare benefits in the limited circumstances in which students qualify at present, I will not pursue that matter.
<P>
Can I ask one last question about immigration advice? At the moment, many colleges, universities and charities, such as UKCOSA, give advice. Will they be required to pay the massive registration fees of more than &#163;6,000 a year that have been talked about? If that is not intended, will further consultation take place; or is there likely to be explicit exemption, or explicit provision, for those people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> There is provision in the Bill, as you will be aware, to exempt certain organisations from the basic provisions. We can obviously talk to the universities about that, but there is no intention whatsoever that universities, which are bona fide institutions providing incidental advice, should be caught by the provisions. We can work around that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I hope that the same will apply to specialist charities in the field.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I think that this point was made last week. Specialist charities, such as the Immigration Advisory Service or the Refugee Council, will need to get an exemption under the Bill or to register. We do not think that that will be a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Could that apply to UKCOSA and the Council for International Education?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Yes, it could.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): To bring you back to the question of support, a number of witnesses, as Mike O'Brien said, have said that the Bill is too tough. You were not actually likened to Vlad the Impaler, but the implication was that the Bill would breach people's human rights. For example, it was suggested that support in kind is acceptable only in those countries where there is absolutely no alternative to providing it because the country itself has no other resources. Thinking of the letter of the law and the specific United Nations resolutions on this subject, can you give the Committee an assurance that the Bill complies with those resolutions?
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I cannot give the Committee an absolute assurance that the Bill complies with every resolution that has ever been passed by an international organisation because, as you will know, some international organisations sometimes act in an eccentric way. I can give you an assurance that the Bill complies with our international obligations that affect the Bill, in particular the European convention on human rights.
<P>
I simply do not begin to understand the argument that providing support in kind is somehow a withdrawal of human rights. There has been provision of benefits in kind for the past three years, since the passage of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. Our objection to that Act was that it was incomplete. As you may known, we proposed this kind of process and, had it been introduced, we may have flushed out the fact that abolishing the right of in-country applicants to obtain social security cash benefits and failing to put anything else in their place was bound to put a random burden on local authorities, particularly those in London and Kent.
<P>
Since you raised the question with me, Dr. Ladyman, I shall make it clear that the pressure to set up a co-ordinated national system for the support of asylum seekers came from the local authorities. I chaired a meeting of local authorities in what used to be called the Pembroke hotel in Blackpool during last year's pary conference, and there Lord Harris of Haringey&#151;Toby Harris&#151;and a number of others made it absolutely clear that it was accepted by all that it would be desirable to establish as soon as possible, under the aegis of the Local Government Association, a non-statutory agency which heads up arrangements to direct asylum seekers out of London and would ensure that asylum seekers received the same offer of accommodation, regardless to which council they presented themselves. It went on in a similar vein.
<P>
So that is where the pressure came from. I think it was necessary for us to respond to it, but one of the questions that has to be answered by those who are criticising these arrangements is this: if this country operated in the way that, even now, it is suggested we operated, why do so many asylum seekers travel through a series of European countries before they come to the country of their choice? It is partly because of our high subscription in terms of human rights.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Since we have been sitting in Committee, we have received a copy of the consultation paper on support; obviously, none of us will have read it in detail, but a quick skim through seemed to indicate that support will entail food, accommodation, medicine, clothing and a small cash payment roughly equivalent to about &#163;7 per adult. Is that a reasonable summary of the support that we would be providing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Yes. It is laid out in the two documents that we have issued.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> How does that compare with the levels of support that other European countries would provide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> The answer is that it compares reasonably favourably. We have not set the levels of support on the basis of what is available in other European countries; we have set them on what we believe to be an objective basis, according to what is needed by people who are in that position in this country, so they are much more closely related to social security scales and levels of support than they are to what is available in other European countries&#151;but I dare say we can provide information about other European countries. Having said that, the comparisons with other countries tend to be much, much more difficult to pull out than often appears to be the case.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> It was suggested to us, in particular by what I thought was some fairly powerful evidence from Kent county council, that the cost of operating support through vouchers is very high compared with simply providing cash. Would you care to comment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Yes. The unit cost of providing cash support per asylum seeker or per asylum-seeking family is marginally less than the unit cost of providing support in kind. However, the take-up is hugely different. The overall cost is very much less if you provide support in kind, because there is no pull factor. The only people who seek support in kind are those who actually need it. It is, I am afraid, a fact of life that if you provide cash benefits, payments and individuals are, by definition, much more difficult to track, and the system is much more open to abuse. There is no question about it; they have acted as a pull factor.
<P>
If you look at the statistics for countries such as Lithuania&#151;and I have seen no evidence whatever to challenge Lithuania's human rights record&#151;you will see that 1,000 Lithuanian asylum seekers came to this country. So far as we can judge, it is frankly to get cash benefits. It is part of a racket. I am afraid that such matters put iron in the soul.
<P>
That has been going on to an increasing extent in eastern Europe. There is a similar problem in Albania. One of the things that we have done since coming into office is to try to speed up the system for genuine asylum seekers who plainly meet the criteria of the 1951 convention. Where we can estabish quickly that they are who they say they are, that they come from the country that they say they come from, that the country is known to be one where the convention criteria have been breached and that that affects them personally, then we seek to give them either refugee status or exceptional leave to remain more quickly than happened before.
<P>
So far as Kosovo is concerned, that is true for people who are able to prove that they are from Kosovo, but quite a number of people have come from Albania who speak as if they were ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who generally speaking have no well-founded fear of persecution whatever. We have the difficult job of distinguishing one from the other. However, there is little doubt that the availability of cash benefits acts as a pull. I am afraid that it is our judgment, endorsed by Paliament in its votes on our comprehensive spending review, that we must control that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Other points of view were put to us, saying that the time that it took to process the claims was the most significant factor. Could you say whether any work has been done on the question of time rather than the question of cash benefits? In other words, I am asking whether you think that the Lithuanians that you cited, or any other group, would still find cash benefits a significant pull if their claims were likely to be turned around within the two months suggested in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Straw:</B> We said that we aim to have the initial decision made within two months and an appeal within four months; so we are talking about six months, not two months. I am quite clear that cash benefits would still be a pull factor because, given the relative differences in standards of living and the value of money, social security cash benefits paid in an easily tradeable international currency are a major attraction, even if they are available only for only six months. I have no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Can I ask about the social costs? You said that the cost per unit would be higher under the proposed arrangements. You make the assumption in your document that the total cost will fall because of the lack of pull factor. If the number of asylum applicants remained exactly the same and if they take up the new support arrangements, that would be a more costly system than benefits. In other words, you are putting the Government's money where their mouth is, saying that the numbers will fall because of the change in support arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Yes. There is good evidence, from what happened when the benefit changes were introduced in 1996. Between October 1995 and May 1996, there was a 60 per cent. drop in in-country applications and a 15 per cent. drop in at-port applications, making an overall drop of 45 per cent. Take-up rates for those on DSS benefits are estimated to be 100 per cent. for families and 85 per cent. for single people. For social service benefits, the benefits paid under the obligations that social services has under the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989, take-up rates are 38 per cent. for families and 21 per cent. for single people. Those figures may vary a bit, but similar orders of magnitude are likely to occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Are we to expect some people under the new system not even to take up what is on offer in terms of the cash assistance, but, in a similar way, to rely on the assistance of friends?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> That is what happened after 1996, and I anticipate that that is what will happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Are you not concerned that these people will be very marginalised and excluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> No. They will have a right to benefits in kind so there is no question of their going hungry. It may not be exactly where they want but then people who present themselves as homeless in this country have a right of residnce but are not given more than one offer. That offer is there. If people do not take up the offer of benefits in kind, we have to assume, I think correctly, that they have better facilities on offer from family or friends.
<P>
There are substantial support networks in this country for those who have come from countries where it is accepted that people have a genuine, well-founded fear of persecution. It should be borne in mind that if they come from, for example, the former Republic of Yugoslavia, and we can establish their identity, we process them as quickly as we can. It is the hard cases, those who are often frankly swinging the lead and who want to spin things out as long as possible, which cause problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Lastly, on support arrangements, you said in your document that you are comfortable setting the total payment at 70 per cent. of the income support level for various reasons, one of which is that it should be possible to live on those amounts for the short periods intended. We have just heard from people who work in Croydon, and others who are concerned, that you will not meet the targets that you have set yourself. Do you think that the system would be effective, both in terms of cost and the effects on the individuals concerned, if people continued to have to wait two or three years to have their claims processed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Let me deal with those points in turn. The current situation at Croydon is undoubtedly far from satisfactory. I can go into the reasons why it is so unsatisfactory if colleagues wish. We are working hard to make the situation satisfactory. Mr. O'Brien has visited Croydon&#151;not that a visit changes things by virtue of being ministerial but it certainly shows great concern&#151;on a number of occasions. I visited Croydon on 18 February. It also happens that I am going tomorrow. I should have gone last week but I had to make a statement in the House. I regard turning the situation around at Croydon as my most important management task as head of the Home Office, so does the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, David Omand. We are on the case.
<P>
There have to be improvements. More money is going into the service. The money budgeted for this year and last year was not satisfactory. We have tried to deal with some of the problems that emerged. For example, I discovered when I visited the adjudication centre at Hatton Cross that there were not sufficient presenting officers from the Home Office, which was going to jam up the adjudicating system. I managed to get those increased. More money is going in from 1 April. We remain committed to the targets. Only time will tell whether we meet them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will these arrangements be acceptable if people have to wait a few years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> At present people may be waiting two or three years, but one has to look at why they wait. Unlike any other area of our legal administrative system, the applicant in an asylum case has a vested interest in delay. People have to understand that. It is no good people going on about delays. The applicant who is here in this country and whose application is potentially to be regarded as abusive and therefore to be rejected has a vested interest in delay. That is not the case in almost any other field.
<P>
Take criminal justice: if you are a defendant, you almost always have an interest in having your case dealt with as quickly as possible as that means it is being dealt with fairly. If you have been convicted you certainly have every interest in ensuring that your appeal is dealt with quickly. The same is true, for example, in the social security and housing benefits systems. If a person's application for benefit is turned down, he wants the appeal dealt with as quickly as possible, because that puts you back to the status quo ante.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The problem with asylum seekers is that they do not want to be put back to the position of status quo ante because that would put them outside the country. What has happened, especially in the past 10 years, is that advisers to asylum seekers&#151;some perfectly responsible, some highly irresponsible, some criminal, some just taking chances and making money out of people's misery&#151;have worked out ways of exploiting delays in the system. That is true of many people in detention. One may say that it is terrible that someone is in detention for all that time, and, indeed, no one should be detained for longer than is necessary, but when one goes into the individual case, one finds that the reason that person has been detained for so long is because he is using every possible opportunity to avoid being removed or deported from the country. I understand that, although I do not approve of it.
<P>
We want to ensure that the system operates as speedily as possible, but if you want me to say that we will not start to operate the system until the delay is down to an average&#151;I stress that these are averages&#151;of two months and four months and that we suspend it the moment that the average goes up, the answer is no. We would need to discover why the average had gone up; the average will disguise quite a wide range of individual cases. More months may be taken than the average suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> I want to return to the issue of the proposed bond, or financial security system. I acknowledge that there is support for the proposal, especially from my constituents who are in the throes of disappointment when they hear that a relative has been refused entry clearance to attend a family wedding. Most people to whom I have spoken are relatively affluent and the proposal shows that the Government acknowledge and respond to that feeling.
<P>
However, on reflection, we must think carefully about the measure. I have two specific anxieties: first, the bond system is, by definition, inherently unfair to people on the lowest incomes, whether in this country as sponsors, or as potential visitors, and it may push people to seek unfavourable loans.
<P>
Secondly, depending on how the sytem is implemented, it has the potential to undermine and gradully to erode the integrity of immigration control. We all want a system in which the right, justifiable decisions are taken, including the decisions on refusals. If the system could be bypassed by putting up a guarantee or paying cash, it would be unhelpful and mean that the system would be seen in an unhelpful light. I should be interested in your further comments on how the new territory will be explored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Let me deal head on with whether the bond system inherently discriminates against people on low incomes: the answer is no more than the immigration rules generally. There is an economic test in the immigration rules. At one end of the scale, if you have more than &#163;1 million and you prove that you are of independent means you can come and settle in this country. At the other end of the scale, the rules on entry for marriage and for visitors require the applicant to show that he or she will be able to survive here without recourse to public funds. Public funds means non-contributory benefit. That is inherent in the system. There it is. There are good reasons why those rules are there and I do not propose to change them; they are to do with the prevention of economic migration and to ensure fairness among people in this country on the basis that if you want to bring someone in as a visititor or a fiance, it is your responsibility to ensure that they are properly financed, not the state's.
<P>
On the issue of unfavourable loans, I say that I doubt it. I have talked about the subject at great length with my Indian and Pakistani constituents, and it was they who made the suggestion. It is a constant refrain on Saturday morning in my surgeries, where they roll out all the facts of the visitor case. I have shared their frustration, particularly since 1993 when the appeals asylum system was abolished. I have written&#151;it has not made much difference whether I have done it before or after the election; there is no special treatment for being the Home Secretary when dealing with the Foreign Office, and I suppose that that is quite right. My letters have explained that I know the person concerned&#151;who I think will return for the reasons that I have given&#151;and requested another look at the case.
<P>
On most occasions, my representations fail. Perhaps that is because of the quality of my representations and my constituents need a better Member of Parliament. Each time, my constituent says to me, ``Why don't you go for a bond scheme? We are worth this much and are perfectly willing to stake &#163;5,000, or whatever it is, because we want to prove that we are honest and back our good faith with some money.'' I do not think that people will enter into unfavourable loans. However, we shall pilot the idea. We are being careful about it and if the plot turns out to be unsatisfactory we shall abandon it. However, then at least we shall have a proper answer to give our constituents, who until now have told us that they think that a bond scheme would work.
<P>
As for eroding the integrity of immigration control: no. The basic rules will be the same. An applicant will still have to satisfy the rules for visitors, the principal one having to do with whether the person will return at the end of the period&#151;as well as whether he or she will be a burden on public funds while here. Those elements will remain. We shall monitor the progress of the pilot with a view to avoiding those problems.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hall:</B> To follow up on that point, presumably the bond, security or guarantee would come into play only at the point when an entry clearance decision was heading for a refusal&#151;or perhaps, a refusal having been issued, someone would be offered the opportunity to change it by offering security. Is that what is envisaged?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> That may be one way of approaching it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> The way in which it is implemented will make an awful lot of difference to how it is perceived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Of course, but one of the crucial issues at present is whether there is enough money to support the relevant people; do they really have family here who will ensure that they comply with the undertakings that are given? If the family is willing to put up &#163;5,000, not as a surety but as security, so that it is up front&#151;and I plucked the figure of &#163;5,000 out of the air, by the way; I should probably say X thousand pounds&#151;to confirm that they are prepared to commit themselves in the person's favour, that factor should be weighed in the balance. Let us try it. We shall consult on how it will operate. We shall check the pilots. I think that it will work, but if it does not we shall not proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I should like to switch to another topic. I should like to know how the Home Secretary sees the Bill dealing with some of the undoubted problems with respect to the implementation of the Dublin convention and an asylum seeker's first safe country of arrival.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> The Dublin convention has been a problem. It was signed in 1990&#151;I am still trying to find out by whom. It is a bit like finding people to own up to the solution of the Schleswig-Holstein question. Do you know the answer to that one? There were reckoned to be three; one had emigrated, one had died and the other had gone mad. I think that the answer to the question as to who signed the Dublin convention might be the same.
<P>
The convention is causing problems and raises a very substantial issue&#151;that of the more effective transfer of asylum seekers who have come to this country and who, if they have travelled by land and sea will almost always have travelled through other EU countries; there is an issue of the facility with which we can return them to the EU country from which they came, or, in some cases, from which they originally or immediately came. I am exploring that with a number of EU Interior Ministers. Indeed, the week before last, I discussed that subject with Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the Minister of the Interior in France, when we examined French practice.
<P>
The associated issue is whether to adopt interpretations of our obligations under the 1951 convention that are similar to those adopted by, for example, Germany and France. We are examining such interpretations with care, because it does not make a huge amount of sense to use different, and in some cases wider, definitions than those that apply in France and Germany.
<P>
Different interpretations are used at the moment. That can lead to applicants who otherwise ought to be returned to, say, France or Germany, arguing that as their cases are dealt with on a wider basis in this country than in France or Germany, they should not be returned. That is despite the fact that we are all subject to the same obligations under the 1951 convention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): I have just three brief questions about Eurostar for the Home Secretary. Can you give us an up-to-date figure for asylum seekers entering the country on Eurostar? Are you considering recommendations concerning Eurostar?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Yes, I shall give you the figures in a moment, once one of these extremely efficient officials passes them over.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If you wish any of your officials to provide figures, you may ask them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> If they know the numbers off the top of their heads, thank you very much. I am not proud about this.
<P>
The figures were fairly high when I assumed my post as Home Secretary. I persuaded the then Minister of the Interior in Belgium, Mr. Van des Lanotte that we should impose carriers' liability on Eurostar trains from Brussels.
<P>
On the whole, that has been very effective. However, there has been a difficulty&#151;principally a legal one&#151;with regard to France, which concerns whether, under current treaty arrangements, we could impose carriers' liability through secondary legislation. I could go into the lengthy legal debate that took place about why it was felt that we could not introduce secondary legislation. It was felt that we could not introduce such legislation, because of provisions in the second GATT treaty.
<P>
I discussed the matter with my French counterpart. The French Government have been extremely helpful in improving controls at the Gare du Nord in Paris. However, there remain problems with people who travel as domestic passengers in France. Having bought a ticket from the Gare du Nord to Calais, such people stay on the train. Other people may get on at Lille or Calais. Controls on such passengers may not be as effective as they could be. We hope to resolve that matter. To secure that resolution and as an insurance backstop, I seek powers in the Bill to ensure that we can impose carriers' liability with regard to trains originating and terminating in France and Belgium.
<P>
I will ask Mr. Whalley to answer the question about the number of asylum seekers using Eurostar, as I cannot read his handwriting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Whalley </B>(Home Office): The number of people arriving on Eurostar with inadequate documentation is now several thousand a year. The number of those claiming asylum is high and is rising. The number arriving from France is now a significant proportion, with comparatively few coming from Belgium. A proportion of those claiming asylum have travelled on the domestic route mentioned by the Home Secretary, and is now about 70 per cent.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind witnesses not to touch the microphones, as they are controlled elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Like everything else.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You said it, Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> We can provide detailed figures later for the benefit of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> Do you see that that far outweighs the numbers coming in at the moment on ships, through ports and on unaccompanied trailers?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> No, it does not outweigh the numbers coming in through ports such as Dover, but we have to improve control at every point where we believe that it is falling down. Immigration control is principally about plugging the weakest defences. That has to be done. The imposition of carriers' liability from Belgium partly helped to ease the pressure on Eurostar through inadequately documented arrivals, particularly at Waterloo; but it also led to some transfer.
<P>
There can be little doubt that the introduction in the late 1980s of carriers' liability with respect to air flights improved enforcement. The introduction of more airline liaison officers at ports abroad where there were problems tightened control of air passengers and led to racketeers developing other routes. Up to now, the key alternative has been use of trucks and unaccompanied trailers. The Bill addresses part of that problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Witness after witness told us that cases need to be dealt with as quickly as possible. I am sure that we were already aware of that in relation to asylum cases. I imagine that you would agree that the speed at which asylum cases can be dealt with depends, among other factors, on the numbers applying and on efficiency.
<P>
On the first question about the pressure of numbers, I heard what you said about the pull of cash benefits and I am interested in your evaluation of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. You will recall that it took away benefits for some in-country asylum applicants. You have accepted that there was a reduction in the number of asylum applicants in the year immediately after that.
<P>
Without necessarily disagreeing with the principle of what you say about cash benefits, do you agree that it would be wise to take into account the pull of other factors such as the prospect of being able to settle permanently in the country in which asylum is applied for? Should we not also take into account the fact that, after the initial dip in the number of asylum applicants, there was a big increase? Last year we had a record number of applicants. Do we not, therefore, need to take account of factors other than cash pull?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Of course we do. I accept that. The overwhelming factor affecting asylum claims, which also affects the overall proportion of abusive and unfounded claims&#151;as well as well-founded ones&#151;is what goes on in terms of political stability in other countries in the world. A high level of instability in the former Republic of Yugoslavia and its surrounding territory will generate a large number of applications.
<P>
That phenomenon does not relate only to this country: it has affected other European countries&#151;in some cases to a much greater extent. Although in 1998 our numbers rose by about 40 per cent. over 1997, we are still 10th or 11th in Europe per head of population. It needs to be put into perspective.
<P>
Rolling back 10 or 11 years, we can see why there were so few applications for asylum. One of the paradoxical or deliberate consequences of the cold war was temporary political stability, not only in the countries of Europe but in the countries of Africa, interestingly, because those countries were clients of one or other of the great powers. If you look at how the numbers have changed, not only for the United Kingdom but for other European countries, it is directly related to the political instability that set in in Europe and then, indirectly, in other countries after the collapse of the Berlin wall. There is an overwhelming need, although we do not often talk about it in the context of the Home Office's responsibility for asylum and immigration. The more that we can do through foreign policy and aid policy to secure stability in countries that have experienced huge instability, the better it is, not only, obviously, for them, but, the better it is, indirectly but quite potently, in terms of the number of people who then apply for asylum.
<P>
Other pull factors could be mentioned. The prospect of permanent settlement may be a pull factor. I have not seen much evidence on that. Some countries favour temporary arrangements, so that if the country of origin returns to political stability, the person is liable to removal. That is consistent with the 1951 convention, and I am open to argument about that. The difficulty, however, is that often the country returns to stability of which you can be assured some years down the track, by which time the individual has put down roots in this country as a legitimate resident. Trying to say, ``You must up sticks and go back'', is therefore difficult. It is different if it is a matter of months rather than years.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> But, especially in the case of unfounded applications, as some obviously are, do you not accept that the ease with which they achieve a greater prospect of success in obtaining permanent settlement generates further unfounded applications?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> In discussing well-founded applications, we are dealing in tautology, because if they are well founded, they will be accepted, and the applicants will remain in this country in any event. Unfounded applications fall into two categories, although those categories are not exclusive. Many people are perfectly genuine. I can think of one constituency case of mine, of a Kenyan Asian, whose genuineness was beyond doubt, who had been the subject of violence in that country which was, however, insufficient to meet the tests set by the criteria of the 1951 convention. He had come to this country not for reasons of economic migration but out of fear. I helped him with his case. In the end I had to accept, and so did he, that it did not meet the convention criteria, and he went back to Kenya. As far as I know, he is okay.
<P>
There are also people who are abusive and who have invented or embroidered stories about whether they have been persecuted. They are often assisted by criminal organisations. They take a chance, coming here principally for reasons of economic migration. They see the benefits of a higher standard of living here, and, because of current delays in the system and how they can be exploited, reckon that in any event they may be able to string things out for several years. Of course that is a pull factor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Without necessarily disagreeing with your analysis of the composition of claims, our obligation is towards those with founded claims for asylum. Do you think that it is important to send out a strong message from this country that asylum claims will be judged strictly, that only those with well-founded claims will be granted permanent leave to remain, and that there will be no question of any future amnesties to include both those with unfounded claims and those with founded claims?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> There is no question of any previous amnesties, either. Let me make our obligations clear. Our obligations are not as you state, Mr. Clappison. Under the 1951 convention, our obligation is to consider the claim for asylum of anyone who claims asylum in this country. By definition, some of the people who claim asylum will make an unfounded application, for whatever reason, but we cannot make a judgment about that until we have considered the application. If our only obligation were to consider well-founded applications&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to split hairs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> This is not splitting hairs. There is a huge difference. If our obligations were confined only to thinking about applications from people whose cases were well founded, there would be many fewer. It is precisely because our obligation is to consider applications from those who seek asylum&#151;unless they come within the terms of the Dublin convention or other things&#151;that we have a problem, as do other countries.
<P>
I have tried to send out the clearest messages about wanting to speed up the system. Since you ask, I personally organised the return of a number of Kosovans who came to this country wrongly, having been in transit from Rome. I organised their return to Italy through direct personal negotiations with the then Minister of the Interior in Italy, Dr. Giorgio Napolitano. So I am extremely committed to sending out those messages. That is why we have tightened control as far as we can within existing law, and the reason that we are taking a raft of further powers of control in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that, but the obligation is to consider applications and then to grant asylum where a person has a well-founded claim because of persecution. I think you will agree that we do not want a large number of unfounded claims clogging the system.
<P>
On the system itself, you were asked about Lunar house, and you accepted that the situation there was very unsatisfactory&#151;indeed, chaotic&#151;with delays, long queues, people being unable to obtain documents and work permits, and passports going astray and so on. Clearly it is important that cases be dealt with as speedily as possible. You mentioned asylum targets, and your aims for handling cases in the time-frame of two months and six months, but those figures were set some time ago, since when matters at Lunar house have got worse. Do you think that there is a case for looking again at the targets, given the current problems?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> One difficulty was that we had to move from Lunar house because the lease was coming to an end. Operations have been transferred to the Whitgift centre. Two events took place&#151;I say this so that colleagues know what happened. First, an agreement was signed by Siemens in April 1996 to provide computerisation of most of the system, but delivery and implementation are well behind schedule. Secondly, we had to move people from Lunar house&#151;which, by the way, was a terrible building to work in&#151;to the Whitgift centre. During the transition&#151;with apologies to people of Irish extraction&#151;Murphy's law operated, with everything that could go wrong more or less doing so. However, people are now turning it around, but I greatly regret that the service has deteriorated so much.
<P>
We set the target of two months plus four months in advance of publication of the July 1998 White Paper. So far I have no evidence to persuade me to change the targets, which are most important. If there is evidence, obviously I shall look at it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We heard from the immigration unit before you came in that current applications for asylum are outstripping output and that even with additional staff as a result of the spending review they will continue to do so, and the backlog will get worse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Obviously I am aware of the current position. These changes had to take place at some time. I am happy to turn the Committee hearing into what happened in the past rather than what will happen in the future, but in terms of information about the Bill it would be better to avoid doing that. The changes had to be made. The computerisation contract was signed in April 1986, down the track: the lease had run out, and we had to move. As sometimes happens, although I greatly regret it, some of the other transitional changes did not occur smoothly, and there has been a considerable number of applications for asylum. However, we are already down that track.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the moment, weekly output is below what it was before the changes took place. The first target is to get weekly output back to where it was, and the second target is to get weekly output sufficiently higher than that, so that the backlog that was built up in the weeks since the transition can be made up. The third target is that set under the Bill. The milestones are being set and they will be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> You are saying that, notwithstanding the current state of affairs, you are content with the present targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I am saying that I have seen no evidence so far to make me change those targets. It is important that the targets are implemented as quickly as possible, something with which I do not think any member of the Committee will disagree. In future, if evidence is presented to me that says, ``Home Secretary, it is not possible to implement the targets for these reasons'', we shall look again at the matter. At the moment, however, we are not in that position.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Clappison, may I now move on? I shall come back to you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I wish to move to a different part of the Bill that changes the present appeal procedures&#151;not for asylum seekers, but for those who are overstayers or who are out of permission. Why has that been done? Why has no distinction been made between those who overstay because, for example, they think that they are staying legally, and those who are clearly trying to obstruct the system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> With great respect, there is a distinction. People who are lawfully present when they appeal will be able to exercise the right of appeal in this country. If they are here as visitors or students and apply within due time for an extension but are refused, they can appeal. If they are here unlawfully, they do not have an appeal in this country. They have to go back to the country from whence they came and make their appeal there. I think that that is fair.
<P>
Let me cite a typical example of the cases that I experience in my constituency surgery. Let us consider someone who comes to the country as a visitor or someone who is here wholly legally and then decides to enter into a marriage and wants to use that as the basis for remaining here. That amounts to an evasion of the controls that 99 per cent. of my constituents' families in India or Pakistan are ready to accept. There is no reason why we should facilitate an abuse of the arrangements, and I say to such people that they must go back and that, if they put in an application in Islamabad or Bombay, it will be properly considered and that I shall ensure that it is.
<P>
I tell my constituents that I will not have them enter into an arrangement, basically for queue jumping and that I do not accept such behaviour. On the whole, they acknowledge what I am saying and take my advice. That is the sort of arrangement that I want. We must bear in mind that we must have a system which is fair&#151;as between people in countries abroad who are applying to exercise their rights under the immigration rules and who accept how the rules operate, and those who try to get around them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> At the moment, when someone is being deported, we allow an appeal. When someone has been in the country for more than seven years, he will be allowed a full appeal, whereas under the Bill he will in future be subject to administrative removal. Is there not a danger that all that that will acehive is that people will then apply for asylum, and unfounded asylum applications will be generated because that will be a route to an appeal?
<P>
Let us consider someone who has been in the country for a significant number of years. How will compassionate circumstances be taken into account, because it seems that the person could get in an asylum claim and then try to appeal on human rights grounds?

<P>

<B>Mr. Straw:</B> First, compassionate circumstances are not in the rules and are taken into account through representation to Ministers. They are not taken into account directly at the tribunal appeal against deportation.
<P>
Secondly, I have examined the argument that denying the right of appeal means going down the over-formal route of deportation rather than administrative removal and that that will generate asylum cases. I do not accept that. In many asylum cases, certainly in the past, individuals have been put up to it. There is a substantial industry out there that has become adept at exploiting this country's system of immigration asylum.
<P>
My third point is that, under clause 56(4) of the Bill, we have anticipated such matters. [Interruption.] I have just been advised that what I have said is wrong and that ``compassionate circumstances'' is in the rules for deportation under paragraph 364 (vii) of the immigration rules.
<P>
Clause 54(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If an applicant claims asylum after the end of the period prescribed under section 55(4)(b), no appeal may be made under this Part against the refusal of that claim if the Secretary of State has certified that in this opinion the claim for asylum was made solely for the purpose of delaying the removal from the United Kingdom of the applicant or of any member of his family.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have been much firmer in terms of a one-stop shop for appeal. That is essential, because that more than anything else has been exploited.
<P>
I guess that each of us has had constituents who have run three or four appeals, particularly against a background of the unique consideration in respect of asylum applicants when it is in the interests of the applicants to delay a final decision. We know that that is the case, and we are saying to applicants, ``When you first make your appeal, you must make it clear what your grounds for appeal are.'' If much later down the track at the point of removal, they say, ``By the way, I want to claim asylum,'' prima facie they are doing that solely on the grounds of trying to avoid removal and the Secretary of State will so certify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I understand perfectly well why we should go for one-stop appeals and try to get everything dealt with in one go. At present, someone who has an appeal against a deportation order can in the process put forward a case on compassionate grounds. If that is to disappear, I am afraid that we will end up with more and more cases going for judicial review, or more and more cases of compassionate grounds being taken to Members of Parliament and then referred to Ministers. I do not want us to be swamped with more such cases. I would rather see a mechanism under the law that allows those hard cases to be examined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I understand the case that you are making, although my judgment is different. I have thought carefully about the matter, but I am willing to think more about it. On balance, it is better that there should not be a right of appeal against removal decisions. We should bring the provisions for those who have had permission but who have then overstayed into line with existing provisions in respect of wholly illegal people who never had permission to stay in the first place and who are already liable for removal. In making that judgment, I have taken account of the fact that although some illegals apply for asylum, most do not. I take your point, Mr. Gerrard, that you are aiming for the same target as I am, and I am willing to continue to review that. I am open to argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I have one final, quick point on the transition to the support system. I have had a quick look at the booklet issued today, paragraph 5.14 of which states that the Government could not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consider transferring immediately to the new support system all those who are already receiving support''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
&#151;both local authority support and people who are on benefits currently&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``when the new arrangements begin.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It states that they could not all be transferred into the new system in one go, so there will be a phased implementation. Does that imply that amendments will be tabled to the Bill during its passage through Parliament? As I read the Bill, it is quite clear cut, but at the point at which the new support systems come into place, the powers to provide the existing support disappear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Eagle </B>(Home Office): On 1 April 2000, a number of people will be in receipt of income support and housing benefit, and a number of people will be supported by local authority social services departments. Depending on the assumptions that you make, there could be up to 30,000 or 40,000 in that category. It would be unrealistic to suppose that on one day they could be brought in to the new support arrangements. We will have to ensure that there will be transitional arrangements in the Bill to enable us either to phase in that arrangement or to transfer people to the new support system if their cases have not been dealt with within a responsible time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> So there are likely to be some amendments on the subject?
<P>
<B>Mr. Eagle:</B> I would think so, yes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): My questions arise from evidence given in the second and third sittings. My first question is on the thinking behind part II of the Bill, which focuses on carriers' liability. It sets out some extremely draconian sanctions that can be taken against firms that are found to be transporting clandestine immigrants. What is the first thing that a smuggler of, shall we say, drugs does to his illicit cargo when he fears that it is about to be discovered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I cannot speak for smugglers; I have no experience of smuggling myself.
<P>
They are firm sanctions; they are not draconian, which is a word that is often used rather loosely. It is worth bearing in mind that Draco was a chief magistrate in Athens in the 7th century BC. His name is recorded for posterity because he saw capital punishment as the appropriate sanction for virtually every crime, including small things such as dropping sweet papers on the street.
<P>
I do not regard the sanctions in the Bill as draconian. I regard them as tough but proportionate to the problem.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> If you cannot answer for drugs smugglers, I suspect most people round this table could. They would tell you, even if you cannot tell us, that the first thing that a carrier of illicit cargo does when there is a danger of that cargo being discovered is dump it overboard if he is on a ship, or otherwise get rid of it as quickly as possible.
<P>
During the second sitting it was put to Anne Owers of Justice that there was a real risk that if a lorry driver found that he had inadvertently been carrying a family of illegal immigrants and knew that the penalty could be the confiscation of his vehicle&#151;it might, for all we know, be the vehicle on which his business was entirely dependent&#151;there would be a huge risk of his doing something very violent towards the people who were stowed away. Anne Owers of Justice thought that that was a real risk. Do you agree with her?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I do not agree with her. What we want, above all, is to have in place the proper procedures, which are spelt out in clause 20, to ensure that, as far as is humanly possible, bona fide hauliers do not end up carrying clandestines. We are proposing an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants and providing defences around the provision of such an effective system. As you know, Mr. O'Brien has had a number of discussions with the haulage industry. We are seeking better checks at ports such as Zeebruge, Ostend and Calais, which are the trans-shipment ports for entry into this country.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
May I say, Dr. Lewis, that in another life you would have been writing briefs justifying carriers' liability for the Conservative research department, of which you were a distinguished deputy director. That liability was introduced in 1987 by the previous Government. It has worked successfully. This is an extension of the similar principle.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> If we are going to be personal about this&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that you are not, either of you.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I am not; as you will see.
<P>
I have considerable sympathy with what you are trying to do in the Bill. However, in this respect, you are going seriously wrong. As I hope will emerge from my line of questioning, I believe that you should be putting emphasis elsewhere&#151;on other measures in the Bill, and not on this one, which I think is dangerous.
<P>
If you are to have an effective system that will ensure that carriers do not unwittingly end up carrying illegal immigrants, why do you need these potentially crippling sanctions against the carriers? They could put tremendous temptation in the way of the lorry drivers&#151;I hope that, in most cases, they would resist it&#151;to do something drastic to get rid of their unwelcome cargo.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> You can change people's behaviour by a combination of codes and good practice, but also by sanctions. May I give an example, before people get it out of proportion?
<P>
There has been a very substantial improvement in road traffic enforcement in this country, and an improvement in road safety, not least because of the use of fixed penalties, which involve what is tantamount to an absolute liability if, anywhere in central London, you park your vehicle on a yellow line or you do not fill in a parking voucher correctly. People are routinely placed in a situation where their vehicle is towed away, and they can get it back only by paying &#163;150 or &#163;165 for one infraction. People accept that. The introduction of those sanctions has changed their behaviour. It is quite easy to avoid paying &#163;165 by not parking on a yellow line and making sure that your parking voucher is in order.
<P>
We are not seeking money; we want it to result in far fewer clandestines coming in. We are seeking to change the behaviour of hauliers and the haulage industry. Through a combination of the sort of constructive discussions that Mr. O'Brien and Dr. Reid at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have had and the sanctions, we should secure that.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> We are certainly agreed on the fact that the sanctions are likely to change the behaviour of carriers. I suggest that they will change it in the same way that they changed the behaviour of ships' captains when encountering boat people off the coast of Vietnam. Once sanctions were brought, the captains refused to pick up refugees; they were at the point of death, and they died. I suggest that you are going to get some terrible cases as a result of this change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I do not think that there is any evidence of that. The standards of behaviour in western Europe are very different from those that apply in the South China sea. I simply do not think that that will arise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Clappison, you wanted to ask a question on this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I cannot let go your comment about the introduction of carriers' liability by the previous Government. If my recollection is correct, it was not greeted with acclaim by the present Government when they were in opposition.
<P>
However, putting that to one side, do you not accept that there is a fundamental difference between passengers being carried by airlines, which have the opportunity to check their passengers' documents and so forth, and individual lorry drivers transporting goods across the Channel and dealing with clandestine entrants? There is a very big difference between them. Carriers' liability for lorry drivers was not introduced by the previous Government, was it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> As a matter of fact, it was not introduced by the previous Government; but as I introduced the rerunning of the clock, you are right to say that we opposed it. In opposition, we tried to learn from one or two of our mistakes&#151;that may account for the fact that we are now in government. You never know, the same process could be followed by your party.
<P>
You say that there is a fundamental difference between carriers' liability for air passengers and carrier's liability for clandestines in trucks. I do not accept that. There is a difference but I do not think that it is fundamental. There difference is: should carriers of goods or of passengers be penalised if, by failing to exercise the kind of due diligence that is laid out in part II of the Bill, they allow a situation to occur where people who do not have a right of entry into this country are none the less brought into it? That is the situation with the airlines; the truth is that carriers' liability has led to a change of behaviour by airlines and they are much more careful in who they take. Indeed, that is one reason why we have problems with clandestines.
<P>
This answers your second point, not on whether the previous Government went down this route, which plainly they did not, but on whether they would have done. I suspect that they would have done and the reason is that the more successful other measures of control, such as carriers' liability on airlines, are, the more attractive the remaining loopholes&#151;which then have to be filled&#151;become. I do not think that that is unreasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If I could come back to you on that point; as I recollect, the argument against carriers' liability as it was originally imposed was that it made no distinction between bogus and genuine claimants. I shall not make that point against you now, but what incentive do you think there is for an individual lorry driver&#151;such as those we have been hearing today&#151;who on arrival in this country discovers a clandestine entrant in his vehicle, to co-operate and reveal the existence of that clandestine entrant when that driver will face very considerable questioning and have to prove that he is innocent and that he acted with all due diligence? Do you think that that creates an incentive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I think that there is every incentive because, leaving aside the issue of duress&#151;which plainly has to be a total defence&#151;an incentive is given in clause 20 of the Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is a defence for the carrier to show that&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that a clandestine entrant was, or might be, concealed in the transporter;
<P>
(b) an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants was in operation in relation to the transporter; and
<P>
(c) that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>As you will know, Mr. Clappison, under clause 19, there will be a code of practice which, which it is not required by the clause, will almost certainly be the subject of consultation with the haulage industry before it is brought into force to underpin the clause. Under the code, carriers who happen to find themselves in a situation where they have brought somebody in inadvertently, having complied with the provisions of clause 23&#151;including the code&#151;will not suffer a penalty. So that is the incentive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gwyn Prosser </B>(Dover): Home Secretary, in chapter 6, on education, of your information document, ``Asylum Seekers' Support'', you make the point that children of asylum seekers&#151;whether genuine asylum seekers or people who are making abusive or fraudulent claims&#151;should be supported with education. We would all support that. It goes on to say that it will be a matter for the local education authority to decide suitable provision. In earlier evidence from Kent county council&#151;albeit from its social services director&#151;the point was raised that because asylum seeker children are sometimes transient, passing through the area and spending a short time in the country, and because it would be a better use of language support resources, those children should be educated in a class or an institute of their own. That raises all the unhappy scenarios of apartheid, separation and inclusion, but that cause was being fought from a practical point of view.
<P>
Kent county council went on to make the point that because the Bill will effectively reduce the time even further, that is how it would progress matters. What is your view of those issues?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> We are obviously willing to consider representations from education authorities, including Kent. May I say that Kent county council has had to bear a phenomenal burden, as indeed has Dover district council? We are grateful to Kent county council social services, the education department, and the housing department in Dover and other districts. It was partly because of representations from local authorities within Kent that we introduced the Bill and proceeded with interim arrangements.
<P>
You are right to say that the sort of arrangements that can be made for education will be influenced partly by how long the child will be in the area. That is critical. If a child is going to be there for only two or six months, in practice, very different considerations have to apply than they do now in respect of a child who is going to be around for a year or so.
<P>
I do not accept the argument used against Kent that making separate provision for the short-term applicants would amount to some sort of apartheid. I recall having a group of Bosnian Muslims in my constituency in 1991&#151;and I believe that they are still there. Initially, the arrangements for their schooling were made outside the formal education system, partly for language reasons. Once they had got up to speed with the language and it became clear that they would be accepted for settlement, arrangements were then made to put them into mainstream schooling. No one suggested that the first arrangements were a form of apartheid: they were sensible practical arrangements to deal with a practical problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> On something completely different&#151;carriers' liability&#151;I am glad that Dr. Lewis did not pursue his comparisons of the effects of sanctions much further because we were in danger of him forecasting that a cross-channel ferry will stop in mid-channel and discharge a container full of illegal immigrants. None of us will have any truck with that. I am glad, as I said, that that point was not pursued further.
<P>
There remain some concerns about carriers' liability. Most of us would support the need for a firm sanction, but it needs to be seen to be distributed fairly between the various carriers&#151;the airlines, the truckers and the ferries. Presently, an airline carrying people without proper documentation may have to pay a &#163;2,000 fine and return them to their country of origin&#151;probably by their own airline, which is practical and sensible.
<P>
In some circumstances, cross-channel ferry companies have to fly illegals back to their country of origin, rather than ship them back to Calais, which would be more practical, simpler and cheaper. That is regarded by the industry as an unfair apportionment of sanctions: in other words, there are disproportionate&#151;a word used in reply to Dr. Lewis&#151;sanctions imposed on one carrier as opposed to another. Is there room to look at that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whalley:</B> I know that the immigration service regularly discusses those questions with the carriers, but I am afraid that I cannot tell you the detail of the arrangements. It is always possible to waive the charge in a particular case, but I do not know what to say about the detailed arrangements for the case that you have in mind. I know that the ferry companies feel that they are discriminated against in that sense. We will ask the immigration service to look into that and see whether anything more can be discussed with the ferry operators, if that would be helpful.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have half an hour left and I want the four Committee members who have not yet asked questions to be able to do so. If there is then time, we shall return to the others.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I am sorry that I was not here for your opening remarks; I was in the Chamber listening to David Blunkett's statement on education in the city. I want to return to the question of support arrangements, which, as you know, have caused much concern. I think that most of the submissions that you received on the subject were sceptical. I am well aware of the justification for withdrawing benefits; I have heard it explained very eloquently by your colleague, Mr. O'Brien, so you need not rehearse it with me.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to ask you three specific questions&#151;the first is about transitional arrangements; the second is about the cash sums that are proposed in the document and the third is about inspecting the accommodation that is provided. On the transitional arrangements, I am concerned that in Hackney many thousands of asylum seekers in receipt of benefits are settled in council accommodation and their children are settled in schools. Am I right in thinking that, as your transitional arrangements kick in, thousands&#151;there are thousands in a community such as Hackney&#151;of settled asylum seekers will lose their benefit, housing benefit and council accommodation and that they will have to take their children out of school and be dispersed, no one knows where?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Shall we deal with each question in turn?
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The second issue is about the sum of money that you propose to pay. Looking at the document, on top of benefits in kind, you propose to pay 50p a day for children under 18, &#163;1 a day for adults and &#163;1 a day for children under three. I have a seven-year-old child. I am trying to think how I would meet his cash requirements on 50p a day. I understand that they will get free school meals, but bus fares and school uniforms will be given at the discretion of the local authority.
<P>
I cannot envisage how asylum-seeker mothers&#151;bogus or not&#151;will pay their children's school fares, give them pocket money and so on, on 50p a day. I understand that paying such very low sums is intended to act as a disincentive, but is it really necessary to make mothers try to cover their children's day-to-day needs on 50p a day?
<P>
The final point is about accommodation. I have only just seen the document, so I am willing to be corrected, but I understand that you want people to tender to provide this accommodation. You are placing an emphasis on people who can provide a package&#151;including accommodation and so on&#151;and you are also looking for the lowest possible unit cost. Given the background of what has happened&#151;certainly in the east end of London&#151;with the private sector trying to provide accommodation at low cost, what arrangements is the Home Office making to inspect the accommodation provided for asylum seekers?

<P>
I am well aware that you and your colleagues think that asylum seekers will be in that accommodation only for a matter of months, but if weeks turn into months, and six months turn into 12 months, it will be very important to have some sort of inspection, because the emphasis on low unit cost will present a temptation for people to provide accommodation that is not necessarily of the quality that you and I would want our children to be brought up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I shall ask Mr. Eagle to comment on some of the details of the transitional arrangements. The figures given are correct: &#163;1 a day for adults, 50p a day for children. That is in paragraph 4.21. However, the allowance in respect of children aged under three years will be &#163;7 a week.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I should think so because they need disposable nappies, and they are quite pricey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I know that they are pricey. I used to know the price of them&#151;but they are certainly pricey.
<P>
The important point is that this is a subsistence system. There is no dubiety about that. It is designed as a short-term subsistence system. We judge that that is perfectly adequate for genuine asylum seekers fleeing persecution that can be established within convention criteria. It is our hope and expectation&#151;based on our record over getting on for two years&#151;that we shall recognise the claims of people in that situation as quickly as possible. However, we do not want to provide an incentive for people with highly arguable or abusive cases to remain in the system longer than necessary for their case to be judged fairly. That is why we have set the figures we have. With respect to you, Ms Abbott, I do not accept that your examples of your subsistence needs, or those of long-term residents in your constituency, are comparable with what we think of&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> With respect to you, Home Secretary, whether a person is a long-term or short-term mother in Hackney, she must pay her bus fares&#151;my son's are 80p a day and we do not live very far from his school&#151;she must buy her children sweets and give them money for after-school clubs. Schoolchildren have certain minimum needs and on 50p a day some mothers will not be able to pay their children's bus fares to school.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is a question, Ms Abbott. I think that we should like to hear the answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> That is your point of view, Ms Abbott. I have a different one. I shall ask Mr. Eagle to make one or two other points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eagle:</B> On the first point about transitionals, I had explained&#151;I am not sure whether you were back in the Room, Ms Abbott&#151;that we would not attempt to move all the people who would be receiving income support or support from local authority social services into the new scheme on one day. Some phased transitional arrangements would be necessary. However, our current thinking is that although people may be moved from income support to the new scheme, we would be unlikely to try to move families with children well established in schools to a completely different part of the country.
<P>
As to cash, a factual example may help. A family of four&#151;two adults and two children under 16&#151;would have a spending power of &#163;90.80 a week, of which &#163;21 would be in cash and the rest in kind or in vouchers. The total package would amount to accommodation, which would be furnished and with utensils; utility bills paid separately&#151;that is gas, electricity, water and council tax&#151;and on top of that some spending power, amounting, depending on where the family might be in the country, to about &#163;9,000 a year. With regard to inspection, clause 75 of the Bill requires that accommodation must be adequate. We shall require anyone who provides accommodation under contract to ensure that it is of appropriate quality. It will be a role of the Asylum Support Directorate to inspect accommodation and to ensure that the contract is fulfilled.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Did you say that the local authority would have that responsibility to inspect? I did not hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eagle:</B> No, I said that the Asylum Support Directorate&#151;which will be a Home Office directorate within the immigration department&#151;would have responsibility for ensuring that contracts were properly fulfilled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Secretary of State, I should like to follow on from Ms Abbott's line of questioning. Clause 76 of the Bill has been almost universally criticised by almost all the witnesses&#151;in particular the idea that preferences not only should not, but must not, be given consideration by you. What was the thinking behind that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> On the issue of universal criticism, it is probably true that those who have come before you and written to you have been critical of clause 76 and other aspects of the Bill. That is in the nature of the present process, and does not for a second mean that there is universal criticism of the provision. It may turn out to be highly popular. We have tried broadly to replicate the arrangements for people who are homeless but lawfully resident here, whereby people have one offer of accommodation and no more.
<P>
If we are saying in the abstract that we want to set up a system that is not only fairer and faster, but firmer, we have to do that in detail, too. That is one aspect of it. In terms of running such a system, it would be extremely difficult if people could say, ``We are not willing to go there and we want to go here and we are going to refuse this offer.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> For the second time&#151;the first time was in answer to Mr. O'Brien&#151;you have fairly summarily dismissed the nine hours of evidence we have heard. The Committee decided which witnesses to call and we have found those witnesses extremely impressive and very knowledgeable. The vast majority of those witnesses are involved in delivering the system in some way. Indeed, many of them are subsidised by the Government.
<P>
The London representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees talked about how a second-class group of children was being created by the dispersal and the support system. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``those children are denied equality in the playground and are pointed at as the voucher children. We regard that as fundamentally unacceptable and even inhumane.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 143.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have heard trenchant criticism of this part of the Bill from the Refugee Council and very moving criticism from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. You would do well to listen to that evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I did not summarily dismiss the evidence. I tried to put it into context, which is a very different thing. If you want to mix it, Mr. Faber, I ask you to bear in mind the fact that we suggested holding a Special Standing Committee on the previous Bill, and that was summarily rejected by the previous Government. Had there been a process of this kind, in which the previous Government had been willing to bring out all these things and to publish detailed consultative documents, the lacunae in the 1996 Act might not have arisen.
<P>
Under the 1996 Act, wholly different from this Bill, the Government intended that those who applied in country had no support at all: no support in cash or in kind and no bed to sleep on. That was one of the reasons that we voted against that Bill. It was certainly inhumane. Let us be clear about that.
<P>
The written evidence of the UNHCR representative and her spoken comments are completely disconnected. The written evidence seemed pretty sensible. I am not sure why she came to the view expressed in her oral comments, but it seemed to be based not on fact but rather on an exaggerated view of the Bill.
<P>
As for voucher children, there has been provision in our law at least since 1948 for some people who are in need to be given support in kind. That is the whole purpose of the National Assistance Act 1948. That has applied to asylum seekers since 1996. I have not heard of that criticism since then. If you want to refer to particular evidence from Hope Hanlan, I have it in front of me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> No. I should like just to ask two further quick questions, following directly on the issue of voucher children. Replying to Ms Abbott a moment ago, you said that it was her point of view but that you had a different point of view which you did not elaborate. I wonder what you feel the extra 50p a day that a mother will receive for a three-year-old rather than a four-year-old might be spent on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I did elaborate my point of view. My point of view is that these provisions, taken as a whole, which may include not only accommodation and services but a voucher for food and other essentials, are adequate. People may disagree about that but that is my judgment.

<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Finally, you have now referred twice to the 1996 Act and the fact that you would have liked to have had a Special Standing Committee on that and your belief that some of the problems of that Act might thus have been avoided. I assume therefore that you expect this Bill to be amended.

<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> That is a fair assumption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> And you will look kindly on non-Government amendments, will you not? We have listened to nine hours of experts' evidence&#151;we might expect to have one or two amendments.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Just hang on a second, Mr. Faber; you have the mindset of the previous Administration.
<P>
Since becoming Secretary of State, I judge amendments to every Bill that I have dealt with on their merit. I do not judge amendments on the people who tabled them. If you reflect on the Human Rights Act 1998, you will remember that we accepted the spirit of a number of Liberal Democrat amendments. We also accepted the spirit of a number of Conservative amendments, especially on fast tracking. Mr. Clappison will remember that. It is ridiculous to deny the merits of an amendment, purely on account of who has moved it. I have never sought to do that.
<P>
You said that a number of organisations have given evidence and that they are all subsidised by the Government. The Government supports a number of organisations, but we make no requirement that, because we support them, they must come here and give evidence in our favour; quite the reverse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I understand, and I was not suggesting that.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): I apologise for the emergency which kept me away from the Committee earlier.
<P>
Evidence from Save the Children, UNICEF and the Children's Society points to considerable anxiety about clause 99, which excludes asylum-seeking children from section 17 of the Children Act 1989 and section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
<P>
I would like clarification on the separation of a child's needs and those of her family. That must necessarily cause considerable logistical problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eagle:</B> The underlying principle of clause 99 is to do one thing only: that is, to remove an obligation on local authority social services departments to look after families solely because the children would otherwise be destitute. Clause 99 does not remove any other obligations under the Children Act. If it does not achieve that, then we would wish to bring forward amendments. The only reason that that provision is in the Bill is that there is an alternative, which is to come and receive support from the Asylum Support Directorate. However, social services may continue to make interventions for children of asylum seekers that they normally make for other children.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> But is not that in breach of some of the conventions on children's rights to which we have signed up, as it will treat asylum-seeking children differently from other children in Britain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Eagle:</B> No. The families will have the means not to be destitute, as they may be supported by the Asylum Support Directorate. Therefore, there is no need for local authorities to provide support under the Children Act. That does not deny anyone rights under international conventions, as we will provide support to families.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> On that point, I must support the view that 50p for a child between the ages of 3 and 18 is inconsistent with a parent's ability to protect that child's welfare. I feel quite strongly that that puts asylum seekers and their children in an unfair position. Today, I was speaking to a Labour Member of Parliament who told me that her son was at a school in Westminster&#151;that might narrow down the woman to whom I may be referring. That Westminster school has 80 per cent. asylum speakers. Jack, I am sure you know who I am talking about.
<P>
The Member of Parliament said that since January she has spent &#163;23 on requests from the school, which is attended by very deprived children. The Government's general attitute towards child benefit is exceptionally generous: there has just been an increase which is huge in comparison with those made under previous Governments. I therefore hope that we might follow that line, perhaps in reviewing the 50p payment that has been suggested.
<P>
How will the detention of children in adult prisons be dealt with under the Bill? Will an assurance be given that, if the age of a child is disputed&#151;for example, between the ages of 16 and 18&#151;he or she will not be kept in an adult prison or a detention centre until his or her age is confirmed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Detention is very rarely used for children. The only time when it could even be described as being used routinely is when, for example, unaccompanied children arrive late at night and it is simply impossible to make arrangements with social services. Establishing the ages of asylum seekers is a severe problem. Many people&#151;I have gone through the case files&#151;have developed what can only be described as a new scam: they are plainly in their 20s or 30s, but they claim to be 16 or 17. That presents severe problems. There have been stories in the newspapers of people claiming to be children when, in fact, they are not.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> Surely, is not the view of a paediatrician or another qualified medical person needed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> If only it were that easy. If we could ask the horse doctor to look at the teeth, which is what you are suggesting, it would not be a problem. If 20 or 30 people present themselves as being 17&#151;in some cases they might be 21 or 22; the margin may be small&#151;it can be difficult to establish their age, especially if they have no documents, which, typically, they do not. They will then say, or some organisations will say on their behalf, that it is outrageous that the Government are detaining people who are under-age, when the truth is that they are not under-age, but we are not able to establish that. That is another reason why we cannot state in the Bill that, in those circumstances, we cannot detain anyone who claims to be under the age of 18, otherwise effective control would end, I am afraid.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock </B>(Wyre Forest): We have had many representations from children's organisations. Following on from what Ms King said, can we have your assurance that, as you understand the legal structure of the Bill, the same procedures and protection will be available to the children of asylum seekers as are available to families that are legally resident in Britain if social services departments believe that there is a need to intervene because of suspected sexual or physical abuse, or for any other reason?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> We have been very careful. The duties of social services in respect of children arise regardless of the immigration status of the children, and we do not propose to change that.
<P>
I have just received a note to say that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has told us that it is extremely difficult to narrow down the age range of a person who is in his or her late teens or early 20s. I think that publicans say the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Home Secretary, you signed the Bill off as being compatible with the European convention on human rights under the Human Rights Act 1998; yet in our excellent evidence-taking sittings, we have heard from legal experts who had signifcant doubts about various aspects of the Bill. I take it that a full, written analysis of compatibility issues was prepared for you before signing the Bill off? Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I received legal advice. I shall anticipate your next question. If you ask my to publish the legal advice, the answer is no. There is a very good reason for that, which has always been accepted even by the most enthusiastic supporters of freedom of information. It is that Ministers and Government must have the same right to receive confidential legal advice as anyone else. It is a matter of legal professional privilege. It has always been accepted that the advice of Law Officers and other legal advisers to Ministers is confidential. However, I can tell you, Mr. Allan, that I signed the certificate after careful consideration and on advice. After all, I am on the line on this&#151;no one else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Having declined to publish the advice, will you comment on one specific aspect? Under clause 101, you will have the right to appoint anyone to enter any accommodation that is used to support asylum seekers. The statement of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association was absolutely clear. It believes that that is flagrant breach of article 8 of the ECHR, on the right to private life, and probably article 14, on anti-discrimination as well. That must have escaped your notice, and it directs you to the judgment Macleod v. United Kingdom. Do you have any comment on that, specifically in respect of clause 101, which astounded a lot of us and certainly astounded the ILPA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I shall ask Mr. Hudson to comment on that in detail, but we intend to amend it. I say to Mr. Faber that this is one example&#151;I hope that there will be others&#151;where the process is working. It seems to me that this is a better way of scrutinising a complex Bill than the way that I got all too familiar with, where the evidence came in, but came in on paper and with external meetings where people like me were not subject to this kind of questioning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hudson:</B> Just to confirm that it is not intended that the clause should apply to any properties other than those provided by the Asylum Support Directorate&#151;if the clause goes wider than that, it needs to be restricted&#151;or that it should be used for ordinary management purposes. Only if there were a significant problem&#151;if, say, the property were empty or there were real concern about it being misused&#151;would such a power need to be used. Normally, one would rely on the ordinary management law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> But you will go back and look at these kinds of areas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> Any that are raised. I want to make sure that my certificate stands the test of time.

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> On the European convention on human rights, I would like to say in passing that when I was a Minister, my understanding was that legal advice when there was a legal case could remain confidential, but that legal advice on why something was lawful could be shared with Parliament. But I leave that to the Secretary of State to think about.
<P>
On the evidence from the Medical Foundation for the Care of the Victims of Torture&#151;a totally different switch of thought&#151;there was some discussion on whether there were places outside London where there was perhaps a concentration of the kind of help available from volunteers and part-timers. If the Home Secretary is not satisfied that there is such a concentration elsewhere, is it possible that codes of practice that forced dispersal would not apply to those who might be properly regarded as victims of torture?
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I shall certainly think about that point, Mr. Bottomley. I would like more time in which to think about it. We are trying to establish clusters around the country. It is not in anybody's interest to have people fetch up in a particular town where they know nobody and where there is no system of support. There may be the odd isolated case that ends up like that, but it is not in anyone's interest. I know that you know this, but there is a world outside London, and the implication that there are not proper systems of support outside London is something that I do not accept.
<P>
I mentioned earlier that my constituency accepted a number of Bosnian refugees in the early 1990s. People might at first blush think that it was slightly odd that some Bosnians ended up in Blackburn, but if they are Bosnian Muslims, that is not a daft idea at all. There was tremendous support given by the Indian and Pakistani Muslims to the Bosnian Muslims who came in, and one could see that happening again, albeit in different circumstances.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Dr. Lewis, do you want to say something?
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> If there is time, Mr. Maxton, thank you.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There may be time for a question but perhaps not for a reply.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Briefly, I should like to draw the Home Secretary's attention to a little testimony given at the end of the third sitting by the chair of the Refugee Working Party, Mr. Kawani. I thought that it was revealing that he stated that he himself had come to this country because he was in fear of his life and his liberty; when he was asked if it would have made any difference to whether he had wanted to come here if he had had difficult conditions to put up with when he got there, he said that no, it would not have made a scrap of difference. Yet he then went on to testify that he was afraid that the measures would turn away a lot of other would-be asylum seekers. Does that not go to the heart of the problem, that if someone is really in danger in that way, they will want to come? If people are going to be deterred by some of the traditions that they find when they are here, perhaps they are not in as great a danger as they claim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Straw:</B> I think that you are right about that, if I may say so. If people are genuine and really have suffered, as you say, intense persecution, under the terms of the convention it seems to me wholly improbable that they will not find the perfectly civilised provision that we are making amenable. I am afraid it came through the evidence of the UNHCR representative that she has plainly not properly understood the extent of abusive claims that occur in this and other European countries and the fact that people invent not only claims, but identities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank you, Secretary of State, for attending; I also thank your adviser. As this is the end of the evidence sessions, can I also thank members of the Committee for the self-discipline and forbearance with which they have conducted themselves. The Committee has gone extremely well. As we move to the next stage of the Bill, these evidence sessions will prove to have been extremely useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): We should like to thank you for your chairmanship of this Committee, Mr. Maxton.
