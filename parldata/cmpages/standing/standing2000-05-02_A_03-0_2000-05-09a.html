<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Promotion of well-being</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 110, in Clause 2, page 2, line 10, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A charge may be imposed in respect of anything which<P>
</UL></FONT>
is done in the course of exercising the power under section
2(1).'.-[Mr. Waterson.]

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 94, in page 2, line 19, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) recover all reasonable costs in exercising the power.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 95, in Clause 3, page 2, line 30, at the beginning insert ``Subject to section 2(4)(g),''.

<P>
No. 3, in Clause 3, page 2, line 30, leave out subsection 2, and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The expenditure of a local authority under this Part in any financial year shall not exceed the amount obtained by applying the relevant provisions of subsections (4), (4AA), (4AB), (4A), (4B) and (4C) of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 90, in Clause 3, page 2, line 30, leave out subsection (2).

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): When we adjourned, I was discussing what effect, if any, the new power would have on the ground in local authorities. We have established that there is no extra money to back it up. I have discussed in some detail-I thought that the Committee deserved it-the letter that Lord Whitty wrote between Committee stage and Third Reading in the House of Lords, setting out his position. We have carefully studied that letter, and one can argue that there is no need for clause 3(2)-it is surplus to requirements. Lord Whitty notes that there is no limit on what councils can spend under the well-being powers, but he makes it equally clear that they are constrained by their overall budget. We were, therefore, rather taken by amendment No. 90 and have broken the habit of a lifetime to make common cause with our Liberal Democrat friends on the Committee-a serious lapse, which will not be repeated. We have done that because the neatest and most effective approach to clause 3(2) is to take it out altogether, certainly if one takes Lord Whitty literally.

<P>
In case anyone is labouring under the misapprehension that I am raising a purely Conservative gripe about the provisions, I should add that we have had a briefing from the Local Government Information Unit, which says in relation to clause 2:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The recovery of costs, or making a charge for services, will be important issues. We have concerns about the impact of this clause  We believe that councils need the assurance that they will be able to adopt suitable means of recovering their costs. This could be achieved by an amendment to clause 2(4).-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1462.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The unit goes on to suggest some wording. There is a genuine concern out there in the real world of local government that, if the clause is to survive more or less intact, there should be a mechanism for raising money for worthy causes.

<P>
It is perhaps worth taking a couple of steps back to consider the background to the debate on clause 3(2) in the House of Lords. Baroness Hamwee said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our objection in principle is the tight grip which central government keeps on local government expenditure, a degree of control which we think is wrong, unnecessary and not appropriate for good government.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1462.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not have put it better myself.

<P>
The Opposition have been listening to Britain, and as part of that exercise we have been listening to local government. We have formed the view-[
Interruption.] Yes, we did get it wrong when we were in government. We were far too prone to centralising and interfering in local government. Imagine our surprise and that of many people-not only Conservatives-in local government when we found that this Government had trumped us in that department and were moving in a more centralising and interfering direction.

<P>
Baroness Hamwee went on to ask in relation to clause 3(2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Are local authorities to be restricted by this provision from generating a surplus? I think that clarity in this matter would be helpful. There is a real anxiety that the subsection will prevent councils from raising partnership contributions to activities and could undo the good that the earlier part of the Bill will undoubtedly do.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1463.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the key point. If the Government are clear about what they are trying to achieve in establishing the new power and if they are prepared to tackle all the risks that the lawyers might pose some way down the road-I described those this morning-why not ensure that the power makes a difference? Otherwise, this is all pure debate, and nothing will be delivered on the ground.

<P>
In the same House of Lords debate, which I commend to members of the Committee for its high standard, Lord Dixon-Smith said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are back in the position that we were in on the Greater London Authority Bill. That Bill gave the Greater London Authority powers and then the Government immediately prescribed what I described as an ``anti-power''. Here we are again.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1463.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He notes that the Bill gives the power to promote well-being-it is not an absolute power of general competence-but that it then says that authorities can do nothing about it. His reference to an ``anti-power'' is spot on: that is exactly what we have in the Bill. The Bill gives a power on the one hand, but makes it pretty useless to most local councils on the other.

<P>
Replying to the debate in the House of Lords on behalf of the Government, Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nor do we see merit in allowing authorities to use the well-being power in itself as a means of borrowing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She added that there were good reasons for those ``controls'', saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>First, they ensure that authorities act prudently.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1466.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not the point? Does that not turn a penetrating shaft of light on the Government's true intentions towards local government? They are saying, ``Yes, you will have all these powers, but we don't think that you will use them prudently, so we will make sure that you use them in the way that we think you should.''

<P>
That attitude is reflected across the board in the Government's approach to local authorities, and it is nonsense. The hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) rightly said that councils want to get involved in serious issues such as homelessness. In the same way, people such as Chamberlain went into local government in the 19th century because it was expanding, finding its role and entering new areas of activity; that was seen as an exciting time to be in local government. How on earth can we hope to make a difference to the miserable turnouts in local elections and to the problem of attracting enough of the right sort of candidates if any ability that legislation gives councils to take action is immediately prescribed and hedged around with restrictions by central Government? That is at the heart of the problem that we face on clause 3(2).

<P>
It flows from the Government's approach that local authorities must find a way of funding some activities. The obvious solution is to charge for them, which is why we have tabled a raft of amendments and one or two new clauses. Section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 is crucial in that regard, but it has been substantially recast by part III of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Section 33 of that Act already contains specific powers to allow local authorities to take
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such steps as they may from time to time consider appropriate for promoting the economic development of their area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Presumably, some of the Bill is based on that predecessor statute.

<P>
Under section 35 of the Act, the Secretary of State may issue guidance to which local authorities must ``have regard''-there is that phrase again. The Secretary of State may limit expenditure on economic development, whether incurred under section 33 or otherwise, with reference to any financial year. At the moment, economic development by local authorities is subject to statutory powers in part III of the 1989 Act. That Act amended section 137 and made it clear that any such extension had to be in the interests of the area, part of the area or some of its inhabitants-it made no mention of people present in the area-and of direct benefit. As we heard, the financial limit was originally set at a 2p rate. It is now based on a multiplier linked to an area's population. Part V of the 1989 Act contains a statutory code relating to companies in which local authorities have interests.

<P>
That describes the basis of amendment No. 3, which, by reference to section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, tries to tease out the Government's thinking on how local authorities will fund any significant activity under the new powers. We return to ultra vires. Lawyers say that the phrase ``in their opinion'', used in section 137 as amended, does not confer an unfettered discretion, according to cases such as Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture and that of our old friend the Wednesbury corporation in 1948. Local authorities will face two problems when considering new activities under this part of the Bill. First, will they still have an ultra vires headache? Secondly, will they be able to fund new activities, and if so, how? Ministers must answer those key questions, either today or some time.

<P>
In the meantime, we have proposed a solution in some detail. Much of it will be discussed later, so I shall not detain the Committee too long now. Our series of provisions would allow councils to charge for the new services. There is a slight difference between us and the Liberal Democrats-the word ``reasonable''-but we are raising the same issue, fundamentally. If the Government will not provide funds or allow councils to raise extra resources under the power, why, for goodness' sake, will they not let authorities make charges for certain discretionary services, if they want to do so? I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I have one question. I do not believe that our amendments, Nos. 94 and 95, and amendment No. 90, are fundamentally similar to the Conservative amendment. Amendment No. 110 talks about imposing a charge, but on whom, and in what circumstances, would a charge be levied? I would like to know precisely what the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) means.

<P>
I apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). He explained this morning that he would be debating the Transport Bill in the Chamber, but before the hon. Member for Eastbourne casts aspersions on the Liberal Democrat presence, I warn him that nearly half his own side is missing from the Committee.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): First, I am sorry that the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders), the Liberal Democrat spokesman this afternoon, failed to read amendment No. 110. What our Front-Bench spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne, suggests is that local authorities should be able to charge a fee in whatever circumstances they choose. It is a ``may'' situation. They may make a charge, if they so wish. That is normal, or at least it used to be normal. In my time it was certainly normal, and for a few years after that it was normal that local authorities used means such as fees, charges, repayments and loans as a matter of course, to recover some of their costs, turn the money round, recycle it and get better for less for the local taxpayer.

<P>
I understand that that was turned on its head somewhat in a recent court case between Richmond-which is Liberal Democrat controlled-and someone who was charged for a planning service. The case went through the court procedures, and Richmond lost. Consequently, local government is in some difficulty over charging for many of its services and is looking to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions for specific permissions for specific charges. The complaint that I have received from local government is that the DETR is slow, to put it mildly. I do not mean slow by its normal standards, but very slow, and only two permissions have come forth.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend is aware of another example that illustrates his point. One issue that affects and worries some councils is the status of local authority leisure cards. Authorities are increasingly including non-authority provision in the range of services, such as discounts on theatre and cinema tickets. However, no powers exist that allow authorities to charge for those services, and some authorities have received rather worrying legal advice on the subject. It seems that their genuine desires to improve and provide local services are being stymied by the present regime.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am delighted to hear of yet another example, and I understand that local government is full of similar examples. The Committee has a unique opportunity to get things right before the Bill completes its passage and the power comes into force, and an opportunity in relation to those sparse resources. We keep hearing from the Minister that we must recognise the effect of expenditure in the public sector on the general economy, and I entirely agree with her. We could allow the small amount that will be available for local authorities to spend in this regard to include some factor of recycling, with flexibility. Local government must have the flexibility to decide in a specific case how much it wants to do, how it wants to do it and so on.

<P>
We hear time and again about the risk that local authorities might overcharge, and that fear is evident in clause 3. However, if authorities had that ambition-they do not generally-it would be stymied by the word ``reasonable''. Their charges must be reasonable, otherwise they are likely to be challenged. If the Government do not accept the specific wording of our amendment, I hope that they accept at least the thinking behind it and that they will table a more appropriate amendment at the next stage.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I hope that I can help the Committee in this regard, because I understand the concerns that Opposition Members are expressing. Before addressing the amendments individually, I want to tackle head-on the charge that the new power is something of a paper tiger, because I think that hon. Members have misunderstood what is possible and where the Government are coming from. I want to make it clear that councils will be able to raise money through council tax or the use of some of their grant to contribute towards the activities that the power will enable them to undertake.

<P>
However, the Government are anxious to make it absolutely clear that councils cannot use the power itself to impose new forms of taxation. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Eastbourne is not pushing a desire for new forms of taxation at local level. However, that would be the consequence of some of the amendments. It is important that hon. Members understand that we are not saying that no money can be spent, but that the authority will not be able to say that it wants to raise new funds merely by quoting the power. An authority will have to show that it is raising funds for activities pursued by means of the power and do so within the current local government finance structure.

<P>
Local authorities have an array of money-raising powers at their disposal at present, including the council tax. I remind hon. Gentlemen that in the past three years the Government have increased grants to local authorities by £6 billion, a real-terms increase of 7.8 per cent., in contrast to the previous three years when there was a real-terms cut in grant of 4.3 per cent. Councils will be able to raise money by using their existing powers to finance activity arising from the power; I hope that that is clear.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The right hon. Lady has tackled a matter that the Opposition fully understand. However, amendment No. 110 is about the return, in charges or loans, of fees spent, not about their being used to raise money.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I said that I would deal with the general issues first and then come to the amendments. We held extensive deliberations on best value in debates on a previous Bill, at which some members of the Committee were present. We considered how to ensure that the council worked out the priorities, and how they could be achieved most efficiently, with local people. I hope that hon. Members will not neglect that aspect of the debate; the power is in the Bill partly to aid that process. The new well-being power will allow authorities to explore new ways of working in partnership with other bodies to deliver better services and to make more efficient use of their resources.

<P>
Some of the best-value pilots discovered that authorities could not work with other authorities for greater efficiency by the common purchase of information technology systems, for example, because their legal advice was that to do so may be ultra vires. The power in the Bill gives authorities a clear way forward in that respect, and it will save money. I reaffirm that use of the power will not always incur more spending, but may be a means of reducing it.

<P>
In principle, the Government accept that authorities should have greater scope to charge for discretionary services. The Audit Commission published a report last September called ``The Price is Right'', which highlighted the importance of fees and charges, both as a source of revenue and as an instrument of policy. It stated that a consistent and logical framework was needed within which authorities should be allowed to charge for services. The Government accept that; we are currently considering the design of such a framework. We want to publish that framework as part of the local government finance Green Paper this summer, and then to consult on it. The problem with the amendment is that it would not give us the chance to do so; the issue has been quite confused and, as Conservative Members have said, it needs sorting out, but that should be through consultation with local government rather than by an amendment to the Bill.

<P>
We cannot accept amendments Nos. 110, 94 and 95; it is not a simple matter of legislating to allow authorities to charge for anything done under the well-being power, or to recover reasonable costs. We must give careful consideration to the effect that such powers may have.

<P>
Legitimate concerns have been raised about the impact of charging when authorities have a monopoly position. We must consider the impact of charging on competition with the private sector. The report last year of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee recommended that charges should be means-sensitive. Those issues must be considered before they are encompassed in legislation.

<P>
In the meantime, there are good reasons to allow authorities to charge for what they do under the well-being power and we can use the powers in section 150 of the 1989 Act to allow such charges. That section may also provide a means to implement a wider charging regime following consultation on the Green Paper. We may not have to wait for further primary legislation before implementing suggestions that follow from the Green Paper.

<P>
The Bill is not about Government giving authorities greater powers to charge; the Audit Commission report found that councils rarely managed their charges well, and that there was little evidence that charges were driven by policy priorities or by systematic planning. In the Audit Commission's view, existing charging regimes are rarely used to their full potential; that is something that the authorities will need to tackle, and I hope that they will do so.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 90 and 3 would strike out clause 3(2), which stops local authorities from raising money, whether by precepts, borrowing or otherwise, and there are very good reasons for that subsection. Authorities should not be able to use the well-being power to impose new forms of taxation on individuals or businesses. The power to tax should be subject to the approval of Parliament. There is no merit in allowing authorities to use the well-being power as a means of borrowing.

<P>
Specific terms and conditions apply to local government's power to borrow, for two reasons: first, they help to ensure that authorities act prudently, so that a local community is not faced with an excessive burden of debt charges in future years and, secondly, they help to ensure that the Chancellor's objectives for the national economy are achieved, following the golden rule that borrowing should be only for investment, not for day-to-day spending, and the rule that public sector debt should be kept at a prudent and stable level over time. Committee members know that we are considering changes in how local government borrows as part of the local government finance review; however, the guidelines will remain relevant.

<P>
Amendment No. 3, which we cannot accept, would replace clause 3(2) with a new subsection, which would re-impose the spending limits in section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972. The new power is about freeing up the activities of local authorities the better to serve the needs and priorities of their communities. It includes the ability to direct spending towards local issues that require immediate action. It is not about placing limits on the amount that individual authorities can spend per head of the population. It is for local authorities themselves to decide how to spend the money that is available to them, taking into account the views of local people.

<P>
I am sorry that my explanation has been so lengthy, but I wanted to ensure that Members understood the Government's work on charging and the impact of specific amendments. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I thank the Minister for her full explanation, much of which Conservative Members knew about beforehand. I may be a member of an ethnic minority, but I can occasionally read English.

<P>
Much of the Minister's response was straightforward. However, this side of the Committee is trying to be helpful and the dog's breakfast answer that we received about amendment No. 110 was not helpful. Local authorities at first thought that they could charge, but they cannot because of the courts. They requested specific changes and received permission on two of them, so there is already movement in the right direction, despite what the Minister says about consultation and Christmas coming. It seems that it will go on and on and there may be primary legislation later, unless the Government can work through the back door.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Here, according to the Government, we have an opportunity to move forward with a great new idea-a new well-being power and a chance to make the money spread further-yet the Government are rejecting that opportunity, which is extraordinary. They have already made concessions in two respects, and they recognise the value of the proposals and the need for local government to take advantage of the opportunity. If primary legislation were to follow consultation, and the amendment-in some form or other-proved unacceptable, it could be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> On a point of order, Mrs Michie. The Minister responded to amendment No. 90, which
has not yet been moved. We also tabled amendments Nos. 94 and 95. Am I at liberty to move them now?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister spoke to the amendments, which are included in this group.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Thank you, Mrs Michie. I should also thank the Minister for clarifying in advance some of the questions that I intended to ask. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) said, I thought that the Minister's response was quite enlightening.

<P>
I should like to ask a few questions about issues raised by amendments Nos. 94 and 95. On first reading, it appeared that clause 3(2) would prevent local authorities from raising money by precepts-but the Minister has explained that that is not the case because it could be raised through council tax-or through borrowing, which remains uncertain, or otherwise. I want to concentrate on the ``or otherwise'', because there are other ways for an authority to raise revenue in relation to the powers that it can exercise.

<P>
Clause 3(2) could prevent councils from generating a surplus, which is another means of recovering costs. The inability to generate a surplus or the need to avoid generating one could prevent a wide range of initiatives. In some instances, it could be appropriate to make a profit to meet social objectives-for example, a working profit in a community shop, a rural shop or a shop in a declining estate that was supported by the council. Will the Minister make it clear whether clause 3(2) will prevent such instances of raising revenue?

<P>
There is also some anxiety that clause 3(2) could restrict or prevent councils from raising partnership contributions to activities, though the Minister offered some clarification of that point in her reply.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I should like to make it absolutely clear, as I intended but forgot to do in response to the hon. Member for Eastbourne earlier, that there will be no restriction on authorities working effectively in partnership with public bodies, and the other bodies will also be able to contribute.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> That is helpful and an important point, because it goes to the heart of the Government's objectives on partnerships. We all know that many issues cannot be tackled in isolation by one agency. We are now reaching the point where the pooling of resources is permitted in order to meet objectives. That is particularly important for tackling housing problems, health, crime and other social issues. We-or should I say ``I''?-on this side of the Committee greatly welcome that. Will the Minister provide further reassurance on generating surpluses and on the council acting as a trader or guaranteeing a trading activity? Will that be able to continue? Such clarification is greatly needed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> This is just not good enough. The Minister has at her disposal the intellectual firepower of not only the Secretary of State, but all her fellow Ministers and a vast number of people with double firsts-Wykehamists and the like-in the senior echelons of the civil service. We have only just started debating the Bill, but every time we come to a tricky question, we find that it will be dealt with somewhere else-in the guidance, in the regulations, in the famed local government finance Green Paper, whenever it emerges from this great black hole at the heart of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. We are expected to go along with all this, but we are not going to.

<P>
Talking about wordsmiths, the Minister coined the phrase ``paper tiger'' to characterise the power, and we are happy to adopt it. My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley, who has forgotten more about local government than I know, gave some good, practical common-sense examples of services for which councils would like to have the opportunity to charge. Many people would be happy to pay for them in the right circumstances.

<P>
What was the Minister's answer? Parts of it were almost word for word the same as what was said by the Minister in the other place. I suppose that that is joined-up government of a sort. It shows that the debate-if only an internal debate within the Department-has not moved on at all. It is our job to move it on, which is exactly what we are going to do.

<P>
The Minister's fundamental answer was, ``Well, it is a matter for the council tax.'' Are the Government going to increase council tax? Thanks to the Government's attitude to grants, council tax in my constituency went up by 8 per cent. this year, and 40 per cent. of my voters are over retirement age, so it is easy to imagine the impact of that increase. The Minister leaves her big stick-capping-in the cupboard, but it has not gone away.

<P>
What are we told? ``It is all right, because the Government accept that councils should be able to charge for services.'' The Government are looking at a ``design for a framework''. We were not born yesterday, and Mrs Waterson did not raise any children who would withdraw amendments on the basis of a promise of a design for a framework. We are not going to wait for the local government finance Green Paper to emerge; we are not going to wait for draft guidance or draft regulations; and we are not going to wait for a consultation exercise. Why did Ministers and their advisers not consider these problems earlier? It should have been an obvious issue, and even if it was not obvious, it has been raised time after time by people of all parties speaking for local government in this country.

<P>
The Local Government Association made a good deal of this issue. Its briefing states that authorities should be able to levy charges for activities undertaken to promote well-being, at the very least in order to cover their costs. Before we started the Commons Committee stage, it discussed the famous review, which was expected in the form of a Green Paper this summer. We know from promises made in other Green and White Papers that that may not come to pass.

<P>
The briefing says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, a final solution to the charging issue is not expected until the Local Government (Finance) Bill is presented in possibly two or three years' time.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the new general power will be introduced without an accompanying power to charge, but that is the point. The change will not happen soon or even in the middle distance. The briefing goes on to talk about the use-as a temporary expedient-of section 150 powers. The Minister touched on that but said nothing concrete or detailed about what was to happen.

<P>
I hope that I have been the opposite of churlish on a series of amendments so far, although this is the first proper day of consideration of the Bill, but this simply is not good enough and it is high time that we at least put down a marker. I will not withdraw amendment No. 110 but will press it to a Division.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 23, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Action taken by a local authority outside its own boundaries shall only be undertaken with the consent of the authority within whose boundaries the action is proposed to be taken.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Better luck next time.

<P>
The amendments would place safeguards on the use of the new power outside an authority's own area. We think that the burden of proof, so to speak, should be greater. An authority should have to demonstrate that a proposed action would deliver improvements to its own area, rather than merely considering that it would, and it should have to gain consent from an authority, or authorities, in whose area it proposes to take action. It is a sensible proposal. One hopes that in any event an authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would take some care to obtain the consent and wholehearted agreement of neighbouring authorities that might be affected.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister in another place stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We need to make it clear that we expect local authorities to co-operate. On the other hand, we do not want to be over-prescriptive on the face of the Bill. We would not want to be quite as limiting as the noble Lord is tempting us to be.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>None the less, I am happy to go away and look at the matter in order to see whether there is a better way in which we can make it absolutely clear that local authorities should act in co-operation.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 25 January 2000; Vol. 343, c. 1457.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be interesting to hear whether the Minister simply went away and, if he did, whether someone gave serious joined-up thought to how we can address the problem. This is a probing amendment. I am eager to discover what the Government are thinking. They have had ample opportunity since the debates in another place to consider this issue. If the answer is to be that they expect local authorities to consult, why not put that in the Bill? I see no objection to it. I hope that no local authority would behave so unreasonably as not to consult its neighbours if it was proposing policies that would affect them.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I particularly support amendment No. 1. I remember that in the days of aggravation between political parties, there were opportunities for it to move across local authorities' boundaries. In my case, the aggravation moved westward, in that grants given to organisations that worked on one side of a boundary were used by those on the other side. I can see from the smile on at least one face-an ex-London local authority leader-that these events happened with some frequency, and I know that they created considerable consternation. The Bill will do precisely the opposite; it will ensure that local authorities co-operate and work together. Amendment No. 1 makes eminent sense. It follows the line of the Bill and is a hint and a warning to co-operate rather than being a marauder across the border.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> That was relatively short and sweet by comparison with the debate on the previous set of amendments.

<P>
In response to the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Mole Valley, the Government have reflected on the position in the other place. However, despite the clarity of the explanations that we have heard today, we are still not able to accept amendments Nos. 8 and 1. I owe both hon. Members an explanation of the Government's thinking on the issues.

<P>
The Government want local authorities to be able to act in the interest of the communities, and to be certain of their legal right to do so. The hon. Member for Eastbourne made much of his listening exercise around England and Wales, and the United Kingdom at large. If he listened to anything that local authorities said, he will know that they want to know that they are properly accountable to their communities and that they can decide when, and how, to use the well-being power, whether inside or outside their own area.

<P>
The Government want local authorities to find ways of tackling local problems such as social exclusion and deprived neighbourhoods, and the economic development issues that are a factor in the power, which has been broadly welcomed. We want local authorities to take on the challenge, but I hope that hon. Members will accept that doing that will occasionally involve taking risks. There can be no guarantee that any approach will necessarily work. The power in the Bill is therefore drafted to confirm to local authorities that they can be sure of the lawfulness of their activity and will be able to prove in court that in their opinion the activity that they undertook was likely to promote or improve community well-being.

<P>
The concept is nothing new. The wording in clause 3 is similar to that used in other discretionary powers-notably section 137 of the Local Government Bill 1972. It is right to make the general powers discretionary. Local authorities are best able to identify the needs of local communities and consider the partnerships that they need with other local agencies to tackle problems. This is why many local authorities in England and-according to representations that I have received-in Wales, greatly welcome the general direction and thrust of clause 2.

<P>
The Government obviously think that local authorities should not be given the power to do absolutely anything. They will still be open to challenge on whether they have acted reasonably; that is entirely proper and right. However, if amendment No. 8 were accepted, local authorities would have to show that any proposed activity outside their area would actually-I emphasise that word-promote or improve community well-being before the activity could be undertaken. That would be a difficult if not impossible test, as there can be no objective test of whether the local authority could achieve its objective. That could create uncertainty about the power and thus increase the potential for litigation, as it would leave the courts to decide whether councils had undertaken activities properly.

<P>
Amendment No. 8 would act as a strong deterrent to local authorities that wanted to try out a new approach to bring benefits to their communities. It would also deter other agencies from supporting local authorities and participating in partnerships with them, since they, too, would be uncertain about whether they had a legal right subsequently to participate in those activities.

<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Eastbourne and supported by the hon. Member for Mole Valley would act as a deterrent, and impose a brake on local authorities that wanted to participate in certain activities.

<P>
Amendment No. 1 has some valid points, and Conservative Members have expressed sympathy with the Government's aims. Ministers in another place considered the issues carefully. The success of community planning and action taken under the well-being power depends on local authorities working together for the common good of their communities.

<P>
The Government expect the different tiers of all authorities to adopt a sensible attitude to the new freedoms that the Bill will give them. I do not want local authorities to act irresponsibly outside their own areas, but we do not want to be overly prescriptive. A key element of the measure is that the Government are transferring responsibility back to local authorities to promote activities under clause 2 that contribute to the well-being of the community.

<P>
The Government took note of the protestations of the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Mole Valley and reconsidered the issue; we concluded that further legislation would be impractical and that the best way to approach the matter would be by issuing guidance. Hon. Members have a cynical attitude to guidance, and expressed their anxiety about it, but it is what it says it is: guidance to local authorities to consider the Government's intentions. Guidance allows them flexibility and gives them the chance to consider their own arrangements in a proper and effective way.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I accept what the Minister said about amendment No. 8; as he may recall, I was promoting one predominant point. Can I take it from what he says that the guidance will allay our anxieties? I think that he has the nod.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The guidance will be examined and I hope that it will cover the points that he made. I shall consult my colleagues who will be issuing guidance for England; my responsibilities are for Wales, which will have different guidance.

<P>
I take note of what the hon. Gentleman said, and the Government have some sympathy with his views on the matter. The guidance will strongly emphasise that consensus and co-operation between authorities using the power is essential. We want authorities to work together; the onus will be on local authorities to live up to those new responsibilities. I hope that in the spirit of co-operation, the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Mole Valley will put aside their cynicism about guidance and consider the Government's good will, both in the DETR and in the National Assembly for Wales, and rest assured that although we have taken account of the valid points in their probing amendments, sadly, we are opposed to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I want a little more reassurance from the Minister. I accept that guidance is necessary and that much work is done through subsidiary legislation. I assume that the guidance will lay down that there must be widespread consultation within local authorities so that people do not discover from their local paper that a neighbouring authority will do something in their bailiwick.

<P>
Will the Minister bear in mind the matter of proportionality when he issues the guidance? In Wales, there are unitary authorities everywhere; local authorities are broadly similar in size, resources and powers. That is not the case in England. Craven, in my constituency, is one of the smallest districts; its neighbour is Bradford, a large metropolitan authority. Harrogate, a large district with a population three times the size of Craven, abuts Leeds, another large metropolitan authority. West Yorkshire has entirely metropolitan authorities, which are big enough to take care of themselves; but the guidance must spell out that actions taken by large authorities will have an impact on a small neighbour.

<P>
The guidance must make the process of consultation clear and ensure that representations from the smaller neighbour are listened to carefully. The relationship is equivalent to that between a large council and a parish council; if the Minister can reassure me on the matter he will settle some unease.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) for raising those matters. I spent a pleasant week in Buckden in his constituency at Easter, although I did not write to him. I am aware of the relationship between Skipton and Ripon and Bradford.

<P>
Proportionality and consultation are important issues; the relationship between neighbours such as Bradford and Craven must be taken into account, and the impact of the well-being proposals on a Bradford would also have an impact on a Craven. I hope that consultation will be endemic; it will certainly be encouraged.

<P>
The same is true of England and Wales. My local authority in Wales borders the large metropolitan authorities of Liverpool and the Wirral, and Manchester is not far away. Consultation is important in considering the well being of the community that the council serves and the impact of the well-being proposals on neighbouring authorities. I hope that in the same spirit of co-operation shown in the Committee, local authorities will achieve the overarching objectives of consultation, discussion and working together, which are better placed in guidance than in the Bill.

<P>
If the amendments were accepted, there would be much that local authorities could not do because of the rigid nature of the proposals. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for taking the trouble to reassure us with his detailed and comprehensive explanation. We are not against guidance per se; of course, there are issues that can be tackled only by means of guidance, and the issue under discussion is pre-eminently the sort of thing that should be dealt with in that way. We are concerned only with preventing guidance becoming an all-purpose long grass into which things can be kicked if they are too difficult to be dealt with in Committee.

<P>
I can see the wisdom of the clause and I am grateful to the Minister for confessing that he was recently present in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon for the purposes of economic, social and environmental well-being. If Ministers are to camp out in our local authority areas, God knows what will be the costs of the new power. I am harking back to a previous debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I was even canvassed by one of the right hon. Gentleman's constituents in Upper Wharfedale ward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I wonder how the Minister responded.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We kept control.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is nice to know. I am glad that the Conservative machine is efficient in Upper Wharfedale, given that the properties to be canvassed are some distance apart.
 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is comforting to hear the Under-Secretary's honeyed words on this subject. I do not want to set a precedent, but we shall take him entirely at his word on this occasion. We are happy to accept that the matter will be dealt with in guidance, if only because those who will be breathing heavily down Ministers' necks if it is not dealt with properly will be local authorities that are cheesed off at their neighbours acting in their areas in ways that they should not. I accept the Under-Secretary's assurances and look forward to seeing the fabled guidance eventually. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 25, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) Nothing in this part shall empower a local authority to engage in trade otherwise than is provided for by the Local Authority (Goods and Services) Act 1970.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We take the view that local authorities exist to provide public services to their communities that, for various reasons, cannot be provided by the market. They do not and should not exist to trade for profit or to act as competition for the private and voluntary sectors in the provision of services that can be provided through the market.

<P>
The amendment has a simple and straightforward purpose. It is to protect private enterprise in a given local authority area from unfair competition and to protect council tax payers from the risk of mismanaged ventures by the local authority. It relies on the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970, which has stood the test of time and addresses the issues neatly. The Act permits authorities to trade with other authorities and with approved public and quasi-public sector bodies. Its scope has been interpreted narrowly by the audit authorities, who advised that such trade is lawful only if the supplying authority has surplus capacity-but it has not been tested in the courts. If stronger protection is required, the Government can table their own amendments in line with the general principle.

<P>
It is a probing amendment. I am not suggesting that many local authorities are poised to go out and start supermarkets, but important issues are bubbling up in our mailbags, which might relate to the problem in future. There is the question of village shops and sub-post offices, for example. Many authorities of all political persuasions are seeking to ensure that those crucial aspects of the local economy and social structure do not disappear altogether-and the same goes for pubs. I would, of course, have greater sympathy with a local authority that wanted to set up a pub. Local authorities are becoming worried, particularly in rural areas, about the future of businesses that are crucial to local communities. Once they are gone, it will be difficult to get them back.

<P>
A local authority that either felt it could not achieve enough through rate relief or was constrained by regulations might want to run a shop or a post office. We regard that as an improper extension of local government activity. Local authorities do not exist for that purpose and they would probably not make a good fist of it in any case.

<P>
Another topical example is rural transport. Once again, we are in difficult waters, which have probably been trawled heavily by hon. Members who served on the Committee considering the Transport Bill. Some large rural county councils are investing substantial sums in school transport. Preserving rural communities through businesses at the heart or through connections between them matters greatly to county councils of all political persuasions.

<P>
I shall summarise what the Minister in the other place said. Baroness Farrington described the 1970 Act as ``permissive'' legislation-a statement of fact rather than a description, though I have not read some parts of it. She said that once the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>comes into force, local authorities will be able to provide goods and services to anyone-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a mite concerning. She redeemed the problem almost immediately by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But, while they will be able to provide goods and services to anyone, they will not be able to charge for them  nothing in the current Bill will change the current ability of local authorities to engage in trading.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She said that the Government were ``currently exploring''-a common phrase that strains the use of the word ``current''-the issues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>with business, voluntary organisations, local government and trade unions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government want to relax some of the restrictions. Now comes the inevitable:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We intend to issue a consultation paper on these issues in the spring.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 28 February 2000; Vol. 610, c. 339.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So here we are again-carry on consulting.

<P>
I have an eerie feeling that I can predict what the Under-Secretary will say in response. I have a sense of déjà vu that we shall soon hear about another consultation paper, or it might be subsumed and wrapped up in the ever-broadening local government finance Green Paper. The issue is important and must be clearly addressed in the Bill. That is why we tabled the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I support the amendment, which will help the Government. I recently read another document from the Department-the housing Green Paper. It is a long document-as one would expect, three times longer than it needs to be to say what it has to say-and an important one. It clearly sets out a concept of local government, whereby it should be strategic but not necessarily executive in its actions. That is why the Green Paper fully endorses the transfer of housing stock from local authorities into the private sector. It is entirely consistent with that philosophy that local authorities should have a strategic role without being traders.

<P>
The Government say that local authorities have barely a role left in housing management, yet suggest that they should be getting into commercial ventures or setting up businesses. The Under-Secretary should recognise, on reflection, that the amendment would help the Government to realise their own goals for local government. We used to call our view of local government the enabling authority, and the present Government call it the strategic authority. Frankly, they are precisely the same, whatever the terminology.

<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will not take refuge behind yet another consultation document, but will make it clear that it is not for local authorities to get involved in business. I refer her to the statement made in the House recently by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. He said repeatedly that it is not the job of the Government to get involved in funding these organisations; it is for the private sector to do so. If it is right for the Government to stay out, surely it must be right for local authorities. That is entirely consistent with the Government's own philosophy, so I hope that she will prove to be a noble upholder of it. As far as it goes, I agree with it-I should do, because I invented it.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> My response to the amendment could be brief, although the hon. Member for Eastbourne has introduced several points that are extraneous to the amendment, and I should respond briefly to them.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman summarised the Government's response to the amendment in another place, and I can add nothing to the points that he read out. To reiterate, I should make it clear at the outset that we oppose amendment No. 2 because it is superfluous. Nothing in the Bill would change authorities' ability to trade in goods and services, as defined by the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970. As he said, the Act permits an authority to charge for goods and services only where it provides them to another public body, as defined in the Act. As he mentioned, once clause 2 comes into force, local authorities will be able to supply goods and services to other bodies, provided that they are satisfied that that comes within the terms of the promotion of well-being. However, they will not be able to charge for them. Clause 3(2) specifically prevents authorities from using the well-being power to raise money, and that includes charging. Therefore, the powers in the Bill neither restrict nor extend local authority powers to trade; they leave them as they are defined in existing legislation.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's contribution on the amendment reflects the confusion in his party's emerging view of local government and in its emerging policy on what local government is and should be about. Not long ago, the Conservative party argued that local authorities should be able to use the power of well-being as a basis for more charges, presumably also for services provided by the private sector. Now, however, it thinks that it is not okay for local authorities to trade in goods and services that the private sector provides. Leisure cards are perhaps a case in point and illustrate the confusion among Conservative Members in their attitude to local authorities.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister is creating confusion for her own purposes. A leisure card is an example of local authorities trying to offer something that involves their own services and non-local authority services. Perhaps she is suggesting that that is not a helpful route to take, but that is a special example.

<P>
Let me, however, take the Minister away from all this easy stuff and ask what her colleague in the House of Lords meant when he suggested that everything was being explored. We seem to be going backwards-exactly what is being examined in the consultation exercise that is taking place or is about to take place on this issue?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Certainly. However, before I come to that, I make no apologies for the consultation that is under way. A similar set of issues arose from the best value legislation that was passed last year. As the hon. Gentleman noted, we said during the passage of that legislation that we would consider using powers in section 16 of the Local Government Act 1999 to allow councils greater scope to trade. Since then, we have been consulting with a wide range of interested parties. Given the points that they have raised, hon. Members will understand that the issues are necessarily complicated and could have many important ramifications that need careful consideration.

<P>
In introducing proposals, we need to balance the potential benefits to local communities against proper safeguards to protect local taxpayers and ensure fair competition. We share the concerns that have been expressed about that today. Our concern is to get the balance right, and we shall issue the results of the discussion in a public consultation paper before the summer recess.

<P>
It is entirely proper that the power of well-being should not be used as a basis for extending the ability of local authorities to trade. We have started a consultation process in response to the discussion of best value to see whether there might be cases in which extending trade is compatible with the best value obligations and opportunities of local authorities. That is a separate issue, but it is not inconsistent with the view that the power of well-being should not be used to extend authorities' ability to trade-which we do not propose to do. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister cannot have it both ways: either there is an issue or there is not. If there is not, what on earth is all the consultation about? We are not against consultation if it is in the right place and for the right purposes, but there is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed. No one is being churlish about that; there is an issue, and that is fine-why should not there be? This is an important and technical area, which raises some difficult questions, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said and as I suggested in my opening remarks. It must be common ground that there is an issue that needs to be addressed. However, if the Government do not want the Bill to be used to extend the ability of local authorities to trade, our amendment is perfectly acceptable.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is the right hon. Lady's opinion.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There is a great need for reassurance, not so much in local government, but in the business world and among small businesses. That is true, in particular, of those who remember the period before the 1970s and the late 1970s, when some local authority trading was a bit grim and affected businesses enormously. One would think that we would have an opportunity to consider the matter on Thursday, when we discuss limitations under clause 3. Perhaps the Minister can tell us then whether she is prepared to use a schedule or guidance to spell out matters clearly for the benefit of local authorities and the private sector.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon. Friend makes a sensible suggestion.

<P>
I apologise for reiterating this point, but amendment No. 2 states the Government's position. They do not want-at least not in the Bill-to move beyond the current situation, as defined by the 1970 Act. That is fine; that is our view, too. One inevitably gets into a circular argument in Committee about whether such amendments are unnecessary or whether they should be included to avoid doubt. We think that this issue is sufficiently important for the amendment to appear in the Bill. After all, it is only a shortish provision. What harm would it do to have it in the Bill? It would certainly make the Government's position clear to all concerned in the public and private sectors.

<P>
 I shall be happy to seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment on this occasion, but I hope that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley suggested, the Government will address the issue a little later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 2, line 25, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) The definition of a ``person'' under subsection (4) shall be an official or recognised representative of a voluntary or non-profit making organisation registered with the Charity Commission.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a short point, which will be shorter if I cannot find my copy of the amendment. The amendment would simply ensure that unscrupulous or disreputable organisations were not involved, as persons, in the activities. I leave aside politicians of all parties in that description. Although I will not quote from their debate, the Lords discussed the meaning of ``person'' or ``persons'', because the words have a wide legal meaning. It is a reasonably sensible safeguard to ensure that the right organisations-reliable, sensible organisations-are involved in the process. I would be surprised if the Government had serious objections to the amendment, but I wait to hear from the Minister.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Member for Eastbourne frequently refers to guidance. This morning, we briefly discussed the fact that the Government seek to ensure that hon. Members can see guidance as soon as it is available, so I draw hon. Members' attention to the fact that copies of a new draft guidance for part II are available today. They are on the desk, along with other papers for the Committee.

<P>
The amendment is interesting, and I was keen to hear the explanation by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Although he did not say that this was a probing amendment, I trust that it is. I will not remind him of the somewhat intemperate terms that he used to describe organisations that were not registered charities or in the voluntary sector.

<P>
Our aim is to enable local government to enter into partnerships and work in confidence with a range of public and private sector organisations. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would prevent authorities from working with private sector organisations, but I am sure that he did not intend that effect and that he inadvertently called the private sector disreputable, so I hope that we can get rid of the amendment quickly.

<P>
Subsection (4) allows local authorities to use the well-being power to provide financial assistance, and to work with, or co-ordinate the activities of, any person. The provision gives local authorities and other potential partners the confidence that they need to participate in partnerships and other arrangements, because we want local authorities and others to act together when it is sensible to do so.

<P>
In recent legislation such as the Health Act 1999, partnerships clearly form part of the aim. Such provisions show our commitment to cutting bureaucracy and improving the delivery of services to users. We seek to give local authorities more certainty about forming such partnerships. This morning, the hon. Gentleman was concerned about the spectre of ultra vires, and his amendment would raise that again, but much more starkly. I know that that was not his intention, so I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister is right that this is a probing amendment. It has obviously been effective in that ambition, because it has extracted from her an explanation of all its shortcomings.

<P>
However, there is a serious point behind the amendment, as I hope is the case with all probing amendments. Subsection (4) contains the reference

<P>

but it leaves the definition of the word ``person'' rather at large. Of course, we can leave a lot to the good sense of individual local authorities, but I wonder whether the Government may want to return to the definition of ``person'' themselves. I accept that my definition is far too narrow, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 2, line 28, leave out ``contained'' and insert ``expressly stated''.

<P>
The amendment deals with prohibitions, restraints and limitations. Its purpose is to make it clear that the provision in subsection (1) applies to restrictions or limitations that have been expressly laid down by Parliament, rather than to those that the courts may later determine are implicit.

<P>
In a letter to Baroness Hamwee, the Government said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>local authorities may not use the well-being power to get round any prohibition, restriction or limitation contained in any enactment. That is to say, any prohibition that is spelt out within another piece of local government statute. These are restrictions that have been expressly laid down by Parliament as necessary checks on authorities' various activities, rather than those that the courts have subsequently determined to be implicit by virtue of the absence of a specific power to do something.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is clear that the Government intend that the provision in subsection (1) will result in an increase in scope for local authority discretion, as expressed in the explanatory notes, which say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The intention is to broaden the scope for local authority action while reducing the scope for challenge on the grounds that local authorities lack specific powers.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government rely on the phrase ``contained in any enactment'' in saying that the clause should be read as though it refers only to express restrictions. Will that phrase be interpreted as the Government intend? Despite assurances, we are worried that there is no obvious reason why the courts should not construe the phrase as including both express and implied restrictions or limitations. The courts can refer to Hansard to establish Parliament's intentions where there is uncertainty, but that occurs only in limited circumstances. I hope that the Minister will reassure us when she responds.

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Amendment No. 111 is not dissimilar to the Liberal Democrat amendment No. 96, but it is rather more clear cut. It would simply insert the word ``express''. This has come about from various articles and representations in the local government press. It is about the limits on the power to promote well-being set out in clause 3, subsection one of which begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The power  does not enable a local authority to do anything which they are unable to do by virtue of any prohibition  contained in any enactment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We think that the word ``express'' should be incorporated to make the Government's meaning clear. The hon. Member for Torbay set out cogent reasons for including it. Its inclusion would make the clause sharper and crisper. I am happy to support the Liberal Democrat amendment.

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I fear that here we get into the murky waters of legal definition. I hesitate to do that, given that the hon. Member for Eastbourne was a solicitor in his previous existence and will, I assume, return to the profession at some stage. We have a clause that properly expresses the aims of Opposition Members. I understand their concern to ensure that the power is broad and free of unnecessary restrictions. It is important that local authorities should be as certain as they can be about their scope to act using the well-being power. I hope to reassure hon. Gentlemen that the Bill already meets their worries. As some Opposition Members know, in a sense these matters are decided not by Ministers but by parliamentary counsel, whose drafting comes after years of experience of what is put into Bills, and what it means. I confess that I am frequently confused, but I am not parliamentary counsel, nor am I a lawyer.

<P>
I assure the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Torbay that the clause as drafted is clear about which prohibitions, restrictions and limitations will apply to the power of well-being: they are only those contained in legislation, nothing else. All prohibitions, restrictions and limitations in legislation are by definition expressly stated-so I am told. Adding such words, I am also told, might confuse matters, as it would imply that some restrictions are set out in legislation in a way that is not express-I said that we were getting into the realms of legal definition. The clause is structured in a way that ensures that it is clear to authorities that the restrictions are only those contained in legislation, and nothing else.

<P>
We fear that the amendments would confuse rather than clarify. I hope that hon. Members will accept that the clause as drafted does exactly what their amendments would do, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I hear what the Minister says. Obviously, we will have a longer debate on clause stand part to pull together all the points, but the clause involves setting limits, yet again, on the new powers. It seems perfectly sensible and reasonable to make it abundantly clear that only an express enactment will have the effect set out in subsection (1). That is certainly the view of people in local government who know about such matters. I do not think that that could be achieved any more clearly than by inserting the word ``express''. The Minister kindly referred to my profession as a solicitor, but I take the view as a matter of law that it is abundantly clear that the word ``express'' would have that added effect.

<P>
I cannot understand the objection to the amendment. We are already concerned about the limits that will be placed on the power in relation to guidance and regulations, and about the lack of funding to back it up. It should be as clear as possible that only an existing enactment, on all fours with the new power in terms of limiting it, would have that effect. If that is not made clear in the Bill, alarm bells may ring in the local government community and certainly among Conservative Members.

<P>
Amendment No. 111 is a modest amendment in that it would insert only one word, but it carries a volume of meaning if the Government are unwilling to accept it. I urge the Minister again to consider accepting that amendment. Purely as a matter of drafting, it is perfectly sensible and adds something to the clause. If the Government are unwilling to accept the amendment, that will send entirely the wrong message to people in local government who share our concern.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Eastbourne has said. Both this morning and this afternoon, the Minister has clarified some matters very well and cleared up the confusion. However, she has not convinced me of her case against amendment No. 96 at all. This minor amendment would lead to greater clarity and not the contrary, as the Minister claims. For that reason I am unwilling to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment negatived.
