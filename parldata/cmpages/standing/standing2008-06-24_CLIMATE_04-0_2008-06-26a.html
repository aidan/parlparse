David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): I will try to resume
where I left off before we adjourned for lunch.</div>
<a name="080626104000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The precise
targets and dates are not issues on which we should pin all our
ambitions. We need to think about the direction of travel, for which we
need a start point and an end point. We need to think in periods of
time. There is nothing God-given about 2020&#151;2015 is arguably a
better date for the interim target, but it could equally well be 2045
or
2055.</div><a name="080626104000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has said that the 2050 80 per cent. target is becoming
symbolic. It is more than symbolic; it is indicative. I have stressed
the point that we are talking about &#147;at least 80 per
cent.&#148;, and we should not be too hung up on a precise
figure.</div>
<a name="080626104000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
interested me about the debate&#151;I am conscious of time and do not
wish to detain the Committee for too long, as I know we are behind
schedule&#151;was the way in which some Opposition Members decided to
debate not the relative merits of 80 per cent. or 60 per cent. but a
topic that relates to our consideration of part 2 of the Bill, namely
the status of the Climate Change Committee. That is interesting,
because it suggests that they do not want to debate the relative merits
of 80 per cent. or 60 per cent., which might cause them some
difficulty. It may be that the extent of climate change denial within
the official Opposition is far greater than we were led to believe by
the three Members who voted against the Bill on Second Reading. That is
not an issue to pursue at the moment, but it is a point that I have to
make.</div><a name="080626104000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was impressed by many of the speeches on this amendment. In particular,
I was impressed by the Opposition&#146;s adherence to the importance
of building targets on the basis of science, although I would have been
more impressed had they shown at any point in this Parliament or
previous ones that they form their political judgment on the basis of
scientific advice. Perhaps this is not the moment to remind everyone of
the intricate debate over the Human Fertilisation and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>Embryology Bill, but that did not strike me as a classic example of a
political party forming judgments on the basis of
science.</div><a name="080626104000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to the Climate Change Committee, the Minister pointed out the
contradiction between what the official Opposition are arguing today
and what they were arguing yesterday on the independent planning
commission. It is possible to reconcile the principle of establishing
Government policy on the basis of the best scientific evidence with the
need for political judgment and an element of economic judgment to be
brought into play, which is why the Climate Change Committee is not an
entirely scientific
body.</div><a name="080626104000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about the interplay between science, politics and
economics, largely because those issues&#151;the overall issue of
climate change and keeping to the recommended 2°
target&#151;are not just matters for the UK. We have to form our own
policy in the context of what will be most valuable in future
international negotiations.</div>
<a name="080626104000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate
my point about the critical importance of the finite nature of fossil
fuels. In opening the debate, I referred to the Prime Minister&#146;s
speech to the European Council last weekend. In responding to the
debate, I want to refer to the Prime Minister&#146;s comment at Prime
Minister&#146;s questions yesterday, when he said&#151;this is
perhaps the first time that this has been said&#151;that the
underlying cause of the dramatic increase in the oil price in the past
two years, and particularly in the past six months, is the mismatch
between supply and
demand.</div><a name="080626104000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the first time in history, demand is outstripping supply. That involves
more than speculation or the unwillingness of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to co-operate. It is an inevitable
consequence of economic growth in other parts of the world. Now many
hundreds of millions of people in China, India and other parts of Asia
are demanding, absolutely rightly, the same kind of lifestyle and
privileges from which we in the west have benefited for a century or
more. That is the key fact that underlines this debate, and it is one
of the most powerful arguments for setting a more stringent target at
this stage.</div>
<a name="080626104000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Nicholas
Stern has been incredibly helpful not only because of the publication
of his original report two years ago, but because of his speech to the
Carbon Rating Agency yesterday, when he said that he is now convinced
that climate change is happening more quickly than had previously been
thought. He said that it is happening faster than he thought even two
years ago, and therefore emissions need to be reduced even more
sharply. He went on to
say:</div><a name="080626104000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
now think the appropriate thing would be in the
middle&#148;</div>
<a name="080626104000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the range of 450 to
550 parts per million. He also
said:</div><a name="080626104000036"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
get below 500 ppm ... would cost around 2 per cent. of
GDP.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
significance of this is twofold&#151;first, it illustrates how fast
the reality of climate change is coming on us, and, secondly, it
illustrates that we are discussing not only scientific judgments but
economic judgments. All Governments will have to consider the impact on
their GDP of the cost not only of mitigating climate change, but of
adapting to it. Sir Nicholas&#146;s speech yesterday further serves
to justify the importance of a more stringent target in the long term
as well as for 2020.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div><a name="080626104000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, if we want the Climate Change Committee to be the final
arbiter, that undermines any case for having a figure in the Bill at
all. We all understand the need for a figure, and of course it can be
amended in the light of the Climate Change Committee&#146;s advice.
As the Minister has said, it is difficult to think of circumstances in
which any Government would not accept that advice, but at the end of
the day, we need a balance of science, economics and politics if we are
to secure international agreement. We need a higher target if we are to
send the right signals about the urgency of making the transition to a
low-carbon economy not only to our own people, but to the nations of
the developing world. There is no realistic possibility of the
developing world coming on board and seriously addressing reductions in
their rate of growth in emissions if the rich countries are not
prepared to set high targets,
too.</div><a name="080626104000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the Minister to consider a point that has not been mentioned yet.
The current position is that the interim Climate Change Committee is
charged with producing its first report on 1 December. Report stage for
this Committee is unlikely to take place before the recess, so the Bill
will be on Report in October or November. In one sense, that highlights
the absurdity of having a target in the Bill that could become obsolete
within a matter of weeks or even days. The Minister should think
seriously about the timing not only of Report but of the Climate Change
Committee&#146;s first report. I know the chair of the committee has
a lot to consider at the moment, but it would not be unreasonable to
bring forward the date of the first report from 1 December
to 1 November, or at the very least to request an interim report from
the Climate Change Committee for publication before Report. In view of
the fact that that perhaps provides the basis for a way forward and a
consensus, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080626104000040"></a>

However, I would like the Minister, in responding to the clause stand
part debate, to give me firm reassurances about subsection
(2).</div>
<a name="080626104000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Secretary of State is going to consider scientific knowledge about
climate change, biodiversity loss will be among the many things that he
will consider. According to Dr. Rodolfo Dirzo, who is a world expert on
biodiversity at Stanford university, the most critical global
environmental change is biological extinction. For one thing,
biological extinction is the only irreversible global environmental
change. Climate change, given enough time and if we do the right things
over a period of time, can be reversed, but if we lose certain species,
it will be impossible to recover them. Environmental damage and
biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems cost between $2.1 trillion to
$4.8 trillion per year&#151;I think that was the figure given at the
conference in Bonn, which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs attended last week or last
month.</div><a name="080626104000065"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000419"></a>David
Maclean:</b> Even if the $4.8 trillion figure is an
exaggeration, the lowest figure is $2.1 trillion per annum according to
a report to the UN convention on biological diversity in Bonn. The
report, entitled &#147;The Economics of Ecosystems and
Biodiversity&#148;, was commissioned by the European Union and the
German Government. For the first time, I believe, the report attaches a
monetary value to the services provided by species and ecosystems. The
report says that those systems are often undervalued by humanity. That
is an important new piece of scientific knowledge relating to climate
change that none of us knew about and which scientists have generally
not taken into account in the
past.</div><a name="080626104000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080626104000420"></a><b class="B">Mr.

is right to point to those figures. I hope that he also agrees that,
even if the figures were not so overwhelming, we have a fundamental
moral duty to hand on the planet in a better state than we received it.
If we handed on to our children, with every year less rather than more,
then we are doing something fundamentally immoral. Contrary to what the
hon. Member for Bury, North has said, some of us based our decisions
about the science on very strong moral arguments, which is why we took
a different view from him&#151;it has nothing to do with our
scientific judgment. We simply put morality

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000421"></a>David
Maclean:</b> My right hon. Friend makes an exceedingly telling
point, and far more eloquently than I could. However, ours is more than
just a moral obligation. Millions of species could be at risk by
2050&#151;not millions of one kind of species, but possibly millions
of different and undiscovered species in the rain forests&#151;and it
would be utterly wrong to lose them. We all worry 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>about the polar bears and orang-utans, which of
course are important, but they are probably sexier and more television
friendly than some of the bugs, creepy crawlies, flora and other things
in the rain forests that could be vital to human health.
Pharmaceuticals, biomedical research, the production of food, whether
on land or in the oceans, fibres, fuel, clean water, healthy soil and
the ability to store carbon all depend on biodiversity. Those are
crucial aspects of scientific knowledge that the Minister ought to
consider.</div><a name="080626104000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am certain that the Secretary of State would consider some of those
things, but I would like the Minister to assure us that, if the power
in clause 3 is exercised, all the biodiversity aspects will be taken
into account&#151;not just whether the temperature is up or down
0.5°, or whether we should opt for 60 or 80 per
cent.</div><a name="080626104000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080626104000422"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. I do not intend to detain
the Committee for long, but I raised some concerns about this clause
earlier. In the previous debate, the Minister told us that in setting
the target the Committee on Climate Change would take into account a
wide set of factors, including economic factors. That is perfectly
reasonable, but my concerns relate to the stage after the target has
been set. Clause 3(1) gives the Secretary of State the power
to alter by order the percentage target. To answer my own Bercow
question, that would be done by the affirmative resolution procedure.
It tends to be assumed that that would be a power to increase the
target after the committee&#146;s report, but as I pointed out on
Tuesday the clause does not state that the target can only be increased
upwards, so the Secretary of State could decrease
it.</div><a name="080626104000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will argue that subsection (2) contains
safeguards by stating what factors must be taken into account in
deciding to amend the percentage target or change the baseline. On the
face of it, that is perfectly true. Indeed, on first reading the
clause, I thought it inconceivable that the target could be reduced,
given the overwhelming amount of scientific evidence pointing to an
increase, whether 60 or 80 per cent. However, I was struck by the
Government impact assessment presented to the Committee on Tuesday. On
page 29, under the heading, &#147;Issue 3: Review of statutory
targets and/or interim budgets&#148;, paragraph 3.2.25
states:</div><a name="080626104000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is important to consider whether, and in what circumstances the
proposed system of unilateral statutory targets and budgets could be
amended in the context of managing environmental risk, economic cost
and wider policy objectives
effectively.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
does that mean?</div>
<a name="080626104000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
following paragraph cites the need to review the multinational
agreement, which might be necessary given the European Union&#146;s
commitment to increase the target in the event of a multilateral
agreement. However, my concern relates to paragraph 3.2.27, which
states that amendments could be made</div>
<a name="080626104000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so that
emissions reductions could be spread over a longer timeframe, if it
became clear that the emissions forecasts used when a budget had
initially been set proved to be significantly inaccurate. This could
result from large changes in the price of gas on international markets,
or the pace of development in a new
technology&#148;.</div><a name="080626104000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
economic factors could come into the equation as well. However, it is
not entirely clear whether that refers only to the carbon budget, or
also to the target itself.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div><a name="080626104000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3.2.28 goes on to
say:</div><a name="080626104000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
capacity to review budgets or targets would enable policy makers to:
minimise economic and social costs and competitiveness risks arising
from significant changes to key drivers of mitigation costs; and,
continue to demonstrate international leadership in the light of
revised assessments surrounding environmental
risk.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to be a much wider interpretation, and allows the Government,
whoever they may be at the time&#151;this is not a party political
point because up to 2050 there will inevitably be changes in
Government, whatever we think about current opinion polls&#151;to
make changes, specifically in the price of gas in international
markets</div><a name="080626104000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later
in our deliberations, we shall come to the rightly wide-ranging factors
that will be taken into account in setting the carbon budget. However,
there is a world of difference between the carbon budget and the 2050
target. The former is a method of delivery, and the latter is the
ultimate destination or the guiding star of where we want to go. Given
that the target was set after taking account of economic and other
factors, and that the budgets are the five-year plans, if that is not
too Stalinist a description, for achieving those targets, I can well
understand that unforeseen and pressing economic reasons may arise, and
that it may necessary to alter a five-year carbon budget, although I
hope that subsequent budgets would try to make up any shortfall.
However, I do not fully understand why it should be necessary to alter
the long-term target as a result of economic changes&#151;such as the
rise in the cost of gas as quoted in the impact assessment&#151;which
one hopes would be relatively short-term economic
shocks.</div><a name="080626104000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000423"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument and
have great sympathy with it, but is it possible to ask a Committee, as
the Government have done, to make a judgment on what targets should be,
but to tell it that those targets must be in only one direction?
Surely, if people are to believe the Committee, it must have the
opportunity at some future date of saying that the science has moved on
and that we need to raise the targets further. Similarly, it must have
the opportunity of offering the Minister the possibility of a
reduction. We do not believe that that would ever happen, but it would
be odd legislation if the Government could not, even on the advice of
the Committee, change the target if something that we know nothing
about now, and which we do not believe will happen because it would
seem almost impossible, were to happen in 2020. There must be a
mechanism whereby the Government could change the targets in either
direction.</div><a name="080626104000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000424"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> With respect, that is not my point. I understand
what the right hon. Gentleman is saying, but my concern is the factors
that allow a change. I accept that if a huge change in the science
proved that climate change was not as bad as we thought&#151;that is
highly unlikely&#151;clearly there would be an argument for reviewing
the
targets.</div><a name="080626104000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that we are setting a target for 2050, by which time I shall
be waiting for my telegram from the Queen. We could be saying that as
gas and oil are going up in price, we must abandon that long-term
target because of what we hope are short-term economic impacts. I can
well understand that in the five-year carbon budget there may have to
be a change to get over an immediate difficulty, but the long-term
target should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>remain in place, and we should make an effort to recalibrate that
long-term target. My concern is that we could have a series of economic
shocks in that long period and find that the Government abandon that
long-term carbon reduction
target.</div><a name="080626104000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no intention of voting against the clause, but I seek reassurance
and an explanation from the Minister, because it not clear from the
final impact assessment whether it refers to the target, or merely to
the carbon budget. It seems to refer to both. I am concerned about that
narrow point&#151;not the scientific evidence, but a change to the
target, perhaps because of an economic downturn or shock within the
period.</div><a name="080626104000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080626104000425"></a><b class="B">Gregory

the Member for Penrith and The Border is proving to be a powerful
champion for the rain forests, building on his important work on behalf
of the United Kingdom at the Rio conference. I endorse his view. The
case for including a consideration of biodiversity loss in the clause
is strong. My right hon. Friend is absolutely right to keep repeating
his concerns about the alarming rate of biodiversity loss. According to
the United Nations global environmental outlet report October
2007, 30 per cent. of amphibians, 23 per cent. of
mammals&#151;</div><a name="080626104000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000426"></a>The

Gentleman. I allowed a certain amount latitude to the right hon. Member
for Penrith and The Border during his contribution, but we are not
debating biodiversity in this clause. If the hon. Gentleman refers to
clause 11, he will see that that debate is more appropriate to that
clause. I would be grateful if the Committee did not enter into a long
debate on that subject.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000427"></a>Gregory

Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): In concluding his
remarks on clause 2, the Minister made some interesting comments
relating to my remarks on how business could prepare. The clause will
allow the Secretary of State to amend the baseline. What the Minister
did not say is whether, in the trajectory towards that, he will give
any illumination on what the percentage target should be, for example
in the run up to 2020. The business community, notably the CBI, has
said that it is keen to have a credible framework for working towards a
low-carbon economy and it believes that the Climate Change Bill can
achieve that. It would particularly welcome the use of an interim
target and rolling carbon budgets to provide that. Is that a
possibility within the context of the clause and later clauses related
to this one?</div>
<a name="080626104000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the Minister could clarify clause 3(4), which
clearly states that the power</div>
<a name="080626104000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may only be
exercised if it appears to the Secretary of state that there have been
significant developments in European or international law or policy
that make it appropriate to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
he therefore suggesting that if a 2009 treaty flows from the Copenhagen

minded to alter the baseline, or is he looking out to the longer

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000429"></a>The
Minister for the Environment (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
I thank you, Mr. Atkinson, and the Committee for some
thoughtful points. Let me try to explain the purpose of the clause
briefly, and then answer the questions equally briefly, I hope. As has
been said, we are talking about the circumstances in which the 2050
target and the baseline year on which it is based&#151;currently
1990&#151;may be amended. We are trying to achieve&#151;all hon.
Members have signed up to this&#151;greater predictability for
businesses and households, so that when they invest in low-carbon
technologies, they do so with confidence. That is why we are setting up
the framework.</div>
<a name="080626104000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we all agree that the legislation is intended to be in place for many
decades. Changes in that period are likely, in both scientific
knowledge and in the international context. With that in mind, we
consider that allowing the 2050 target to be changed through secondary
legislation provides necessary flexibility, but let me give some
reassurances to the Committee. The procedures that have been put in
place to allow this change are especially strong, perhaps stronger than
in other areas of legislation, to ensure that the power is not used
inappropriately. In parliamentary terms, any change in the target or
the baseline year will be subject to affirmative resolution in both
Houses. That is important and will guarantee high levels of
transparency and parliamentary
control.</div><a name="080626104000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="080626104000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
if you will allow me to stray, Mr. Atkinson, under clause 4
no amendment may be made until the advice of the independent committee
has been taken into account and the devolved Administrations have had
the opportunity to make their views
known.</div><a name="080626104000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000430"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> For the sake of those who do not understand the
parliamentary arrangements, will the Minister confirm that the
affirmative resolution procedure will provide strong protection because
it can be voted against in both Houses? People sometimes think that
this is a very complex system. Such statutory instruments cannot be
amended, but they can be defeated. As this is a single and simple
matter, it would easily be defeated were this or any Government to
behave
dishonourably.</div><a name="080626104000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000431"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman who has
vast experience in these matters. He is right. The provisions sound dry
on paper, but if one envisages the circumstances of such a vote, one
can see that they provide surety. My point about the
devolved Administrations is important because this is a United Kingdom
Bill, introduced with the consensus of the devolved Administrations. I
hope that that answer is acceptable to the
Committee.</div><a name="080626104000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will answer the points about the target and then provide the assurances
on biodiversity sought by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The
Border. First, as the hon. Member for Angus is anticipating the arrival
of his telegram so far in advance, I note his acceptance that Scotland
will still be in the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="080626104000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000432"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> The Minister is quite wrong in that assertion. We
seek the dissolution of the Union and of Parliament, not necessarily of
the Crown.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div><a name="080626104000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000433"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am sure that she or he will send a telegram
anyway. However, the hon. Gentleman asked some reasonable questions.
The target can be amended only with regard to developments
in</div><a name="080626104000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;scientific
knowledge about climate
change&#148;</div><a name="080626104000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
in &#147;international law or policy&#148;. I will explain why
&#147;scientific knowledge&#148; includes biodiversity, not just
semantically but legislatively.</div>
<a name="080626104000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
other reason for a change in the target is that the basis of it has
changed. For example, we may add other greenhouse gases to it in the
future. One reason for including changes in international law and
policy, in lay terms, is so that the UK has negotiating power at the
international table. As I have said, the target can be changed only
within those strict criteria and based on the advice to which I have
referred.</div><a name="080626104000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is quite right to push the
Committee and the Government on biodiversity. The phrase,</div>
<a name="080626104000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;scientific
knowledge about climate change&#148;</div>
<a name="080626104000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">includes biodiversity
because that is a scientific point. He mentioned the international
agreements on biodiversity to which the UK has signed up under various
Governments. They include the convention on biological diversity, to
which he referred, the convention on international trade in endangered
species, the convention on the conservation of migratory species of
wild animals and others. Given that the UK is a signatory to those
treaties, the international context provides the protection that he
seeks.</div><a name="080626104000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
establishment of a cap-and-trade system, which this is designed to
accomplish, offers great hope, if not the best hope, for financing the
world&#146;s anti-deforestation measures. The hon. Gentleman will
know that the policy he has pursued has been supported by the
Government, and the United Kingdom has a strong stance on it, although
we would like to have more to do with
it.</div><a name="080626104000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle made his point effectively, and the
hon. Member for Vale of York asked about the trajectory and about
Copenhagen. I think that I have covered the latter, but I ask for help
on the
trajectory.</div><a name="080626104000102"></a>

discovered over the course of our debates, there is some concern that
in future the Government may decline to implement the full advice of
the independent Committee on Climate Change. Amendments Nos. 57 and 70
deal more fully with that, but this is a largely technical amendment,
which would make it clear that the committee&#146;s advice must be
published and that, if decisions made by the Minister differ from the
recommendation, the reason for the difference must also be specified
and published. This is a probing amendment and I shall make my
principal remarks on amendments Nos. 57 and

Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): Clause 4 is about transparency,
which is a wise provision to have in the Bill given the confusion that
we have already witnessed in Committee over the Government&#146;s
intentions on the balance of decision-making power between the
Committee on Climate Change and the Government and/or Parliament. At an
earlier stage of the Bill, the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
seemed to suggest that some hypothetical future Government, in which he
might be a Minister, would always take the committee&#146;s advice.

be as enthusiastic as each other on various things, but everyone is
clear about the fact that there is a specific commitment to accept what
the committee suggests to the Government about the target. We take the
same view as the Government about it being an advisory committee, but
we have said that if the Government are not going to put it in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000443"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> As ever, I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman. Amendment No. 56 refers to the subsection in
which</div><a name="080626104000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
order makes provision different from that recommended by the
committee&#148;.</div><a name="080626104000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
we are discussing the Secretary of State disagreeing with the
committee&#146;s advice. I will resist the temptation to further
debate the party politics, which would not be wise. I accept the good
faith of the Conservative spokesman, on this occasion at
least.</div>
<a name="080626104000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
on other parts of the Bill has also, probably quite accurately,
revealed a level of potential distrust about Government intentions in
such proceedings. We have heard the phrase, &#147;wriggle
room&#148;, and I have worried about the influence of &#147;go-slow
Departments&#148; in other parts of Government perhaps trying to
influence the process. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal
referred to civil servants who might say at some stage in the process,
&#147;Better not Minister&#148;. Therefore, it seems right to have
amendments that make the process absolutely watertight wherever
possible, and in that respect, I happily support amendment No. 56. It
is part of the process of making crystal clear what should happen under
those circumstances, which is that, if the Government differ from the
Committee on Climate Change&#146;s advice on the target, Parliament
must know the reasons why at the time at which the order to change the
target is being laid. That will enable us to test the methodology
suggested, to hold the Government to account and to spot any undue
influence by wrigglers, go-slowers or
better-nots.</div><a name="080626104000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000444"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I hope that amendment No. 56 is not seen in anyway
as an attack on the Government; it is an attempt to ensure that the
Government and any future Government are properly concerned with the
issue. It is important because the Minister has shown himself willing
to try to meet us. I referred on a radio programme to his willingness
to move on the 2° in terms that may be embarrassing to him. I
want to make it clear that the measure is there because we all feel
that all Governments of any kind should be so constrained because it
gives confidence to the public, and, after all, we are looking 40 years
ahead&#151;that is a very long time to predict how good future
Ministers might
be.</div><a name="080626104000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000445"></a>Mr.

pm</div><a name="080626104000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me try to help the Committee. On amendment No. 56, we know that the
Committee on Climate Change has been established to give us expert
advice. Clause 4 requires the Government to take the advice of the
committee before making any amendment to the long-term target. That is
an important part of the process. To reinforce the importance of the
committee&#146;s advice further, we accepted an amendment in the
other place so that if the target is amended in a way that differs from
the committee&#146;s recommendation, the Secretary of State must set
out the reasons for doing so. We accepted that point. It is quite
possible that the Government would want to publish those reasons at the
same time, and as I shall go on to say, it is not only quite possible,
it is quite likely. Any Government will be aware of the likely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>public interest in a change to the long-term target. In addition, clause
3 requires that the order amending the target, as I have said twice
already, must be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I
think that it is unlikely that any Government would be keen to go into
a debate in both Houses without having first made their rationale
clear.</div><a name="080626104000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000446"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I do not think that anybody would doubt the point
that the Minister is making, certainly in respect of the current
Government or the next Administration, so far as we can see. However,
as has been pointed out, we are dealing with the next 40 years here,
and with the best will in the world, it is impossible to try to
anticipate the political make-up or dynamics of an Administration 30 or
40 years hence. Is he confident that he can see that far down the
road?</div><a name="080626104000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000447"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am very confident that I cannot see that far
down the road. I am in a slightly difficult position in that the
Government do not have a position on the tabling of the amendment.
However, I am prepared today to put on record that if this Government
propose to amend the long-term target in a way that differs from the
committee&#146;s advice, we will publish our reasons at the same time
as laying the order for the amendment. I hope that that satisfies the
point that the hon. Gentleman is rightly
making.</div>
<a name="080626104000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000448"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> That is a very generous offer, but it covers only
two of the next 42 years, so it does not really address the substance
of the
point.</div><a name="080626104000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000449"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> As I do not anticipate a change in Government in
the next 42 years, it goes much further than that. I hope that what I
have said gives the hon. Gentleman surety. I do not disagree with the
point that he has made, and I can go as far as putting that commitment
on record. I hope that the Committee will agree that that has been done
in good faith. I thank him for his probing
amendment.</div>
<a name="080626104000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000450"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The amendment was tabled initially as a probing
amendment, but the arguments that the Minister has advanced have done
nothing to reassure me. The key issue is not the good intentions of
this Government, or indeed the next one, but establishing a modus
operandi that would bind all Governments through the next four decades.
We remain somewhat concerned, and although we hear what the Minister
says, we will reserve our position for Report. I do not intend to press
the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080626104000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="080626104000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000451"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in
clause 4, page 3, line 17, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Before
laying before Parliament an order making provision different from that
recommended by the Committee, the Secretary of State shall consult the
Committee on the effect that difference will have on the risks for the
United Kingdom of the predicted impact of climate
change.&#146;.</div><a name="080626104000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000452"></a>The

amendment No. 70, in
clause 55, page 26, line 2, at

<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) In preparing reports
under this section the Secretary of State must have regard to whether
the net UK carbon account is within the indicative annual range for the
relevant periods and the effect of any differences on the risks for the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000453"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> As we have just heard, amendment No. 56 would have
required the Secretary of State, in the event of setting a target that
differed from that recommended by the committee, to publish at the same
time as resetting the target the reasons why the advice of the
committee was not followed. Moreover, in the event of a Government
ignoring its advice&#151;we are not anticipating that the Government
today, or next year, or the year after would do so, but we are looking
at the whole lifetime of the legislation until 2050&#151;amendment
No. 57 would require the Secretary of State of the day to consult the
committee on what effect that diversion from its scientific advice
would have on the risks that the UK would face from the predicted
impact of man-made climate change.</div>
<a name="080626104000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 70 would then further require the Secretary of State to consider
whether the country was still on course to meet its indicative annual
range when making the report on the impact of climate change. In the
absence of the amendment, the Government of the day could more easily
ignore the good counsel of the independent committee and make a
decision based on political challenges or even political
expediency.</div><a name="080626104000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080626104000454"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Will the hon. Gentleman clarify a
point? He is suggesting that if the Minister decides to ignore the
committee, he must ask its advice on the implications of doing so. Is
the Minister then bound to take notice of that advice? Is there a
sanction if he fails to take notice of the committee&#146;s advice on
the implications of his ignoring it in the first
place?</div><a name="080626104000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000455"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> No. The process would inform debate in Parliament,
as the matter would be one for Parliament. Debate in Parliament, and
indeed in the country, would be better informed about the intended
consequences of the Minister&#146;s actions. It is likely that the
Minister will wish not to reject out of hand what the committee advises
but to trim. It is unlikely to be black or white. The Minister might
say, &#147;We&#146;re going to have some difficulty with this.
We&#146;re not going to implement the Committee&#146;s
recommendations fully.&#148;</div>
<a name="080626104000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, we will be facing a new scenario. It is thus important that the
House of Commons and the public at large have access to the
committee&#146;s opinion, rather than leaving the impact of the
revised strategy to further interpretation, especially by the
Government of the day.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000456"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I hesitate to differ with the hon. Gentleman on
his own amendment, but it actually
says:</div><a name="080626104000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000457"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman
understands. The Minister would consult the committee, but he would
then have to report to Parliament. There would be a debate when he laid
his budgets. There would still be five-yearly budgets, and there would
still be debates in Parliament, but the Minister would have to consult
the committee on the impact of his
decision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div><a name="080626104000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000458"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Surely my hon. Friend is drawing attention to
something that is already a failing of the Environment Agency? There is
a worry that when the Environment Agency&#146;s advice is turned into
ministerial propositions, it is often not tested against the
Environment Agency. He is on to an important point: Parliament must be
able to debate such matters with the knowledge of the
committee&#146;s judgment of the Government&#146;s proposed
changes. Parliament may well say, &#147;It seems that the
Government&#146;s got it right,&#148;&#151;I am not suggesting
that it will always be on the committee&#146;s side&#151;but we
must know from an authoritative source what the effect of that change
might
be.</div><a name="080626104000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000459"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Absolutely spot on. Once again, my right hon.
Friend puts it far more eloquently and articulately than I could hope
to do. He has encapsulated the argument. We want to avoid a situation
in which the committee has only one opportunity to give its opinion,
which may be reinterpreted by the Minister. We argue that if the
Government are willing to depart from the committee&#146;s advice,
they should have to explain to the public why they are doing so and be
told authoritatively by the committee what effect that decision might
have on the impact of climate change. We do not perceive this to be a
problem in the short term, but as the life of the legislation will
extend all the way to 2050, it needs to be foreshadowed in the
Bill.</div><a name="080626104000140"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000460"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I apologise for not saying when I first spoke how
good it is to be serving under your chairmanship, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="080626104000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we accept for a moment the hypothetical possibility that at some stage
during the next 40 years there might be a Conservative Government, I
suppose that it is wise to be cautious about their ability to wriggle
out of certain commitments. It might be more likely that there will be
a Liberal Democrat Government in that time scale. Who knows? The Leader
of the Opposition might be from the Green party. If we accept that
there will be Governments of different colours and opinions, it is wise
to propose amendments that would make processes more watertight and
transparent, so, in that sense, I support the spirit of the amendment
and certainly accept the Conservative Front Benchers&#146; good
intentions. However, I do not think that amendments Nos. 57 and 70 are
as critically important as amendment No.
56.</div><a name="080626104000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the circumstances that amendment No. 57 envisages&#151;when the
Government appear to be obstinately refusing to take account of the
committee&#146;s advice&#151;it is likely that we would all be able
to draw our own conclusions about the likely impact of climate change
on the UK. If we do not, civil society and non-governmental
organisations will do so in our
stead.</div><a name="080626104000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000461"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying and
agree to a large extent, but amendment No. 57 proposes that
the Secretary of
State</div><a name="080626104000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
consult the Committee on the effect&#148;.</div>
<a name="080626104000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does not that give the
committee the chance to say, when the Government do not accept its
advice, that that will mean X, Y and Z? Given the argument about the
importance of scientific evidence, it would be useful for Members of
Parliament to have that before them when they debate the matter in the
House.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div><a name="080626104000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000462"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but I do
not think that that is necessary in the context of the Bill as a whole
because the committee&#146;s responsibility is to adjust the budget
and look sector by sector at the impact regarding the future plans. It
will still be mandated to only those targets and will make further
advice based on the Government&#146;s revised position, including
their refusal to accept a target at that position. Therefore, the
committee&#146;s processes will reveal a lower opinion on the impact
and certainly the steps that need to be taken. He might be right that
that could be useful. It would certainly serve one purpose: to add to
the embarrassment of any Government who were needlessly wimping out of
tough decisions. In that respect, I have enough sympathy with the
amendment to allow it to go
forward.</div><a name="080626104000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000463"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I will try to resist the temptation to remark that
some Committee members find it impossible to put party politics aside,
even when they clearly do not arise, and that is always true of the
Liberal Democrats, as one of their Members has shown regularly in this
debate. That is sad, because this is an issue on which we ought to try
as hard as possible to have a common view.</div>
<a name="080626104000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why I hope that the Minister will find a reason to go at least some way
towards this relates to the simple matter of the Environment Agency. I
happen to have invented and set up the Environment Agency, so I know
what I got wrong. I thought that I had set up an independent agency
that would provide advice from which the public and Ministers could
take their view. Over the years, the Environment Agency has come to
provide advice that fits in with the budget that the Government set for
things, and that is altogether different from the original
intention.</div>
<a name="080626104000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
constituency, for example, the Environment Agency advises the
Government on coastal defence on the basis of the three-year budget
that is put in place, even though the advice ought to be based on what
might happen over the next 100 years. I had hoped that the Environment
Agency, as is stated in legislation, would announce its advice in
general on various scenarios so that the Government could then decide
on a scenario, take responsibility for it, accept the agency&#146;s
independent advice on the cost, and then decide what had to be done and
what the timetable would be.</div>
<a name="080626104000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
experience leads me to be concerned that the Minister and the
committee, because of their good heartedness, believe that no one would
behave differently from them. I feel rather bitter about that example
because the result is not what I thought would happen. It would be
helpful to make it clear that at the point at which Parliament is
discussing that disagreement, there will be a real objective assessment
of the difference between what would happen if we followed either the
Climate Change Committee&#146;s proposal or the Government&#146;s
alternative suggestion. This would not tie the Government any more. It
does not make this less of an advisory committee; indeed, it makes it
more of an advisory committee. However, the amendment does mean that if
we were faced with such a situation in the House of Commons and the
House of Lords, we could say, &#147;This is what the committee says.
It is not worth making this change; we have to tell the Government that
really the cost of this is not satisfactory.&#148; We would be able
to debate the matter without trading disagreeable bits of
science.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div><a name="080626104000366"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2 pm</div>
<a name="080626104000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to enter into this issue too deeply, but one of the problems with
the science is that it is rare that there is much agreement on a
specific thing, although, for example, there is widespread agreement on
a target of 80 per cent. plus. However, many bits of the science are
much more complex, so arguments can be deployed on either
side.</div><a name="080626104000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament
would do well to insist that it had the latest judgment of the
committee on the Government&#146;s proposals in its debates so that
an informed decision could be taken. That would underline the role and
the importance of
Parliament.</div><a name="080626104000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot imagine that this Government would not go back to the committee
or that they would not tell people what the committee had actually said
and pretend that it had said something else. However, I hope that they
will be prepared to accept the amendment simply because it would do
them no harm. It would not do any harm to the next Government, but it
might ensure that at some time in the future, when times were tough
just before an election, somebody would not try to do something through
which Parliament was not given the
truth.</div><a name="080626104000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000464"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman a serious
question, and also, as a flood-hit MP myself, pay compliment to his
achievement in setting up the Environment Agency, which was appreciated
last year. The body of work required to deliver on the amendment is
substantial. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that by the time that
work has been completed and the committee has delivered its conclusion
on the likely impacts of the change, it might as well have undertaken
the work of the reassessing the carbon
budget?</div><a name="080626104000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000465"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> That intervention worries me, because the sort of
changes that we envisage are changes of considerable importance. If the
hon. Gentleman is saying that Parliament would have to rubber-stamp or
agree to the Government&#146;s changes without those changes being
satisfactorily tested against the knowledge and the science, that would
be very dangerous. The committee would have to get a wiggle on, talking
about wiggle in a different sense. It would have to do the work and
provide the Government with a clear indication of the consequence of
the decision to ignore its advice. That advice to the Government should
be available to Parliament so that we can make a sensible decision. If
the Government had got it right, no doubt we would support it, and if
the Government had got it wrong, no doubt we would oppose it, but at
least we would do so in full knowledge of the
facts.</div><a name="080626104000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000466"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle for moving the amendments. Let me make three points to back up
my argument that the amendments are reasonable, but the process is
covered by other clauses, particularly clauses 33 and
55.</div><a name="080626104000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first point is the most important. There is a danger of us
misunderstanding the relationship between UK emissions and temperature
in the UK. The UK&#146;s contribution accounts for 2 per cent. The
change in the target is very important for the carbon budgets, and only
in the context that I described could it take place. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>The link between the possible change in target and
the potential change in temperature is less than the margin of error in
the calculations in the first place.</div>
<a name="080626104000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
always remember that our emissions do not dictate our average
temperature. A constituent of the Under-Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewisham, Deptford asked her the other day whether she could avoid
climate change by going to her house in France, which rather
crystallises the difficulty that some people have. I am not suggesting
that the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle has that difficulty, and
certainly not that the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal has. It
was just a point worth making.</div>
<a name="080626104000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 33(2)
states:</div>
<a name="080626104000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Advice
given by the Committee under this section must also contain the reasons
for that
advice.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is envisaged that the committee will put forward various public
scenarios containing ranges, given that we are talking not about
arithmetic but about science. As the months and years roll on, the
United Kingdom climate impact programme, which we will publish in
November, will play an important role. It is relevant practically to
the Bill, and it will set out the United Kingdom&#146;s best science
to give us the range of scenarios based on parts per million and on
temperatures.</div>
<a name="080626104000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 57 and 70 are already covered by the processes in the legislation,
and because of the scenarios that I have described, the amendments
would not achieve precisely or even generally what the hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle seeks. I shall back up that point. Clause 4 already
requires the Secretary of State to set out his reasons, and if he were
to set the 2050 target at a level different from that which was
recommended, there would still be transparency, because in those
reasons, one would see the scenario with which he had differed from the
committee. That is a long-winded way of saying that one would already
be able to see the committee&#146;s advice in the Secretary of
State&#146;s scenario, were it to differ from the
committee&#146;s.</div>
<a name="080626104000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000467"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> What happens if the committee gives three
scenarios and the Minister decides not to take any of them? The Bill
does not say that he has to take any. He could take one that was
mid-way between two of them. In other words, he could modify the
scenario, and there would be no independent evaluation of what happens.
Indeed, that is exactly my concern. In those circumstances, lay
people&#151;Ministers are usually lay people&#151;would be able to
say, &#147;It looks more or less right. I think we can&#146;t quite
do that, but if we come in between them, it ought to be okay.&#148;
There might be very good reasons why that would not work
satisfactorily, and I should be happier if I knew what the committee
thought about, let us say, a mid-point between two of its
scenarios.</div>
<a name="080626104000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000468"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I take the point, but in practice the
committee&#146;s publication of its advice and reasons would cover
those potential circumstances. It would be like publishing a logarithm
book. It would contain all the options. Because the relationship
between UK emissions changes at the margin, remembering that we are
talking about the cumulative amount of carbon in the air under the
curve of the trajectory over that long period, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>relationship between UK emissions and the global
temperature is less than the margin of error in those scenarios, even
on current knowledge.</div>
<a name="080626104000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There could
not be any gap. Parliament would go bonkers and would turn down the
affirmative resolution if the Secretary of State were to deviate from
the accepted advice of the committee. I cannot see that arising, as the
committee&#146;s advice would be public. The UK climate impacts
programme will be hugely important in setting the scenario, and will
evolve. It is not conceivable that the Secretary of State would deviate
from the target in a manner that was not based on the scenarios and
premises of that programme&#146;s report. I urge the Committee to
consider achieving the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reasonable objective
through clauses 33 and
55.</div><a name="080626104000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000469"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation. It is considerably more sensible and rational that the
disappointing partisan comments from the Lib Dems which, if anything,
water down and weaken the Bill, rather than improve
it.</div><a name="080626104000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the Minister&#146;s argument, but I do not agree that
clauses 33 and 55 achieve exactly what my amendments propose.
Amendments Nos. 57 and 70 would bring greater clarity and certainty to
any future decision-making process. However, I appreciate that a
further layer of the onion lies beneath those clauses. If it is
intended to publish a range of scenarios, more information will be
available than one would have anticipated from a straight reading of
the Bill. On the understanding that that is how it is intended that the
Bill be interpreted and the committee will
function&#151;</div><a name="080626104000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000470"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b><b class="B"> </b>Has the hon. Gentleman considered that the
devolved Administrations would have to be consulted? I am sure they
would set out their reasons. That might give him further
reassurance.</div><a name="080626104000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000471"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Yes, the devolved Administrations are an
interesting element of the Bill. We will discuss their role later,
particularly the ability of the Secretary of State, rather than the
Prime Minister, to have a genuine locus in the decisions taken by the
devolved Administrations. What we have is not perfect, but I take on
board the Minister&#146;s arguments and reassurances. On balance, and
in the interests of forging consensus where possible, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080626104000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000473"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am mindful of your strictures, Mr.
Atkinson. I refer the Minister to my earlier comments and to the point
raised by the CBI. Clause 5 deals with the setting of five-year carbon
budgets, on which we all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>agree, and the setting by 1 June 2009 of three
consecutive carbon budgets for three-year periods. The CBI broadly
supports that. The Federation of Small Businesses also supports it, but
commented:</div><a name="080626104000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
balance between economic growth and environmental legislation must be
maintained because only by increased investment in research and
development by the private sector will we find solutions to the
problems of climate
change.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI says that it wants a credible framework within which to work
towards a low-carbon economy, and it believes that the interim target
and rolling carbon budgets could help by giving the right balance of
certainty and flexibility. It goes on to say
that</div><a name="080626104000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;alongside
the risks, the shift to a low carbon economy offers the UK a unique
opportunity to develop innovative environmental technologies of the
future and prosper in new, multi-billion-dollar world
markets&#151;but only if research funding is better co-ordinated and
prioritised.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today,
at Innovation, Universities and Skills questions, the Minister for
Science and Innovation announced, in response to a question, a
multi-million pound research programme for delivering the building of a
low-carbon
economy.</div>
<a name="080626104000367"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="080626104000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the interests of joined-up government, can the Minister give the
Committee an assurance today that he is going to satisfy the points
raised by business, through the Federation of Small Businesses and the
Confederation of British Industry, that targets will be set? His own
final impact assessment, to which I referred in relation to previous
clauses, and page 17 of the Stern review suggest that industrial
sectors with high-energy intensive production exposed to international
competition are probably going to face the most adverse impact on
output and employment.</div>
<a name="080626104000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to support what the Minister is doing, but can he satisfy business that
there are going to be measures whereby the environmental targets that
he is expressing in the Bill are balanced by some degree of inducement
to change behaviour, perhaps by using alternatives to fossil fuels, and
encourage less intensive energy burning of fuels generally? In trying
to change business behaviour through the carbon budgets imagined in
clause 5, is it the Government&#146;s intention to use the moneys
that they have set aside to encourage businesses to change their
practices in that
way?</div><a name="080626104000177"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000474"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I have a staggeringly brief question.</div>
<a name="080626104000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
carbon budget will be set in 2009 for the five-year period 2008-12. It
took years of study to work that one out. Will the Minister say more
about why the first set of targets partly relates to history?
Clause 5(1)(b) states that the duty of the Secretary of
State is to ensure that the carbon account does not exceed this figure.
He obviously cannot exercise that duty historically, because there are
no levers he can pull. Why does the period not start in
2009?</div><a name="080626104000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000475"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I just thought of another reason why I was hoping
for inspiration.</div>
<a name="080626104000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
help if I point out to the Committee that about half of UK emissions
are already covered by the European trading scheme. The big emitters
are already there, so to respond the important question asked by the
hon. Member for Vale of York about surety for business investment, we
have some experience to build on. In a sense, it is a chicken and egg
situation. A large 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>part of the benefit of a carbon market is that it
creates investment opportunities. The private sector is going to have
to provide 85 to 90 per cent. of world finance for the low-carbon world
economy, and the carbon markets are there to incentivise, as she
accepts. Although one is never as sure as one would like to be, the
great advantage to business of the Bill and the approach of five-year
budgets is that they provide certainty. That we can talk about the
position 15 years ahead and rolling on provides that certainty. That
point has been supported by businesses in the consultation and during
consideration of the draft Bill.</div>
<a name="080626104000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will lay
out briefly the reasons for the timetable, which will answer the
question the hon. Member for Northavon asked. The first reason we chose
that timetable is to dovetail with international time scales. The first
budget period, 2008-12, runs concurrently with the first commitment
period under Kyoto and the second phase of the European Union emissions
trading scheme, so it makes sense from that point of view. I will not
go into the reasons why five years is preferred to one&#151;I think
there will be some debate on that
later.</div><a name="080626104000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another reason that is not in my speaking notes, but that is
important. It is not a retrospective decision: we will take the
measurements that were already reported under Kyoto and build those
into the budget, but what starting in 2008 does is provide an absolute
guarantee to business, to the markets and to everyone else that there
has not been a political fix in the period. If we were to preannounce
what the first budgetary period was going to be, everybody would shift
their organisation in such a way as to get the best advantage.
Theoretically&#151;it could not happen because of the ETS&#151;a
company could switch off the power for a couple of weeks in winter to
show a much lower baseline. That is a theoretical example, as I said,
and I have nobody in mind, but that could be a problem and we want to
avoid it. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question.</div><a name="080626104000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the strongest parts in the Bill&#151;an aspect on which there is a
very strong consensus&#151;is found in this clause and the related
clauses on the creation of carbon budgets. With our European partners,
we are world leaders in this field, and I have been delighted to note
the development of carbon budgets, or the research to prepare for them,
elsewhere. I am pleased there is consensus. I hope I have answered hon.
Members&#146; questions

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000476"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in
clause 6, page 3, line 37, leave
out &#145;26%&#146; and insert
&#145;35%&#146;.</div><a name="080626104000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we go again. With your strictures in mind, Mr Atkinson, we
will not repeat the debate about targets, but the amendment deals with
the interim figure in the Bill. There are only two principal numbers in
the Bill&#151;60 and 26&#151;and we are suggesting that 26 be
replaced by 35. Why 35 specifically? It is because we
asked, if 60 per cent. became 80 per cent. what
would have to happen to 26 per cent.? It was no
more sophisticated than that, but there are more fundamental questions
at stake.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div><a name="080626104000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
should we view the trajectory for 2050? 2020 matters for a number of
reasons. One is that it is the end point for a number of commitments,
negotiations and promises at EU level and beyond. It matters also
because of political accountability. Although I do not suppose that any
current Ministers will be Ministers in 2050, or in senior
positions&#151;although you never know&#151;it is at least credible
that there is some political continuity over a decade, so having a
realistic target for 2020 is more realpolitik than something decades
hence.</div><a name="080626104000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been some discussion of whether we have a steady progression to
2050, and the 2020 target would be an interim target. There seem to be
two counter-arguments to that. One is that there is &#147;low-hanging
fruit&#148;: in other words, the easy carbon savings will be made
first, so we ought to be able to get more than halfway to the 2050
target by halfway through the time period&#151;2020 bisects the
period between 1990 and 2050. The other counter-argument says, no, it
takes time to innovate and for big capital projects to come on stream,
so we should be more gentle with the earlier target. We have not, in
our amendment, taken a view on that or changed the Government&#146;s
judgment on that. We have simply made a pro-rata change from 26 per
cent. to 35 per cent. in the way that 60 per cent. was
changed to 80 per cent.. So, assuming we end up with 80 per cent., via
whatever mechanism, 35 per cent. has the same relationship to 80 per
cent. that 26 per cent. had to 60 per cent.. We have not
altered the judgment on whether it is easy or difficult to make headway
in the earlier phases&#151;that is a separate
debate.</div><a name="080626104000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
difficulty we had in trying to prepare for this debate is the many
different targets and objectives there are for 2020, with different
baselines and different coverage. The Minister knows that there are
targets for everything excluding the emissions trading scheme; targets
based on 2005 figures; and targets that cover all greenhouse gases and
some that cover only CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">.</span> It is rather hard to
get one&#146;s head round which targets one is talking about and how
they all fit together. I hope the Minister will give us a feel for how
the number we end up with in clause 6 fits together with the various
obligations that the UK has entered into and those that the EU has
entered into, and with the Kyoto
process.</div><a name="080626104000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is prompted in part by the debate on Second Reading, because
it was repeatedly said, by a number of hon. Members both on this
Committee and in the House, that we need to get on with the process.
Although the Minister hypothesises doing nothing for 49 years and then
suddenly doing it all in the final year, we all know that we have to
get on with it. The interim staging post then becomes important as a
signal of how serious we are. Our worry about leaving 26 per cent. in
the Bill&#151;I know the phrase used is &#147;at least 26 per
cent.&#148;, but it could be &#147;at least zero&#148; and one
could argue that we do not need to worry about it&#151;is that if
there is to be a number there, &#146;twere better that &#146;twere
the right one.</div>
<a name="080626104000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give a
feel for what 26 per cent. would mean, the Tyndall Centre for Climate
Change Research has looked at the current targets and has suggested
that, under present targets, the total emissions we
would be talking about over the period 2000 to 2050
would be 7.5 billion tonnes of carbon&#151;massively in excess of the
carbon 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>budget of 4.6 billion tons that is compatible with
the 2° C goal we have all been talking
about.</div><a name="080626104000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be frank, 35 per cent. is at the cautious end of the range. A steady
reduction across the whole period, compatible with the budget we have
just discussed, would need 38 per cent. by 2020. We certainly have not
over-egged this&#151;if anything, it is at the cautious end of the
scale&#151;but to accept the amendment would be an important
indication of how seriously the problem is being
taken.</div><a name="080626104000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been talking about the 2050 target, and there are whole sections
of the Bill about how that target can be amended, but as far as I can
see there is nothing specifically about how the 26 per cent. target can
be amended. All the stuff about amendments and consultation and so on
relates to clause 2. Yes, there will be carbon budgets, and they will
imply particular levels of cut, but as far as I can see there is no
provision for changing the 26 per cent. figure.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If I listen very carefully, I
might hear where it is. Is there a danger that we will leave in statute
a number we are all agreed is wrong?
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If the Minister could get his
official to hold up that number of fingers again, it would be very
helpful. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">] </i>Ah, clause 7. In
principle, all the focus is clearly on the 60 per cent. or
80 per cent. figure, and it would be a worry if we left the 26 in,
particularly if we thought we would end up with 80 per
cent.</div>
<a name="080626104000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080626104000477"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for giving way just before he concludes. I have followed
his argument with great interest and I welcome his emphasis on this
target, because it is the target that will bite on today&#146;s
decision making. Will he clarify the economic consequences of moving
from the 26 per cent. to 35 per cent. target? The Committee ought to
get a sense of the cost attached to the
Bill.</div><a name="080626104000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000478"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the final impact
assessment provides those figures based on 60 per cent. and
on 80 per cent., and 35 per cent. is the number consistent with 80 per
cent. It is the stepping stone to 80 per cent. in the same
way that 26 per cent. is the stepping stone to 60 per cent. All the
analysis has been done by the Government on that basis.</div>
<a name="080626104000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal rightly asked about the economic cost
of not getting on with all of this. There is, as we have said, a huge
potential benefit. To some extent, the argument for 35 per cent. is
also the argument for 80 per cent., and I will not rehash all of that.
There is, however, a separate set of arguments, first about the
consistency of all the other 2020 goals we have entered into, secondly
about the trajectory, and most of all about the importance of early
progress. What matters is in the jargon &#147;the area under the
curve&#148;, that is the cumulative emissions. If we are not quite
serious that quite soon we are going to make big headway, then the
goals for 2050 will not be worth having because we will already have
done the
damage.</div><a name="080626104000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="080626104000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000479"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Past sins are supposed to throw long shadows. One
problem we face is that we have all experienced a long succession of
energy Bills with no targets that could possibly relate to the
ministerial experience of anybody on the Floor of
the House. All 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>the targets were, at the very
least, for times when those who set them would be taking well earned
rests in retirement homes. Some have pointed out that energy Bills
originally contained more targets, but they were taken out on the
&#147;better not&#148; principle&#151;a Minister should not
promise to achieve something by a time when he might still be a
Minister, because somebody might draw his attention to
it.</div><a name="080626104000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that point because as a Minister of State at the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I proposed a review of a decision
about fishing off the coast of north-east England to take place five
years after the decision, never thinking that I would come back as the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the review was due to
take place. I recognise the temptation to avoid such
situations.</div><a name="080626104000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore start by being relatively sympathetic to the amendment. If I
had not already made it clear that I feel we must have certainty about
the full length of the thing, I might well have joined the Liberal
Democrats in supporting the amendment. However, I hope the Minister
will reassert the truth that everything we do immediately is worth a
great deal more than everything we do in 10 years&#146;
time and that everything we do in 10 years&#146; time is worth a
great deal more than what we do in 20 years&#146; time. If
it were not for the ancient sins, I would be relatively happy, because
it is manifestly true that getting things right now has a huge
advantage over leaving them until
later.</div><a name="080626104000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a matter of morality, because to leave the next generation with a
worse problem than we have would be peculiarly unpleasant. I hope the
Minister will reassure us by saying clearly that it is the intention of
the Government to use whatever time they have to do as much as they can
as soon as possible. That will make it easier to deal with these
problems as we go
along.</div><a name="080626104000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I hope the Minister will reassure me that there will be no temptation
within the five-year periods to leave that which needs to be achieved
until the end. I accepted his explanation for having five-year periods
and supported the idea. For the reasons that I have mentioned, it is
easier and better to do things earlier. If things are allowed to pile
up, there will come a stage when the problem cannot be solved, rather
like the debt that some of our constituents come to our constituency
surgeries to resolve. I am sure other hon. Members agree that often in
one&#146;s surgery, one thinks, &#147;If only this person had come
to me three years ago, I could have done something about it. The debt
is now so vast that nothing can be done.&#148; I am terribly keen
that the Minister should commit himself to saying that this Government
will do as much as they can as early as possible to meet the interim
target and the five-yearly budget
arrangements.</div><a name="080626104000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
many of us expect the advice from the Committee on Climate Change to
have a big effect on the interim target. If so, will the Minister
ensure that the Government respond rapidly to give industry the
opportunity to understand how the decision-making process should be
affected? I do not think that we can resile from targets that are based
on science on the basis that we cannot manage them, because climate
change does not stop. The target is there not because we can do it, but
because we know what will happen if we do not meet that target. I hope
that he will undertake that,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>should the target be significantly higher than the
one in the Bill, he would take immediate action to
spell out the Government&#146;s view of what that would mean for
personal action, governmental action and business
action.</div><a name="080626104000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000480"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The point made by the hon. Member for Northavon
about the capacity in the Bill to amend the 2020 target is an important
one, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to that
later. The basic principle that he is arguing for&#151;that deeper
cuts made earlier will be necessary and are more useful&#151;is a
sound one that all the scientific evidence supports and Lord
Stern&#146;s report endorsed.</div>
<a name="080626104000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am deeply
sceptical of our capacity to secure a cut of 35 per cent. by 2020. That
is partly why, although I am instinctively sympathetic to the
principle, I am nervous about suggesting that that target should be
stated and supported at this stage. Of course, 2020 is conceivably the
final year of the next Parliament but one. That is an important point
to make, because it reminds us that this issue is about not just
setting targets for the distant future, but matching targets to
policies. Earlier I gently criticised the official Opposition and the
disconnect between some of the ambitions for which they are arguing and
the reality of their voting record. The same applies to the Liberal
Democrats: there is a disconnect between their hugely ambitious efforts
to support the highest targets and the reality of their support for
particular policies when it comes to a vote in the House.</div>
<a name="080626104000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I touched on
the point that there is nothing magic about 2020. Arguably, it would be
more effective if we had not only a more stringent target for 2020,
which I hope we will have, but an earlier target. The beauty of a
target for 2015 is that it could well be the final year of the next
Parliament, and therefore all parties would have to match up their
support for a target with a set of principles, policies and mechanisms
in their election manifesto. The argument for changing the target date
from 2020 to 2015 is stronger than the argument for changing, at this
stage, the current 2020 target of 26 per cent. to a higher target.
Having a 2015 target, which nobody has yet suggested and there is no
amendment on the order paper to that effect, would force each and every
one of us and our parties, the leadership and the membership, to
concentrate their minds on the kinds of policies necessary to deliver
that target.</div>
<a name="080626104000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it
seems that the argument I made in support of my proposal to move the
2050 target earlier may be the way forward. My argument was that there
is a consensual way forward by reconsidering the date for the Report
Stage of the Bill, together with the date that has been given to the
Committee on Climate Change to produce its first report. We can find a
way forward that everybody can agree upon if we bring forward the
release of the Climate Change Committee&#146;s advice to before the
Report stage of the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000481"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The argument made by the hon. Member for Northavon
has considerable merit. The substance of his argument, that early
action is more effective and more cost-effective than delayed action is
absolutely correct. That is the accepted wisdom&#151;a point made
crystal clear by Lord Stern and many others, and reinforced by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="080626104000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I also have considerable sympathy with the point made by the hon.
Member for Bury, North that there is nothing magic about 2020. That is
why in the past the Conservative party has expressed considerable
support for the notion of rolling annual targets, because it is vital
that each Parliament and every year we have a clear trajectory to
follow. We should audit our progress regularly, so that we do
not&#151;for reasons of political expediency, bad luck or a change in
economic circumstance, or for reasons entirely beyond the control of
the Government of the day&#151;find ourselves suddenly towards the
end of the accounting period engaged in a desperate game of catch-up,
when really there is no hope at all. Therefore, there is a risk that we
do not meet that target, whether the 2020 target is a reduction of 26
per cent., or higher. To me, as a layman, there is considerable merit
in having a higher target. I appreciate the arguments in favour of 35
per cent. Equally, I agree with the hon. Member for Bury, North that
that is going to be a stretching target. However, it is one that we
have to show real courage and vision in supporting, not only to do our
part in the war against climate change, but to ensure that we are able
to reap the opportunities that will come from the new low-carbon
age.</div>
<a name="080626104000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
ensure that UK plc is a real first mover and that we pioneer the new
low-carbon economy. Our industry and commerce will be the first truly
low-carbon economy in the world only if we move ambitiously
on those markets. If we do that and seize the opportunities,
we can turn this around. For all the problems that will necessarily
arise as we try to wean ourselves off old-fashioned fossil fuels, there
will be opportunities that will give rise to economic
growth, new industries and new jobs. Look at the jobs
created in Germany, which has a far more ambitious and effective policy
of pursuing renewable energy. More than 200,000 new jobs have been
created in the renewables industry there, and within the
next couple of years that industry is set to overtake the German car
manufacturing industry, which was one of the largest employers. It is
important that we balance the opportunities and difficulties of meeting
those stretching
targets.</div><a name="080626104000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Conservatives will support a yet more stretching target, and we
will do everything we can to implement a more ambitious and dynamic
policy to push forward industrial change to meet those near-term
targets, we come back to our belief that those targets should be set by
the Committee on Climate Change and that they should be testing. We
should not underestimate the difficulty and complexity of working out
the targets. It is therefore right that they should not be set on the
say-so of politicians or as part of a bidding war between the parties
about who is the greenest of them all. If we are going to carry the
population with us, we have to show that the targets are based on sound
scientific evidence. We have to show the
working.</div><a name="080626104000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I would like the Climate Change Committee to be able to give its view
on the targets before the Bill completes its passage through
Parliament, I think it most important that the committee is the body
that has the say-so on raising the figure. It is clear from clauses
7(1) and 6(1)(a) that there is a mechanism within the Bill to amend the
2020 figure, so that need not concern our Committee. Therefore, while
not doubting for a moment that we need to be ambitious and to move 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>early, I would oppose the amendment, as we believe
that it should be the Climate Change Committee that informs any
necessary move
upwards.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000482"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Northavon for
tabling the amendment. When I saw the amendments, I thought that the
debate on this one would be the most important, and as he rightly said,
we have already debated its principles in
Committee&#151;thankfully.</div><a name="080626104000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall address the specific first and then the general. The specific
point is contained in clause 7(1), and it is amplified in clause 8 in
respect of the proposed duties on the Secretary of State and his
relationship with the committee. This debate parallels the debate on
the 60 per cent. and 80 per cent. long-term target, and the
three points that the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal made give
us the reasons why. Greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, and some of
them last for 100 years&#151;CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>being a case in point.
Therefore, the second budgetary period must take into account the
accumulated emissions of the previous
period.</div><a name="080626104000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
situation is not like opening a window to let the gas drift away when
the stove has been turned on but not lit; it does not work like that.
It is more like a car engine running in a sealed garage: one has to
turn the engine off quickly to have any hope of staying alive. That
accumulation of gases is the
point.</div><a name="080626104000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the parallel with the level of debt, when a constituent is heavily in
debt, it is in one sense easier than when they are less in debt. As the
old adage goes, a &#163;100 overdraft is my problem; a &#163;1
million overdraft is the bank manager&#146;s problem. Unfortunately,
as the right hon. Gentleman said, there is no bankruptcy with
greenhouse gas, so his point about rapidity and the point in the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Northavon are absolutely right.
The rapidity of the measures will build on the existing European
trading scheme and climate change agreements. There is also the carbon
emissions reduction target scheme, as well as the carbon reduction
commitment, which starts in 2010 and will have a profound effect on
attitudes.</div>
<a name="080626104000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
schemes herald the way for the Budget, and as the Chancellor has said,
following the committee&#146;s advice, the carbon budgets will be
announced in spring next year. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but
I shall not go into the detail about why the Government do not like the
35 per cent. target at this stage. It was debated significantly during
pre-legislative consultation and in the other place. Indeed, to try to
satisfy that figure, the Government amended the clause in response to
similar points made in the other
place.</div><a name="080626104000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman, however, asked an important question about how the
figure fits into the European and international contexts. We have
picked the range before us to fit the European context. At least 26 per
cent. is itself a stretching target for the country, but it is
consistent with the European Union&#146;s greenhouse gas target for
2020&#151;whether the current 20 per cent. reduction, or a 30 per
cent. reduction should the EU be able to offer it as an incentive to
the rest of the world for an international
agreement.</div><a name="080626104000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have examined the trajectory to ensure that it works in both European
scenarios, and indeed it will do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>so consistent with the long-term target. The hon.
Gentleman will now ask me about the 80 per cent. figure, and he will
have a fair point.</div>
<a name="080626104000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000483"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I would be grateful if the Minister answered a
question that I have not yet asked, but this is the question I was
going to ask: if the EU goes to 30 per cent. because there is global
co-operation and the UK contribution is 26 per cent., will we not
underperform relative to the rest of the EU, or is he saying that we
would then bump up our 26 per cent. target to 32 per cent. or whatever?
Is that implicit in what he
says?</div><a name="080626104000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000484"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We would then have to look at the trajectory. I
hope that that does not sound like wriggling. That is why we thought
the point made in the other place was valid. The bigger consideration
is that if we change from CO<span class="Sub">2</span> only to greenhouse gases it
would affect current projections. A 26 per cent. reduction in
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions could reduce the UK&#146;s emissions of the
basket of greenhouse gases, including CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, to around 32 per
cent. below 1990 levels by 2020. That is a potential change that I
believe would be
beneficial.</div><a name="080626104000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the question, we believe that that is consistent, but it would
have to take into account three factors: the long-term goal, tightening
the target by including all gases and the trajectory we would take in
the first budget period. That in turn would have a consequence for the
second budget. In short, we do not think that 35 per cent.
is realistic, so we have said &#147;at least 26 per cent.&#148;,
but we want the independent Climate Change Committee to look at it and
advise
us.</div><a name="080626104000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North made the point about the
practicality of 35 per cent. He also made an important point about the
length of the targets period. We are talking about 2020; that is one
option we have committed to. The crucial decision to be taken, however,
is on the period covered by the post-Kyoto agreement. In my view, there
is a danger that that period is too long, and to get the early action
that we have talked about we may need to look at a different
trajectory. The point of all this is that the area under the curve, as
the Americans describe it, is what matters.</div>
<a name="080626104000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle made a point about annual targets. We are
coming on to that. In practice, once the five-year period is set, it
would not take a journalist too much trouble&#151;even our
journalists can operate a calculator&#151;to divide by five and work
out what the annual measurement of progress would be. He said
&#147;measurement&#148; as well as
&#147;progress&#148;.</div><a name="080626104000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000485"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s style and
conciliatory approach. I was concerned when, towards the end of his
comments, he said he thought 35 per cent. unrealistic. Given that he
said this morning that 80 per cent. is the Department&#146;s internal
working assumption, it worries me that 35 per cent. is deemed
unrealistic, as 35 per cent. is to 80 per cent. what 26 per cent. is to
60 per cent. Is he therefore end-loading it, as the right
hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal suggested?</div>
<a name="080626104000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it the
position of the Government that although we are not going to get to 35
per cent. by 2020, we are working under the assumption that we will
need 80 per cent. by 2050? A huge amount of late effort would then be
needed. How well does that sit with what we have all agreed is the need
for early effort? That troubles me somewhat. There is no great point in
repeating the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>issues we have already discussed. Suffice it to say
that it is good to get on the record the considered opinion around the
Committee of the importance of early action.</div>
<a name="080626104000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested in the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Bury, North
that we also need to look at targets before then. I suppose they are
implicit in the carbon budget process. Whether 26 per cent. or 35 per
cent. bites any more than any other carbon budget number does&#151;it
is not obvious to me that it does&#151;there is a duty to hit the
carbon budget all the time once it is in
place.</div><a name="080626104000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am slightly troubled by what the Minister says, but I am not sure that
a Division would achieve anything at this point. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080626104000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000486"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The clause mirrors the requirements of clause 3,
about which I spoke earlier, in setting out the circumstances in which
2020 targets and any post-2050 target may be amended. As before, the
application of the clause is limited to specific circumstances to
ensure that the legislation provides as much certainty as possible
while retaining the flexibility to respond to the latest developments,
such as changes in scientific knowledge and the international context,
which affect the basis of our reduction target. With that in mind, we
consider that allowing changes to the 2020 target or the future
post-2050 target to be made through secondary legislation provides that
for that
process.</div><a name="080626104000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
potential inclusion of other greenhouse gases or emissions from
international aviation or international shipping also needs to be taken
into account, as either of those could significantly affect the
achievability of the targets. It is therefore right that, in those
circumstances, we should have that
flexibility.</div>
<a name="080626104000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000487"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have a comment to make to the Minister. I
notice that the Government intend to introduce such changes through
debate under the affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses. There
is a little concern that throughout the Bill&#151;clause 7 reflects
this&#151;there is a general enabling power. Of course, the devil
will be in the
detail.</div><a name="080626104000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
alert the Minister to the fact that there is a general concern out
there; perhaps more detail could have been included. We do not wish to
detract from the flexibility of any future Government considering this,
but we put down a marker that perhaps there is too much dependence on
Orders in Council, albeit preceded by debate under the affirmative
resolution procedure. Perhaps more could have been included in the
Bill.</div><a name="080626104000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

clear that among the scientific knowledge the Secretary of State had to
take into account would be rises in global temperature, the impact of
climate change on world biodiversity and the impact in relation to the
loss of world forests.</div>
<a name="080626104000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to other parts of the Bill, where the Prime Minister is under a duty to
report on climate change, I say that he should ensure that the report
includes impact on world forests, biodiversity and temperature rises.
Why am I doing that? What concerns me? What concerns me is the fact
that this is a highly technical Bill. It is a pretty boring Bill. It is
almost like the EU treaty&#151;totally inexplicable to outsiders. One
would think that it is understood only by accountants. Like the EU
treaty, the people may go one way, yet the leaders carry on.</div>
<a name="080626104000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I worry that
when the Prime Minister comes to make a report&#151;a change may be
made, and the report may have to be made by the Secretary of
State&#151;and things are taken into account, if one is merely
dealing with some of the arguments that we have had this morning, which
are interesting but esoteric arguments about 60 or 80 per
cent., I am afraid that the people in the pubs in Hexham and Penrith
are going to lose interest. They will not understand the relevance of
it
all.</div><a name="080626104000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="080626104000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have been reading about this subject, I have discovered that climate
change is infinitely important to our survival. Yet, from my research
on the effects of climate change on England, it does not seem very
frightening. Why do we have this complex Bill? Why are we setting
targets that may have enormous costs for the economy and be difficult
to implement? Why are we doing it when the research into the
consequences for England suggests it would simply mean a little bit of
warming? There would be flash floods and more violent
storms&#151;that would not be good. We are likely to have water
shortages and hosepipe bans and, of course, if sea levels rose, large
parts of lowland England and Scotland, and Wales too, no doubt, would
be underwater. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Suffolk, Coastal, would not want his home to become a new Lindisfarne;
a new Holy island in Suffolk. So, there are serious consequences of
rises in water levels.</div>
<a name="080626104000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
have hot spells&#151;my research suggests that we would probably get
more train lines buckling in the heat, but we would probably not have
frozen points in winter. It is difficult to see things of
earth-shattering importance that will happen because of climate change
in England. Yet we know that the consequences of climate change can be
absolutely disastrous for the survival of the whole human race, and for
the survival of the human race in this country.</div>
<a name="080626104000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is
a 2°C rise in global temperature, we will find a large decline
in global freshwater resources, decreased crop yields in the world,
widespread hunger and our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>seas will become more acid. There will be a loss of
biodiversity, the mass extinction of some species and extreme weather
conditions around the world. There will be widespread droughts around
the world, a near-total loss of coral reefs, and perhaps the start of
the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. There will be a northwards
expansion of the spread of tropical diseases such as malaria, and in
this country we will get more non-indigenous species. Some of those
species may be benign, but some may be quite malignant, such as our
grey squirrels in Hexham and
Penrith.</div><a name="080626104000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will see the potential extinction of arctic species, including the
polar bear. The polar bear is one of those wonderful icons. My
secretary gives me an awful ear bashing in Portcullis House if I go out
and leave the lights on, because she is trying to save the polar bear.
That is something that has stuck in the public conscience. Much as
polar bears are important, as I was trying to say on Second Reading,
there are more important species than that, although they are not as
cuddly&#151;although I am sure that polar bears are not that
cuddly&#151;and do not look as
friendly.</div><a name="080626104000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
couple of weeks ago I went to Kew to do a little bit of background
research before serving on this Committee, and one of the things that
scared me in the wonderful greenhouses at Kew was the tiny number of
species of insects that pollinate in the world. We know about bees, but
there are other insects that pollinate around the world. If we lose
some of those rather unsexy little bugs and species, the world starves.
Nothing pollinates in
future.</div><a name="080626104000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000494"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the
Government&#146;s current indifference to the fate of the indigenous
bee and their failure to provide for its protection from disease, shows
how easy it is for these things to go unnoticed? In fact, the bee and
similar insects provide an enormously important fundamental ecological
job.</div><a name="080626104000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000495"></a>David
Maclean:</b> That is absolutely true. The job they do is
absolutely vital, and I suspect that my right hon. Friend is referring
to varoa and disease control. That is not a route that I wish to go
down now, but no doubt the Minister will defend the Government&#146;s
record on that in due course.</div>
<a name="080626104000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was my
summary of the research on what happens with a 2ºC rise in world

we will get drastically reduced crop yields around the world, and mass
starvation. Diarrhoea, which is a huge killer in the developing world,
will expand rapidly and kill millions more in Africa. The rise in
temperature would lead to widespread species extinction and huge
desertification. There would be a wholesale collapse of the Amazon
ecosystem, and the complete loss of all arboreal and Alpine ecosystems.
We would have the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, and in Greenland,
we would see more melting of the ice sheet with huge rises in sea
levels.</div>
<a name="080626104000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we say
&#147;huge&#148; rises in sea levels we do not need to talk about
10, 20 or 30 ft; a 3 ft&#151;1 m&#151;rise in sea levels puts half
of Bangladesh underwater, and 14 million people displaced or homeless,
as well as having an impact on our own country. Other parts of the
world would have no agricultural production whatsoever. In addition,
there is a danger that global warming could trigger further releases of
methane in Siberia and the Arctic tundra. Although this is more
speculative, if we had a 5ºC rise, some scientists say that that
there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>50 per cent. chance that the world&#146;s ocean circulation
systems would cease to operate, or may close down. There will be even
more horrific effects that I have not quoted to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="080626104000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">If only half
of the incidents that I have just described are true, I want the
Government and the Prime Minister to put that in every ruddy report
that is produced and to refer to it. We must excite the imagination of
the British public into realising how serious the matter is. With all
due respect, vital arguments about 60 per cent. or 80 per cent. targets
do not bring the consequences home to the public. That is why I want
specific mention in the reports and in the Bill of the effects of
temperature rise I want the Secretary of State to acknowledge that when
considering scientific knowledge.</div>
<a name="080626104000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do I
want to see the tropical rain forests mentioned? What has that to do
with the price of fish in England? It has a tremendous amount to do
with our own survival in England. Rain forests are now receiving a
level of international attention not seen since I was at the Earth sum
in Rio in 1992. The Stern report&#151;and thank goodness that the
Government are to keep Stern working for them&#151;showed the
important link between forests and climate. This is a climate change
Bill, and one fifth of the total annual carbon emissions now come from
land use changes, especially tropical deforestation. In fact, cutting
down the tropical forests is releasing more carbon into the atmosphere
than the whole of international shipping and aircraft combined. That is
why, if we want to do something about this, although we need to tackle
our own industries, cars, pollution, and increasing carbon emissions,
unless we are doing things to save the rain forest&#151;perhaps in
carbon trading, which is covered in later parts of the Bill&#151;we
will not succeed in meeting our climate change objectives and we will
lose those precious forests.</div>
<a name="080626104000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rain forests
continue to be destroyed at a pace exceeding 80,000 acres per
day&#151;32,000 hectares per day. I cannot imagine something on that
scale; that is horrendous: 1.5 acres of rain forest are
being lost every second. Rain forests once covered 14 per cent. of the
Earth&#146;s land surface; they now cover a mere 6 per cent. If we
continue at the present rate of destruction, the remaining rain forests
will be consumed in fewer than 40 years. The current world rain forest
cover of 2.5 million sq miles sounds pretty big&#151;it is the size
of about 48 contiguous states in the United States, representing 6 per
cent. of the world&#146;s surface&#151;but the rate at which it is
disappearing is frightening. If we are losing 13 million hectares of
forest land every year, adding to that huge amount of carbon in the
atmosphere, the rain forests will no longer be able to be the lungs of
the earth, performing that vital role of soaking up carbon and giving
us clean air, oxygen and water in
return.</div><a name="080626104000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the rain forests disappear, we are not just losing trees or the ability
to soak up carbon and produce oxygen. It is not just a large bit of
greenery. The most important thing is that, as the rain forests
disappear, we are losing the species in them; we are losing the fauna
and flora, the insect life and the animals. With them goes potential
cures for life-threatening diseases. I am told by my researchers that
there are currently 121 prescription drugs sold worldwide which come
from plant-derived sources. While 25 per cent. of western
pharmaceuticals are derived from rain forest ingredients,
less than 1 per cent. of these tropical trees and
plants are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>being tested by scientists. So 25 per cent. of the drugs we use to treat
illnesses come from rain forest ingredients and we have examined only 1
per cent of those ingredients. Yet we are going to continue cutting
down the rest of the rain forests. Where on earth will we get the raw
material to make the drugs that will save human life in the future? I
have never been a flat-earther, nor have I the reputation of being a
great herbalist, but I have always believed that part of the solution
to human ills lay inside the sealed globe we call the world. It does
not lie in the synthesis of new chemicals by chemical companies, it
lies in using the products and ingredients we have. Opium is a perfect
example. Many other solutions to the ills and diseases we face are
already out there, possibly deep in the ocean, in the jungles of the
Amazon and Papua New Guinea, in fauna, in flora, and in animal species.
If we destroy them, we can never get them
back.</div><a name="080626104000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier, with a huge amount of effort, we could lower the world
temperature. We can reverse climate change. We cannot bring back the
millions of species which may be destroyed if those forests are cut
down and burned. Experts estimate that we are losing 137 plant, animal
and insect species every day, due to rain forest deforestation. That
equates to 50,000 species a year. I do not mean that we are losing
50,000 of one animal, or one beastie, or one insect, but 50,000
different species. That is absolutely frightening. Deforestation of
tropical rain forests has a global impact through species extinction.
We will see the loss of important ecosystem services and renewable
resources and the reduction of carbon
sinks.</div><a name="080626104000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want this in the Bill so that the people of the United
Kingdom&#151;and everyone in Penrith&#151;can see that the loss of
the rain forest affects our human health in this country. It does not
just affect the Indians who might be living in the forest, or some of
the animals and wildlife there&#151;although it would be tragic if we
lost some of that wildlife, and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Suffolk, Coastal would say, it would also be immoral&#151;it affects
us. It is in our own vital life-preserving interest that we save those
things. If we could spell out more of the biodiversity consequences in
the report that the Prime Minister will be asked to produce, we might
be able to engage the British public so that they realise that,
goodness me, this is a very serious thing. That would have more impact
than just talking about carbon at 80 and 60 per cent., important though
that
is.</div><a name="080626104000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that faunas are critical to regulating the climate. We know that
more than half the world&#146;s estimated 10 million species of
plants, animals and insects live in the tropical rain
forest. A fifth of the world&#146;s fresh water is in the Amazon
basin. Also, although I would be highly critical of the food miles, in
any huge supermarket these days&#151;Sainsbury in Pimlico, or any
other big market&#151;we see ranges of fruit and vegetables that we
did not even know existed five, 10 or 20 years ago. A total of 80 per
cent. of the developed world&#146;s diet originated in the tropical
rain forest. Its gifts and the wonderful foods it has provided include
avocados, coconuts, figs, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, bananas, guavas,
pineapples, mangos, tomatoes, vegetables, corn, potatoes, rice, winter
squash, yams, black pepper&#151;I am getting quite hungry now. There
are many more but I will not bore the Committee by reading a huge
shopping list of food from Tesco or
Sainsbury&#146;s.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="080626104000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="080626104000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
least 3,000 fruit species are found in the rain forest alone. We use
only about 200 of those in the western developed world, whereas the
Indians in the rain forest consume about 2,000 different species of
fruit and vegetable. Who knows what solutions for the illnesses that we
may face lie in those fruits and vegetables? People with my condition
are told to eat a lot more oily fish. I love fish, but I hate oily
fish. Initially, I did not believe that it was beneficial, but I
certainly find it slightly beneficial in tackling multiple sclerosis. I
think, in my little mind, that if that bit of oily fish can help me in
a minor way, what else that could save people is lying in those rain
forests, which are being cut down at the rate of 80,000 hectares a
day?</div><a name="080626104000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
US National Cancer Institute has identified more than 3,000 plants that
are active against cancer cells. Seventy per cent. of those plants are
found in the rain forest, and 25 per cent. of the active ingredients in
today&#146;s cancer-fighting drugs come from organisms found only in
the rain forest. I am told that vincristine&#151;I shall pass that
name on to <i class="I">Hansard</i> later&#151;which is extracted from the rain
forest plant the Madagascar periwinkle, is one of the world&#146;s
most powerful anti-cancer drugs. It has dramatically increased the
survival rate for acute childhood leukaemia since its discovery, and
that discovery was linked directly to the rain forest rather than to
the millions of pounds spent by multinational chemical companies. That
is why I want rain forests to be specifically mentioned and flagged up.
We have a chance to excite the British public with the wonderful
reasons why we are backing the Bill. We can terrify
them&#151;legitimately&#151;with the consequences of cutting down
the rain forests, and we can tell them why climate change, which is a
terribly boring term,
matters.</div><a name="080626104000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final thing that I want to flag up to the Government relates to
forests. We cannot discuss biodiversity without rain forests, and we
cannot discuss rain forests without biodiversity. I want biodiversity
to be mentioned specifically in the Bill because, as I said earlier,
everyone sees that biological extinction is the most critical global
environmental change that we face, because it cannot be reversed. Aaron
Bernstein, a doctor at Harvard medical school and one of the authors of
the book, &#147;Sustaining Life: How Human Health Depends on
Biodiversity&#148;, has
stated:</div><a name="080626104000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
we harm nature, we are harming ourselves...few people realise that
our health is directly tied to the health of the natural
world&#148;,</div><a name="080626104000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current extinction crisis is a serious threat to humanity that is equal
to, if not greater than, climate change.</div>
<a name="080626104000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, although the Earth&#146;s rain forests cover only 6 per cent.
of its surface, they harbour 50 per cent. of all known life on this
planet. The estimated number of creatures that inhabit the tropical
rain forest is so great&#151;between 5 million and 50 million
species&#151;that it is almost incomprehensible. The sheer range of
numbers alone is mind-boggling. If the best experts&#151;the
Attenboroughs of this world&#151;can calculate only that it is
between 5 million and 50 million, it shows how little we have actually
explored life on Earth. If we do not understand it, for
goodness&#146; sake, we must not destroy it
first.</div><a name="080626104000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
western forests are good things, too, but whereas half a dozen tree
species or fewer make up 90 per cent. of the trees that dominate
western forests, a typical rain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>forest, I am told, may have more than 480 tree
species in a single hectare, which means not 480 trees but 480
different tree species. Similarly, a single bush in the Amazon may
contain more species of ant than the entire British isles. Rain forest
biodiversity is not a haphazard event, but the result of a series of
unique circumstances. Unfortunately, every year approximately 27,000
species of animal and plant life disappear from our planet. We hear
about big cuddly animals if they are in danger of extinction, but not
about the fauna, flora, bits of moss, trees and bushes. Those things
may seem utterly unimportant, boring and not sexy, but they may contain
chemicals that are vital for our survival. Scientists estimate that
there are between 3 million and 30 million species of plants, animals,
fungi, bacteria and so on. Only 1.4 million have been identified so
far, and we risk destroying the rest. Up to 30 per cent. of all species
on earth could vanish by 2050 due to unsustainable human
activities&#151;mainly deforestation. Medicines are just a small part
of the role that biodiversity plays in human well-being. Without
beneficial insects, most of the land ecosystems in the world would
collapse, and a good part of humanity would perish with them. We have
already discussed bees and other insects, but that is an absolutely
crucial point.</div>
<a name="080626104000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
bore the Committee for much longer, because I only want to make two
points. I have made my first point on biodiversity, and my second point
concerns garbage&#151;I hope that colleagues can spot the difference.
I will conclude with the cone snail. I am not sure who has heard of the
cone snail&#151;I had not heard of it before I started my research.
Cone snails live only in coral reefs, and at least a third to a half of
all reefs are in danger of dying off due to a combination of disease,
pollution and climate change. What have cone snails got to do with
anything? The first breakthrough in pain medication in years has come
from those little snails. I have no idea what they look like or how big
they are&#151;I presume that they are tiny or even microscopic. Some
33 per cent. of terminal cancer and HIV patients for whom the strongest
opiates were ineffective are now pain free thanks to a pain-blocking
peptide from cone snail venom. I have no reason to disbelieve that
point&#151;no one could make it up&#151;which I discovered during
my research. The cone snail is a tiny little thing in the coral reef,
yet people are making a highly powerful medicine&#151;it is more
powerful than opium&#151;from a peptide that it produces for the
treatment of cancer patients. That in itself is justification for
saving the coral reefs. We have to save the coral reefs, if only to get
that material from the cone snail for cancer and HIV patients. How do
we save the coral reefs? The answer is by reducing the global
temperature.</div><a name="080626104000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to live in a world where we have only met our carbon
targets. We could meet 60, 80, 90 or 100 per cent. of our
carbon targets, but that would be irrelevant because&#151;as the
Minister has said&#151;what is important are the measures that we
take to meet the ultimate target. There will be no point to a society
in which we have managed to meet our carbon targets, if we have lost
all the rain forests. Make no doubt about it, we can meet the carbon
targets, even if we cut down every forest&#151;it would be much more
difficult, but we could do it. The danger is that we would lose
millions of species that we do not even know about yet that have the
potential to improve or save human life. We would lose the tiny
insects, bugs and creepy crawlies&#151;&#147;the wee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>beasties&#148; as my old mother used to
say&#151;that are so vital to our ecology and economy. I do not know
what they are&#151;nobody in the Committee knows. Nobody knows what
is in the rain forests in Brazil, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, which
we are losing at a rate of
knots.</div><a name="080626104000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am certain that the Minister will tell me not to worry about scientific
knowledge on climate change. He will say, &#147;That&#146;s all in
there David. We&#146;ll be thinking about that.&#148; I am merely
saying that my amendment would not significantly change the Bill. It
would not cause damage, and the Government would not have to impose a
new target. It would merely signal what the Government will probably
report on anyway. It will make the Bill slightly sexier, and slightly
easier for people like me&#151;virgins in carbon matters&#151;to
understand. It will make it easier to get the message home in the pubs
of Hexham and Penrith, and around the country. People will not buy in
to the boring bits of climate change, such as the stuff about dustbins
in clauses 69 and 70, unless we create reasons. If my proposals were
implemented, the Government would have to spell out why biodiversity
and rain forests are so vital to the survival of the human
species.</div><a name="080626104000280"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000496"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I warmly congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on
his extraordinarily eloquent speech and on his amendments and new
clause. He repeatedly apologised for potentially boring the Committee,
but I was not bored&#151;I was inspired by his brilliant
contribution.</div>
<a name="080626104000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only
small quibble is that the references to the rise in global temperature
in the amendments would be accommodated in almost any review of the
scientific evidence on climate change. It is difficult to see how such
reviews could otherwise be
conducted.</div><a name="080626104000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s references to biodiversity and world
forests were spot on. He has revealed a rather strange aberration in
the Bill. Clause 11 states that carbon budgets will overwhelmingly be
set on economic and social criteria. We all love the Stern report,
which is an important document that changed the terms of the debate on
climate change in this country and that has been influential worldwide.
After the Stern report, it has become almost axiomatic that the cost of
doing nothing about climate change will be economically greater than
the cost of doing something about it, especially if we act
quickly.</div><a name="080626104000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the right hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, the economic
justification is not the only justification for acting on climate
change. Even if there were no dramatic economic costs, it is important
to protect the biodiversity of the planet from the impact of climate
change. The figures on biodiversity are truly alarming. The right hon.
Gentleman gave many of them, and he went into great detail. The UN
millennium ecosystem assessment reported in 2005 that approximately 60
per cent. of the ecosystem services that it examined are being degraded
or used unsustainably. Those
include</div><a name="080626104000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fresh
water, capture fisheries, air and water purification, and the
regulation of regional and local climate, natural hazards and
pests.&#148;</div><a name="080626104000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latest red list of threatened species in 2007 shows that one in four of
the world&#146;s mammals, one in eight of its birds, one third of all
amphibians and 70 per cent. of the world&#146;s assessed plants are
in jeopardy. The UK biodiversity action plan, for which the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>should take due credit, has identified 1,149 species and 65 habitats as
priorities for conservation in the UK
alone.</div><a name="080626104000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
forests, it has been estimated that about half of the mature tropical
forests that once covered the planet have been felled. That is between
750 million and 800 million hectares out of the original 1.5
billion to 1.6 billion hectares that once covered the planet.
Deforestation probably contributes to 20 per cent. of world carbon
emissions. The situation is extremely grim. The most obvious and simple
impact is on the beauty and diversity of life on Earth, and there is a
moral and a spiritual reason for trying to protect our biodiversity on
that basis. As the right hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, there are
massive impacts in terms of the potential for science to discover new
medicines, treatments and
painkillers.</div><a name="080626104000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
importantly, there is an enormous impact on the ability of the world to
feed itself. The right hon. Gentleman light-heartedly mentioned the
price of fish. I assure him that the price of fish will be massively
impacted. In February, the United Nations environment programme report
pointed out that all the major world fisheries are at some risk of
complete collapse within decades if the combination of overfishing,
climate change and pollution is allowed to proceed unchecked. It
pointed to the fact that 2.6 billion people derive most of their
protein from fish. The impacts of such a loss of biodiversity are
almost
incalculable.</div><a name="080626104000372"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="080626104000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, if the ecosystems start to
collapse, that is a feedback mechanism that will in turn make climate
change even worse. The threat to the Amazonian rainforest, as
highlighted in the Stern report, is such that it would enter
irreversible collapse if we allow the global temperature to rise by
only 2° C above pre-industrial levels. That should focus our
attention. It is right that biodiversity should be a prominent concern
in the Bill, and the amendments deserve our warm support. It is a
matter of some embarrassment to me that we did not spot that enormous
omission before and were not responsible for tabling the amendments. I
warmly congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on doing
so.</div><a name="080626104000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000497"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I, too, congratulate and pay tribute to my right
hon. Friend for his amendments, research, the passion and eloquence
with which he spoke and for spotting an omission from the Bill. May I
also establish my eco-warrior and environmental claims, which go back
to about the age of nine, 10 or 15?</div>
<a name="080626104000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee may recall that Professor David Bellamy made his name as a
lecturer in botany at Durham university. One of the great campaigns
that he supported at that time, but which, regrettably, was not
successful, was the drive to protect the blue gentian, an alpine flower
that grows in this country in only one part of the north of England.
This is not a private Committee meeting, but I do not mind sharing this
story with the Committee. I was brought up in that place, known as
Upper Teesdale, which remains relatively unspoiled, compared to the
Lake district.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div><a name="080626104000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
that time, it was proposed that part of Upper Teesdale should be
flooded to create a reservoir to help people further downstream on the
River Tees, and that plan went ahead. Professor Bellamy and those who
supported him failed to protect the blue gentian. Outside Austria and
Switzerland, that flower grows only in Upper Teesdale, so there are few
left. The tragedy is that the water that was damned by the reservoir
was never needed further downstream. I hope we can all learn from
that.</div><a name="080626104000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments and new clause tabled by my right hon. Friend propose that
the Secretary of State should take into account such matters when
making decisions about carbon budgets and the duty to report on them.
My right hon. Friend seeks to amend clause 11 so that rises in global
temperature, the impact of climate change on world biodiversity and
loss of world forest, with particular reference to rain forests, would
be added to the list of matters to be taken into account. He wishes to
put a duty on the Secretary of State to lay an annual report before
Parliament on the impact of biodiversity loss on the UK and on meeting
our carbon budgets and for the theme to be included in the title of the
Bill.</div><a name="080626104000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments relate to clauses 11 and 14 and the title of the Bill. It is
interesting that the much-flaunted theme of sustainable development is
often described as a three-legged stool, the legs being a sustainable
environment, a sustainable society and a sustainable economy. It is
claimed that, without one of the legs, the stool would fall over. The
Minister might want to comment on why no reference is made to the
impact on the environment in clauses 11 and 14 and in the
title.</div>
<a name="080626104000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case for
amending the clauses and the title in order to consider the loss of the
world&#146;s forests and the impact of climate change on biodiversity
is a noble one, and my right hon. Friend is right to express his
concern about those vital issues. I share his mother&#146;s concern
for the wee beasties, and was moved by his reference to the cone snail,
of which I confess I was not aware. I hope that it can be protected and
can continue to be used for the purposes he
described.</div><a name="080626104000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
World Bank estimates that approximately two thirds of tropical forest
is under moderate to high pressure from agricultural expansion and
timber industry expansion. My right hon. Friend spoke at some length
about the impact on the rain forest, but I am sure he would wish to
draw attention to previous incidents at Carlisle in Cumbria and at
Boscastle in Devon, and incidents during last summer&#146;s floods
which, although they caused devastation elsewhere, were particularly
acutely felt across Yorkshire and the Humber and the north Lincolnshire
regions. Agricultural land was lost for part of the summer, as were
many crops. It is important to see the issue in terms of UK losses as
well.</div><a name="080626104000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is aware that prime agricultural land is increasingly
encroached upon by the Government&#146;s ambitious plans to build 3
million houses by 2020 and by their separate proposal for eco-towns. In
considering the amendments, it is important to look at the impact that
those Government plans will have on our own biodiversity.</div>
<a name="080626104000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">A recent
report for McKinsey estimates that the world could avoid 3.3 gigatons
of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> equivalent in annual emissions from tropical
deforestation by 2030 if we were able to price the carbon stored in
these rain forests at less than â¬40 per tonne of carbon dioxide
emissions. Such an analysis must make us seriously 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>consider the benefits of avoiding rain forest destruction not purely as
the morally correct thing to do, as my right hon. Friend argued, but
because the value of the ecosystem services that those forests provide
is immeasurable. If, in the years ahead, we continue to lose the rain
forests at the current rate, we can almost certainly give up hope of
keeping warming under 2°C.</div>
<a name="080626104000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I warmly
welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s aspiration for biodiversity and
deforestation issues to be brought to the heart of our carbon reporting
procedure, which is as an eminently sensible idea, and especially for
them to be taken into account in setting the carbon budgets in the
annual report and in the long title of the Bill. I look forward with
great interest to hearing from the Minister why she believes that there
was no place for the environment in the original drafting of the
Bill.</div><a name="080626104000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000498"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I shall be brief. We were all moved by the words
of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border in
introducing the amendment. I hope very much that the Minister will not
say that those matters are implicit in the Bill, but will understand
why a specific reference is so important. The reason is that it is
extremely easy for these things to be forgotten because they do not
happen to be the fashion of the time. I remember when the rain forests
were at the centre of attention, and gradually they declined and other
topics came up. It is very important that we should not miss them out.
I have three more quick
points.</div><a name="080626104000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
we should remind ourselves that the importance of biodiversity has an
additional dimension to the one to which my right hon. Friend referred.
The retention of biodiversity is vital for the poor. The fish example
is very strong. Rich countries steal the food of the poor. That is what
happens. Local material becomes less and less available, so people look
further and further abroad, and because they are rich enough they can
grab a higher proportion of what is there. That is the injustice of the
world, and it is crucial to those of us who recognise that social
justice is at the heart of any policy to deal with climate change. We
cannot deal with climate change without dealing with social justice,
both nationally and internationally. Biodiversity is a key issue for
social justice.</div>
<a name="080626104000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads
to the second point, which is that we must have a degree of imagination
and a willingness to extend the issues that are covered in the Bill
more widely than is sometimes thought. I shall give an example. I am
lucky enough to do business in Brazil and I recently returned from a
conference there. One of the interesting issues raised was the work
done by non-governmental organisations to provide jobs and
opportunities for the indigenous people who would otherwise cut down
the rain forests. It is all very well talking about cutting down rain
forests, but it is often not wicked outsiders but poor people who do
it, as part of the means to getting some sort of livelihood
for themselves.</div>
<a name="080626104000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">An excellent
NGO is trying to help indigenous people to farm in a sustainable way.
In doing so, they have found what is thought to be the original place
where the cocoa bean comes from and are beginning to farm those
original cocoa bean plantations in a way that will have a remarkably
sustainable mechanism. They run into two kinds of problems. One is
getting it started and teaching people; the other is being able to sell
the high quality cocoa bean outside the area in which it exists, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>because the international organisers of such commodities do not like
making the distinction between that special product and the generality
of cocoa beans.</div>
<a name="080626104000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
meet the demands of my right hon. Friend&#146;s proposals, we will
have to look further. The matter should be talked through with the
Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. It is the
kind of issue that we should be thinking through when we deal with our
overseas aid. It is a Foreign Office matter, as well as something that
we do at home. I emphasise that a failure to look further might
undermine the broad way in which the Bill should be
applied.</div>
<a name="080626104000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000499"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I agree with almost everything that the right
hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal said, in a valuable contribution. As
chair of the all-party group for tribal peoples, I should say that
although I am sure the organisation that he mentioned is doing valuable
work, traditional tribal peoples in the rain forest live on a
sustainable basis, do not damage the rain forest and are widely
recognised as the best stewards of the forest. Protecting their land
rights is an important contribution to the battle to protect
biodiversity.</div>
<a name="080626104000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000500"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I agree. The traditional mechanisms of groups
living in the rain forest are some of the things that we have done much
to damage and have ignored and treated badly. I am merely saying that
much of the damage done to rain forests is done by people who are poor
and who do so because they have no other way to ensure that they and
their family&#146;s livelihoods are protected. Remembering our
responsibility in that respect is important.</div>
<a name="080626104000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister will have been advised that all that is included in the
Bill and that reference to biodiversity may well suggest that other
things are less important, may upset the balance and so on. I think I
know what has been written beautifully for her. I hope I am wrong, and
if so I apologise. If I am right, I suggest to her that this is an
opportunity for the Government to remind the nation that combating
climate change is a much bigger business than merely the mathematics of
targets, budgets and the like. It requires us to try to understand our
world in a wholly different
way.</div><a name="080626104000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="080626104000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border has reminded us
that we have been unbelievably cavalier with the riches that we have
inherited. The willingness to destroy without thought is a serious
statement about humankind at this moment and over many centuries.
Climate change is about reminding us that the human attitude to itself
and its planet has to change radically. That was why I said during the
previous sitting that this is the most exciting time for us to be
living, because it is a time in which we have to become different about
ourselves and each other in a way that we have not had to since the
huge changes of the enlightenment and the
renaissance.</div><a name="080626104000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will set aside any temporary, narrow or less
than excellent proposals that she has from her civil servants and
instead say that she will rise to this, because it is necessary to
remind the nation and the world that biodiversity is so important as
part of the fight against climate change because it represents the area
in which we can see most dramatically where humankind has behaved at
its worst and where the biggest changes have to take
place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div><a name="080626104000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000501"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. First, I join in the general
congratulations to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border on
how he presented his case. The inspiration of Rio lives in him. He has
given us a huge opportunity to remind everyone who hears the debate
about the extraordinary importance of the world&#146;s biodiversity.
He did that not only because its intrinsic value and moral status, but
for our self-interest. I think that if climate change affected only
human beings, it would not be so dangerous. It is the fact that it
affects the totality of the natural world that makes it such a terrible
threat.</div><a name="080626104000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman referred to the contribution of ecosystems and,
especially, the contribution that the new natural world has made,
through human discovery, to our medicines and thus our well-being. I
join him in underlining that value. I will dwell a little on the threat
for a few
moments.</div><a name="080626104000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Stern report revealed that an increase of just 1° C could lead
to at least 10 per cent. of land species facing extinction, with 80 per
cent. bleaching of the coral reefs, including the great barrier reef.
Within the 2° C increase, which we have all pledged not to
exceed, the extinction figure rises dramatically to between 15 and 40
per cent. We also know the enormous value of biodiversity in mitigating
climate change. For example, the amount of terrestrial carbon stored in
peat lands is equivalent to 75 per cent. of all atmospheric carbon and
about 100 years of emissions from fossil
fuels.</div><a name="080626104000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise the link between biodiversity and climate change. We make a
link in our efforts to tackle climate change and our efforts to tackle
biodiversity loss. In a previous intervention, the right hon. Gentleman
referred to &#147;The Economics of Ecosystems and
Biodiversity&#148;, which is an extremely important report, supported
by the UK Government. We are also chairing a group of experts on
biodiversity and climate change for the convention on biological
diversity. At home we have established a climate change adaptation work
stream, as part of the English biodiversity strategy, to promote
adaptation of relevant policies and programmes in all relevant sectors,
which include agriculture, forestry, water management and land-use
planning.</div><a name="080626104000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments focus on the loss of the
world&#146;s forests, particularly rain forests. Again, I support his
passion to see that sufficient attention is given to these terrible
threats. Let me give him the further assurance that that goes for the
whole
Government.</div><a name="080626104000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK is working actively in the EU and with our international negotiating
partners to reduce deforestation in developing countries by achieving a
successful outcome to the UN climate negotiations. We have also
recently allocated &#163;50 million from the new &#163;800 million
environmental transformation fund to help to slow the rate of
deforestation of the Congo basin. Let me make it absolutely clear that
our overall aim is to reach international agreement on the use of the
carbon market for the second commitment period under the Kyoto protocol
to give positive incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation in
developing countries.</div>
<a name="080626104000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, why will
I proceed in the way in which I am about to proceed? Let me say to the
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal that officials may indeed
provide me with information and even speaking notes, but I speak for
myself. I have given great attention to the amendments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>and great thought to the vision that he and others have presented here
this afternoon. However, there are two issues that we need to look at
very carefully. I am the Minister who is dealing with both the
biodiversity and the garbage, and I hope that the right hon. Member for
Penrith and The Border will not find me among the garbage at the end of
what I am about to say.</div>
<a name="080626104000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two issues. First, the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border
seeks to add to clause 11(2)(a), which
states:</div><a name="080626104000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;scientific
knowledge about climate
change&#148;.</div><a name="080626104000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
one could possibly argue that</div>
<a name="080626104000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;scientific
knowledge about climate change&#148;</div>
<a name="080626104000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">did not include
knowledge of both the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and the
way in which biodiversity might mitigate climate change. That is
absolutely taken for granted; it is in every discussion and in every
document. Therefore, I think that it is absolutely clear that that
provision covers the issues that he has raised.</div>
<a name="080626104000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must also
say to the right hon. Gentleman, for the sake of accuracy&#151;of
course, this is all boring, technical stuff&#151;that there are many
causes of the loss of biodiversity that are not due to climate change.
We could think, of course, of change in land use patterns, overgrazing,
the introduction of alien species&#151;that is a major factor that we
agree might be exacerbated by climate change&#151;and the
over-abstraction of water.</div>
<a name="080626104000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the amendments attempt to draw a direct line between the UK&#146;s
carbon budgets and the impacts of climate change on global biodiversity
and forests. I am genuinely sorry to have to tell the right hon.
Gentleman this, but I do not believe that that is sensible or even
possible. As we have already discussed, the impacts of climate change
will be driven by global emissions, not just emissions from the United
Kingdom.</div>
<a name="080626104000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
it will give the right hon. Gentleman some comfort if I say that there
is undoubtedly a case for linking any future global climate change
agreement to international biodiversity. That is why all the points
that he has made are absolutely clear and valid. Indeed, at the
conference looking at the convention on biological diversity that I
attended last month, we decided to make closer linkages between that
convention and the United Nations framework convention on climate
change. Specifically, the conference agreed to highlight the role of
biodiversity in mitigating climate change; to highlight the threats to
global biodiversity from climate change; and to look for ways to
minimise climate change. We also agreed to set up an expert group that
would provide biodiversity-relevant information to the UNFCC.</div>
<a name="080626104000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
specifically to amendment No. 38. Clause 11 sets out matters
that the Committee on Climate Change must take into account when
providing advice on the level of carbon budgets, including economic,
social and scientific factors. That will be a complex task that will
require thorough analysis, advice and political judgement. I suggest to
the right hon. Gentleman that it is not possible to take account of the
effect of rising global temperatures on world biodiversity and forests
when considering specific UK carbon budgets if that assessment is to be
made in any meaningful way. That, of course, should not diminish the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s vision, and it does not diminish the fact
that it is precisely because of the potentially devastating effects on
global 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>biodiversity that we want to make our contribution to avoiding dangerous
climate change and to limit the increase in average temperatures to no
more than 2° C more than pre-industrial levels.</div>
<a name="080626104000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">To the
extent that there could be any linkage between the Committee on Climate
Change and such work, hon. Members should be aware that, under the
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, all decisions that
the Government take must have regard to the purpose of conserving
biodiversity in the exercise of those
functions.</div><a name="080626104000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 40 builds on amendment No. 38 by requiring an explanation of how
proposals and policies to meet a budget will affect global temperature,
the loss of world biodiversity and the loss of world forests. I have to
say to the right hon. Gentleman that just as we cannot assess what
effect the particular level of UK carbon budgeting would have on these
issues, it is equally not possible to say what effect our particular
choices of policies would have. We need to remember that all our
proposals for emissions reductions have to be implemented within
existing law. The right hon. Gentleman will know the extent of existing
law covering biodiversity in this
country.</div><a name="080626104000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we cannot directly determine, or expect a link with, what happens
overseas, we can expect that when we choose our new policies in the UK,
they will have to respect the habitats and birds directives and the
requirements for environmental impact assessments, where they apply.
Clause 13 requires that proposals and policies contribute overall to
sustainable development, which includes taking environmental impacts
into
account.</div><a name="080626104000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York asked about the sustainable development
definitions. The whole Government have adopted a definition for the
sustainable development strategy, which says that a policy is
sustainable when it is in line with all five of the sustainable
development principles, one of which is the key to the hon.
Lady&#146;s question: &#147;Living within environmental
limits&#148;. That is absolutely clear and the strategy says we must
have policies in line with all five of those
principles.</div><a name="080626104000326"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000502"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> I have no doubt about the Minister&#146;s
sincerity on this issue, as I have heard her talk about it before, but
let me put it to her that as far as this is concerned, her advice is
duff. Clause 11 says quite categorically that we put, as a society, a
value on material prosperity and the economy because we have to take
into account economic circumstances and the impact on the economy.
However, when we are being presented with an opportunity to send a
strong signal that we put a value on the natural resources on which
that economy depends, we duck
it.</div><a name="080626104000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000503"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> On the contrary. The case that I make is that the
phrase that we have in the Bill about science entirely covers those
points. All the science acknowledges these points. I have to return the
hon. Gentleman to the nature of the amendments&#151;this is a
technical point&#151;which are specifically asking us when setting
budgets, which are just numbers, to take account of the effect that
that might have on the world&#146;s biodiversity and the
world&#146;s temperature rises. Clearly, I am sorry to say, I could
use the same word&#151;&#147;duff&#148;&#151;about the
amendments, but I shall say that they at least do not
work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="080626104000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000504"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the kind and
courteous way in which she is dealing with my amendments. While I
accept that they might legally and technically be duff, given that in
the places I have tried to insert the phrases
&#147;biodiversity&#148; and &#147;rain forest&#148;, they may
not actually work, will she accept the vision thing? She kindly said
that in my speech I was making &#147;a vision thing&#148;. Does she
not accept that somewhere in the Bill, with the Government&#146;s
excellent lawyers and civil service, they could put a bit of the vision
thing in, using appropriate phraseology and at the appropriate place,
to highlight the importance of rain forests and
biodiversity?</div><a name="080626104000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000505"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I think the right hon. Gentleman has enough
parliamentary experience to know that we do not put such visions into
Bills. We debated a preamble in a previous sitting. When great speeches
come to be made, as they will as a consequence of the Bill becoming an
Act of Parliament and all that will flow from that, including the
reports that come in to Parliament, people will undoubtedly surround
whatever they have to say of a technical nature with that vision,
because nobody can doubt that that vision is why we are doing this. Why
have the Government brought a Bill of this nature to Parliament?
Because we understand that our whole planet is in great danger and we
must make our contribution to dealing with it. However, as my hon.
Friend the Minister for the Environment has had to say on several
occasions, we deal with only what we have the possibility to control,
and that is our own carbon emissions and the way in which we decide on
them and report on
them.</div><a name="080626104000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall dealing now with the new reporting requirement that the right
hon. Member for Penrith and The Border would like to place upon us. We
are in the business of reporting on UK biodiversity and I assure the
Committee that there are regular reports. If hon. Members have not seen
them, they should look for them, because they are comprehensive. The
hon. Member for Cheltenham congratulated us on our UK biodiversity
action plan. That is entirely transparent and a way in which people can
follow the efforts that are being made to conserve UK
biodiversity.</div><a name="080626104000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regular
reporting occurs and, in particular, DEFRA leads on the natural
environment public service agreement, which includes targets for the
Government&#146;s approach to action on biodiversity. Progress
against the PSA is, of course, published annually in the departmental
annual report to Parliament. I suggest that any additional reporting
requirement would be unnecessary in any case, but clearly would not
work for this
Bill.</div><a name="080626104000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
summarise, the Government&#146;s view of the group of amendments is
that scientific knowledge about climate change is wide enough to ensure
that the matters raised by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The
Border are taken into account in relation to carbon budgets, in so far
as that is possible. The Government are deeply committed to promoting
biodiversity in the UK and overseas. I meant to mention, but forgot,
that the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal referred to the need to
link indigenous lifestyles with the conservation of biodiversity. I
refer him to the Darwin initiative, for which he can take some credit,
which has funded hundreds of projects in developing countries where we
are doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>precisely that. I am glad to say that I recently launched a new round of
funding for that so that we can help developing countries with our
scientific expertise, particularly on climate change and the way in
which lifestyles need not threaten biodiversity and we can all work
together.</div><a name="080626104000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that the amendments would add value to the
Government&#146;s existing reporting to Parliament on biodiversity
and I do not believe there is a meaningful causal relationship between
the UK&#146;s carbon budgets, or our policies to meet them, and the
level of global temperatures and loss of international biodiversity. I
tell the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border that I therefore
cannot accept the
amendment.</div><a name="080626104000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080626104000506"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her kind and
courteous reply. She said at a couple of points in her response that of
course it is implicit in considering &#147;scientific
knowledge&#148; that loss of biodiversity, the rain forest and other
matters will be taken into account. She said that it would be
inconceivable to consider new scientific knowledge without considering
those matters. I accept that, but she said towards the end that, as far
as was possible, the Government would take loss of biodiversity into
account. She says, and I accept, that the Government would not wish to
set a target for the United Kingdom based on what was happening in the
Amazonian rain forest or in Papua New
Guinea.</div><a name="080626104000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had no intention of seeking to tie British policy to things of which
the Government are not in charge. It would be utterly wrong to attempt
in any way to tie the Government&#146;s hands by including a legal
obligation in respect of rain forests and biodiversity, and therefore
requiring a carbon target to be set for the United Kingdom on matters
that are way outside the Government&#146;s control. I was seeking to
incorporate a little bit of vision in the Bill because I think that it
lacks
it.</div><a name="080626104000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the reasons why we are here is because people have a vision of the
disastrous consequences of climate change if it goes unchecked. I was
merely seeking&#151;in a technically inadequate way, I know&#151;to
introduce some concepts that the Minister says are already implicit in
the reporting mechanism. I would merely wish the Minister and her civil
servants to think again. Are there ways to flag up the two phrases,
perhaps in a reporting mechanism&#151;possibly not a reporting
mechanism on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>carbon budgets, but elsewhere in the Bill&#151;in addition to all the
current reporting that the Government may do, and in addition to any
other report laid before Parliament? Is it possible to include
somewhere in this Bill&#151;the most important one for a
generation&#151;on climate change and saving the planet phrases about
the loss of biodiversity and rain forests, or preservation of
biodiversity and rain
forests?</div><a name="080626104000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is right. No doubt when politicians make great speeches in the
future, they will talk about biodiversity and rain forests, not just 60
and 80 per cent. targets. However, I am afraid that when my hon. Friend
the Member for Bexhill and Battle is sitting in the Department as the
Minister of State, possibly in a couple of years&#146; time, and he
goes off to make a major speech, he will want to talk about
biodiversity and rain forests but his officials will say, &#147;No,
Minister. You must stick to the terms of the Bill, which is all about
climate change. We have a very exciting speech here for the UN about 20
per cent. targets,&#148; or 80 or 60 per cent. targets. That might be
fanciful and it might not happen&#151;it is fanciful that my hon.
Friend would accept the advice, because I am sure that he would
not.</div><a name="080626104000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister and hon. Members sitting with her can tell from what I have
been saying that I have no intention of putting wrecking provisions
into the Bill, or of including provisions that are impossible to
achieve, or meaningless legally or technically. I do not wish to press
the amendment to a Division because that would be against the spirit of
consensus&#151;we are almost in agreement on this&#151;but I hope
that the Minister will think again and try to find a way of coming back
on Report with a proposal to include in the Bill an obligation to talk
about the things that she says are implicit in
it.</div><a name="080626104000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry if my colleagues are disappointed that I will not press the
amendment to a Division, but I suspect that I would not win and I would
not win for the wrong reasons. I might anger the Minister such that she
does not come back on another occasion with an amendment that is not
duff, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080626104000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
