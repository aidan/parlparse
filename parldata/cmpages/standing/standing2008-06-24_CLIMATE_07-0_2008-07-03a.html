Chairman:</b> I am very conscious, gentlefolk, of the common
aspirations of the Committee in so far as climate change is concerned.
With that in mind, I have a serious announcement to make. I have good
news and bad news. The good news is that this is the last occasion on
which members of the Committee will have to suffer somewhat bilious
interpretations of &#147;Erskine May&#148; and the pedantic
application of Standing Orders by me. As of today, hon. Members will be
left to the tender mercies of Mr. Peter Atkinson for the
remainder of our proceedings. The bad aspect is the fact that in my
experience in the position of Chairman, which is considerable, members
of the Committee will not do justice to the proposals within the time
set under the programme motion unless there is a major adjustment in
presentation techniques. I offer that advice in the spirit of kindness
and in the hope of helping to sort out our climatic
problems.</div><a name="08070372000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to point out that this is a maiden occasion for Minister
Ruddock, so I ask members of the Committee to be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000219"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> It is a pleasure to work in Committee under your
chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I assure you, at the outset, that no
coffee cups are in sight.</div>
<a name="08070372000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Forgive me if
my speech seems a little lengthy, but I will certainly shorten what I
have to say on future occasions. The amendments are the first of a
comprehensive package of Government amendments to clarify the role of
the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change. All
members of the Committee know that the debate on climate change within
and outside the House has focused mainly on mitigation, so I want to
stress that the completely new adaptation duties and powers under the
Bill show how seriously the Government take the need to adapt to
climate change.</div>
<a name="08070372000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The original
provisions have been strengthened as a result of the debate in the
other place. We have also listened carefully to the arguments put
forward about adaptation and agree that expert advice and scrutiny of
how the Government assess the risks and implement the programme are
important and useful. An adaptation sub-committee of the Climate Change
Committee could have a useful role, and we therefore propose to accept
the principle of the changes made in the other place to establish the
sub-committee on adaptation issues. However, we believe that the
committee should have a slightly different role from that set out in
the Bill, and we have tabled amendments in that regard. We shall
discuss the functions of the Committee on Climate Change when we deal
with clauses 34 and 35.</div>
<a name="08070372000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
10 would establish an adaptation sub-committee or, in Welsh, an
is-bwyllgor addsau of the Committee on Climate Change. First, it
provides that the job of the sub-committee is to offer advice,
analysis, information and other assistance to the Climate Change
Committee. That reflects the fact that other amendments would give the
committee the function of advising the national authorities and
reporting to Parliament on adaptation issues. Secondly, the amendment
would clarify the appointment processes and provides that not only the
Secretary of State, but the national authorities should appoint the
chair and members of the adaptation sub-committee. That is in line with
the arrangements made for the Climate Change Committee itself and
reflects the fact that it is to be a sub-committee of that body.
Thirdly, the amendment provides for the sub-committee chair to be
appointed from the committee&#146;s core membership following
consultation with its chairman and for at least five other members of
the sub-committee to be appointed after consultation with the
sub-committee chair. In practice, we expect sub-committee members to be
appointed through open competition following Office of the Commissioner
for Public Appointments rules, and we will ensure that the overall
membership will bring together a range of environmental, social and
economic expertise.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="08070372000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
10 proposes to delete, and not replace, paragraph 16(3), which sets out
a list of relevant criteria for the appointments. We are not making any
equivalent provision for a number of reasons. First, adaptation policy
is at an early stage of development. It is liable to change as we make
further developments in science and as we develop better solutions to
adapting sustainably. Putting a list in the Bill would prevent our
changing the membership of the committee in coming decades. Secondly,
the nature of adaptation and the work of the ASC, as it is currently
defined, are broad, and a comprehensive list would be very long.
Thirdly, for the first ASC we want to work with stakeholders, such as
environmental NGOs and utility companies as well as a range of
statutory bodies, to draw up a list of the expertise that is needed. We
must also ensure that the ASC does not duplicate existing expert advice
so that it provides value for money. The list will be agreed with the
chair of the ASC. The ASC must be competent in all the pillars of
sustainable development&#151;the environment, including biodiversity,
the economy and impacts on society. Those need to be grounded in robust
science and in expertise in delivering the changes that we
require.</div>
<a name="08070372000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
80 would add &#147;sustainable development&#148; to the list of
expertise of the ASC. As I have already said, we do not believe that
there should be any such list in the Bill. Therefore, we cannot accept
the amendment. That is not to say that we do not support the principles
behind the amendment. Let me assure the Committee that we are committed
to taking a sustainable approach across our climate change policies and
that we will deliver our adaptation programme in the context of
sustainable development.</div>
<a name="08070372000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
ASC must have a broad understanding of the context in which the
Government work. Adapting to the impacts of climate change is itself a
good example of actively practising sustainable development. We are
working to embed sustainable adaptation across all Government policy
areas as part of our adapting to climate change programme. The Bill
commits the Government to deliver an adaptation programme that
contributes to sustainable development. The environmental aspects of
sustainable development and specific policies, such as those on
biodiversity, are key to developing a truly sustainable adaptation
programme and will be given due consideration in cross-cutting work on
adapting to climate change. For example, we are already working with
out statutory environment advisers Natural England and the Environment
Agency on the risk assessment and the statutory guidance.</div>
<a name="08070372000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
amendment No. 80 raises the important issue of sustainable development,
I do not accept that that issue needs to be put in the Bill. We must
maintain flexibility, and any list needs to be developed in
consultation with stakeholders and the chair of the
sub-committee.</div><a name="08070372000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 14 proposes to amend clause 37 by adding that the
Committee on Climate Change, with the sub-committee&#146;s help, must
provide any further advice on adaptation issues that may be requested
by the Secretary of State or any of the devolved Administrations. The
committee is a UK-wide body and adaptation issues will vary in
different countries. It is important that the devolved Administrations
make proper use of the expertise that the committee and sub-committee
can provide.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div><a name="08070372000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
established an adaptation sub-committee through Government amendment
No. 10, we have also tabled a series of amendments, Government
amendments Nos. 11, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which tidy up some of
the governance arrangements on the provision of information, guidance
and directions to the Committee on Climate Change. They mirror the
existing provisions around the mitigation functions of the
committee.</div><a name="08070372000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070372000220"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): I suppose that it was
inevitable that in accepting the establishment of an adaptation
sub-committee, which we welcome, the Government would wish to
substitute their own wording for that used by the House of Lords. I am
somewhat concerned that the competencies that were detailed by our
noble Friends and neighbours have been removed in the
Government&#146;s wording, and I am not sure that I understand the
logic. Once again, the Government have simply transferred something
specific in the Bill into a good intention. That seems to be a rather
pointless exercise, especially as it removes the wording that our
amendment No. 80 seeks to
add.</div><a name="08070372000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to add to the list of competencies for the ASC the concept of
sustainable development. That issue has already been discussed in this
Committee, but our feeling is that there is a slight risk that a
complete list of the various competencies, including ecology, science,
public health and risk management, might be rather less than the sum of
its parts, and that it is important to impress upon the ASC during its
establishment the need to bring the different strands
together.</div><a name="08070372000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give an example that shows how there might be a temptation, in
adaptation in particular, to take a more short-term view than the main
committee. Flood risk is something that I, as a Gloucestershire MP, am
aware of and consider important. However, in certain circumstances,
dealing with it could lead to a large amount of civil engineering and
substantial defensive work that is consistent with risk management,
which is one of the other competencies on the list, but might be an
inappropriate and unsustainable response to an evolving climate
pattern&#151;in fact, it might contribute more carbon emissions than
it
prevents.</div><a name="08070372000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
seek to insert the words &#147;sustainable development&#148; in the
list to ensure that the group as a whole takes a holistic approach, and
that the ASC in particular respects Gro Harlem Brundtland&#146;s
original request that the principles of sustainable development be
reflected in policy around the
world.</div><a name="08070372000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070372000221"></a><b class="B">Gregory
Barker</b> (Bexhill and Battle) (Con): Good morning,
Mr. Cook. Adaptation is often seen as the Cinderella of the
climate change agenda, and the advocates of a robust and ambitious
adaptation strategy often feel that they are crowded out of the debate
by those who are concerned only with the threat of climate change and
solutions to it. Unfortunately, we cannot choose between a climate
change strategy that focuses on the solutions and adaptation. The
science tells us that climate change is inevitable; it is just a matter
of whether we can hold back the most dangerous consequences of man-made
climate change. Therefore, adaptation is
vital.</div><a name="08070372000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are those who would argue that adaptation ought to be central to the
Climate Change Committee&#146;s remit and that giving it to a
sub-committee somehow makes it a junior, or lesser, part of the agenda.
Some would say that we are trying to pigeonhole the adaptation agenda
at a rank below that which it ought to occupy.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="08070372000176"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I understand those
concerns, but I do not agree with them. Their lordships in the other
place were right to establish the ASC, because it will require a
slightly different skills set from the one that may be present on the
committee, which will be of a relatively limited
size.</div><a name="08070372000188"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08070372000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have pushed for an enlarged committee, but the Government did not
accept that. Given that there will be a relatively small number of
experts on that panel, it is right that the sub-committee should have a
clear adaptation focus. As important as a robust, ambitious adaptation
strategy is, a clear communication strategy is needed, too, so that it
is not sidelined in the public
debate.</div><a name="08070372000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
Conservatives have no substantive problems with any of the amendments
tabled on the ASC. However, it is necessary to ask the Minister just to
clarify a couple of points. In respect of the Government&#146;s
amendment to schedule 1(16), will she explain why the national
authorities should appoint the ASC chair, when it is meant to be a
non-political appointment? No such requirement existed in the original
provision. Why did the Government feel it necessary to make that
significant
change?</div><a name="08070372000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham has made some sensible points about
amendment No. 80. I am happy to say that I support the inclusion of the
words &#147;sustainable development&#148; in the required expert
criteria for prospective ASC members. We have already had the debate
about the importance of sustainable development and the need for an
accurate, clear
definition.</div><a name="08070372000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000222"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am delighted to have the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s support. Is he aware that the Environmental Audit
Committee also supports, and indeed recommended, this
change?</div><a name="08070372000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000223"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Indeed. That helped to inform our thinking. I
congratulate the hon. Gentleman, who is a member of the EAC, on taking
up its recommendation and tabling it in an amendment. I do not want to
rehearse all the arguments about sustainability, except to say that the
hon. Gentleman is right that it should be included in the Bill. It is
vital that sustainability criteria are included in the planning for
mitigation and adaptation policies. Thus it makes eminently good sense
to include persons with expertise in sustainable development on the
ASC. I support the Liberal Democrat amendment and Government amendments
Nos. 11 to 18. Linking the ASC to the reporting requirements on climate
change impacts and adaptation in clauses 36, 40 and 41 seems eminently
sensible, and it is a necessary joining up of related appropriate
powers in the Bill.</div>
<a name="08070372000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000224"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Member for Cheltenham has said that we
are removing specific competencies. As I said in my opening remarks,
however, adaptation is a wide subject. If we were to include all the
competencies that might be desirable, the list would be extraordinarily
long and in no way adequate, even if we were to accept his amendment
and leave the other items on the list in place. Including expertise in
international development 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>on the list, for example, would not be appropriate in terms of the ASC,
which deals with adaptation in the UK. Furthermore, considering public
health, for instance, we could argue that wider public welfare includes
much more than public health. There are criticisms of the list as it
stands, let alone with the addition of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div><a name="08070372000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000225"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am astonished by the Minister&#146;s comments
about international development. Clearly, the most enormous impacts in
terms of adaptation and climate change will affect the poorest
countries in the world, which has profound implications for British
Government policy through the Department for International Development
and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Surely, this area of expertise
links to the climate science and many other areas on the list, which
are
vital.</div><a name="08070372000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000226"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument about
impacts is, of course, correct. Through the Department for
International Development, the Government are extremely active in
supporting developing countries in tackling their adaptation needs.
That is quite different from the needs of the membership of the ASC,
which deals with adaptation in the UK itself.</div>
<a name="08070372000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Minister for the Environment and I have been at pains in
Committee to indicate the way in which sustainable development is
embedded across Government and to point out that all Departments have
duties in that respect. Any bodies that are set up, such as the
adaptation sub-committee, will, of course, be bound by those
principles. We have defined exactly what sustainable development means
for the Committee, how the Government understands it and where it has
been defined. There are sustainable action plans right across
Government.</div>
<a name="08070372000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are clear
that although sustainable development is an incredibly important topic,
it imbues everything that we do, and it is therefore unnecessary to
place it in the list. Even if we have the most extensive list, we are
only going to appoint a small number of people at the end of the day.
There is therefore no way in which the individuals concerned can be
people with a particular expertise in all those things. They need to be
able to cover all the topics, and, because science and practice are
developing, we will need to consult the person appointed as the
sub-chair of the committee regarding the appointment of further
members. There is no doubt that we need to proceed in a way other than
that proposed by the hon. Gentleman in his amendment.</div>
<a name="08070372000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle rightly said that we cannot choose
between adaptation and mitigation. We agree wholeheartedly on that
point, which is why we have constructed the sub-committee in a way in
which ensures that it is part of the full committee and that the
linkage is there. That is the way in which we expect to proceed, and we
think that it is the right
way.</div><a name="08070372000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle has asked why national authorities
should appoint the sub-committee chair. That is because we need to work
with the devolved Administrations. It is important that the
consultation on these appointments is done in conjunction with the
devolved Administrations, which is why the decision will involve them.
He discussed and welcomed our other amendments, and I am grateful for
his support.</div>

adaptation sub-committee would be enormously long&#151;well, it would
be exactly as long as the list in front of us in the Bill. I do not

<a name="08070372000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000232"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> One month to save the world is precisely
right.</div>
<a name="08070372000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
difference does it make if the month is December or November? During
the Bill&#146;s progress through the House, changes have been made to
the version seen in the Lords. When this House has completed its
deliberations, the Bill will go back to another place and, I speculate,
it will return to us. It therefore seems inevitable that the
proceedings will not be completed until October or November. Clause 33
currently requires the Committee on Climate Change to report on 1
December, so we could still be debating the Bill, and the target, in
early November. The long title says that this Bill is &#147;to set a
target&#148;&#151;that is the first thing that it seeks to
do.</div>
<a name="08070372000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
lengthy debates in Committee about what that target should be and on
what basis and, during the course of the debate, it struck me that the
comments made by the hon. Member for Bury, North were
characteristically profound. If we could arrange to have the benefit of
the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s assessment while the Bill is
still live, we could address the official Opposition&#146;s
legitimate concern that that committee&#146;s standing should not be
undermined by our second-guessing it. If the committee had to report by
1 November, while the Bill is still live, we would know what it thought
and could decide whether to put the number that it suggests in the
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div><a name="08070372000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppose that,
on 1 November, the Committee on Climate Change comes up with a
number&#151;80 per cent., for example, although it could be anything.
The official Opposition, who have said that they will abide by the
committee&#146;s advice, would be happy to put that figure in the
Bill. We would be happy to do so, as we have already indicated, and the
position of Government Members who signed the amendment on 80 per cent.
that we considered earlier in our proceedings would be strengthened, as
they would be able to see the latest scientific assessment agreed by
the independent committee. The question is whether the Government will
accept the number suggested by the committee. Rather than passing the
Bill and taking it on trust that the Government will implement that
number, amendment No. 102 would allow us to know the number. In that
case, the Government would make a choice, and the House would decide
what it thought about that
choice.</div><a name="08070372000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
bringing forward this important work by one month is a significant ask
for the Climate Change Committee. It is right and proper that, before
speaking to the amendment, I spoke to Lord Turner. I did so at the
weekend, partly as a courtesy&#151;if we are going to give him a
harder task, it is only right to let him know&#151;and partly to see
what he thought. We spoke at some length. He was understandably keen
not be associated with the views of any political party on such issues,
and the views that I express are my own, informed by what he said but
not attributable to him.</div>
<a name="08070372000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppose that
the Committee had to produce a report on 1 December. As we know, in
such cases minds are not made up on 30 November. People begin to work
out what they think during the work, and they start to get an overall
picture. Although the last two, three or four weeks of the
committee&#146;s work might be taken up with pretty bar charts,
checking scientific references and so on, it is not unreasonable to
suppose that by 1 November the committee would be in a position to
advise the Government in summary about the direction of travel. On that
date, it probably could not meet the requirement in clause 34, which
includes a 1 December deadline, to provide detailed advice on carbon
budgets, which is the nitty-gritty, because some work might still be
outstanding, which is why I have not tabled an amendment to clause 34.
However, the committee might be able to perform the single task set out
in clause 33, which is to advise on the 2050
target.</div><a name="08070372000189"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08070372000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully accept that these are interconnected issues. It would be
na√Øve to say that the committee could advise on the 2050 target
without reaching a decision on international effort, aviation and
shipping, or greenhouse gas lists. That is a fair point to make.
However, it does not seem unreasonable that the committee might be
asked to bring its recommendation forward a month. Then, when we
finalise our considerations in the House, all of us will know what the
committee thinks, and rather than us amateurs&#151;speaking for
myself, I am an amateur on the subject&#151;plucking a number from
the air, we will have expert opinion. That will be so much more
powerful when we finalise the
Bill.</div><a name="08070372000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is one small practical problem with that suggestion. If the committee
has to report by 1 November, as the amendment suggests, and the Bill
does not come into law until later in November, technically it is not
binding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>on the committee to produce the report by 1 November, because there is
no law to say that it must do so. There is a slight problem of logic
there.</div>
<a name="08070372000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
suspend the fiction that the committee on climate change does not
exist. The committee is already out there. It does exist. I rang the
man on Saturday. I spoke to the chairman of the committee. The
committee is doing its work. There are people beavering away. What
questions are they answering? The questions in the Bill. The Bill says
what the committee has to do.</div>
<a name="08070372000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a way,
therefore, what I am calling for in the amendment is a dirty great
hint, let us say, so that the shadow committee on climate change
understands that the will of the House is that it reports by 1
November. If the Secretary of State or the Minister wanted to write to
the committee to reinforce the dirty great hint that we wanted its
opinion by 1 November, I would welcome that. Indeed, if the
Minister&#146;s reply was, &#147;Well, forget the Bill, I&#146;ll
write to them and tell them to do it anyway&#148;, I would welcome
that too.</div>
<a name="08070372000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
labour this point, as it is clear what I am trying to do. We all want
to make the decision on the basis of the best evidence, and if we can
have the best evidence a few weeks earlier, albeit in summary form,
that would be good. I note that clause 33(5)
states:</div><a name="08070372000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
soon as is reasonably practicable after giving its advice...the
Committee must publish that
advice&#148;.</div><a name="08070372000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the committee can say what it thinks the number is,
perhaps with a paragraph or two of
explanation.</div><a name="08070372000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
soon as is reasonably
practicable&#148;,</div><a name="08070372000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">it
can do the full monty, as it were, in parliamentary terms. That seems
to be the best balance that we can achieve.</div>
<a name="08070372000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
one final observation, which comes back to the question, &#147;Why
specify 80 per cent. or 60 per cent. in the Bill?&#148; I have spoken
to the Minister and to the Secretary of State about the issue and I
found myself in a slightly awkward position, because I realised that
what I was saying to the Secretary of State sounded as though I was
saying, &#147;I don&#146;t trust you&#148;. I thought,
&#147;That&#146;s not what I&#146;m saying.&#148; I was trying
to work out what I wanted to say, because it is slightly awkward to say
to someone, &#147;I don&#146;t trust you to do what the committee
says. I don&#146;t trust you to change the Bill.&#148; The reason I
realised that that was not what I meant to say was that I thought,
&#147;I do trust the DEFRA Ministers to want to do this, but I
don&#146;t trust the rest of Government to go along with it.&#148;
That is the important point.</div>
<a name="08070372000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I do trust
that the Minister wants the right number in the Bill, but once the
climate change committee publishes its report after the passage of the
Bill, if it does so, DEFRA may say, &#147;Yes, we want 80 per cent.,
because it says 80 per cent. in the Bill&#148;, and the Treasury, the
Department for Transport, the Ministry responsible for housing or
whoever it is may say, &#147;Ah, but...&#148;. That is what we
are trying to deal with here.</div>
<a name="08070372000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
will strengthen the hand of DEFRA, which I sincerely believe wants the
right number in the Bill. It would give DEFRA a stick to beat the rest
of Government with, because it will know on 1 November that the figure
is 80 per cent. or whatever it is, and it will say to the rest of
Government, &#147;There is no way now that we can stop now.
Parliament clearly wants either the advice of the committee or 80 per
cent.&#148;, which may coincide&#151;Parliament may want both those
things. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>will be an overwhelming desire for that to happen.
So, if the Minister can give us the date 1 November, or a letter to
Adair Turner saying that he wants 1 November, we can achieve what I
think the vast majority of us want.</div>
<a name="08070372000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000233"></a>Joan
Walley:</b> I support the amendment in principle. I take it to
be a probing amendment. Along with many colleagues in this place, I
supports the move towards at least 80 per cent. In the debate so far,
we have heard many contributions about the role of the Environmental
Audit Committee and its many inquiries into climate change, in respect
of the recommendation of 80 per
cent.</div><a name="08070372000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
reference to the date and whether we could have an earlier resolution
of these matters, it may be helpful to tell the Committee that in the
course of its deliberations the Environmental Audit Committee is keen
to have a private hearing with Adair Turner, to discuss those very
issues. Select Committees have an important role in trying to find a
way through difficult decisions on timing and so on. I hope that such
initiatives will be helpful in taking the legislation
forward.</div>
<a name="08070372000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070372000234"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): It is in everyone&#146;s
interest that we have the greatest possible consensus on the Bill
because it will run for many years under Governments of all
persuasions. It must be in the interest of the Government and of
business managers for the advice of the Climate Change Committee to be
made available before Report and Third Reading, otherwise the remaining
stages of the Bill will be incredibly frustrating.</div>
<a name="08070372000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are not
careful, the Minister&#146;s line to take on Report and Third Reading
will be the same as in Committee, and the headline out there, in the
<i class="I">The Guardian</i> and other newspapers, will be &#147;Government
betray 80 per cent. target&#148;. Every single person who has taken
the time and trouble to get in touch with us, to write to us, to send
us postcards, such as those involved in &#147;The Big Ask&#148;
campaign, will feel betrayed. As an Opposition MP, I will be quite
happy if large numbers of people think they are being betrayed by the
Government, as that will add to the increasing army of people who are
frustrated with this Government&#146;s performance. In practical
terms, however, it would be good news if we could carry that
constituency with us, thinking that Parliament has achieved
something.</div>
<a name="08070372000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
matter of the Minister trying to work out with his officials a line to
take. It would not be difficult for the Government to say that so far
as is possible, they will try to ensure that Report and Third Reading
of the Bill take place after the Climate Change Committee has given
advice to Ministers. That advice could then be reflected by what the
Government say on Report and Third Reading, not least by what they say
to the House about how much attention they will pay to the advice of
the Climate Change Committee. In that way, we would know what the
Climate Change Committee has to say and how much regard the Government
will pay to that advice. Otherwise, we will have a frustrating Report
and Third Reading and the likely victims of that frustration will be
not the Opposition, but the Government and the Government&#146;s
supporters.</div>

and the amendment is well intentioned and reasonable. The hon. Member
for Northavon put his finger on it when he said that the Committee does
not doubt that the ministerial team would like the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>amendment to be made, but there is a widespread
sneaking suspicion that the enthusiasm and commitment of the DEFRA
Ministers to an effective policy is not shared by the rest of the
Government. We have a Prime Minister who perhaps does not get it in the
same way as his predecessor did. He is more battered by expediency and
is inclined to take all matters into consideration and dither when
confronted with hard decisions. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Ah&#148;] Well, the record of the past 12 months speaks for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000238"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000239"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> It would greatly help to inform the debate and the
decision-making process later in the year if we had access to the
committee&#146;s views. Opposition Front-Bench members hold to the
position that the critical decision to set the target should be taken
on the basis of the committee&#146;s informed opinion, and it would
make eminent sense to move forward by one month the date on which the
committee must advise the Secretary of State on the resetting of the
2050 target. I have not spoken to Adair Turner, but there are concerns
that by truncating the process, we might limit the scope of the
committee&#146;s considerations or place on it an unwanted additional
burden.</div>
<a name="08070372000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to the hon. Member for Northavon, and I am willing to take at
face value what he said about his discussion with Lord Turner, without
attributing anything directly to the committee chairman. It is
important that we take into account the committee&#146;s views, if
possible. The inconvenient truth is that the Bill will not have
received Royal Assent by 1 November 2008, and we worry about how to
legislate for a deadline that will have passed by the time the Bill
becomes law. I hope the Minister will clarify today exactly what powers
the shadow Committee on Climate Change will have prior to the
Bill&#146;s enactment.</div>
<a name="08070372000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
draws our attention to how slow the Government have been in taking the
Bill through Parliament. If they had followed the timetable that we all
expected, the Bill would have passed through both Houses and become law
by the summer recess, or sooner, which would have given the Committee
on Climate Change exactly six months in which to produce its report. As
it stands, however, the shadow committee will be official for a number
of weeks at best before it must report on the 2050 target. That
situation is far from ideal, and I commend the Liberal Democrats for
tabling the amendment, if for no other reason than to highlight the
Government&#146;s procrastination on such a vital piece of
legislation.</div><a name="08070372000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070372000240"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): Allegations of betrayal
have been made over the 80 per cent. target, but yesterday both
Opposition parties had an opportunity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>to make an important contribution to the achievement
of that target. They could have supported the application of the new
variable vehicle excise duty system to the existing vehicle fleet, but
refused to do so. In discussing the importance of that target, we must
recognise the need to support the mechanisms and policies that will
achieve it, and not just make vague gestures endorsing the target
itself.</div>
<a name="08070372000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am
slightly aggrieved that the Liberal Democrats have stolen my
intellectual copyright, the amendment has some merit and I hope the
Minister will respond sympathetically. My comments on Tuesday did not
refer only to bringing forward the date of the full report, but left
open the option of an interim report. Furthermore, I do not think that
1 November is the only date that could be considered for either the
full or the interim report.</div>

am grateful to the hon. Member for Northavon, who has helped the

intention, and credited my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North in
that conversation. The hon. Member for Northavon has also talked to the
chairman of the shadow committee to see what is possible. Let me try to
help the Committee in two ways&#151;to echo you, Mr. Cook,
the good news and the bad news. I think that the good news outweighs

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000243"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is what it says in the
brief.</div><a name="08070372000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall help the Committee by quoting subsection
(3):</div><a name="08070372000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Committee must give its advice under this section before 1st December
2008.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we put the figure in, we were not in the position that we are in
now&#151;we did not know when Report and Third Reading would be.
Indeed, the suggestion by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle on the
alleged delay would have made the problem worse. Pragmatically, we felt
that a requirement to provide advice before December gives sufficient
time.</div><a name="08070372000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been said, at the moment the committee is a shadow one. In
accordance with the conventions of Parliament, the committee can spend
taxpayers&#146; money, because the Bill has had Second Reading.
However, anything that the committee does before it is vested has no
legal import. Therefore, the advice itself, and the relationship of the
Government and Parliament to that advice, is not based in
statute&#151;our Bill&#151;until the committee has been vested,
which cannot take place until the Bill has received Royal Assent. I had
hoped that I would get credit for what I thought was beautiful tapestry
with the date, because 1 December is the day before the Queen&#146;s
Speech&#151;I thought that that would be obvious, but it clearly was
not. Seriously, the date means before 1 December, and I am more than
happy to make that clear to the shadow committee and its
chair.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div><a name="08070372000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
advice on the 2∞ target and what we may be able to do under our
Bill is in the interests of Parliament, and I have given a commitment
to seek advice and to take a decision on that. Having interim advice
on, for example, the long-term target would clearly benefit Parliament
and deliberations on Third Reading and Report. The hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle was cruel to my leader, saying that he has been
&#147;battered by expediency&#148;, although I point to last
night&#146;s vote for a case of battering with expediency. However, I
will keep away from partisan points.</div>
<a name="08070372000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were
simply acting expediently, we would accept the point of the hon. Member
for Banbury and agree with the amendment. The person whose life would
be easiest as a result would be my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State&#151;or mine and my hon. Friend&#146;s. Seriously, if we were
to pass the amendment as it stands at the moment, the committee would
still not be based on statute, because of the lack of Royal Assent. We
have to remember that the committee does not legally
exist.</div><a name="08070372000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000244"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Is anyone really saying that they will not accept
the advice of the committee, if the committee does not legally exist?
Surely what we want in Parliament, and what the public wants, is the
advice of the committee. We do not want some technical, legal assurance
that the committee exists in statute. We want to know the advice of
those wise
men&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i><i class="I">&#151;</i>and
women. It is not the legal definition, but the opinion of that group of
experts that we
seek.</div><a name="08070372000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000245"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I understand the political point that is being
made&#151;of course I do&#151;but I am seeking to defend the status
of law. Opposition Members have said that it is not DEFRA Ministers
whom they do not trust, but the rest of the Government. One cannot
knowingly table an amendment to instruct a committee that does not
exist, because it would have no status in law. Clearly, if the
committee were able to make public its views and its interim advice, if
we can use that phrase, it would have a huge policy import. However,
all the debates that we had on Tuesday about the relationships between
the committee and the Government, and the Government and Parliament,
would mean nothing. It would be a Del Boy
clause.</div><a name="08070372000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000246"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> As the Minister probably gathered, no one
particularly wants this amendment, but we want an undertaking from the
Minister that he will write an elegant letter to the chair of the
shadow Committee explaining that we would like this advice before
Report and Third Reading. It is very simple. What we really want to
hear from the Minister is how he gets off the hook. The most shocking
thing that I have heard today is the idea of a Liberal spokesman
rampaging across the machinery of government speaking to chairs of
shadow committees. The Minister should get a grip on this, and we will
not have the Liberals interfering in the machinery of government, which
they have absolutely no place to do. That is the most shocking thing
about all this. If the Minister can get a grip on the matter, and
ensure that by the time that we come to Report and Third Reading, we
can elegantly deal with without anyone feeling betrayed, it would be
really wonderful.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div><a name="08070372000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000247"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I will take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sound
advice. I have tried to answer him and give him the undertaking that he
needs by pointing out the clause&#146;s reference to &#147;before 1
December&#148;, and I undertake formally to bring that to the
attention of the chairman of the shadow Committee.</div>
<a name="08070372000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Large numbers
of hon. Members on both sides of the House believe that we should do
what is being said. I do not see this as a partisan point. I am sure
that there will be those who say that if we are able to do this, the
Government are caving in under pressure. There is a range of views on
this, and it is wrong to say that it is the members of the Government
who are looking for a way out of this. It was the Prime Minister in his
speech in November who put the question before
us.</div>
<a name="08070372000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000248"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> We are grateful for what we have just heard. Would
the Minister be willing&#151;I cannot think why he would
not&#151;to place in the Library of the House a copy of the letter
that he sends to the chairman of the
Committee?</div><a name="08070372000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000249"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Yes. Like, I hope, all my letters, that letter
will be
elegant.</div><a name="08070372000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070372000250"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): I have listened very
carefully to the Minister&#146;s argument, which appears to be rooted
exclusively in issues of law. He has not mentioned to the Committee any
concerns about practicality or pressure. Can we take it that his
understanding is that the November deadline will not create practical
problems?</div><a name="08070372000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000251"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is astute. I have not used
those arguments, because the answer is that I do not know. When we
looked at the timing, we judged that before 1 December, which is a
Monday, was reasonable. I do not know the answer, and I do not know for
sure the view of the chairman on the question whether making an interim
report, or some such advice, public would separate the long-term goals
from the medium-tern goals. In my view, is possible to do that, but I
do not know whether that is the chairman&#146;s
view.</div>
<a name="08070372000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000252"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> If the Minister&#146;s position is rooted in
honest ignorance, may I make a suggestion? One of my concerns about
practicalities is that the committee will have another extremely
important job to do by 1 December, which is to pass comment on not one
but three carbon budgets. Those are incredibly important judgments to
make, so I am a little puzzled why there is such a hard line on 1
December. Is there room for some
flexibility?</div><a name="08070372000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000253"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The answer concerns the relationship between that
advice and the Chancellor&#146;s Budget in March, if one sees the
beautiful tapestry. There will be the pre-Budget report, the advice and
then, of course, the Budget. Remembering that the pre-Budget report is
a consultation, the committee&#146;s advice will dovetail with those
events. The key words are &#147;before 1st
December&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070372000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
question asked by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, the Bill
creates the committee. The Secretary of State will make a commencement
order to bring the committee into existence before its advice is given,
but, obviously, that can happen only after Royal Assent. Ahead of that
date, the committee cannot legally exercise any of the legal functions
that the Bill grants it, which is the formal legal position.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div><a name="08070372000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for Northavon. His point is
helpful to the good sense of the debate in Parliament and consequently
to the Government &#151;I nearly said &#147;for once&#148;, but
that would be
unfair.</div><a name="08070372000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000254"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The debate has been very constructive, despite my
amendment being called the Del Boy amendment and being accused of
rampaging across the machinery of government.</div>
<a name="08070372000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me state
my understanding of what the Minister has said. He has emphasised that
the law requires the matter to be dealt with before 1 December, which
does not necessarily mean that date, and he has undertaken to write to
the chair of the committee and to publish that letter. I understand and
hope that that letter will make explicit reference to the parliamentary
timetable and the advantage to Parliament of receiving an interim
indication of the committee&#146;s thinking prior to our further
deliberations.</div><a name="08070372000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000255"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My emphasis was on drawing attention to the words
&#147;before 1st December&#148; in clause 33(3), and on pointing
out the parliamentary
timetable.</div><a name="08070372000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000256"></a>Steve

assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

me press the Minister for clarification on three points. I do not want
this to turn into the war of the Select Committees, but the excellent
report of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
on the draft Bill raised certain points about the committee&#146;s
powers under clause 33, the resources available to it, its independence
and the duty on the Government to accept its advice. The Select
Committee clearly stated in paragraph 85:</div>
<a name="08070372000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Committee on Climate Change should not be a policy-making or delivery
body. It should be focussed on the provision of advice...but it
must not be prevented from advising the Government on any policy
matters that may come to its attention while carrying out its
duties.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
86
states:</div><a name="08070372000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
order to establish the independence of the Committee on Climate Change,
the Secretary of State should be required to accept its recommendations
without further
debate.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee concluded that that would place</div>
<a name="08070372000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Committee&#146;s advice alongside that of the Monetary Policy
Committee whose interest rate decisions are not challengeable by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer except under very extreme
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
paragraph 88, the Committee
stated:</div><a name="08070372000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not see that the Bill prevents the Committee on Climate Change from
recommending the mid- and long-term targets, but it is not clear that
the Committee will have this power. We recommend that by 2009 the
Committee should review and recommend to the Secretary of State what
the 2020 and 2050 target should be... In addition, the Committee
should have the power and responsibility to make recommendations to the
Secretary of State at any time regarding the mid- and long-term
targets.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div><a name="08070372000191"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08070372000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee went on to consider what resources there should be. In
response to the earlier amendment, the Minister said that, legally, the
committee does not exist. However, it is currently being resourced in
shadow form and the resources will go up incrementally as the committee
takes legal effect.</div>
<a name="08070372000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In paragraph
101, the Select Committee
states:</div><a name="08070372000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is imperative that the staff and information resources available to the
Committee on Climate Change are completely independent of Government.
We recommend that independent consultants be asked by the Government to
recommend the correct level of resources available to the Committee in
order to establish that it is properly
resourced.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not see any opportunity in the later stages of the Bill to discuss
the important matter of resources. Usually such discussion takes place
in one of the debates on the schedules, but I see no reference to
resources in schedule 1. Will the Minister confirm that the Secretary
of State will be obliged to follow the advice? We have established that
the advice will be published and debated. Will the Secretary of State
be obliged to follow that advice? Are we satisfied that the committee
will be independent of Government, and can the Minister convince us
that the resources available to the committee to perform its functions
are adequate for its
task?</div><a name="08070372000125"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000260"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Thank you, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="08070372000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the committee is a NDPB, the rules governing it are covered by those
governing NDPBs. That is why schedule 1, which relates to some of the
administrative matters pertaining to the committee, is not as
comprehensive as it might be. The committee draws its accountability
rules from NDPBs.</div>
<a name="08070372000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer to
the Government&#146;s response to the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Committee in the Command Paper published last October,
&#147;Taking Forward the UK Climate Change Bill: The Government
Response to Pre-Legislative Scrutiny and Public Consultation&#148;.
That is why the relationship between the committee, its advice and the
Government is as it was laid out in our debate on clauses 1 and 2. It
is advice that can be rejected, and that is how an NDPB operates. The
advice is public. The transparency that the Committee also recommended
is important in meeting some of its objections.</div>
<a name="08070372000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Turner
appeared before the Select Committee in March. He
stated:</div><a name="08070372000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the role of our Committee certainly to consider the range of
policies which are in place and the effectiveness of those policies
because without that we cannot recommend what is a credible budget.
There is no point in us simply saying we think the budget by 2020
should be X,Y and Z without being able to tell a story of a credible
path from here to
there.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that
helps.</div><a name="08070372000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
resources, I am certainly not the most experienced Minister, but I am
experienced enough to know that whatever is granted is never enough.
Please do not quote that out of context. However, Lord Turner, who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>is the chairman of the Climate Change Committee, told the EFRA Committee
that he thought that the resources were adequate for the job in hand.
Of course, that will have to be
reviewed.</div><a name="08070372000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
size of the secretariat is important. Again, Lord Turner confirmed when
he gave evidence to the Select Committee in March that he was satisfied
with the arrangements. However, I am mindful that the size and shape of
the secretariat will need to be regularly reviewed as the work of the
committee
progresses.</div><a name="08070372000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
to what I described as a beautiful tapestry, I draw the attention of
the Committee to the work of the UK climate impact programme, which
will have a significant bearing on the debate. If it creates surprises
and projections that cause us to readdress the science, I may need to
review the resources that are available to the committee. That is far
outside the remit of clause 33, but it might be
helpful.</div><a name="08070372000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot go into detail on all the questions, but I am grateful to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000262"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000263"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> As has been noted, we believe an adaptation
sub-committee of the Climate Change Committee would have a useful role,
but we think that it should be a more technical one in line with the
rest of the work of the
committee.</div><a name="08070372000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee&#146;s role on adaptation should be consistent with its
work on mitigation; that is, it should involve technical advice and
analysis, and scrutiny of progress. That means that it should provide
technical advice to the Government and the devolved Administrations on
the risk assessment, and progress reports to Parliament about the
Government&#146;s adaptation
programme.</div><a name="08070372000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other place agreed that the committee should not be a policy-making
body. Many sensitive decisions will have to be taken in order for us to
reduce our emissions and adapt to climate change. They properly should
be taken by elected representatives in Parliament and in the
Government. The committee will have a vital role in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>providing impartial advice and scrutiny, but we do not think it
appropriate for an unelected body to make, or be seen to be making,
policies. The individual decisions that will directly affect families,
communities and businesses should be made by Parliament and the
Government.</div><a name="08070372000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that in mind, Government amendments Nos. 12, 19 and 20
delete the current roles of the sub-committee, and Government new
clause 3 gives new functions to the main committee. The new clause sets
out the first new function that we are giving to the committee, which
is to give advice on the risk assessment required in clause 55. Expert
input to the risk assessment will help to strengthen the evidence base
that will underpin the Government&#146;s adaptation programme.
Independent review will add to the transparency of the assessment and,
therefore, the basis upon which the programme is
built.</div><a name="08070372000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee&#146;s role will be to provide expert advice on the
preparation of the risk assessment to ensure that it is as robust as
possible. That is wholly in line with the committee&#146;s wider
role, which is highly technocratic and focused on specialist advice on
carbon budgets. With the committee advising on the risk assessment, we
do not see the need for specific provision to be made giving the
Environmental Audit Committee an additional role in this area. For that
reason, we tabled Government amendment No. 20, which would remove the
duty currently in the Bill requiring the Government to invite the EAC
to review the risk assessment. The EAC will still be free to look at
the adaptation work, or any other area of work, should it chose to do
so. Indeed, it has already considered adaptation as part of its work on
climate change and local and regional
government.</div><a name="08070372000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the Government to ask a parliamentary Committee to consider a
particular piece of work would be an anomaly in the Bill because it
could be seen to interfere with the EAC&#146;s independence. We
expect that the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, together
with the likelihood of further parliamentary scrutiny, will ensure that
the risk assessment is robust and transparent. We also hope that
adaptation will be considered&#151;I am sure it will be&#151;by a
wider range of parliamentary Committees, because clearly it is not
simply an environmental issue, but one that will cut across all aspects
of the economy and society. If we receive advice, we will be sure to
make use of it, which is why we tabled Government amendment No. 19,
which ensures that the Government must consider the advice of the
Committee on Climate Change before laying the national climate change
risk assessment before Parliament.</div>
<a name="08070372000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the advice on the risk assessment from the adaptation
sub-committee will add value to the Government&#146;s adaptation work
and complement the committee&#146;s wider work. It would be
inappropriate for the Government to have to invite a parliamentary
Committee to review its work, as the decision on whether to review
should be a matter for that Committee
itself.</div>
<a name="08070372000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000264"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> This is a complex and intertwined group of
amendments, and it would be beneficial to seek clarification from the
Minister on a few points. As the Bill stands, the Committee on Climate
Change has reporting duties to Parliament on the Government&#146;s
progress on adaptation and mitigation. However, the Government&#146;s
amendments will remove the committee&#146;s reporting duties on
progress towards adaptation, which means that there would be no
requirement on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>adaptation sub-committee to scrutinise Government performance and to
report to Parliament on its findings. If I have interpreted the
proposal correctly, I find it worrying, and would appreciate assurances
from the Minister that the role of the independent committee is not
being watered
down.</div><a name="08070372000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the amendments, the adaptation sub-committee will have a far more
nebulous role in adaptation scrutiny reporting, particularly when
compared with the clear scrutiny functions of the Committee on Climate
Change itself on
mitigation.</div><a name="08070372000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000265"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> We will come on to the progress reporting
function in the next group of amendments, which is why I did not deal
with that
before.</div><a name="08070372000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000266"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point, so I shall
withhold further comments on that until we get to later amendments.
Will she explain why the Government have proposed what seems to be a
more muted role for the adaptation sub-committee, and how she envisages
the sub-committee adding value to the Government&#146;s work, if it
does not have any powers or obligations on formal scrutiny and
reporting on the progress to the Government?</div>
<a name="08070372000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not
fully persuaded by the Minister&#146;s explanation why, under
amendment No. 20, the Government want to remove the duty on the
Secretary of State to invite the House of Commons Environmental Audit
Committee to review every report on adaptation that is laid before
Parliament. I am sure the Committee will be interested in the views of
the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North before reaching a decision
about that. I hope she will give us the benefit of her thoughts and
those of her fellow Committee
members.</div><a name="08070372000192"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

Walley:</b> I have been tempted to intervene on the hon.
Gentleman, who is well versed in the work of the EAC. Select Committees
play an important role, and I should like him to comment on what the
Minister has said, because it put the work of Select Committees in a
wider context. The purpose of the EAC is to look at all Government
policies across the piece, but I am also aware that other Select
Committees have an interest in such matters and therefore consider that
there is much worth in the Government&#146;s

Barker:</b> That was a helpful intervention, and many people
who might have been worried by the wording of the amendments will take
comfort from it. The hon. Lady is known for her significant input into
the EAC and the valuable work that she and the Committee do. If she is
comfortable with the amendments, it makes me much more comfortable,
too. They are slightly complex, but not controversial, so I accept the
Minister&#146;s reassurances about
them.</div><a name="08070372000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000269"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not sure whether I am quite so reassured as
the hon. Gentleman, so I shall seek a little more
reassurance.</div><a name="08070372000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
group of amendments is slightly odd. It covers two different sections
of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 and new clause 3 relate to
impact and risk assessment, but only amendment No. 12 deals
specifically 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>with the adaptation sub-committee&#146;s remit to provide expert
advice and, as I understand it, that is being deleted and not
reinserted into the Bill under any other
clause.</div><a name="08070372000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
referring to adaptation, we are talking not about hypothetical targets
in decades to come that are conveniently distant from the current
political debate, but about the action that is required now. I take the
Minister&#146;s point that the adaptation sub-committee should not be
a policy-making body in the sense that it should take powers away from
Ministers or Parliament, but nothing in the clause suggests that. The
reference is to expert advice. That could be relevant to the flood risk
management budget and whether, in technical terms, the amount being
spent by the Government is sufficient to keep ahead of the impacts of
flood risk.</div>
<a name="08070372000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The committee
could cover health and whether the NHS has the right technical planning
in place to cope with new diseases that arise as a result of climate
change and that did not previously reach people in this country and
latitudes, or whether there is enough technical planning for heat waves
of the sort that hit the continent only a few years ago. It could
examine transport infrastructure and whether it can cope with not only
the right sort of snow, but the right flood water, the right heat and
the other possible impacts. They would be very technical
matters.</div><a name="08070372000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
such a report, the temptation for the relevant
Departments&#151;which, again, will not be the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but the Department for Transport,
the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department
of Health&#151;to be derailed into short-term political
considerations will be huge. Subsection (5), which amendment No. 12
would delete, is an important counterweight to that short-termism. It
will provide independent, expert advice based on scientific and
technical knowledge&#151;not policy, as the Minister
suggested&#151;and it is bizarre that the Government accept the need
for an adaptation sub-committee, yet run scared from seeking its
full-blooded
advice.</div><a name="08070372000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 20 would remove the provision in respect of the EAC. The EAC
considered the Bill and was quite happy to have the duty laid upon it,
so I do not see the logic for removing it. We can probably assume that
the EAC or its successor Committee would, almost automatically, want to
scrutinise such reports and measures, but proactively to take this
provision out of the Bill sends a rather strange signal that could be
misinterpreted.</div><a name="08070372000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000270"></a>Joan
Walley:</b> As a member of the EAC, does the hon. Gentleman
agree with me that, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, the Committee
has that role in any case by virtue of its status in
Parliament?</div><a name="08070372000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000271"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I accept what the hon. Lady says, but that is a
voluntary responsibility to be interpreted by the Committee. The
provision would be a more stringent condition that might, in the end,
have the same effect&#151;I accept that&#151;but I am more
concerned about the signal that its removal would send; it might be
interpreted wrongly as the Government&#146;s seeking to wriggle out
of the glare of proper scrutiny. I do not see the need for it to be
removed in that way.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000272"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The comments made by the hon. Members for Bexhill
and Battle and for Cheltenham show that there is a degree of confusion.
It is clear that the Government are certainly not trying to avoid
scrutiny, because we have tabled new clause 3 this morning, which
says:</div><a name="08070372000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the duty of the Committee on Climate Change to advise the Secretary
of State on the preparation of each of the Secretary of State&#146;s
reports under section
55.&#148;</div><a name="08070372000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, that relates to the impact assessment. So it is clear that we
are giving new duties to the Climate Change Committee&#151;along with
the work being done by the sub-committee&#151;which will report to
the Government in advance of their presenting their risk assessments.
It is clear we are giving the Committee that role to give specific
technical advice, which it is experienced in preparing, in advance of
the Government&#146;s producing their risk assessment
report.</div><a name="08070372000167"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000273"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> New clause 3 relates to impact and risk
assessment. Pages 25 and 26 of the Bill contain two separate clauses
with two logically separate areas of advice: clause 55 deals with
impact and risk assessment and clause 56 is on adaptation under the
Secretary of State&#146;s programme. The technical advice on impact
assessment is contained in clause 34(5), which would be deleted by
amendment No. 12 and is not reinserted by new clause 3 or any other
Government
amendment.</div><a name="08070372000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000274"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman needs to wait until we move to
the next group of amendments. The role that we are giving to the
Climate Change Committee is clear, from the advice stated in new clause
3, and I can add nothing to what I have said.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="08070372000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 20, again, the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that a signal could be
given. It is clear to us that saying that one Select Committee should
have the role weakens scrutiny. We have given the scrutiny role to the
Climate Change Committee, which will be advising on the risk
assessment. We are more than aware that the EAC makes its own decisions
and will continue to do so, as will other Select Committees. That is
the proper role of a Select Committee in
Parliament.</div><a name="08070372000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000275"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sorry to press the Minister on this matter,
but we are discussing new clause 3 now, in this group of amendments,
and nowhere does it mention
adaptation.</div><a name="08070372000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000276"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The risk assessment is clearly the precursor of
any programme for adaptation. The Climate Change Committee is being
given this duty to advise on the risk assessments that the Government
are
preparing.</div><a name="08070372000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000277"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sorry to press the Minister further, but
why, in that case, do we have separate clauses: one for impact and risk
assessment and another&#151;clause 56&#151;for adaptation? They are
not the
same.</div><a name="08070372000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070372000278"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am looking to see whether I may receive some
advice on this matter. Our amendments, including our new clause, are
clear to me. Clause 55 is in part 4, which is called &#147;Impact of
and adaptation to climate
change&#148;.</div><a name="08070372000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
