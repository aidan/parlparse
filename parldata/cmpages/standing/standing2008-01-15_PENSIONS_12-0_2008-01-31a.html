Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I beg to move amendment No. 99, in
clause 50, page 24, line 10, leave
out from &#145;State&#146; to &#145;and&#146; and insert
&#145;shall establish a money purchase
scheme&#146;.</div><a name="0802013000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure to be back here under your chairmanship, Mrs.
Anderson, with somewhat inclement weather conditions outside. I am sure
that our discussion will not be so inclement, and certainly not as
inclement as the weather in my constituency, where snow appears to be
falling heavily as we
speak.</div><a name="0802013000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0802013000432"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): Good for the
skiing.</div><a name="0802013000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000433"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Good for the skiing, as the hon. Gentleman has
said. I will get back to the
point.</div><a name="0802013000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendment is to allow the Minister to clarify why clause 50(1) is
currently drafted in such a permissive way. My amendment
inserts</div><a name="0802013000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall establish a
money purchase
scheme&#148;,</div><a name="0802013000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is what the
Government intend. There is no doubt about that, although if there is,
then the Minister will surprise us all when he responds. My question,
simply, is why should the Bill not say what we are establishing as the
personal accounts
scheme?</div><a name="0802013000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for some advice offered to me on this point. It has been suggested
that, in order for personal accounts to work, the phrasing that
the</div><a name="0802013000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Secretary
of State may establish a pension
scheme&#148;</div><a name="0802013000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">is a bit strange,
in that it seems to be permissive rather than mandatory, which the
Minister has acknowledged by nodding. The scheme concerned must be a
money purchase occupational pension scheme. Would it not be better to
say
so?</div><a name="0802013000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000434"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> To clear up any doubts, although I doubt whether
there are any doubts, we intend to use the power to create the personal
accounts scheme, which will be a defined contribution occupational
pension scheme. However, defined contribution occupational pension
schemes take a number of forms. Personal accounts will have various
unique features, particularly given the target audience, the way in
which they will be organised and the way in which we are setting them
up. We therefore took the view that rather than having the legislation
say that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>pension scheme was of a particular kind&#151;thereby risking someone
at some point deciding to take a judicial review as to whether our
decisions fitted exactly with a particular definition&#151;it was
better to take a broad power and to be very clear about how we intend
to use
it.</div><a name="0802013000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt that the understanding of the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is correct. That is what we intend, and
there has been no deviation from the Government&#146;s intentions. We
have set out the power in this way because we do not want to raise
legal risks at a later stage by trying to define the scheme narrowly.
Personal accounts will be similar, but not identical, to other DC
schemes. We should not pretend that it is a particular kind of pension
scheme in the legislation, because some might say, &#147;Well, the
way you are working does not exactly fit that definition&#148;. That
is the only reason why we have taken that view. With that
reassurance&#151;the hon. Gentleman is entirely right about our
intentions&#151;I hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000435"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the
Minister&#151;I almost promoted him to Secretary of State for a
second&#151;for his explanation. The clarification is exactly what I
was seeking. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="0802013000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000436"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in
clause 50, page 24, line 10, after
&#145;scheme&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;which shall
commence operation with effect from 1st April
2012&#146;.</div><a name="0802013000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, unlike some, has the attraction of being incredibly simple
and straightforward. All it does is to add to the beginning of clause
50 that the scheme should commence operations from April 2012. Since
that is the Government&#146;s stated policy objective, I imagine that
the Minister will be happy to accept the amendment. I shall sit down
now, if that is his
intention.</div><a name="0802013000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000437"></a>Mr.
O'Brien</b> <i class="I">indicated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000438"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> The Minister is shaking his head so I fear that
we have to argue the case a little
more.</div><a name="0802013000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000439"></a>Mr.
O'Brien</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="0802013000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000440"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> The Minister is shaking his head, so I fear that
we must argue the case a little
more.</div><a name="0802013000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
one point of view, the plan is already two years behind schedule. I
have dusted off my copy of the final report of the Pensions Commission,
chaired by Lord Turner. On page 400, it talks about an implementation
time scale for the various reforms and compares international
experience. In Sweden, for example, implementation of the new pension
system, the premium pension system or PPM, took six years from the
report of the working group&#151;presumably the Swedish equivalent of
Lord Turner and his colleagues&#151;to the first year of
contributions into the funded scheme. That included not only the
introduction of the new funded PPM but the re-casting of the state
pay-as-you-go system into an NDC system. The report
concludes:</div><a name="0802013000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
we are not recommending such radical changes to the core state system,
a more rapid implementation ought to be possible.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div><a name="0802013000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report then talks about New
Zealand, where, even more surprisingly, the report of a working group
was followed only nine months later by a budget commitment in
principle, with implementation planned for just two years after that.
It talks, however, about the possible slippage of that time scale,
which I think has been true. The report importantly concludes
that</div><a name="0802013000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Pensions
Commission believes that it is reasonable to plan on the assumption
that the NPSS could be in place and receiving first contributions by
2010.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NPSS was the
original proposal that was replaced by personal accounts. We are
already two years out from that
date.</div><a name="0802013000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Being a sad
person at heart, I was listening to Radio 4 between Christmas and new
year and caught a bit of the &#147;Money Box Live&#148; programme,
presented by the estimable Paul Lewis, a great expert who has followed
many of our debates closely. He was interviewing Tim Jones, the new
chief executive of PADA, who has given evidence to the Committee. He
pressed Tim Jones hard on the implementation date for personal
accounts. I managed to obtain a transcript of the interview. Paul Lewis
said:</div><a name="0802013000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
an awful lot to do, isn&#146;t
there?&#148;</div><a name="0802013000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pausing there, I
think we can all agree with that. He went
on:</div><a name="0802013000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This scheme
is scheduled to start in April 2012, just over four years way. Is that
a realistic target?&#148;</div><a name="0802013000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tim
Jones
replied:</div><a name="0802013000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
honest answer to that is I don&#146;t know
yet.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paul Lewis then
said:</div><a name="0802013000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So there
might be a delay?&#148;,</div><a name="0802013000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
which Tim Jones
replied:</div><a name="0802013000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Well,
it&#146;s not a delay because I don&#146;t know
yet.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then talked about
reviewing matters as the incoming
CEO:</div><a name="0802013000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
understand the desire for 2012 and so far I&#146;ve not seen anything
that says it&#146;s unachievable, but I need to do that review and
when I&#146;ve done that review I&#146;ll then be able to have a
conversation about what a proper date
is.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key part of the
interview was where Tim Jones
said:</div><a name="0802013000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Because
this is so hard what&#146;s critically important is not exactly when
it starts but that it starts well when it
starts.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the final
exchange, Paul Lewis
said:</div><a name="0802013000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So there
is a possibility that in a few months time you&#146;ll be going to
ministers and saying my view is we cannot start this when you&#146;ve
scheduled it&#151;April 2012. It will have to be another date in the
future?&#148;</div><a name="0802013000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">To which Tim
Jones
replied:</div><a name="0802013000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is that possibility,
yeah&#148;.</div><a name="0802013000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
then, Mr. Jones&#146; apparent concerns have to some
extent been dissipated. In the oral evidence sitting, I asked him about
the commencement date. He
said:</div><a name="0802013000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
policy intention is that the personal accounts scheme will launch in
2012, and it is my job, and the delivery authority&#146;s job, to
meet that intention. We have no evidence at this stage that that is
unachievable.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

Q11.]</div><a name="0802013000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, when I raised the
matter at Question Time only the week before, the Minister
said:</div><a name="0802013000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we intend
it to begin in 2012, and the chief executive has been informed that
that is what we intend.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000441"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> There was a bit more emphasis on certain
words.</div><a name="0802013000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000442"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> The Minister can read it out himself with the
proper emphasis. I do not know whether you have ever seen the film
&#147;Downfall&#148;, Mrs Anderson, about the last days of Hitler
in the bunker, but the situation is reminiscent of the phantom
divisions that were sent out to attack the Red Army and that were told
not to come back alive if they did not
win.</div><a name="0802013000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We still have a
contradiction here. Let me stress that the official Opposition want the
scheme to start on time. We want it up and running in 2012. Earlier
would be nice, but nobody who has met Mr. Jones could be
anything but persuaded by his massive competence and experience in
these matters and by the extent to which he and his chairman, Paul
Myners, appreciate the scale of the task they are facing. Nothing quite
like this has ever been tried before, which I recall is a line from the
movie &#147;A Bridge Too Far,&#148; but we will not go down that
route.</div><a name="0802013000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it is a
massive challenge. There is still a missing link between what the
Minister told Mr. Jones and what Mr. Jones told
Paul Lewis. Very honestly, like any successful man of business,
Mr. Jones has apparently initiated a review in his new job.
He has the office furniture, he has the chairman, he has one or two
non-execs, and things are gradually picking up, but he has reviewed the
state of play. I have the impression that that review is taking a
while, and it has certainly not been concluded yet. I would like the
Minister to tell us about his understanding of the situation, because
despite the slightly greater confidence that Mr. Jones
exuded when he came to this Committee compared with the confidence that
he exuded at the end of last month, he is clearly still in the
midst of
this review.</div><a name="0802013000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister will share with the Committee what he has been told about
how the review is going, including when it is likely to be concluded,
what the preliminary indications are, and whether he will publish the
advice he gets when Mr. Jones&#146;s review is finished.
The eyes of the world are on us and, in particular, Mr.
Jones. I have stressed our support for getting on with it in 2012, but
the only thing that is worse than not starting on time is having a
botched start, which is clearly something that concerns Mr.
Jones.</div><a name="0802013000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The brief from
the Equality and Human Rights Commission
states:</div><a name="0802013000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Like
the Conservatives, we are keen to see personal accounts ready to
commence in April 2012. We are extremely supportive of the new accounts
and the benefit that they offer to the target market. It is imperative
that the new scheme is in operation as soon as possible to allow people
the opportunity to save for their retirement in a way that is not
offered by the savings products currently on the
market.&#148;</div> <a name="0802013000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with every word of that. Indeed, the Minister&#146;s own
predecessor, now his new boss, made quite a good speech a little while
ago when he was in the pensions job, making the point about what we
might call the &#147;planning blight&#148; on people&#146;s
pension savings between now and 2012. There will be a significant
period between now and then when people will still not be saving for
their retirement. Such people will miss out on several years&#146;
contributions, the benefit of which they will never be able to make
up.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div><a name="0802013000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, the
guy in the saloon bar who finds pensions difficult and puzzling will
have another excuse for not doing anything at the moment, because he
has read that in 2012 it will all be sorted. I am very interested in
what the Minister has to say, particularly about Mr.
Jones&#146;s ongoing
review.</div><a name="0802013000060"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000443"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I, too, heard the comments on the &#147;Money
Box&#148; programme that the hon. Gentleman has read out. Being, no
doubt, as keen a listener as him&#151;I am sure that all members of
the Committee are regular listeners to that programme&#151;I was
perplexed and concerned by Mr. Jones&#146;s comments. In
due course, Mr. Jones corrected those comments. Perhaps he
did not do so as quickly as Admiral West, but it had happened when he
gave evidence to this
Committee.</div><a name="0802013000398"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div> <a name="0802013000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tim Jones is
someone with a huge amount of professional skill and is held in the
highest esteem and respect by those people he previously worked with,
and so the amendment being debated should not be seen in any way as
casting doubt on the competence of Mr. Jones and his team at
PADA. The question is, if there were doubts in his mind&#151;and he,
no doubt, has discussed these with the Minister, and the Minister has
reassured him, no doubt, about the deliverability of the
timetable&#151;then it is important that the Minister shares the
pressures that may exist in terms of meeting quite a tight
timescale.</div>
<a name="0802013000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, there are a number of steps that need to be completed
over that four-year period in order to ensure that the personal
accounts scheme can be up and running. The contracting process for the
administrative software and people to actually run the administration
of the account, because it is quite naturally subject to European Union
rules&#151;we return to those and, no doubt, will return to the
European Union again at some point&#151;about public procurement.
This is a process that&#151;I understand from the procurement side of
this&#151;will take at least 14 months, and possibly longer, before
that commissioning is completed. I guess, probably quite naturally,
that commissioning process cannot start until this Bill has become
law.</div> <a name="0802013000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is a
situation where, in an unknown period, this Bill will become
law&#151;I guess the Minister is hoping for May or June, when it has
completed its passage in both houses. There is a period of slightly
less than four years, in which that commissioning process has to be
undertaken successfully, the team to put it in place has to be
recruited and so on&#151;which will take a bit of time&#151;and
then there obviously has to be appropriate testing to ensure that the
system works perfectly before the start date of the scheme.</div>
<a name="0802013000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
clearly some significant practical hurdles and tight deadlines that
have to be kept to along the way to ensure the target date of 1 April
2012 is met. It seems to be me to be quite right that it should be met
but, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) has
quite rightly said, only one thing would be worse than missing the
deadline, and that would be a botched
launch.</div><a name="0802013000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
right that the Minister should have to reassure the Committee that he
is satisfied that there is sufficient time for all those practical
steps I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>described, and no doubt many other steps along the way to ensure the
successful launch of PADA, to be met in the timescale&#151;which will
be slightly less than four years by the time this Bill, if it does,
receives Royal Assent&#151;so that we can be sure that the deadline
the Government have quite rightly set for the launch of the scheme can
actually be
met.</div><a name="0802013000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000444"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> It is important to get personal accounts
right&#151;that includes to deliver it on time&#151;but a prudent
manager will recognise that events are something, as Harold Macmillan
mentioned, that are not always in the control of those who would wish
to have them under control. The policy intention is that the personal
accounts should be delivered in 2012, and nothing we are aware of at
this point would prevent that from happening. That has not changed. I
had not tied myself down to April of 2012, but it does seem to be a
reasonable date as a target to launch it on. But it may well be that
for other reasons there are other times of the year that might be more
appropriate. But as far as we are concerned, there is nothing we know
that would prevent a 2012 launch.</div>
<a name="0802013000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">So that is what we are aiming
at; that is what we expect to hit, and Tim Jones has been brought from
the private sector in order to ensure that we have a senior executive
who is able to deliver a project of this kind on time, on budget, and
to enable it to create the mechanisms to deliver personal accounts,
bearing in mind that PADA itself will not deliver personal accounts,
bearing in mind that PADA itself will not deliver personal accounts. I
can give that
reassurance.</div><a name="0802013000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tim Jones
has a background which has not involved having to weather the uncertain
waters of politics, or politicians&#146; ability to salami-slice
words&#151;or, indeed, journalists&#146; encouragement of what
appear to be innocuous comments which are then repeatedly referred to
in Parliament. I agree that Paul Lewis is an estimable journalist who
does indeed know how to do an interview and get a story, as he did on
this occasion. Tim Jones has, however, assured me that he knows of
nothing that would stop him from delivering in 2012, and he fully
intends to see that that happens. I hope I can reassure the hon.
Gentlemen on that point.</div>
<a name="0802013000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason I do not want the
amendment in the Bill is that we have not fixed on 1 April 2012 as a
precise date. That is a reasonable target date for the moment, but it
may be better, for all sorts of reasons, including presentation of
better dates, to move it a month or two one way or the other. We are
still targeting 2012. That is when we expect to deliver, but I do not
want to enshrine that in the Bill. Primary legislation is not the place
to set out precise dates for implementation of reforms. It is the place
to set out the principles of a reform and the approach to reform, and
it is only sensible to retain some flexibility in the start date. Who
knows what might happen over the next four years, or how the pensions
landscape may
change?</div><a name="0802013000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000445"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I just want to press the Minister on one point
to do with the timeline. While I can see his point about not being
ready at a particular date, I want to be reassured that he has looked
at the public procurement timelines that are involved in this process
and is satisfied, given all the legal restrictions on public
procurement contracts of this size, that the process can be completed,
implemented and tested in good time for a 2012
launch.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div><a name="0802013000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000446"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We know of nothing which would
prevent the public procurement timetables from being met within the
time scale we are seeking. We do have four years, and that gives us
enough time to go through delivery. I have seen how Government
procurement&#151;of computer systems and other things&#151;has not
in the past always been completed on time. That is also the case in the
private sector. I cannot provide a cast-iron guarantee that every
independent private company that has a contract is going to be able to
do its job perfectly, and therefore it is useful to retain some
flexibility.</div> <a name="0802013000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
same time, I do not expect them to fail to deliver on the contracts; if
we expected that, we would not be signing them up. We expect that those
who make arrangements to deliver personal accounts will be able to
deliver on their contracts. The time scales are not so tight that they
do not have some built-in flexibility, and we should therefore be in
good time to be able to deliver this
project.</div><a name="0802013000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000447"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am sorry to say that I am not at all reassured
by that answer. First of all, the suggestion that it could even be
December 2012, and not necessarily April. I agree with the Minister
that April is the logical time to start, because it chimes with the tax
and accounting years, and so on. Although Paul Lewis is a prince in his
profession, I take the Minister&#146;s point about journalists. I
think the Minister&#146;s point about Tim Jones&#146; comments to
Paul Lewis got it the wrong way round. It is because he is not a
politician that he does not have that natural guile to try to disguise
the reality. That is the point.</div>
<a name="0802013000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two things we do know
for sure, unless the Minister has something up his sleeve. One is that
between now and 2012 there will be an election and a new
Government&#151;hopefully a Conservative one&#151;and almost
certainly a new Minister in charge. Because we have our ambitions to
win that election, I take the Minister&#146;s point that a new
Minister would have the same concerns about putting a start date on the
face of the legislation. I have a sneaking suspicion that some poor
devil&#151;it could even be me&#151;arrives on day one after the
election as the Pensions Minister and very near the top of his in-tray
will be a report from PADA saying we cannot possibly do this by 2012
and these are the reasons.</div>
<a name="0802013000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it is
time we nailed this down because I have reached the age where I do not
like surprises. Let me offer a deal to the Minister. I am prepared not
to press this amendment to a Division if the Minister will agree to
share with us&#151;and we do have a legitimate interest as the
official Opposition&#151;the results of the review that
Mr. Jones is conducting. That seems fair. If he wants to
suggest doing it on Privy Council terms, I would not object. I do not
know what the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
thinks.</div><a name="0802013000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000448"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The suggestion made by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne is wholly sensible. If there is a review being undertaken it
should be shared with spokespeople for the opposition parties or on
whatever basis the Minister thinks is appropriate. This is a critical
issue and if there are problems to be identified by PADA I think we,
too, ought to know about
them.</div><a name="0802013000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000449"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful for that
intervention. It is simply a matter of good governance and of
consensus. If this consensus process is to have more than lip service 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>paid to it by Ministers, on something as important as this and something
as nuts and bolts as this&#151;there is no great politics in this
issue&#151;we all want to play our part in making sure that this
happens on time and properly. I am happy to give way to the Minister
but I will not press this to a Division if he is prepared to give us
that
undertaking.</div><a name="0802013000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000450"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> It is a matter for the hon. Gentleman whether he
presses this to a Division or not but as I understand it there is not
going to be a report to publish or share. What the hon. Member has
already done, I understand, is talk to Tim Jones. I would be very happy
for him to go and discuss these issues with Tim Jones and Paul Myners.
That invitation extends to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey. The hon. Members are able to discuss these
issues with the managers of PADA, on the basis that any commercially
confidential information will be kept confidential. I am not aware of
any final report or anything that I am able to share, so I am not in a
position to do so.</div>
<a name="0802013000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">What there
will be is an ongoing process of Tim Jones looking at delivery
projections, devising plans for delivery, ensuring that timescales are
met and, in due course, revising those timescales and plans to meet
managerial issues that normally arise in the development of a project
of this kind. Throughout that process, on the basis of consensus, I am
very happy that either hon. Member can engage with PADA. Indeed, I know
Tim Jones and Paul Myners would welcome that degree of interest from
our leading politicians who have shared the process of creating PADA
and personal accounts. I hope that provides sufficient reassurance. I
fear I cannot go further than that. I hope he can withdraw his
amendment but that is a matter for
him.</div><a name="0802013000399"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="0802013000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000451"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am not sure that takes me a lot further. Let
me explain why. Yes, we have already had some discussions with Tim
Jones and Paul Myners and have every intention, as do they, of
continuing those discussions. It is sensible from both their points of
view, as well as ours, that in a massive undertaking like this, which
in anyone&#146;s view is going to straddle another general election,
the Government and the official Opposition should both be in the loop
about what is going on. I was not suggesting that Mr. Jones
is going to produce a report of the sort that might be put in the
Library of the House of Commons.</div>
<a name="0802013000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, unless he is doing the
review on the back of a fag packet, I assume that he is going to
produce some internal conclusions and I assume that he is going to
share them with Minister, perhaps just in the form of a two page
letter. Even a one-paragraph letter that says, &#147;Not on your life
mate, there is no way we can deliver this by 2012, you&#146;ll be
lucky to get it by 2015&#148;, would be worrying enough. All I am
saying is that the Minister should share that with us as part of the
consensus process. Unless the minister can give us that undertaking, I
will seek to press this to a division. I do not know if that finds
favour with the Liberals as well, but that is my intention. Clearly
nobody has a review without coming up with some conclusions, and the
results of the review ought to be shared with us. We ought to know
anything that the Minister knows.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div><a name="0802013000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000452"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am not unhappy that the hon. Member for
Eastbourne should know broadly what is going on. I cannot understand
quite why he thinks that he is not going to be told the conclusions by
Tim Jones. We have ongoing project management. There will be things on
paper that Tim Jones works to and there will be plans and proposals
that he will have negotiated with the board. I do not know of any
reason why he should not share those with the hon. Gentleman. The best
approach would be for him to go and talk to Tim Jones about how best he
would want to do that. I am not prepared to take it any further than
that. There is no wish on our part to be other than appropriately
commercially confidential. I have no great problem with sharing basic
commercial issues with either the hon. Member for Eastbourne or the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey providing
that they are kept confidential. I have made that clear and I think
that that should be enough. It is a matter for him whether he wishes to
press it to a vote.</div>
<a name="0802013000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000453"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I do not want to labour the point&#151;there
may be a feeling that I already have&#151;but I have one final
thought. I entirely take the point about commercially sensitive
information; there is no way that I want or need to have access to that
stuff, nor I suspect does the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey. If the result of the review is a conclusion by
Tim Jones, whose judgment and experience I totally respect, that this
cannot be delivered on time, I want to know almost as soon as the
Minister knows. That is what it boils down to and that is probably why
we will have a division on the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000411"></a><a name="0802013000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Mr. Waterson:</b>
I beg to move amendment No. 157, in
clause 50, page 24, line 13, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) A scheme

hope this will not be as controversial an amendment, but it may take a
while to explain it and in the course of explaining it, even I may
begin to understand some of the finer points behind it. It is a bit
tech-y, but here goes.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div><a name="0802013000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take absolutely no credit for
this, it is entirely sponsored and put forward by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, a body this Committee
should hesitate to argue with on these matters. Amendment 157 seeks to
set out exactly what kind of independent scrutiny the Government
intends to have for the personal accounts scheme. We can all agree
there has to be independent scrutiny and the non-accountants among us
might assume that should just mean an annual audit of the traditional
kind, which will ensure that the millions of new members in the scheme
get their proper entitlement, that the contributions are correctly
accounted for and broadly that the administration and financial probity
of the whole thing is as it should be. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants tells me it
is</div><a name="0802013000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very concerned that a
national scheme such as the personal accounts scheme cannot be audited
within the rules applying to occupational pension
schemes&#148;</div><a name="0802013000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the
scheme should instead be required to have what it
calls</div><a name="0802013000102"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a controls-based

review.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
no-one intervenes to ask me what that is, but I hope I will be able to
give a clue later on. I understand there has been some contact with
officials on the technical aspects.</div>
<a name="0802013000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000465"></a>Mr.
O'Brien</b> <i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div>
<a name="0802013000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000466"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> The Minister nods, so it may be that he could
put me out of my misery now by popping up to say that he accepts the
amendment. Let me just explain for the benefit of the Committee and
those outside what is behind
this.</div><a name="0802013000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand
it, if we do not have something like amendment 157 the assumption will
be that the audit requirements of existing pensions legislation will
apply to the personal accounts system. It is not a subject that has
been keeping me awake at night, but on the face of it, that appears
sensible; apparently it is not. It is partly because personal accounts
will be such a different animal from traditional pension schemes, not
only because of the order of magnitude but for all sorts of other
reasons.</div><a name="0802013000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000467"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> It might assist the hon. Gentleman to know that
we are still looking at the proposals we have had from the institute.
We want to ensure that the method of dealing with the accounts is the
best that can be achieved. It is true that this scheme will be of a
different scale and type from other schemes and therefore we need to
look at the particular scheme. We do not need primary legislation to
disapply the provisions of the Pensions Act 1995, we can amend these as
necessary either by regulations under section 41 of that Act or under
clause 106 of this Bill. I understand his point and we are still
considering this, but we wish to look at what is a complex issue in
more detail before taking a final decision on
it.</div><a name="0802013000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000468"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful for that
indication and although I will go into a bit more detail, I will go
into considerably less detail than I might otherwise have done. There
will be people out there who will be totally tantalised until the end
of time as to what I was coming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>to say. Although the Minister&#146;s intervention was partially
helpful, and I accept&#151;I think the institute accepts&#151;that
it is perfectly possible to deal with this point by regulation, the
institute wants a clear idea of where the Minister is going on this. I
share that
concern.</div><a name="0802013000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will touch upon the main points of concern to the Institute. In a
traditional audit of possibly one million employers&#151;of which
many thousands will be small employers&#151;often with very mixed and
different record-keeping systems and so forth, all the contribution
records of all those employers would need to be checked so that an
auditor could give an opinion. This is vastly time consuming and vastly
expensive. The ICAEW says it is firmly of the view that it would be
impractical and that the enormous cost would be of little benefit to
the members who would have to bear it. The basic point it is making is
that there is a confusion between an audit and an overall check on all
internal systems and controls. What would be meaningful for savers and
personal accounts would be to call for a third party to check that the
administration is conducted properly. It calls this assurance
engagement, which looks at all the internal controls&#151;operational
as well as financial.</div>
<a name="0802013000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
precedent apparently. According to the institute, following the
introduction of internal controls requirements under the 2004
Act&#151;who could forget it?&#151;a number of institutions that
work for pensions schemes, trustees in managing scheme administration,
scheme investments and custody have adopted this controls-based
approach. It says that it would be cost-effective, and will provide the
appropriate comfort to job holders and savers. I think the institute
has a very good point. Moreover, having a provision whereby this is
reported to Parliament, perhaps annually, also makes a lot of
sense.</div><a name="0802013000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
Minister&#146;s point that this could, and perhaps should, be dealt
with by regulation. But the institute could not be clearer in its own
conclusions and who am I&#151;or indeed, who is the
Minister?&#151;to argue with that expert view? I therefore press the
Minister to perhaps be a little less coy about telling us and, in
particular, the institute where his thinking is going on this and how
he intends to deal with it.</div>
<a name="0802013000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000469"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Clause 50 enables the Secretary of State to
establish the fact that this scheme is a trust which, like all
trust-based schemes, will be run in the interest of its members. The
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has raised this
particular issue with my officials; I am grateful to them for the help
that they have given.</div>
<a name="0802013000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to change the way in which the Pensions Act 1995 applies to the
personal accounts scheme. It is based on the premise that the
requirement for an auditor&#146;s statement about contributions would
be costly and difficult to compile due to the sheer numbers of
employers participating in the scheme. We acknowledge that this is
complicated by the fact that the employers in the scheme are likely to
be small employers who may not necessarily employ an accountant. An
auditor may not be satisfied that contributions have been paid properly
and would therefore only be able to compile qualified accounts, which
would not be of much benefit to the members.</div>
<a name="0802013000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle of proper
accounting is paramount and all equivalent schemes should be subject to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>same, or effectively the same, level of scrutiny and transparency. That
is an important point. As part of having confidence in personal
accounts we need to ensure that we do not have a situation where either
the accounts are unduly qualified or, alternatively, a system of
accounts which raises questions about personal accounts.</div>
<a name="0802013000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute has a point in
terms of its view, but as yet, we are not necessarily convinced that
its approach is one that we can sign up to wholeheartedly. There may
well be other options that we wish to examine before reaching a final
conclusion. I have been assured that officials are looking at this
issue with care. They have not yet reached a final conclusion, but it
is safe to say that they have considerable sympathy with the concerns
of the ICAEW and they are to let me have advice in due course about
whether the approach favoured by the ICAEW, or an alternative approach
for dealing with the problem they have identified, would be the best
way forward. We could then deal with that through regulations. I hope
that with that reassurance the hon. Member will be able to withdraw his

Waterson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for reassuring me.
He has put my mind&#151;and, I hope, the institute&#146;s&#151;at
rest to the extent that this is being looked at very carefully. There
is considerable sympathy for the proposal, but also an underlying
acceptance that we cannot just work on the basis of the existing audit
requirements and that there has to be a solution. This is one of
perhaps two possibilities. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Waterson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in
clause 51, page 25, line 15, leave
out subsection
(5).</div><a name="0802013000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a rather
simple probing amendment. It is not entirely clear why such a scheme
order should exclude liability for a trustee, officer or employee of
the trust arising from administration or management, or provide an
indemnity for such liability. It might be merely that there is a
precedent and that is what happens already. However, there will,
potentially, be significant liabilities for trustees, officers and
employees in running the scheme, so one wonders why they should be
excluded from liability. If they are not liable, who is?</div>
<a name="0802013000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting it another way, and
looking at the analogy of non-executive directors, is there a prospect
of insurance being obtained against that liability? If there is a
liability, that presumably means that somebody, somewhere&#151;the
members, I guess&#151;have lost out. If they cannot look to the
trustees, officers or employees, who would they look to? That is a very
long question to the Minister, which I am sure that he will answer in
his inimitable fashion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000472"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I will not detain the
Committee long, but this is an interesting issue, and I will be
interested in the Minister&#146;s response to the questions that the
hon. Member for Eastbourne has rightly posed. The deregulatory review
of private pensions also looked at this issue and said:</div>
<a name="0802013000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that as a quid pro quo for the increased visibility and
controversy surrounding trustee duties, all pension scheme trustees
should be covered, at employer or scheme expense, by appropriate
indemnity insurance or assurances from the employer and/or scheme, that
would at least cover the cost of litigation so long as the trustee is
not found to have acted
improperly.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that subsection (5) was, essentially, trying to follow the
advice that there should be some degree of indemnity. While some
protections already exist for trustees who have acted in good faith,
there is unease as to whether the law would continue to be interpreted
as it is at the moment. There seem to be good reasons for ensuring that
trustees have that degree of protection to allow them to carry out the
important role that the Bill allocates to them. When drafting the Bill,
did the Minister read what the independent reviewers said in the
deregulatory
review?</div><a name="0802013000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000473"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I agree with the hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey that there has been
concern that trustees should not be the subject of undue liability in
respect of their actions. They will retain an obligation to fulfil
their fiduciary duties. However, it is anticipated that there will be
an indemnity to cover them in respect of any decisions that they make
that are other than flagrant and deliberate breaches. They will be
fully liable for any flagrant or deliberate breach of their duty, but
they should not be liable for having made decisions with which others
merely do not agree. There could be all sorts of legal challenges to
such decisions, and the trustees might end up having to defend
themselves
individually.</div><a name="0802013000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right that indemnities should cover the trustees for the costs of
any such actions. PADA or, in due course, the Personal Accounts Board,
should be able to pay any legal costs that the trustees incur, should
they be challenged on the basis of any decisions that they have made
after due consideration. As the hon. Gentleman says, the board will
have a high profile and a lot of people will be interested in its
decisions on investment and other matters. We do not want trustees
dragged into court unnecessarily, and if there are court cases, it is
right that an indemnity should cover them. Trustees are indemnified in
many existing private pension schemes. There are exclusions to their
liabilities. We will be broadly following such a precedent, which does
not apply to all schemes, but does to a lot of
them.</div><a name="0802013000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is fairly straightforward and standard for trustees to have
indemnities. We want to ensure that we attract high-quality trustees
who are not going to feel that they will end up having to pay a lot of
money in court fees because someone has challenged a decision that they
made properly. That is the basis for the provision. I appreciate that
the amendment is probing and I hope that I have addressed the concerns
of the hon.
Gentlemen.</div><a name="0802013000127"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000477"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Amendment No. 154 is lengthy and the purpose
behind it might take a little time to
explain.</div><a name="0802013000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
naturally and rightly contains provisions in clause 52 for the
consultation of scheme members and employers, and the establishment of
a members&#146; panel and an employers&#146; panel. I am grateful
for advice and suggestions from Age Concern about the amendment, which
tries to set out in more detail what the role of the members&#146;
panel should be, how it should work and, particularly, the fact that it
should be properly
resourced.</div><a name="0802013000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
members&#146; panel will have a big role in ensuring that the scheme
acts in the best interests of members. It is thus essential that the
members&#146; panel is given both appropriate powers and sufficient
resources to carry out its responsibilities and meet its obligations
effectively. Giving the panel the power to make formal representations
and the right to a formal reply would mean that it could quite simply
not be ignored. The Minister might say that the panel would not be
ignored in practice, but the amendment would ensure that it could not
be
ignored.</div><a name="0802013000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
good approach to consultation, in which many hon. Members will have
been involved in their constituencies or elsewhere, will encourage the
sponsoring body to seek the panel&#146;s views at an early stage.
Certainly, the principles of good community consultation would suggest
not getting to the end of one&#146;s deliberations and reaching
conclusions, and only then asking people what they think. A proper
consultation engages with those who have a right to be consulted along
the way, thus leading to better policy making. That reduces, but cannot
totally eliminate, the likelihood of serious disagreements emerging
late in the process. Such an approach would also demonstrate to members
and potential members that the panel was independent of
trustees.</div><a name="0802013000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would empower the panel to carry out research, and that would ensure
that there was a good evidence base for its advice. Employers and the
financial services industry, which quite properly takes a great
interest in the development of personal accounts, as members of the
Committee will be all too aware, are likely to have access to
considerably greater expertise and financial resources than members and
potential members. A statutory right to carry out research would ensure
that funding was available to redress the balance and to plug the
knowledge gap from a perspective that had scheme members&#146;
interests at heart. Without such a statutory right, any research
funding would be available only at the discretion of trustees. The
right would also ensure that the panel was able to research the views
of members and potential members so that it could represent their views
fairly, although I am sure that the Minister would envisage that
anyway. PADA is already doing some research among potential members and
is seeking public opinion to try to understand how people view the
scheme.</div><a name="0802013000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Meaningful
participation in processes that are designed to make policy often
requires detailed work to analyse the possible impact of future
developments. I am told 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>that the experience of existing panels is that the work requires
individuals with both a strong personal commitment and the time to
devote to understanding issues that are often highly technical. That is
why it should be possible, when necessary, for trustees to pay panel
members more than just expenses. If a substantial time commitment or
effort is required for a particular piece of work, it needs to be made
clear that panel members can be paid so that they are enabled to
participate fully. Without that, there will be a risk that the panel
will either attract only those who can afford to take time off, or that
its advice will be rushed or ill-thought, neither of which would be the
Minister&#146;s intention when seeking to establish a members&#146;
panel.</div><a name="0802013000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
there is an argument that membership of the panel should not
necessarily be restricted to people who are current members of the
scheme because it should also be able to take account of the needs of
future members, who are specifically referred to in the principles of
PADA, which will be debated under clause 62. Such a measure would be
unduly restrictive, such as if a panel member had retired and was no
longer a member of the personal accounts scheme. The panel will also
benefit from the involvement of people with particular knowledge and
skills who might not be attracted from within the membership base.
Research by the National Consumer Council found that people sometimes
simply wanted to be confident that their interests are being fully
represented by
others.</div><a name="0802013000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would also provide for the right to reappoint members. That right,
within the context of an overall maximum term of appointment, would
avoid any suggestion that an individual could be leaned on. Such a
practice is followed in other
bodies.</div><a name="0802013000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is detailed because it relates to an important aspect of how the system
works. It seeks to reflect the Government&#146;s intention properly.
I hope that it will give the Minister the opportunity to put on record
that he has detailed intentions in many of the areas to which the
amendment refers. Those areas include how the system will work, how
panel members could be appointed, how their work could be resourced,
and how the contribution of panel members could be properly paid for so
that we were able to attract the broadest range of people as
members.</div><a name="0802013000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other issues
are the fact that the panel&#146;s terms of reference and the way in
which it is constructed should not deter people who might not have the
resources or personal means to take lengthy periods of time off work,
and that outside experts who might not necessarily be members of the
scheme could also be involved in the panel when appropriate so that it
could act as broadly and independently as possible in the interests of
members and with full consultation with the trustees from the
beginning.</div><a name="0802013000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">An area to
which we will no doubt return is the fact that while the Bill sets out
clear principles for PADA, it does not set down principles for the
Personal Accounts Board to follow, when it inherits the scheme and
takes it over. The members&#146; panel will have a critical role in
ensuring that members&#146; interests continue to be at the heart of
what we expect to be a scheme that will last for a long
time.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="0802013000478"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey for probably taking less time to
introduce his amendment than it would have taken to read it
out.</div><a name="0802013000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 154
is very detailed. It is a tad prescriptive, so we probably would not
join him in voting for it, if he pressed it to a Division, although I
got the impression that he was just trying to draw out a comment from
the Minister on its contents. The amendment has Age Concern&#146;s
seal of approval, which is very
important.</div><a name="0802013000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right that the role of the members&#146; panel is
important now, as it will be in the future. He is right to say how
important it will be when PADA changes to become the board. He is also
right that there is no point in setting up a members&#146; panel if
it is going to be ignored and not listened to&#151;if it is just to
look good. He has not tabled a similarly detailed amendment about the
employers&#146; panel, which is a pity, in a way. Perhaps he takes
the view that employers can look after themselves on these matters and
have sharp enough elbows to ensure that they get their point
across.</div><a name="0802013000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to speak
fairly briefly to my two amendments in the group&#151;amendments Nos.
27 and 64. The purpose of amendment no. 27 is really to probe the
Minister. It would leave subsection (3) as stating that the composition
and functions of the two panels would be determined by the trustees
under an order. I do not see why we should have an alternative in there
for the Secretary of State to make an order, which is how I read the
measure. If independent trustees are being set up, they should be in
charge. The Minister is looking puzzled&#151;that must mean that
either I have it horribly wrong, or he has suddenly realised that there
is a gaping flaw in the Bill.</div>
<a name="0802013000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000479"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> There is not a gaping flaw in our Bill. I was not
entirely clear about the order. Under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment, the composition functions of the panel would be determined
by the trustees under an order, but who would make the order? How would
the trustees make an order? Such an order would usually mean a
parliamentary order, so they would not be able to do that. Presumably,
the amendment should refer to some sort of rules set by the
trustees.</div>
<a name="0802013000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000480"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> This is the Minister&#146;s Bill, not mine. I
have not drafted it. It suggests that there are two ways to
go:</div><a name="0802013000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by order under
section 50&#148;,</div><a name="0802013000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">which would
be made in the traditional fashion by the Secretary of
State&#151;</div><a name="0802013000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000481"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Let me clarify the situation. Our position is
that the composition and functions of the panel can be determined
either by an order under clause 50, or by the trustees acting under an
order under clause 50 so that they may make the detailed rules. Either
way, there will be an order under clause 50. Clause 50 would be applied
in either case. Under the amendment, there would be no clear
order-making power.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div><a name="0802013000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000482"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying
that, but he has not dealt with my central point: why not just leave it
to the trustees? However, I am glad that we have sorted that out
because it was ruining my day. Why should the Secretary of State be
involved in this at all? Surely, the ideal situation is to set up the
trustees&#151;good, competent people at arm&#146;s
length&#151;who can make these decisions, rather than being
interfered with by the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="0802013000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that the amendment would make an even bigger nonsense of subsection
(3), but if the Minister accepts my basic premise, he can go away and
use all the resources of the Department to draft an amendment that is
going to work. I do not understand why Ministers should be involved in
this at all. That deals satisfactorily, or otherwise, with amendment
No. 27.</div> <a name="0802013000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
64 concerns the functions of the members&#146; panel under subsection
(4). It is conceptually very important that the members&#146; and
employers&#146; panels are seen as equally important with regard to
advice and the role that they have in developing personal accounts. As
I said, one of my objections to the very long amendment tabled by the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey was that it
covered the members&#146; panel but did nothing for the
employers&#146; panel.</div>
<a name="0802013000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4) says that one of
the functions of the members&#146; panel&#151;it does not mention
the employers&#146; panel&#151;is to nominate individuals to be
members of the trustee corporation. This is slightly academic because
presumably anybody could nominate people to be members of the trustee
corporation, just as it sometimes seems that anyone can nominate
themselves or a relative for an honour.</div>
<a name="0802013000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to have a
members&#146; panel, and to take it seriously and listen to it, and
if we are to have an employers&#146; panel, and to take it seriously
and listen to it, they should have equal status wherever possible. I
cannot think of a good reason why the Minister should not accept that
amendment, which I commend to
him.</div><a name="0802013000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0802013000483"></a><b class="B">Nick
Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab): I
want to speak briefly about how members of the members&#146; panel
are to be selected. I have been briefed by UNITE, which is not the
organisation comprising the Transport and General Workers Union and
Amicus. This UNITE got its name a lot earlier. It represents BT and
Post Office pensioners and has existed for several of decades. It is in
negotiations with Unite, the trade union, about the name.</div>
<a name="0802013000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the
Minister is aware of UNITE&#146;s submission. It makes the very good
point that it is extremely successful in maintaining contact with
members of both those large pension funds and keeping them well
informed of developments. It suggests that there must be some form of
election. That is the way in which it has worked for a long
time&#151;it was set up in the 1920s as a pensioners&#146;
organisation for the Post Office.</div>
<a name="0802013000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be interested to hear
how my hon. and learned Friend the Minister thinks that members of this
members&#146; panel will be chosen. Will that occur through election
or by nomination? If so, who will nominate these people? What is the
direct connection with the members of the scheme? How will those who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>are contributing to the scheme be kept informed of developments? I
recommend that he and his officials read the UNITE briefing, if he has
not already seen
it</div><a name="0802013000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000484"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Clause 52 deals with consultation with members
and employers. The Government believe that engagement with all
participants in the scheme is vital for success. We have designed the
Bill so that the scheme order must require the trustee to make and
maintain arrangements for ongoing consultation. We need an order to
oblige or enable trustees to do things.
</div><a name="0802013000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
scheme will have a very large and diverse membership with many
thousands of participating employers. It is vital that there are good
channels of communication between them and the trustee to give and
receive feedback, thus create a feeling of ownership among members. We
consider the establishment of members&#146; and employers&#146;
panels to be absolutely fundamental to the process, although that is by
no means the only way that the trustee would communicate with members
and employers.</div> <a name="0802013000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
authority will consider how these panels should operate, including by
looking at similar existing arrangements, such as those for the
Financial Services Authority consumer and practitioner panels.
Recommendations will be made on the constitution and remit of these
panels, taking account of current best practice.</div>
<a name="0802013000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to the point about
election made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and
South Pembrokeshire is that I do not yet know what recommendations are
going to come forward from PADA. Election is obviously one of the ways,
and nomination is another, but questions then arise of how to go
through the nomination process, which organisations will have the right
to nominate, and how we use the process of getting to literally
millions of members to enable some sort of election to take
place.</div><a name="0802013000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have
final answers for my hon. Friend, except that the submission that he
identifies is certainly one way forward of which we will take account.
Also, we will want to look at other ways in which very large
organisations are able to maintain the engagement and participation of
their members. This will be a difficult process, which is why I am
unable to be specific about exactly how this will be done. We have time
to work this out, but we need to give him and others the reassurance
that we see the process of setting up both these panels as absolutely
fundamental. They should be set up in a way that commands
confidence.</div><a name="0802013000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of amendment No.115 is that while the composition and
functions of the employers&#146; panel would be in the scheme order,
the members&#146; panel would be given the freedom to decide its own
functions. Amendment No. 27 would provide that the scheme order would
require the trustee corporation to establish members&#146; and
employers&#146; panels, but could not include anything about their
composition or functions, because the intention would be that the
trustee would make those
decisions.</div><a name="0802013000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
striking a balance between legislative requirements and independence
for the trustee, we need to keep in mind the scale of the scheme.
Millions of members will be drawn from thousands of employers. Some
will have a few members, while others will have hundreds or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>thousands of members. It is likely that many of those members will not
have saved in a pension before. That will make the arrangements for
engaging and involving members all the more important&#151;and
indeed, all the more
complex.</div><a name="0802013000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">This unique
aspect of the scheme&#151;and the importance of members feeling
ownership of the scheme, if we are to the deliver our
ambitions&#151;means that Parliament and the Government have a
legitimate interest in ensuring that there is a broad approach to
employer and member engagement. I think that we have an interest in
this. We want to know that that it is being done and how it is being
done. We want to be satisfied that it will be done properly and
adequately. That is why the Bill provides for an order under the clause
to set the broad composition and functions of a
panel.</div><a name="0802013000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure hon.
Members that it is not our intention that that would determine all the
practical detail of how the panel operates. The panel members will be
able to make arrangements with the trustee about how they can best
represent members, and the methods of consultation and dialogue with
the trustee. Therefore, while the order will set the functions of the
panels, the panel members will have a significant say in how those
functions are
discharged.</div><a name="0802013000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 101 would provide that all members&#151;or an organisation
representing them&#151;would have to be involved in the process of
setting up the members&#146; panel. Amendment No. 154 goes into quite
some detail on the constitution and function of the members&#146;
panel and how it interacts with the trustee. It is, of course,
essential that the members&#146; panel is designed to be as
representative as reasonably possible. It is also important, however,
that, given the unique scale and diversity of the potential membership
of the personal accounts scheme, we do not constrain the options
available for the authority at this early
stage.</div><a name="0802013000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not for me
to anticipate the panels&#146; work or advice. However, I would not,
for example, necessarily want to restrict the scope of a panel to
members of the scheme only at this stage. It might be desirable for a
scheme of this scale to include room on the panel for national
organisations, such as Help the Aged and Age Concern, or those with
experience in promoting legal or consumer rights. We need to look at
how this ought to operate, rather than trying to form a complete
judgment at this
stage.</div><a name="0802013000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="0802013000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not underestimate the challenge of ensuring that all members have a
say in the nomination and selection of the members&#146; panel, for
reasons I have already given. That is not to say I disagree in any way
with the principle suggested by hon. Members opposite. In fact, I
broadly agree. However, I want to ensure that we give the authority
sufficient flexibility to consider innovative solutions to what can be
a very difficult challenge.</div>
<a name="0802013000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe we should create primary legislation which, however well
intentioned, will so restrict the options they can put to us that we
will not be able to make amendments to it except via further primary
legislation, even if we all agree that those amendments should be made.
If we are to look at the detail of this, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>would be better to do so either in regulations, which are more easily
amended as times change, or by a broad-based order followed by
decisions made by the trustees and, in due course, by others, including
perhaps the members&#146;
panels.</div><a name="0802013000176"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000485"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I understand what the Minister says about the
need for flexibility in designing this, and I was encouraged by what he
said at the beginning of his remarks about following best practice. In
the interests of brevity, can I ask him whether the ideas contained in
subsections (3F) and (3G) of the amendment&#151;which relate to the
way in which the representations made by the panel have to be listened
to, and the advice and research functions of the panel&#151;do in
fact follow best practice, particularly relating to the financial
services consumer panel? Are they are the sorts of things that he would
like to see the panel carry out in relation to personal accounts under
the
Bill?</div><a name="0802013000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000486"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Members of the trust board would want to have
regard to the views of the panel. We would not want them necessarily to
be bound in this sense. The trustees are going to have to make
decisions. That is what they are there for. When they make decisions,
they will no doubt listen to the views of the panel and the members. I
suspect that if they went very strongly against either, they would have
to have very good reasons for doing so.</div>
<a name="0802013000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
are creating a trust-based pension scheme here, in which the trustees
have to make decisions. We can say, &#147;Look, we are creating for
you a larger scheme than anything that exists at the moment anywhere
else in the country, and you probably have greater responsibilities
than any other trustees&#148;. One of those obligations is to have
regard to the views expressed by the panels. I do not, however, think
that we should change the decision-making capacity of trustees so
fundamentally that we effectively create a new type of body that has to
do what members&#146; panels say.</div>
<a name="0802013000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The members&#146; panels are a
way of getting soundings. They are not a way to make final decisions.
That responsibility must lie where the legal responsibility lies, and
that is with the trustees. That is the way other pension schemes work.
That is where trust comes from. A genuine sense of responsibility
should lie on the trustees&#146;
shoulders.</div><a name="0802013000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 64 would give the employers&#146; panel a similar function to the
members&#146; panel to nominate members of the trustee corporation.
The role of the employers&#146; panel is important. It will be
charged with providing advice on matters relating to the scheme as they
affect employers. It will be the main channel for consultation between
the trustee and the employers. The requirement to have member-nominated
trustees stems from the desire to ensure that the scheme is run
primarily for the benefit of members. It is the scheme members who
ultimately benefit from the introduction of the scheme, especially
those people for whom no pension is available at the moment. That is
why the Bill ensures that members will be able to nominate trustees,
and this is in line with the current legislative requirements. Trusts
are there for the benefit of members, not employers. They are
beneficial organisations and the beneficial owners are the members. The
trustees hold the organisation and its assets in trust for the
beneficial owners. That is the way the system works.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div><a name="0802013000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
individuals who form the corporate trustee will have the sole
obligation to act in the members&#146; best interests, rather than
representing employers or any other particular interest group. It will
not be possible for the trustee to meet its duty of acting in the
members&#146; best interests without taking account of
employers&#146; concerns, but it is not appropriate to appoint
members of the trustee with this as a specific role or indeed in any
sort of representative capacity for the employers. Employers should not
be represented on that board, because the trustees are all there to
represent the members.</div>
<a name="0802013000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to say
a brief word about the effects of amendment No. 27. The amendment as
written provides that the trustees will determine the composition and
function of the panels under an order. However, the trustees cannot
make an order, this being the prerogative of Government. So they would
have to set the detail out in some administrative document that would
not necessarily be open to any debate, let alone a debate in
Parliament. The trustees would later amend the rules to include this
detail, but the panels must be established first because the trustees
cannot make any rule changes without first consulting the panels. The
consequence of this amendment, therefore, would be to delay setting up
the panels and remove the public or parliamentary debate about their
constitution and functions. I am sure that is not the intention of it,
but that would be the consequence, so I just lay that out as a
warning.</div><a name="0802013000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
amendments Nos. 154 and 155, I note the reference to payments being
made to the chair and members of the members&#146; panel and the
points being made about appropriate recompense for those who are acting
in that capacity. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I
was looking to introduce an amendment to subsection (5) of this clause
to make it clearer that all members of both employers&#146; and
members&#146; panels could receive such payment for their time spent
on panel duties and reimbursement of any necessary expenses.</div>
<a name="0802013000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">As PADA will
be advising on the constitution and functions of these panels, it would
also consider and advise on what payments may be appropriate in order
to secure the services of the most suitable people to be panel members.
So I do want to flag up that, on this particular issue that the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is raising, I do
propose to table an amendment that will address at least one of the
points that he made in his intervention. I hope with those reassurances
and some of the concerns about the detail of these particular
amendments the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000487"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> On the last point that the
Minister made about the payments to panel members, I am reassured by
what he said. What he is proposing&#151;to bring forward another
amendment to widen the scope slightly&#151;will have a beneficial
effect, particularly on the range of people who will feel able to take
on the duties of involvement in a members&#146; panel. I do
understand what he is saying about the need to think through the scope
and range of the panel, and that is what he is asking PADA to do. That
will be brought forward in
regulations.</div><a name="0802013000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
wish to stress again the importance of the point about research. The
Minister has not addressed in his response the question of resources
for the panels. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>Clearly, a practical arrangement must be reached. The advantage to
having at least some reference to this on the face of the Bill, or a
clear undertaking from the Minister that it will be included in
regulations, is that it is important for the members&#146; panel
especially&#151;there is a difference, as the Minister accurately
described, between the employers&#146; panel and the members&#146;
panel&#151;that it is able to commission and carry out research
independently where it deems that to be
necessary.</div><a name="0802013000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000488"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Just to give the hon. Gentleman
some reassurance, I take his point in relation to proper resourcing. It
will be noted by those on PADA, who look at the detail of this, that we
regard both the members&#146; and employers&#146; panels as vital.
They will therefore need to be appropriately and properly resourced. He
also makes a valid and interesting point about research, which I will
consider further. I cannot give him any further reassurance on that,
but I am sure that those on PADA who will be listening to these debates
will be aware that there may well be a requirement that the
members&#146; and employers&#146; panels should be properly
informed. I am conscious, however&#151;I am conscious, too, of the
length of this intervention&#151;that there are cost implications
which need to be properly factored into it. Rather than trying to deal
with that now, we should let PADA do it in due course and
advise.</div>
<a name="0802013000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000489"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for that necessarily lengthy intervention and I am reassured. He is
right that there has to be a proper balance between the costs found; no
doubt PADA will bring that forward. However, an understanding now of
the importance of the members&#146; panel having access to
independent research is important. My other point, which relates to the
intervention from the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South
Pembrokeshire, concerns the process by which the panel members are
chosen&#151;the Minister has addressed that adequately in his
response. It also relates to the way in which the views of the panel
have to be listened to and responded to by the trustees.</div>
<a name="0802013000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
is right in saying that there is a clear difference between the
trustees, who are the sole people for taking decisions, and the panels,
who have a responsibility to represent the interests of members and
employers and to offer their views. However, it is
important&#151;this is something that will have to be borne in mind
by PADA&#151;that in constructing the relationship between the panel
and the trustees, there are some clear obligations about how the
trustees must receive and respond to representations that are made to
them by the panel; that is the practice in some other such panels. I
hope that those comments will also be noted.</div>
<a name="0802013000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given much of what the Minister
has said, I am happy to withdraw the amendment concerned. However I
hope that those points will be noted on the record and by PADA as they
go forward to construct the way that the members&#146; panel works. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="0802013000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="0802013000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000490"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 100, in
clause 52, page 25, line 31, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) The Secretary
of State must provide the panels with&#151;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) an annual report considering the impact of
means-tested benefits on members of the scheme established under
section 50,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) an annual
report assessing the quality of qualifying
schemes&#146;.</div><a name="0802013000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not take long with this. The amendment makes a point which,
although extremely important, is one that we have debated at an earlier
stage. The amendment proposes that, in order to support the work of the
panels, it is important that the panel members understand the broader
context&#151;the backdrop&#151;against which the scheme is
operating. Clearly, members and their representatives, particularly
those on the members&#146; panel, will therefore have a specific
interest in how the benefits that members are receiving, or are likely
to receive, are interacting with the wider pensions environment. This
is particularly true in the pensions environment, as it relates to
means tested benefits, but also the wider environment that pensioners
are exposed to in terms of means tested benefits. Throughout the
earlier stages of the Committee&#146;s deliberations we looked at the
importance of housing benefit in this context for some
pensioners.</div> <a name="0802013000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to oblige the Secretary of State to provide the panels
with information: first, that concerning the impact of means tested
benefits for members of the scheme; and secondly, whether the way in
which the concept of levelling down is happening or not. That will also
be a matter of concern for the panels. That is the point of the part of
the amendment that refers
to</div><a name="0802013000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an annual report
assessing the quality of qualifying
schemes&#148;.</div><a name="0802013000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
case the Minister is in any doubt, I repeat that I welcome the
commitment he made earlier in our deliberations to undertake a report
suggested by Help the Aged on the broader issue of means testing. That
will be subject to further consideration and debate in due course. It
is also important that information is provided to the panels as they
carry out their work, to enable them to understand the context in which
the personal accounts are operated. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response on that
point.</div><a name="0802013000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="0802013000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000491"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am slightly perplexed by this amendment. It is
entirely appropriate that we should debate whether it pays to save and
also issues around levelling down. The members&#146; panels, however,
are primarily going to be looking at how the scheme itself operates. It
is primarily an internally-focused operation looking at whether this
pension scheme is properly run, adequately delivering to the members
and whether its strategies are taking account of the views of the
members. I think that is a pretty big job.</div>
<a name="0802013000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the hon. Gentleman is
suggesting is that members of the panel should be more outward-looking,
examining the impact of personal accounts on levelling down, the
benefit system, whether it pays to save and that they should be aware
of these things because of the impact on members. I appreciate that
these things will have an impact on the members, I am just not sure
what impact the members&#146; panel could have on those things as a
members&#146; panel. It is essentially looking to the board of
trustees and ensuring that the board of trustees is doing things that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>are in the interest of the members. It is a sort of sounding board for
the trustees on the operation of the pension
scheme.</div><a name="0802013000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">So while I
think these are perfectly proper and legitimate issue which we can
debate in a wider context, I am just not sure that they are what I
would expect the members&#146; panel to be focusing on. They will
have enough work to do without focusing on those issues. I have no
problem with them having information about these things, I am just not
convinced that this is what they ought to be up
to.</div><a name="0802013000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident
there will be a proper flow of information between the trustee and the
panels, the trustee board will be as keen as the government to make all
this work. I do not think it is appropriate to specify the types of
information they need to fulfil their duty, to some extent that is for
the members&#146; panels to determine for themselves. I hear what he
says about research and if they wanted to get reports on pays to save
and whether there is any levelling down, I do not see any reason why
they should not get that, but what I would hope if I were ever a member
of personal accounts is that whoever is on the members&#146; panel
will be watching the decisions being made by the trustees board and
ensuring the trustee is acting in the interest of the members and that
investment decisions, the management, the operation, the procedures,
the processes of collection and administration and payment are all ones
which are in the interests of the members. I just see a different role
so I am a little perplexed by the amendment. I do not dispute that the
issues are ones we need to discuss, I am just not sure they are issues
for the members&#146; panels. I do not object to them discussing
them, it is a matter for
them.</div><a name="0802013000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000492"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am sorry if the Minister is perplexed. The
amendment was not meant to be perplexing and he is right to say that in
carrying out their work, the members&#146; panel obviously has to be
focused primarily on the operation of the scheme, decisions made by the
trustees and so on, but as he also said, one of the roles of the
members&#146; panel is to make sure the scheme is adequately
delivering to members. The point of this amendment is simply seeking to
draw this out and in his comments I think he accepted that this was an
area where the members&#146; panel might wish to have information
from time to time, and, if they did, there would be no problem with
them having it. So, in a sense, I regard my point as having been
satisfied by the Minister, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"></i><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div><a name="0802013000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a fairly simple
amendment, harking back to earlier clauses&#151;which is very much
welcomed by employer organisations like the CBI&#151;and clearly sets
out a 3 per cent. employer contribution in the Bill. We had a fairly
prolonged debate about this issue only the other day, in the context, I
think, of a Liberal Democrat attempt to jack that up to 5 per cent. But
we managed to defeat that&#151;or at least persuade them of the error
of their ways&#151;on the basis that this was all part of the
post-Turner settlement, as it were.</div>
<a name="0802013000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that that be in
the Bill and I cannot imagine that there can be any controversy about
also writing it in to clause 53, which deals with contribution limits.

come to those in later
amendments.</div><a name="0802013000206"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000494"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I want clarification about what the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention. It has always been argued that the 3 per
cent. should be the minimum employer contribution. His amendment would
make it the only possible contribution. Is that his
intention?</div><a name="0802013000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000495"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> The Minister makes a good point, in which case
we will have to recast the amendment. If the Minister accepts the
principle that we should write 3 per cent. into clause 53 we would be
very happy with that.</div>
<a name="0802013000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It just seems to me that if
there is a clause headed &#147;Contribution Limits&#148;, then it
is worth spelling out what is envisaged on contributions. We know the
position at the moment is that we start off with an 8 per cent. overall
level of contributions: 5 per cent. from an employee, 3 per cent. from
employers. Again, this point was quite hard fought the other day on the
basis that, if some future Government or personal accounts board wanted
to come back and argue for a higher statutory employer contribution,
they would have to do that by way of primary legislation. I think that
remains the Government&#146;s position, and I am sure our position as
well&#151;and that is the kind of reassurance that employers are
looking for.</div> <a name="0802013000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
principle is acceptable to the Minister&#151;I was not going to press
this amendment to a vote anyway&#151;I am sure he can find a way of
setting out even more issues about contribution levels, including the 8
per cent. overall figure, into clause 53, which just seems a logical
place to put it, despite the fact it appears earlier in the
Bill.</div><a name="0802013000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000496"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The points made by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne are ones that we, the Liberal Democrats, would wish to
associate ourselves with. There is clearly a question about employer
contribution and how it can be maintained at the 3 per cent. level that
has been promised, and that is the expectation. An amendment such as
this&#151;which makes it clear that there would have to be further
primary legislation if that were to be changed&#151;would give the
appropriate reassurance for which employers would certainly be
looking.</div><a name="0802013000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000497"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Clause 18 says</div>
<a name="0802013000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the employer&#146;s contribution
must be at least 3% of the amount of the jobholder&#146;s qualifying
earnings in the pay reference period.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div><a name="0802013000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is in the Bill already. I am
not sure there is any point in putting it into this clause. It might
confuse the courts, who may think there is some other further
point.</div> <a name="0802013000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot
accept the amendment proposed by the Conservatives, on the basis that
it makes 3 per cent. the contribution; we have always made it clear
that we regard it as a minimum contribution. We expect many employers
will want to make a contribution higher than 3 per cent. We think that
is a matter for them. That is why we have worded clause 18 in the way
we did, saying that the employer&#146;s contribution must be at least
3 per cent. of the amount of the jobholder&#146;s qualifying
earnings. I cannot see any point in putting it here.</div>
<a name="0802013000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought the Conservatives had
taken a view that the employer&#146;s contribution should be held at
3 per cent. which somewhat surprised me. I see now that that was not
the intention&#151;so that is clearer&#151;but I do not see any
point in putting it in twice. I can see a point in not doing it, in
that the courts might want to know why it was there twice and whether
this meant something slightly different. I am not convinced of the
argument and do not see why this is necessary. I regret I cannot accept
the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000215"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000501"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> This group of amendments will take a bit more
time. They are all around the issues of contribution caps and transfers
into and out of personal accounts.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div><a name="0802013000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will quickly go through what
the amendments seek to do and then give a bit more background. It is
logical to start with amendment No. 29 which incorporates an absolute
prohibition on transfers between the pension scheme&#151;the personal
accounts&#151;and other schemes and also says that the contributions
of the jobholder should be limited to &#163;3,600 in any one year.
Amendment No. 77 deals with how to maintain the value year-on-year of
that contribution and I will return to that in a moment. Amendment No.
30 seeks to take out subsection (3) which would allow an order to
change contribution levels. Subsection (5) would be taken out under
amendment No. 58 which gives the Secretary of State power to repeal
this section.</div><a name="0802013000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been a long and fairly fierce debate about contribution limits. There
are very powerful arguments on both sides. On the one hand are ranged
the consumer organisations and others, such as Age Concern, who argue
the case for more flexibility in either a lifetime limit or a higher
annual contribution cap or transfers in, either a one-off in year one
or subsequent years of capital amounts.</div>
<a name="0802013000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the arguments focus on
people who want to catch up contributions&#151;perhaps some of the
people I talked of earlier who do nothing between now and 2012,
assuming that is the date&#151;or people who want to put savings, an
inheritance or divorce settlement into personal accounts. I apologise
to people whose arguments I am paraphrasing. I will perhaps touch upon
one or two in more detail and perhaps in their own words in a
minute.</div>
<a name="0802013000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0802013000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ranged on one
side are a group of people, especially those representing the industry,
who argue very strongly and persuasively that we must take every step
that we can in legislation to ensure that personal accounts, even if
they are a success in their own right, do not erode existing pension
provision and compete as a non-advice, low-cost alternative to other
pension savings. We have debated at length the nightmare scenario,
which was conjured up by the Pensions Policy Institute, of personal
accounts being quite successful, but the overall pension savings in the
country sharply declining because of levelling down and so
on.</div><a name="0802013000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other side
of the argument is the mantra of simplicity. Mr. Tim Jones
seems to be getting a good run today. He raises this every time I have
any kind of conversation with him, and I am sure the same goes for
Ministers. As he and Paul Myners have said to me&#151;and, I am sure,
to everybody else who takes an interest in these things, including the
Minister&#151;every extra bell and whistle will add to the cost of
personal accounts, and might add to the risk of them not being ready by
2012. As will become apparent when I deal with these amendments in more
detail, I side with those who say, &#147;Let&#146;s not take risks
about implementing personal accounts. There might be reasons for
reviewing things later, but we need to be absolutely sure that this is
ready to go in 2012,&#148; and those who say, &#147;We have a
pretty good private pension set-up in this country as it is. It has
taken a few knocks, but it is still a lot better than many other
countries&#146;, and we do not want to see that eroded or threatened
by this new personal accounts system.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div><a name="0802013000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal first with the annual
contribution cap. The Pensions Commission originally proposed an annual
limit of about &#163;3,000, in support of which it
said:</div><a name="0802013000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
approach would mean that lower earners would effectively be free of any
cap (since they would be unlikely to be able to use the freedom) while
limiting the extent to which higher earners could use the NPSS as a
low-cost alternative for pension saving that is already in many cases
occurring.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
from that that the commission sussed out quite early on that there was
a risk of levelling down and that that had to be dealt with
clearly.</div><a name="0802013000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We then made a
quantum leap to the December 2006 White Paper, when the Department for
Work and Pensions suddenly popped up with the suggestion that the limit
should go up to &#163;5,000. It also proposed that the Personal
Accounts Board should be able to review the limit, and suggested a
higher limit of &#163;10,000 in the first year. I know that the
Minister has been turning that over in his mind, so he might have
something to say about it. The Work and Pensions Committee also
examined at the issue.</div>
<a name="0802013000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The &#163;5,000 announcement
caused, to put it mildly, a bit of a flurry in the industry, because it
emerged that a &#163;5,000 cap would, in theory, incorporate
something like 94 per cent. of all existing pension provision, which
was not at all what Lord Turner had in mind. We in the official
Opposition were quite taken aback by the proposal. We did not know
where it came from, what was behind it and who was in favour of
it&#151;it was certainly not the industry&#151;and we did not think
that it was sensible. We made it very clear, both in public and in
private, that if the Government wanted to proceed with that figure,
they would jeopardise the whole consensus process and that we would
certainly not sign up to it. The Government got their mind right, to
quote another famous film, and came up with a figure of &#163;3,600
at 2005 prices, which we were content with, and a mini-consensus has
grown up around that figure since, which is good news. We would still
urge the Government to keep the &#163;3,600 figure, and the Minister
has made it abundantly clear that that &#163;3,600 at 2005 prices is
still the policy.</div><a name="0802013000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are trying to help out the Minister with amendment No. 77, which deals
with uprating the figure. However, the figure does not appear in the
Bill, or even, I believe, in the explanatory notes. We think that it
should, and some of the witnesses agree with us. I will cite what some
of them said in a
moment.</div><a name="0802013000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give credit
to the Engineering Employers Federation and Mr. David
Yeandle, who came up with the wording of amendment No. 77. It is
designed to make it clear that the Government will not only carry
through their commitment to an annual limit of &#163;3,600, based on
2005 earnings levels, but that they are committed to that
limit</div><a name="0802013000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;being uprated with
earnings from that point to implementation from
2012.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It cites that the
precedent for such tight drafting as section 34 of the Employment
Relations Act 1999, which is used to implement, among other things, the
maximum weekly pay that is used for calculating statutory redundancy
pay annually in line with the retail price index. This is not rocket
science.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div><a name="0802013000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our evidence session, I was
underwhelmed by the Minister&#146;s response when I quizzed him as to
why &#163;3,600 was not mentioned at all in the Bill. He
said:</div><a name="0802013000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#163;3,600 is a
2005 figure&#148;,</div><a name="0802013000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is
correct,</div><a name="0802013000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which will be
annually uprated as we deal with issues in terms of the economy,
inflation and other factors. Therefore we want to ensure we do not
enshrine in statute something that we then plan to amend year on year.
&#148;</div><a name="0802013000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is fair enough, up
to a point. He
continued:</div><a name="0802013000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
those reasons, enshrining that figure in legislation would not be wise
but we would intend to say that very clearly the policy is that that is
the figure; we do not intend to increase it other than by the increases
in the level of inflation.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,
Pensions Public Bill Committee, </i>17 January 2008; c. 113,
Q138.]</div><a name="0802013000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why am I not
convinced by that? All sorts of pieces of legislation are peppered with
examples of figures that change. At the moment, &#163;3,600 may not
be the right figure. However, I have never claimed that any of my
amendments or new clauses is the ultimate. We do not have all these
clever people working for us, and if the principles are accepted, the
parliamentary draftsmen can go away and sort it
out.</div><a name="0802013000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, given
that this is such an important issue, why can it not be in the Bill?
The argument that one should not put a figure in legislation because it
will change is, with respect, completely bonkers. Figures have been put
in all sorts of legislation, such as tax and minimum wage legislation,
and those figures change. There is almost invariably a formula in the
legislation setting out how they are to change. With respect to the
Minister, I do not think that that is a valid argument against the
amendments.</div><a name="0802013000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The EEF
supports a &#163;3,600 limit. Originally, it lobbied the other way
and wanted the limit to be more open and flexible, but its attitude now
seems to be, &#147;We have now alighted on this figure and there
seems to be general agreement&#151;perhaps some of it
grudging&#151;that that should be the figure, so let us make sure
that it is in the
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a question of lump-sum contributions and transfers. Although I
intellectually understand the arguments that are put forward in favour
of them, I think that there are real arguments against. I have dealt
with simplicity and the erosion of existing provision. If someone had a
&#163;10,000 inheritance and decided to put that into their personal
account scheme, there would be two major
problems.</div><a name="0802013000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lump sum
would not attract the employer contribution. I do not want to reopen
the whole debate&#151;important though it is, and we have had it more
than once&#151;about the groups that will benefit from personal
accounts, not benefit, or not benefit as much as they expect. Those
three groups&#151;those that will benefit, those definitely at risk
and those in the middle, as identified by the PPI&#151;will be part
of the ongoing process at which we will be looking on a cross-party
basis. Part of the definition of whether people are going to be better
off will be based purely on an employer contribution, because that will
make all the difference to whether they are going to get something out
of this or not. However, with a &#163;10,000 lump sum, there will be
no employer
contribution.</div><a name="0802013000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
keep coming back to the issue of advice. No one is going to give any of
those people specific advice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>on their particular situation. Otto Thoresen, as people keep reminding
us, is wrestling with the oxymoron of generic advice. We will see what
he comes up with in his final report&#151;I think that the Minister
said that other day that it might be published in March. Someone might
well be advised not to put that &#163;10,000 in personal accounts and
to do something completely different, but there will be no one queuing
up to give such specific
advice.</div><a name="0802013000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me come
back to what some of our witnesses said about the subject. When we saw
Mr. Stephen Haddrill of the Association of British Insurers
on 15 January, I asked him what he thought should be in the Bill to
minimise the erosion of existing provision. He talked about his
concerns on levelling down and the need to ensure that the personal
account remained</div><a name="0802013000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;targeted
at the people it is really designed for...Money speaks, and we
fear then that personal accounts will get delivered for the people with
more money&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0802013000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather
than the target group. He went on to
say:</div><a name="0802013000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That is
why we do not like the idea of high levels of contribution being
allowed during the year&#151;the Minister has given assurances on
that, but we do not see that &#163;3,600 figure on the cap actually
on the face of the Bill.
We&#151;</div><a name="0802013000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">this is the view of

say:</div><a name="0802013000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do not
see anything about transfers in from other schemes on the face of the
Bill in terms of them being stopped, which is what we would like to
see. I think that we should also be very cautious indeed about random
lump-sum contributions&#151;in fact, not allow them&#151;into these
schemes, because they will not be matched by an employer
contribution&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0802013000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

reason why we do not like additional contributions is because we think

have no advice.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Pensions

on that particular issue. Additionally, the written evidence of the

therefore very surprised and disappointed to see that, whilst Clause 53
of the Pensions Bill refers to the introduction of an annual
contribution limit, there is no reference to the level of this limit in
either the Pensions Bill itself or the Bill&#146;s Explanatory Notes.
We consider that both the &#163;3,600 annual contribution limit and
its uprating in line with earnings between 2005 and 2012 need to be set
out clearly in the Pensions Bill as we feel that the absence of this
detail will inevitably reopen the debate on this important issue which
we felt had been
resolved.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000502"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The amendments cover at least three important,
but distinct, areas: first, the uprating of the limit, secondly, the
ability to transfer in or out of personal accounts and, thirdly,
whether, in addition, there should be a lifetime limit. I disagree with
much of what the hon. Member for Eastbourne has said about the second
and third of those. However, on the first of those, the uprating of the
annual limits, he makes a great deal of sense. Amendment No. 77 seeks
an annual limit of &#163;3,600 at 2005 prices that should then be
uprated in line with the relevant index in the future. To have that in
the Bill, just to be clear of the Minister&#146;s intention, makes a
great deal of sense. I will now turn to other issues where there are
some grounds for disagreement.</div>
<a name="0802013000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Eastbourne
seeks to put in the Bill an absolute ban on transfers in and out of
personal accounts. It is clear from what the Minister said 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>elsewhere that that is a question that he seeks to review in 2017. That
approach is probably a sensible one, but there are cases where, having
had a period of stability in the initial phase of personal
accounts&#151;which I suspect is what the 2017 review is designed to
achieve&#151;there are circumstances in which to allow small
transfers in and out would be
appropriate.</div><a name="0802013000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
talked previously about particular groups of people such as those with
small pension pots or broken work records. Let us take as an example
someone who has worked for two or three years in a relatively low
income job, with a company pension scheme, who has perhaps built up a
small pot which would be significantly lower than the trivial
commutation limit. After a period out of work, they might come back
into work and have a personal account again but have only the income
and the time to build up a relatively small pot. It would clearly make
sense, in due course, to allow those small pots to be combined, within
appropriate limits, to allow the transfers
in.</div><a name="0802013000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept what the
hon. Member for Eastbourne says, and he is right that this point has
been made strongly by PADA. He is right that Parliament should be
conservative about adding unnecessary bells and whistles to the scheme,
because the more bells and whistles that are added, the more complex it
becomes and the harder it becomes to keep the charges at a low level.
That would then have an impact on the benefits that members will
receive. However, the critical word has to be
&#147;unnecessary&#148;. There are some additional ways of
contributing to personal accounts which I would not characterise as
unnecessary bells and whistles, but which are potentially necessary to
allow personal accounts to achieve their full objective. There is at
least a genuine question to be asked about allowing the transfer in of
other small pots so that there can be a combination which allows a
decent degree of income to be realised in retirement. I hope that the
Minister can say that the 2017 review will be a real review that will
look at those issues in detail with a view to ensuring that the
interests of members, particularly those I have described who might
have a number of small pots, are met. That is why I strongly oppose
amendment No. 29.</div><a name="0802013000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to the idea of having some additional lifetime contributions
limit, which is embodied in amendment No. 103. It suggests
that</div> <a name="0802013000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A member
may make payments that are not contributions for the purposes of
provision under subsection (1) up to a maximum of 2 per cent. of the
standard lifetime
allowance.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Standard
lifetime allowance, as the Committee will know, is currently
&#163;1.6 million. Two per cent. of this would be &#163;32,000,
approximately twice the current trivial commutation limit. We had an
interesting debate about trivial commutation in which I proposed an
amendment that the trivial commutation limit be increased. Amendment
No. 103 would add a degree of flexibility to the system while not
allowing excessive contributions to be brought in from outside. That
would allow people in the target group&#151;and this has to be of
interest to the Committee&#151;who are on low incomes and may only be
able to make a relatively small contribution to their personal account,
to make use of any windfall, legacy or inheritance they may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>have to build up what will be, in many cases, the only pension they have
to ensure an adequate income in
retirement.</div><a name="0802013000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the
hon. Member for Eastbourne is absolutely right that there would not be
an employer contribution attached to any such transfer in, the obvious
reason for such a transfer would be to allow growth to take place in
that money so as to contribute to the overall retirement fund. That
would allow them to reach a level at which they are able to benefit
from an annuity or a regular income stream as opposed to a lump sum,
which is all that they would be entitled to in a very small pot. I must
confess that I was not in the Committee when the questions about advice
were debated, though I have read with interest the record of those
discussions. However, to say that the fact that such people will not be
in a position to have advice is an argument against allowing a lifetime
contribution limit, is not quite right. If we are to get the advice
regime right&#151;it is my understanding that that is what Otto
Thoresen has been asked to look into, and it is certainly the basis on
which my party&#146;s proposals for the advice regime have been
made&#151;we must consider that there are a number of different
aspects of life where better access to financial advice is needed by a
range of people who will potentially be in the target audience for
personal accounts. This is not just advice about personal accounts.
Advice is needed about personal debt, for example.</div>
<a name="0802013000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our suggestion&#151;a national
network of financial advice centres, perhaps operating through citizens
advice bureaux&#151;would clearly provide a vehicle where, if someone
wished to ask a question about this sort of decision, they would be
able to do so. People would be able to receive generic financial
advice, not restricted to personal accounts, but dealing with a range
of other circumstances. Such an approach would allow relevant questions
on this sort of decision to be asked. So that is not a genuine
objection to amendment No. 103.</div>
<a name="0802013000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very pleased to see that a
number of stakeholders, who follow very closely the Committee&#146;s
deliberations, also support amendment No. 103. I note, for example, the
EEF&#146;s belief that individuals should be able to make the
occasional lump-sum payment, in addition to the annual contribution,
into a qualifying workplace limit such as personal accounts, provided
this does not add disproportionately to the cost of administration,
which must be kept as low as
possible.</div><a name="0802013000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
pleased to note the support of Which?. It says that the Government
should introduce a lump-sum contribution limit now to allow consumers
to pay in lump sums such as inheritance, redundancy payments or
bonuses, separate from an annual limit. That would help people to save
for a comfortable retirement in line with their aspirations, and allow
millions of people to achieve their aspirations, which are not
currently being fulfilled. That is the Bill&#146;s principal
political objective. Likewise, the TUC has noted its support for
amendment No. 103. I could go on, but I suspect I would try your
patience, Mrs. Anderson, if I continued to list
organisations in support of this
point.</div><a name="0802013000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposal is
not a bell or a whistle; it is an essential feature to allow people on
low incomes who are in the target group and may not be in a position to
create, through their own endeavours and employer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>contributions, the size of pension pot that they wish, to make
relatively modest additional payments into their personal account from
time to time, with a clear lifetime limit set at a relatively low
level. It would ensure that the personal accounts scheme can have the
wider benefits desired by everyone on the Committee. That would be a
sensible addition to the Bill, and, although I have not yet heard the
Minister&#146;s response, I would like to be permitted, if necessary,
to press the matter to a Division at the end of the
debate.</div><a name="0802013000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000503"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I have considerable sympathy for some of the
points raised by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey. He identifies the three key issues we are discussing: the
&#163;3,600 annual cap, the transfers in and out and the lifetime
investment that people might make.</div>
<a name="0802013000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is that transfers in
and out should not be allowed at this time, but he will be aware from
my evidence to the Committee that I have some sympathy for this idea in
terms of small pots. Let us look at it after 2017, at a more
appropriate time when we have reassured the
industry&#151;particularly the insurance-based, but also the
trust-based pensions industry&#151;that people will not transfer
significant sums from one pension fund to another. At that time, the
Minister and hon. Members can take a view on whether it is appropriate
to allow small pots to be transferred in and out of personal accounts.
Tim Jones indicated that there were some benefits in doing that but
there is a need at this point to keep a level of reassurance for the
industry and that would help with our aim of preventing levelling down,
which is an important concern for all Committee
members.</div>
<a name="0802013000406"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="0802013000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
lively debate for some time around the lifetime limit. There are strong
views on both sides. I do not propose to close that debate down now. I
hope that, in due course, a wider consensus will emerge. We certainly
do not have that now. Closing down the debate on the &#163;10,000
limit at this time would not be the right way
forward.</div><a name="0802013000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000504"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am pleased that the Minister does not wish to
close down that debate. He is right that there is a divergence of view
within the stakeholding community. What steps would he take to bring
consensus on that important issue? Clearly, if there is to be a
consensus, it would require the Bill to be amended. If such a consensus
emerges, is he willing to bring forward an amendment at a later stage
in the Bill to allow that to
happen?</div><a name="0802013000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000505"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> First, we would not have to amend the Bill in
order to enable that change to take place. Subsection (1) would allow
that. Therefore, there is scope to allow that. It does not need to be
in the Bill.</div> <a name="0802013000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do
need to have a clear view by 2012 because there may well be people who
wish to transfer into personal accounts a sum that is perhaps held in a
non-pension saving pot. I am sympathetic that there is an argument but
I want to look at the detail so, therefore, I am not disposed at this
point to put it into the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div><a name="0802013000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000506"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Minister has been very generous in giving
way. To be clear on the first point he made, is it his view that,
should a view come forward that a lifetime limit is desirable, that it
can be done by regulation and not by primary
legislation?</div><a name="0802013000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000507"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Yes. Subsection (1) we believe
enables us to do that. Therefore, we would not need primary
legislation. We are clear that our aim is that personal accounts should
complement rather than replace good-quality pension provision, in
order&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am sorry. I believe
that subsection (3) rather than subsection (1) would enable us to do
that.</div> <a name="0802013000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as our
overall aim is concerned, we are not seeking to replace any
good-quality pension provision. That has never been our intention.
Indeed, the whole process is to complement not compete or replace
current provision.</div> <a name="0802013000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
order to achieve this we have taken some specific measures to focus
personal accounts on the target group. An annual contribution limit of
&#163;3,600 and a prohibition on transfers in and out of personal
accounts, at least in the initial stage, are part of that process. We
have consulted widely on the level of annual contribution limit which
involves a trade-off between focusing personal accounts on the target
group and providing individuals with flexibility to save. We have been
quite clear that we intend to set the contribution limit at
&#163;3,600 in 2005 figures. We have reached a broad consensus with
stakeholders that this is appropriate.</div>
<a name="0802013000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not put the actual
amount in the Bill for a number of reasons. First, the level of the
limit will not be &#163;3,600 in 2012 because we have undertaken to
uprate this figure in line with earnings from 2005.</div>
<a name="0802013000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, I hear what the hon.
Member for Eastbourne says about how we could have a figure in the Bill
and a mechanism for adjusting it. That is possible and is certainly
done in Finance Bills, but it is much easier in Finance Bills as they
come around annually. We are looking at a Pensions Bill that we hope
will still be looked at in 2020. Having such a figure in the Bill
becomes much odder.</div>
<a name="0802013000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is better
to say that the figure will be annually uprated in line with earnings,
so we are clear about where we are. We do not have any proposals to
change that, and I know that the Opposition Members, should dire things
happen at election time, would have no wish to alter it either. I think
that the industry has the level of reassurance that it needs about the
political consensus.</div>
<a name="0802013000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have said that we would
consider a higher limit of &#163;10,000 in the first year and
subsections (1) and (3) provide scope for that limit. As we have said
in earlier debates, we are making pension policy for the long term.
Without the benefit of 20:20 foresight, we believe it is important to
retain an element of flexibility in setting the level of the
contribution limit. We believe this approach makes clear our intention
but does retain flexibility at the same time, and it is the right
approach. So the industry knows our intention&#151;it is all very
clear&#151;but I do not think that we need to put it in the
Bill.</div><a name="0802013000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also been clear that it is our intention to uprate the annual
contribution limit in line with earnings. This will prevent the value
of the limit from being eroded over time as a proportion of an
individual's 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>earnings. But again, flexibility is important. Amendment No.77 would
remove the flexibility for the Secretary of State to adopt another
index should it become apparent that uprating by earnings is not
appropriate. This amendment would also prevent the introduction of a
higher contribution limit in year
one.</div><a name="0802013000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are considering&#151;as I have indicated&#151;the &#163;10,000
limit, but we are not in the position yet to close down that debate. We
have asked the delivery authority to advise us on the cost and
implementation issues around a higher contribution limit in the first
year of the
scheme.</div><a name="0802013000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.29
would pre-empt this work, categorically ruling out a higher limit in
year one. We also recognise that there will be some individuals with
irregular contribution patterns who may want to make one-off payments
to their personal account to boost their pension savings. Consumer
groups in particular have been keen for members to have this facility.
I have already indicated what our view is and I do not propose to close
that down now.</div>
<a name="0802013000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as
amendments No.30 and No.103 are concerned, both affect the development
of a limit&#151;such as a lifetime lump sum&#151;but in
diametrically opposite ways. Amendment 30 would prevent the ability,
whereas amendment No.103 would prescribe a limit of
&#163;30,000&#151;significantly undermining the purpose of the
limits.</div>
<a name="0802013000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an
additional measure to protect existing good quality schemes when
personal accounts are introduced, Amendment No.29 seeks to put a
blanket ban on transfers in the Bill. We have made clear our commitment
to banning most pension transfers into and out of personal accounts.
However&#151;as always&#151;we must allow the flexibility for
exceptions. There are some very limited circumstances&#151;such as
pension sharing on divorce and, as I have indicated previously, the
small stranded pension pots&#151;where we would want to have the
ability to look at these issues. Paving powers for this ban are at
clause 100 of this Bill, and we plan to set out the detail in the
scheme order. We will therefore have the opportunity for some further
discussion at a later
date.</div><a name="0802013000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
make clear that we are committed to carrying out a review of the
contribution limit and the ban on transfers in 2017. In answer to the
hon. Member for Inverness&#146;s question&#151;we intend it to be a
real review. Quite what happens in 2017 will depend on the Government
at the time. But our intention is certainly that that would be a real
review.</div><a name="0802013000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
measures are important to protect good quality provision when the
personal account scheme is introduced. But they do have cost
implications for the scheme, and therefore it is right that we should
review them once the reforms have bedded down to see whether they
remain appropriate. It is right that, following a review and a debate
in the House, the Secretary of State has the power to remove the
requirement for a contribution limit. Amendment No. 58 would remove
that flexibility and require primary legislation should the review
conclude that no contribution limit is necessary. I believe that we
have the balance right in the approach we have taken to this
legislation.</div> <a name="0802013000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some stakeholders who have different views and seek reassurances on
particular points&#151;the &#163;3,600 figure is one. But the way
we have sought to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>present this, and the level of consensus around it, provides them with
the level of security that they need and also enables us to keep some
issues open. One of these is the &#163;10,000 issue, where there is
still a way for that debate to go and where getting a consensus is
likely to be possible. It is not there yet, however, and it may well
take some time&#151;perhaps a year or so before we are in a position
where the industry and the various groups are able to come together and
take a view on this. I am anxious to enable that process to continue,
so I hope that will not be circumscribed by these amendments. Having
said that, I hope the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000508"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am not wholly convinced. In one breath, the
Minister talks about giving people certainty and swearing undying
loyalty to the figure of &#163;3,600 at 2005 levels. He then talks
about the need for flexibility. He cannot have it both ways because
there are bodies out there like the ABI which represents great swathes
of the industry and is nervous about the lack of reference in the Bill
and in the explanatory notes to
&#163;3,600.</div><a name="0802013000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
not press the amendment to a division on this occasion, but the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000510"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Appointing a trustee body to
run an occupational pension scheme, which is part of wider Government
reforms, presents a challenge in balancing independence with
accountability. This is exemplified in the arrangements for the scheme
rules. The scheme rules will include much of the day-to-day detail of
how the personal accounts scheme will be run&#151;hence the trustee
body needs to have a high degree of independence in making the rules.
However, the scope of the rules will be limited by the parameters set
in the scheme order, which we have previously been discussing and will
be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That approach to the rule gives
Parliament control of the scope of personal accounts but allows the
trustee independence in the day-to-day administration and operation of
the
scheme.</div><a name="0802013000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="0802013000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
concerns how comments about rule changes would be considered by whoever
was making the rules, whether a trustee or the Secretary of State. It
may be helpful to explain what we anticipate the rules covering. The
rules will include the set-up and operation of any committees that the
trustee chooses to create, the establishment of an internal complaints
procedure and any information about investment, such as how many
changes to funds a trustee can make each year. That is far from being
set in stone; it is a broad assumption based on practice in existing
large schemes. We expect that the trustee generally will be responsible
for making and amending the rules after the initial
set-up.</div><a name="0802013000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty to
consult placed on both the Secretary of State and the trustee will
ensure that the views of all interested parties such as members,
employers and the wider group of stakeholders are considered in the
design of the scheme rules. That requirement to consult ensures
engagement and involvement without fettering the independence of the
trustee. The Bill already requires the rule-maker to have regard to any
comments that they receive and to publish a general response. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment appears to seek greater assurance that the
rule-maker will consider any comments
received.</div><a name="0802013000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
drafting is sufficient. The phrase that the hon. Gentleman
uses&#151;&#147;take account of&#148;&#151;does not take us an
awful lot further but it does appear to fetter a trustee&#146;s
freedom and independence in a way that &#147;have regard to&#148;
does not. I appreciate that he takes us a bit further but there is both
a price and a balance here, and the price in terms of fettering the
independence of the trustee is one that we need to approach with
caution.</div><a name="0802013000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have
enormously strong views here but I think that we are attempting to
strike a balance by requiring the trustee to &#147;have regard
to&#148;, whereas, by saying that they have to &#147;take account
of&#148;, the hon. Gentleman raises questions such as, &#147;How do
they take account of it&#148;? How do they prove that they have taken
account of it? Do they have to do something in
response?</div><a name="0802013000311"></a>

is obviously so pleased with himself that he has gone off for a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000514"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in
clause 57, page 27, line 12, leave
out subsection (3).</div><a name="0802013000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a short point, which is as much asking a question as speaking to
the amendment. Subsection (3) refers the trustee corporation as a body
corporate, not as having any Crown immunity or privilege. I understand
the argument for that, but only a short while ago we had a debate about
relieving individual trustees and others of their possible legal
liabilities in certain circumstances. I am not sure how that chimes in
with this aspect of the Bill, but I know that the Minister will
enlighten
me.</div><a name="0802013000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000515"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The trustee corporation will be a
non-departmental public body, which will ensure independence and
accountability. If the trustee corporation was a Crown body, its staff
would be civil servants and thus less independent. Standard practice,
therefore, is for bodies that are not part of a Department not to be
considered as part of the Crown and thus not to enjoy any immunity or
privileges of the Crown. A trustee corporation will run the scheme in
the sole interest of its members and independently of the Government,
so its loyalty will be not to the Crown, but to the members. That means
that it is more important for the trustee corporation to be without
Crown status. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is
content.</div><a name="0802013000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000516"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000517"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 54, in
schedule 1, page 49, line 14, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;of which at least three members
shall be appointed to represent the interests of members and
prospective members.&#146;.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div><a name="0802013000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">A series of amendments have been
tabled to schedule 1. Some are on nuts and bolts issues&#151;I am
sure that we can dispose of those simply&#151;while others relate to
what I shall call the level playing field issue. We will deal with
those in more detail with your indulgence, Mrs.
Anderson.</div><a name="0802013000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment No. 54, we are saying that of
the</div><a name="0802013000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not fewer than 9 and
not more than 15
members&#148;</div><a name="0802013000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
the trustee corporation, at least three should be appointed
specifically to represent the interests of members and prospective
members. I anticipate that the Minister will say, &#147;But
they&#146;re all meant to represent the interests of members and
prospective members.&#148; On one level, that is correct. However, it
might be better to write into the Bill a specific requirement that at
least three are appointed specifically for that purpose&#151;perhaps
from among the kind of people who might otherwise have become members
of the members&#146; panel. I am sure that that will appeal to the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, given his
near obsession with that issue.</div>
<a name="0802013000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000518"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> As the hon. Member for Eastbourne has observed,
this is an issue that I am interested to pursue. The amendment usefully
serves to probe the Minister&#146;s
intentions.</div><a name="0802013000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, the Minister will no doubt answer that all members of
the trustee corporation will, in some sense, be there to represent the
members. However, the amendment relates to clause 52(4), which we
debated earlier, which
says:</div><a name="0802013000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
functions of the members&#146; panel may include nominating
individuals to be members of the trustee
corporation.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the group of people who are referred to in the amendment
are there not because every member of the trustee corporation should be
helping to manage the scheme on behalf of its members, but so that that
there are representatives on the trustee corporation who are nominated
directly by members, groups representing members and, perhaps, the
members&#146; panel. The point that is being made is important. I
hope that the Minister will either agree to the amendment or a similar
measure, or that he will at least make clear how he wants to ensure
that the members are appointed. If there is not to be such a provision
in the Bill, how will we ensure that such a practice goes
forward?</div>
<a name="0802013000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000519"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The Government&#146;s policy on
member-nominated trustees applies to personal accounts in broadly the
same way as other occupational pension schemes at this time. The
schedule already makes clear that there is provision for section 242 of
the Pensions Act 2004 to apply&#151;for one third of the trustees to
be member-nominated. On that basis, the amendment is probably not
needed. Given that the scale of the personal accounts scheme means that
the members&#146; panel will have the responsibility of nominating
trustees to represent scheme members, it is going to be difficult to
work out how they will do that, as we have discussed. Both hon.
Gentlemen are right to say that all trustees will, by their nature,
seek to represent the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>members of the trust and act in their best interests. That is their
obligation. It is right that there should be member-nominated trustees,
although there is a debate about the number of them. For example, the
TUC has urged that they should make up 50 per cent., and that forms
part of the
discussion.</div><a name="0802013000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, we are looking at section 242 of the 2004 Act, so the
proportion of trustees to be member-nominated would be one third. I
hope that provides reassurance that the amendment is not needed. The
provision that addresses the issues about which the hon. Gentleman is
concerned is already in the Bill: two sub-paragraphs down from the
provision to which the amendment
refers.</div><a name="0802013000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000520"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I am grateful for that explanation, and I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0802013000336"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000521"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in
schedule 1, page 50, line 2, after
&#145;financial&#146;, insert &#145;,
political.&#146;</div><a name="0802013000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I want to make a short but important point. Quite rightly, paragraph 2
to schedule 1 deals with potential conflicts of interest. It is
important that we cater for that possibility, the most obvious of which
is financial, as the measure says. Sub-paragraph (5) cites
&#147;financial or other interest&#148;, which makes the net
reasonably
wide.</div><a name="0802013000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are suggest that the measure should refer to &#147;financial,
political or other interest&#148;, which would ensure that&#151;of
course, the whole question of recruitment is some way down the
road&#151;whichever Government were in power, we would not end up
with political appointees being nudged in the direction of the trustee
corporation. The men and women who will serve on it will be thoroughly
independently minded and will, presumably, have substantial experience
or expertise in this area. If they have a political background, that
should at least be considered and made part of the selection
process.</div><a name="0802013000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000522"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> What is a political
interest?</div><a name="0802013000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000523"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> Taking one example at random&#151;just
plucking an example out of the air&#151;the new chairman of PADA made
a contribution to the now Prime Minister&#146;s campaign fund. That
is a political interest. I am not necessary talking about people who
deliver leaflets regularly in a particular ward. Whenever paperwork on
recruiting people to the NHS crosses my desk, there is always a bit on
the form about political
activity.</div><a name="0802013000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000524"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman was aware&#151;his
colleagues were certainly aware&#151;of that contribution at the time
of the appointment of Paul Myners. It was not a secret in any way. It
was not regarded by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party or anyone as a
conflict of interest in any
form.</div><a name="0802013000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in danger
of excluding people who have a legitimate political interest. People
vote and participate in politics, and they ought to be encouraged to do
so. I do not think that we should be in the business of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>suggesting that those who have a political interest automatically have a
conflict of interest. Provided that things are reasonably open, I have
no great problem with political
interests.</div><a name="0802013000344"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000525"></a>Mr.
Waterson:</b> Nor do I, but there are two parts of the
measure. It sets out the definition of a conflict of interest and goes
on to say:</div> <a name="0802013000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which is
likely to affect prejudicially that person&#146;s discharge of
functions as a member of the trustee
corporation.&#148;</div><a name="0802013000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example might be someone who was an active member of an extreme
right-wing party such as the British National party, but happened to be
brilliant on pensions. There would be no conflict of interest because
that would not prejudicially affect the discharge of that
person&#146;s functions as a member of the trustee corporation. I am
not suggesting that having any political interest would exclude someone
automatically. To be excluded, they would have to be covered by the
rest of the
provisions.</div><a name="0802013000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">This issue
is important, but I do not want to labour the point about the
chairmanship of PADA. We said what we had to say at the time. Everyone
has now moved on, and our main concern&#151;that of Paul Myners, too,
I am sure&#151;is ensuring that we can deliver 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>by 2012. We still think that the amendment is important and that the
Minister should look at it
seriously.</div><a name="0802013000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0802013000526"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> As far as I am concerned, other interests
adequately cover this. If people have proper political views, I am not
in the business of saying that they should be excluded, as long as
there is no other conflict of interest. Defining &#147;political
interest&#148; would be a mess and I strongly oppose the amendment.
All too often there is a pejorative view in the media and elsewhere of
people who are engaged in politics. We need to say that being engaged
in politics is a citizen&#146;s duty, to some extent, rather than
something that should be frowned
on.</div><a name="0802013000410"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
