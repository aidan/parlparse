<H4><center>Clause 60</center></H4>
<H4><center>Jurisdiction</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [3 February], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<br>
<b>10.30 am</b>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): When we adjourned last Thursday, I was about to ask the Minister about clause 60 and the implications of the United Kingdom's proposed ratification of the international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings. Since then, I have thought carefully about whether such an important subject requires an extensive debate. I took expert advice from experienced Members, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). I consequently condensed my questions into three points.
<P>
First, what is the relationship between the extraterritorial jurisdiction sought under clause 60 and the normal arrangements that we have with several countries for the extradition of serious offenders for trial in the country in which the offence is alleged to have taken place? When such offences take place in a country with which the United Kingdom has an extradition treaty, will it be open to the UK Government or the prosecuting authorities to choose to try alleged criminals here under the proposed extraterritorial jurisdiction or to extradite them to face trial elsewhere? Do the convention and the Bill require that one or other of those courses of action take priority? At what point and to what extend is the matter a question of judgment?
<P>
I accept that Ministers could be under political pressure--I do not use that phrase in a pejorative sense--to have a case tried here rather than return someone to a country believed to be tyrannical or oppressive by a significant sector of the British public. Public feelings of sympathy for the alleged offender may even outweigh the serious crime with which he or she has been charged.
<P>
<B>My second question is about article 8 of the convention, which appears to oblige the UK Government and all other parties to the convention to initiate prosecutions without exception. It explicitly states:</B>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present shall, in cases to which article 6 applies, if it does not extradite that person, be obliged, without exception, whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory, to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that that means that we are proposing to treat the offences provided for in the convention in the same way as hijackings and piracy? To a certain extent, the Government would be binding their hands and saying, "We regard those crimes as so horrific and such a threat, to not only human life and safety but to international order, that whatever the extenuating circumstances we accept an obligation, binding in international law, to initiate proceedings for prosecution." I would be grateful for the Minister's confirmation that that is the meaning of article 8.
<P>
My third question relates to the rules of evidence. My understanding of article 8 is that we are accepting the obligation to initiate prosecutions, but that the police and the Crown Prosecution Service would apply the same tests as in a purely domestic criminal prosecution. They would have to satisfy themselves that there was adequate evidence to justify bringing the case before a British court and that it was in the public interest for such a prosecution to be brought. Would that public interest test be related to an assessment of public opinion or of the state of Britain's diplomatic and commercial relations with the other country?
<P>
The evidential test is relevant to alleged offences that have taken place overseas. The CPS will have to weigh up whether there is sufficient evidence to justify bringing a prosecution in a British court. Will the CPS, in making that assessment, apply the normal rules about admissibility of evidence? Clearly, it might be difficult for the CPS to obtain documentary evidence and to secure the presence of witnesses in court to ensure that the case meets the standards that British courts normally require in prosecutions of such serious offences. The European convention on mutual legal assistance would help in such a case, by allowing evidence to be presented through video recordings and to be faxed to the United Kingdom, rather than requiring original documents.
<P>
If we are properly to assess what effect the clause and ratification of the convention will have in practice and what difference they will make to our ability to combat international terrorism, we will need answers to the practical questions that I have raised about evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I have a few supplementary questions that are appropriate at this point.
<P>
By definition, various jurisdictions will be relevant in the context of the clause. When we talk about jurisdiction in this country and possibly elsewhere, various questions arise, as the hon. member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) rightly said. Those of us who took courses in international law will remember those issues--not very well, but well enough to remember that they are controversial. Do the Government have a mechanism in place to deal with those issues, not only with the Irish Government, with whom they collaborate regularly on legislation in Ireland and in the United Kingdom, but with the European Union and members of the Council of Europe, which are signatories to the convention on human rights? Is there a process to ensure that our legislation on international offences resembles theirs as closely as possible? Of course, bringing together national jurisdictions takes time. I remember from my work at the Council of Europe that there were regular intergovernmental conferences to seek agreement about such matters. It would help to know whether it is now the Government's practice and policy to agree legislative wording and implementation so that there is the greatest similarity, especially across Council of Europe countries, which are all governed by the convention.
<P>
It is appropriate that this matter crops up today. The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) touched on the issue of extradition. Down the road, the most recent phase of the case relating to General Pinochet is taking place. That case reminds us of a question that could apply equally to terrorist bombings and which certainly applies to the Lockerbie air disaster, the Libyan defendants and the issue of jurisdiction. What process is followed to establish who should trigger extradition? Where is the right jurisdiction? What is the right legal forum for such cases? It may be far preferable, cheaper and more efficient in international law making and law enforcement for a particular country to be the forum.
<P>
What is the process? How far advanced are we with the planning? When the Spanish and the Belgians sought extradition of General Pinochet, they did so largely because individuals went to their courts and to international organisations. However, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, extradition is often instigated by domestic prosecuting authorities equivalent to our Crown Prosecution Service. There is an international network of prosecuting authorities, just as there is a network for policing and secret or special services. What will be the process? We can pass the clause into law, create offences and include offences from Acts of Parliament that go back almost 120 years, but our logic must be that people cannot play one jurisdiction off against another. For the same act, there should not be highly different thresholds for prosecution or guilt, or different definitions of the offence.
<P>
My third linked question relates to the prosecuting authorities. It is appropriate that decisions should be taken not unilaterally but collectively. A case is more likely to stand up if there is a common view on how to proceed among the prosecuting authorities in the relevant countries of the Council of Europe or the EU. The best place to seek maximum agreement if the Council of Europe. The European convention is the external arbiter of the working of the Bill, so we should seek maximum agreement among its signatories. Can the Minister update us on the current practice and what the Government expect to happen, in the interests of co-ordination on matters that would be best dealt with at an international level?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Aylesbury strayed slightly on to clause 61, which was entirely appropriate. If hon. Members stray on to clause 61, I shall be entirely content as that will save time. However, there will be a further debate on that matter.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> First, I pay tribute to the outstanding judgment of the hon. Member for Aylesbury in taking the profound, wise and welcome decision not to follow the lead of the right hon. Member  for Bromley and Chislehurst in his approach to such matters in Committee. The hon. Gentleman's approach completely validates his presence on the Conservative Front Bench and shows wisdom that we must all admire.
<P>
As the Committee will be aware, clause 60 is designed  to extend extraterritorial  jurisdiction, beyond that which already applies, in relation to the offences listed in subsection (2). It essentially ensures universal jurisdiction over those offences in existing legislation, such as the Explosive Substances Act 1883, the Biological Weapons Act 1974 and the Chemical Weapons Act 1996, which currently attract different levels of extraterritorial jurisdiction in so far as those offences are committed as acts, or for the purposes, or terrorism.
<P>
Under the clause, if a person commits a terrorist act outside of the United Kingdom that would constitute one of the offences listed if he had committed it here, and he then enters this country, he is triable here. That extension of extraterritoriality, together with the related changes to the Extradition Act 1989 under new clause 9, is necessary to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the United Nations convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings in due course, and to meet its obligations under the so-called extradite or prosecute provisions of that convention, which are common to earlier UN counter-terrorism conventions. That covers cases in which, for example, a convention state seeks the extradition of a person who has allegedly committed a terrorist act in that state, but extradition from the United Kingdom is not possible for whatever reason, so prosecution here could follow. The United Kingdom signed the convention when it opened for signature on 12 January 1998.
<P>
The main provisions of the terrorist bombings convention are that, under article 6, the state  party is required to take jurisdiction over the convention offences that relate to terrorist bombings or the use by terrorists if other lethal chemical, biological or chemical devices when they are committed by its nationals anywhere in the world. In addition, under articles 6, 4 and 8, each state party is obliged to establish jurisdiction so as to prosecute alleged offenders regardless of nationality when they are in a state's territory and that state will not extradite to another state for whatever reason. The so-called extradite or prosecute provision that I mentioned earlier is common to almost all UN counter-terrorist conventions to certain other conventions. Clause 60 and new clause 9 will enable United Kingdom to meet that important international obligation.
<P>
As hon. Members will be aware, in relation to  many Council of Europe countries and India, extraterritorial jurisdiction already applies to a number of serious offences under the Suppression of Terrorism Act 1978. Therefore, I should like to take this opportunity to clarify for the record what my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Extra-territorial jurisdiction covers all Council of Europe countries".--[Official Report, 14 December 1999; Vol. 341, c. 162.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In fact it covers only those countries that have been specifically designated by statutory instrument under the 1978 Act, following their ratification of the 1977 European convention on the suppression of terrorist bombings.
<P>
As I have said, the offences that we are considering under clause 60 will, of course, automatically attract universal jurisdiction. As more countries take action to meet their obligations under the terrorist bombings convention and other UN counter-terrorist conventions, so the underlying objective of international action--to deny terrorists refuge anywhere in the world if at all possible--comes a little closer to practical reality. Building up that infrastructure of international counter-terrorist law and, most important, ensuring effective   implementation by all participating states is, of course, a lengthy and difficult process, and, as most member of the Committee will agree, we as a country must continue to play a significant part in that process.
<P>
Adherence to the terrorist bombings convention and other UN counter-terrorist conventions is consistent with the United Kingdom's support for effective  international co-operation against terrorism. If we had wanted a reminder of the importance of that since we last met, the Stansted hijacking could not have illustrated it more clearly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury spoke about the problem of choosing between different forms of legislation. Extradition law and procedure is extremely complex. Most extradition cases involve accused rather than convicted persons. The best answer I can give is to emphasise that the normal preference would always be for extradition. Lord Lloyd said in his report that extraterritorial jurisdiction was always a second best. The Government share that view and although it is not possible to go into a detailed explanation of every conflict that could arise and every hypothesis here in Committee, I should like to place it on record that our normal preference would always be for extradition as the appropriate means of dealing with issues that arise.
<P>
The second question that the hon. Member for Aylesbury asked was about the meaning of article 8. The obligation under article 8 is to submit the individual for prosecution, but it would be for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether it was in the public interest to proceed. It is always difficult to prosecute in relation to acts committed abroad, but the interpretation that I place on the record here is our considered view. We believe that in passing the clause and the relevant new clauses, we are meeting in full our obligations under article 8 of the convention. The hon. Gentleman's third question related to rules of evidence. Normal evidentiary notes would apply to the decision to bring proceedings  in this country for a terrorist offence so the normal situation is not changed by the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) commended me for my studies in international law when I was an undergraduate. But I never studied international law. It is part of my general weakness in make-up that I did not study law as a whole and it makes me an inadequate person, but I have been advised by people who are well versed in these things and I hope that I can answer the hon. Gentleman's questions. First, he asked whether there would be a greater bringing together of the legislation on all the different processes. The answer is fundamentally yes. Procedures are similar in relation to the European convention on extradition. There are differences in relation to some states where extradition may be dealt with in a different way, but the differences are not significant. Basically we are, in the way he described, moving steadily towards a more coherent and positive position. We are seeking to achieve similar jurisdiction legislation across the different legal systems. That is the purpose of the UN convention itself and the reason why we have signed it and encourage others to do the same. However, as the hon. Gentleman knows better than I do--I mean that quite seriously--there are different systems in different countries. The constant effort is to bring them together, but we are not there in every respect.
<P>
I think that I have dealt with the point that the hon. Gentleman raised about extradition. Jurisdiction depends simply on whether the person in question is to be found in the United Kingdom. If a person is here, he or she can be extradited, prosecuted here and dealt with or released. That is the process. On the question of unilateral or collective decisions, decisions should be taken collectively, not unilaterally as the hon. Gentleman suggested. The authorities here must still decide whether to prosecute. The normal evidential standards will apply. There is not a collective process whereby we all agree that an action should take place in this country. That is the same for every other country. Obviously, the general point that the hon. Gentleman makes is political. In matters of this kind, the more there can be collective agreement about how to proceed, the better. I understand that point, but legally the position is, and should be, that decisions are taken in this country explicitly for that reason.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government new clause 8--Terrorist finance: jurisdiction--and Government new clause 9--Terrorist bombing and finance: extradition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> On Tuesday, when I moved the motion to amend the order of consideration, I explained the technical reasons why the Government had decided to combine in new clause 9 the minor changes to our extradition legislation that flow from the United Kingdom's signature of two recent United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. I was grateful for the Committee's understanding in that regard. Clause 61 is now incorporated in new clause 9, which we shall debate shortly, so I intend to propose that 61 as drafted should not stand part of the Bill, but should be replaced by new clauses 8 and 9.
<P>
New clause 8 makes it an offence for a person to do anything outside the United Kingdom which, if done in the UK, would have constituted the commission of an offence under clauses 14 to 17. The effect will be to extend extraterritorial jurisdiction over the part III terrorist property offences--relating to fundraising, use and possession, funding arrangements and money laundering--referred to in subsection (1)(b) of the new clause. That extension of extraterritoriality, which essentially applies universal jurisdiction over those offences, together with the changes to the Extradition Act 1989 in new clause 9, will enable the UK in due course to ratify the international convention for the suppression of terrorist financing, which the UN General Assembly adopted on 9 December 1999. The UK signed when the convention opened for signature on 10 January this year. That is an important new development.
<P>
New clause 9 is primarily designed to ensure that when there are no existing extradition arrangements between the UK and a state that is party to the terrorist bombings convention or the terrorist finance convention, those conventions can themselves be regarded as such an arrangement for the purpose of applying extradition legislation--by Order in Council--to the convention offences. That is necessary for the UK to meet its obligations under the two conventions, and thus to be able to ratify them in due course.
<P>
I therefore commend Government new clauses 8 and 9 and recommend that clause 61 do not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
The Chairman: The position is that new clauses 8 and 9 are merely being debated now and will be moved a little later in our proceedings.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 60 disagreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following: New clause 1--Annual report--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'.--(1)The Secretary of State shall present to Parliament every twelve months a report on the operation and effectiveness in the preceding year of the provisions of the Act.

<P>
(2) The Secretary of State shall lay the annual review of the provisions of this Act before each House of Parliament.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The new clause is an example of how the new Labour Government listen carefully to opinion from a wide range of sources. We have dropped any idea of steamrollering the legislation through Parliament and taken seriously the views of both official and the unofficial Opposition.
<P>
Several hon. Members said on Second Reading that it was important that there be a proper means of regularly reporting to Parliament on how the legislation is operating. Having thought carefully about the arguments made in that debate, we felt that they had substance and should be taken seriously. That is why we have tabled new clause 7. We believe that the issues that have been raised consistently in this Committee, particularly by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but also by others concerning the need to examine how these measures are used ought appropriately to be debated by Parliament at least annually. That is why we tabled the new clause. I hope that it will win the Committee's support.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am pleased that the Government have listened and introduced the new clause, which meets many of the concerns expressed by my right hon. and hon. Friends, by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and his colleagues, and many Government Members who spoke on Second Reading. I welcome the minister's assurance that, although the new clause does not make explicit provision for annual debate, the Government intent that Parliament should have the opportunity to debate annually the report that will be produced.
<P>
Successive Governments' ability to examine dispassionately how counter-terrorist legislation has worked and been greatly enhanced by independent people being employed to examine and report to Ministers on the progress of such matters. I do not mean in the least to impugn the integrity of members of law enforcement agencies or officials in the Home Office and Northern Ireland Office who are engaged day to day in making policy and implementing  counter-terrorist measures. In the past, men such as Mr. Rowe and Viscount Colville have cast a fresh eye on the problems and benefits of counter-terrorist legislation and given Ministers a valuable independent assessment.
<P>
I accept the reasons for not including such a provision in the Bill. However, I hope that the Government are minded to continue the tradition of employing the services of independent assessors, which has helped to ensure the quality of regular reviews of Government decisions and amendments to legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We welcome the Government's new clause, as far as it goes. We are debating process of review and there are three options on the menu. The Government, whose proposal is the least specific and most minimal, require a report every 12 months; the hon. Member for Aylesbury would add that someone should be appointed to carry out the review, continuing a useful tradition under successive Governments; my hon. Friends and I have tabled a slightly more specific proposal in new clause 1.
<P>
Colleagues who are aware of the history of such matters will know that such a report provides the terms of reference in the current review procedure. Discussing emergency powers, Mr. Rowe's report on the preceding year states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is a report of my review of the PTA...for the year 1998. It is intended to assist Parliament when the renewal of the Act is debated: by section 27 the PTA expires at the end of one year unless it is continued by an order made by statutory instrument, and each year Parliament debates that renewal. The task I have to consider whether there is a need for the Act to continue for a further year and whether its provisions have been used fairly and carefully in the past year.
<P>
Those are my terms of reference, and they may be found in the letters of the Secretaries of State to my predecessor, His Honour Judge Viscount Colville of Culross QC, and to myself. They are also to be found in the Official Report of the House of Lords debate of 8 March 1984, which clearly shows what Parliament intended when the post of reviewer was first established. The reviewer should make detailed enquiries of people who use the Act, or are affected by it, and that may mean seeing sensitive material."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He sets out clearly the basis on which he and his predecessor were appointed and it forms the basis of the new clause. I hope that Ministers will therefore be sympathetic towards it. I guess--I do not know for certain--that the phrase that the Government have included in their new clause is the standard form seen in many other pieces of legislation to require the publication of an annual review. To that extent, it is an obvious starting point. I welcome and understand it. I ask the Minister to go a little further because there is merit in continuing a system that has worked well and has the confidence of Parliament. It is much more valid and credible that someone of authority, independence and integrity should do the work than that a review should simply come out of a Government Department, whichever party is in power.
<P>
We must try to define the two purposes of the review. One of the purposes is to look back at the previous year to see whether there has been fair, careful and appropriate use of the legislation. That comes in part VIII of the Bill. The other purpose, which we shall debate in a moment, it to decide whether the legislation should be renewable and reviewable or whether it should be fixed in stone and amended only by new primary legislation.
<P>
One of the arguments for a more effective new clause, if the Government do not accept the argument that we shall debate next, is that there should be a reviewable procedure. If the legislation is permanent and not subject to annual or parliamentary renewal, it is even more important that there should be a proper and effective annual reporting procedure. They are no alternatives in my book. Our new clause is not an acceptable alternative to renewability and reviewability of the Act as a whole. None the less, it will be a benefit if we can tie it to the tried and tested successful procedure of a comprehensive but specific review.
<P>
It would be helpful to have the terms of reference established. Mr. Rowe and his predecessors made it clear that they had set up a consultation process so the Government have a well-established practice and it will be helpful to know what form of consultation is envisaged. I hope that the Government will accept that the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Aylesbury and my new clause are improvements on the Government new clause. If they consider it sympathetically on Report, or at the latest in another place, they will find that there is not much between the hon. Gentleman and me. We could perhaps come to a common view after the Committee and suggest something to the Minister that might best continue the current good practice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Opposition Members have made helpful contributions and we welcome the enthusiasm with which they view the Government's decision to review our position.
<P>
On the specifics, I can confirm that we expect the report to be compiled by an independent reviewer, as with the current non-statutory review. I agree with the observations made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the contribution of people such as Mr. Rowe and Lord Colville. It is our intention that this review process should operate in the same way.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey on consultation, we think that it is for the reviewer to decide on the appropriate consultation process. Given the reviewer's independence, it is important that he or she decides independently on the best way in which to operate. Again, however, I note that the decisions on these matters that have been taken by individuals such as Mr. Rowe and Lord Colville have been constructive and positive. I am sure that they will offer guidance to the reviewer who is appointed.
<P>
On the question of an annual debate, new clause 7 will require an annual report setting out the situation in full for everyone to read and understand. How Parliament deals with that report is, rightly, a matter for Parliament. I draw the Committee's attention to the existence of the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Intelligence and Security Committee; they may or may not decide to consider the matter on the basis of current events. Whether we have an annual debate in Parliament is, under the parliamentary conventions with which we are familiar, a matter for the business managers and not for me. The new clause does not specifically require that such a debate should take place every year. The form of the debate that takes place will be a matter for Parliament at the time.
<P>
I have two points to make in response to what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said about his new clause. First, new clause 1(2), which specifies that the first report must be laid a year after the Bill comes into force, is redundant--there is no need for it to appear in the Bill. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the first report will be presented 12 months after the Bill is fully in force, as new clause 7 stipulates intends.
<P>
Secondly, subsection (1) would both narrow and widen the conduct of the review once it was required to assess the effectiveness of the legislation. It would narrow it because the wording of new clause 7 on the working of the Act is general, allowing the independent reviewer to decide on the way in which he or she wants to make a report. It can include all matters. On the other hand, it would widen it in the sense of the reviewer seeing sensitive material, as the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
It is important that the Secretary of State of the time makes a judgment as to how effectively or otherwise the legislation has operated. That is principally a matter for the Executive to consider, although of course the reviewer may comment on that. The reviewer's independence should give some assurance to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that matters will be considered effectively and comprehensively. However, it is not right to set up a statutory procedure to second guess the Secretary of State on how effectively the legislation is operating. It is simply not feasible to review the Secretary of State's decisions across a range of matters with all the data that is available to him. I therefore resist the suggestion that we should set that out in law.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees to new clause 7 and rejects new clauses 1 and 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I accept the point that the Minister made about the second part of new clause 1--it seems to be adequately answered by his assurance that the Government intend to lay the first report 12 months after the Bill becomes law. The hon. Member for Aylesbury and I can reflect on the rest of the Minister's response and, if necessary, pursue those matters later.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time. I hope that all Committee Members will be sympathetic to the new clause, which is probably the most important amendment that I have moved in this Committee. It has certainly aroused considerable interest outside the Committee and encapsulates many concerns.
<P>
New Clause 2 would require that, once enacted, the Bill should survive for a Parliament, but undergo renewal after five years. It would allow the Secretary of State three options, stating that he may provide 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that a provision of this Act...shall continue in force for"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a further five years; or that a part of the Act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall cease to have effect;"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or that a part of the Act that is not in force shall come into force for five years.
<P>
That would be a parliamentary process to be debated by both Houses and would bring parliamentary scrutiny to new UK-wide legislation on emergency powers. The Government have built in an annual review for Northern Ireland legislation for the next five years, continuing the current practice. We welcome that. Indeed, the Government's approach  is supported by Members of all parties in the Committee. We hope that there will be a phased and considered approach to part VII of the Bill. Of course, the Bill goes wider than that. I shall not detain Committee members, but I remind them how we arrived at the present position.
<P>
Lord Lloyd argued in his report that there was a continuing need for permanent legislation. That phrase is slightly ambiguous, as the overall tenor of his report suggests that legislation may need to be amended. Indeed, Lord Lloyd considered whether other matters should be added to legislation at a later date. He reflected that the original legislation was introduced in the 1970s against a background of work that had been done on what might be needed, so contingency powers were always in reserve.
<P>
In Chapter 8 of volume two of Lord Lloyd's report, Paul Wilkinson, a highly respected and reputable authority on international terrorism, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Special powers to deal with a terrorist emergency should only be introduced as a last resort, when it is quite clear that the normal law is inadequate to protect the public. If such powers are used they must be approved by the legislature for a fixed and limited period,  subject to the legislature's right to revoke or renew the powers, should circumstances require. Special powers of this kind should be carefully drafted and held in reserve in case circumstances require them. If these are introduced they should be administered impartially and rescinded as soon as they are no longer needed."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I understand it, he is arguing that there should be special powers, but that as a general principle, they should obtain for a limited period.
<P>
Clive Walker, another professor who took part in the debate, made a point that was more similar to Lord Lloyd's than to Paul Wilkinson's. He said that we should have permanent legislation, but with the ability to alter or expand it if there was an additional emergency, so there should be reserve powers as well. He also recommended that a standing committee should oversee the use and operation of those powers.
<P>
We must remember that the extension of power in the Bill, though not hugely controversial in the Committee is certainly controversial outside it. Of the 57 responses to the Government's consultation paper, 28 expressed significant concerns about the new definition of terrorism. it was argued that it was too wide, too restrictive on the media or that the Government should have stuck to Lord Lloyd's proposal, which they have, of course, gone beyond. Forty four of those who responded were not wholly convinced yet we are to enshrine the new definition of terrorism in permanent legislation. There were 23 responses to the question whether the definition should include domestic terrorism--as I have certainly accepted that it should--of which 13 were that it should not.
<P>
It is interesting that, although the Government assert in paragraph 3 of the consultation paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Lord Lloyd concluded that there would be a continuing need for permanent United Kingdom-wide legislation",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and go on to agree with him that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there will be a continuing need for counter-terrorist legislation for the foreseeable future",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
none the less the consultation process did not include a specific question about whether that should be permanent or temporary legislation. People were not asked to address that; the Government took it as a given. One of the reasons why it is important is that a large number of people reasonably think that we as a country should not move in one step from exceptional legislation that is renewed annually to permanent legislation that is never reviewed.
<P>
The new clause is cautious. it suggests not an annual renewal process but a once-in-a-Parliament renewal process, which is intended to be a more measured, more considered way of proceeding. When I took over my current role, I persuaded my party that we should have comprehensive, UK-wide legislation, but I argued from the beginning that it should be renewable once a Parliament. The benefit of the review process is either to narrow or to widen the legislation--by definition it gives that option. I have been here long enough to realise that we rush into legislation, as we did in September 1998, often we do not do it well. A considered, regular review process would be far better than the Government suddenly saying, at short notice, that as a result of a hijacking or bombing or some information from abroad, there ought to be an amendment to terrorist legislation. A considered, careful and regular review strikes me as by far the better option.
<P>
One of the things that we do not know is how the legislation will work out. A periodic opportunity to add, take away, continue or repeal legislation would enable us to consider our experience in the context of, for instance, our domestic prosecution and conviction rates--which the Committee has already considered--whether the Bill has had foreseen or unforeseen consequences and whether it has been effective or ineffective. One of themes of the debate is that the nature of terrorism changes. We all accept that. It is another strong argument for saying that we may need to return to the legislation periodically. Rather than do so in an unplanned, unmeasured way, let us prepare for that now.
<P>
Just as later in this parliamentary session we shall debate electronic surveillance and interception of communications because the technology has changed, we should anticipate the changing nature of the terrorist threat and terrorist activity and give ourselves the opportunity to reflect on it in a considered and measured way which Parliament would be glad to do. We could then have the wisdom of people in both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
Since 1974, the two pieces of terrorism legislation have been the subject of a derogation under the European convention. We have been able to get away with emergency powers only because of that derogation. The Minister told us that the Bill, as a whole, complied with European convention and my understanding is that derogation to permanent legislation is not possible. Therefore there will not be a derogation so it is more likely that the Bill can be challenged simply because it is not exempt from challenge in the normal way, whether under our domestic jurisdiction as from 2 October or, if it gets through the system, before the Commission and the court in Strasbourg. If that is the case, it is another reason for making sure that we have the opportunity to come back.
<P>
Like other members of the Committee, I am a lawyer, although I no longer practice, but I have no desire to produce more work for lawyers. I went to a seminar held by the Administrative Law Bar Association on Saturday at which I was a member of the panel in the afternoon. A huge amount of litigation is expected once the Human Rights Act 1998 becomes law. It was interesting to hear people such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, Treasury counsel, senior practitioners who act for the Government at the European court on a regular basis, a High Court judge who was chairing the proceedings and others talking about the phenomenal change that will alter our legislative and court system.
<P>
We are highly likely to have cases relating to this Bill going through our domestic courts and being determined by the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords Judicial Committee let alone by the courts in Strasbourg. It is therefore seems highly desirable to give ourselves the opportunity to reflect on exactly what the impact of the legislation will be. Otherwise, every time there is likely to be a ruling against us, we will have to amend the legislation. It would be far better and the Government would be in a far more secure position if they could tell our domestic and the international courts that there is a review process and that the Act will have power for five years and will lapse unless renewed. It can be amended at that stage. That will allow the Government much more flexibility when they are trying to defend a permanent piece of legislation in which almost the only variables are things like the lists of proscribed organisations that obviously need orders in both Houses to pass.
<P>
We have debated serious changes. People sometimes fail to see the wood from the trees because first, this measure would allow proscription to apply to any number of organisations, provided that they met the criteria of being UK-wide or international. The Government have said that they have no plans at the moment to add UK-wide organisations, but that they may consider putting international organisations in the list. Secondly, the measure gives the police exceptional powers, which go beyond the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Those powers have been justified up to now because we have a derogation from the European convention, but they may not be justified so easily if we have no derogation.
<P>
Thirdly, the measure changes the balance of evidence, although I do know whether the Minister and I would agree on that term. However, the burden of proof process would certainly move towards either statutory defence or reverse burden of proof, which are matters of major controversy.
<P>
Fourthly, there are already different views about compliance and the compatibility of various parts of the legislation; that is inevitable. There is a strong case for the Government to say, "It is right for us to have legislation against terrorism on the statute book, and that will be the case for the foreseeable future. However, the legislation should regularly be brought back to Parliament to be amended, and when the situation in Northern Ireland has changed it seems sensible to us to do that once in every Parliament rather than annually. If, as we hope, circumstances in Northern Ireland become more normal over the next five years, and the impact of Northern Ireland terrorism on the United Kingdom as a whole becomes less, the development from an annual renewal to a five-yearly renewal would be worth having."
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Government will be sympathetic the proposal, and that it will be considered in a measured way. There will surely be widespread support, both on the Floor of the House and in another place, for the idea that permanent legislation should not be on the statute book. It is better to consider the legislation, regularly and at leisure than to enact changes to the law in haste. I hope that the Minister and hon. Members will be sympathetic to a five-year annual renewal period.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> It is a sad reflection on the state of domestic affairs and international developments that powers that the previous Government originally took explicitly for a temporary duration should now be put on a permanent basis with cross-party support. However, the evidence in Lord Lloyd's report of the need for permanent counter-terrorist powers on the statute book is compelling.
<P>
I appreciate the principles behind the new clause moved by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He rightly draws our attention to the need for Parliament to continue to take an interest in and have a say in the shape of counter-terrorist legislation. The powers that we are giving to Ministers and, in a different respect, the police, are exceptional, and I will want to reflect carefully on the Minister's response to the debate.
<P>
I am not altogether sure whether the new clause will answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I identified two flaws in his argument. I share his scepticism about knee-jerk legislation produced in response to a high-profile outrage, but I suspect that his provisions would not prevent that. I remember sitting at a table in the Home Office a decade or more ago, after an especially appalling atrocity in Northern Ireland. The message came through clearly that Mrs. Thatcher, the then Prime Minister, wanted action to be taken, and action there had to be. I suspect that the momentum generated by public outrage, media attention and the will of the Prime Minister will continue to influence whatever arrangements for scrutiny or renewal we put on the statute book. The hon. Gentleman's new clause will not prevent that from happening again.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made another point that raised a query in my mind when he said, quite rightly, that we must be alert to changes in the technology available to terrorists and to changes in terrorist organisation and methods. The words that we put on the statute book in 2000 may not be appropriate in 2005 or 2006. The trouble with the hon. Gentleman's proposal is that it allows powers in the Bill to be continued, suspended or, under subsection (2)(c), to be revived only if they were suspended by statutory instrument. The hon. Gentleman does not propose a power to amend, yet amendment of legislation would surely be the appropriate response to changes in terrorist organisation, methods or weaponry of the sort to which he rightly drew attention. I see no means of amending the legislation other than taking primary legislation through both Houses of Parliament in the normal way. I am sure that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey would be the first to acknowledge that it was not appropriate to use secondary legislation to amend the draconian powers that we are rightly giving the authorities in respect of terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman has understood the point that the legislation cannot be amended by order, which is why my proposal relates to removal and renewal. The logic is that if the Government wanted to add things at the same time, we could consider everything together. Procedurally, the amendment to the legislation that the hon. Gentleman suggests cannot be achieved in one revoking or renewing process. Otherwise, I would have included it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, which is why I am not persuaded that the new clause is the appropriate way in which to handle the matter. I will reflect carefully on his arguments and those that the Minister will no doubt make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am glad that we are debating the matter. There are two substantive arguments for me to deal with--the need for permanent legislation and changing the legislation to meet changing circumstances. I will deal with the first issue first.
<P>
Lord Lloyd concluded, on page 12 of his report, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Once lasting peace has been established in Northern Ireland, there will continue to be a need for permanent counter-terrorist legislation to deal with the threat of international and domestic terrorism."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government accepted that central recommendation. As I said on Second Reading, that was on the basis of the continuing terrorist threat, especially as described by Professor Paul Wilkinson in appendix F to Lord Lloyd's report. I commend that appendix to anybody who asks whether there is a continuing threat.
<P>
In the consultation paper, "Legislation Against Terrorism", we said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government believes that there exists now a clear and present terrorist threat to the UK from a number of fronts and that a terrorist threat is likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future even when a lasting peace in Northern Ireland is achieved."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the fundamental point. To support it, I will read a couple of paragraphs from the report, which are important in this context. In paragraphs 1.20 and 1.21 on pages 4 and 5, Lord Lloyd wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"From my interviews with the police, the Security Service and other counter-terrorism specialists in the UK and overseas, I am convinced that it would be a mistake--indeed, that it would be folly--to assume that a few years of relative freedom from acts of international terrorism here meant that the threat had largely gone away. There are two reasons for that view.
<P>
First, to measure the threat merely in terms of the number of planned attacks which had been carried out in the UK would be to ignore the substantial effort which goes on, largely in secret, to avert such incidents. Evidence which I have seen and heard, though I cannot set it out here, persuades me that, although the immediate threat is low, international terrorist groups continue to seek opportunities to carry out attacks against UK interests, at home and abroad.
<P>
The second cause for caution is that developments in world politics and the changing nature of terrorism have made it difficult to predict what the future holds. Chapter 4 of Professor Wilkinson's report deals with some of these factors. Regional and national conflict which have generated terrorism or have the potential to do so will continue throughout the foreseeable future. The complex problems in the Middle East and North Africa will remain the most important factor, not least because of the pronounced anti-western position adopted by some of the parties involved. As the 'weapon of the weak', terrorism is likely to remain an attractive option to those engaged in regional power struggles, facilitated by the ever-increasing international freedom of people, of goods and of information. The UK, together with some other Western countries, is particularly liable to be caught up in these struggles because of the number of communities of foreign nationals who live, or seek sanctuary, here."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a compelling argument, reinforced by events at Stansted.
<P>
Temporary legislative provisions have been in force for 25 years. The time has come to face the sad but unescapable fact that terrorism is here to stay. We must be ready to deal with it in the foreseeable future and make powers permanently available, although, of course, that does not mean that they have to be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): This Committee has been mercifully free of partisanship, but I cannot let the moment pass without inviting the Minister to comment on the following matter. He said that temporary provisions had been in force for 25 years. Will he acknowledge that, for most of that time, when my party was in Government, his party did not support those provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly reasonable point. Voting records on the measures before the House and reasons for the decisions that were taken appear in the Hansard reports of the period. Study of speeches made by the Front-Bench spokesmen of the then Opposition would reveal that the issues addressed in those debates were different from those that we are considering today. At that time, the Labour party was trying to examine its perceptions of the balance of judgment--which the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. John M. Taylor) concedes is always involved in such matters--in order to assess how best to address the issue.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to draw attention to that long record in the spirit of political partisanship or for other reasons. I do not resent his doing that at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I may surprise the Minister with my support. However, one reason why people did not support the old legislation--I myself never voted for it--was that it contained an exclusion provision, which was discriminatory in relation to different parts of the country. In that context, while the Minister is reflecting on Professor Wilkinson's contribution, will he address its general principles, which clearly suggest that legislation is only part of the solution. He proposes temporary or reviewable legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Let me say what I was going to say before the hon. Member for Solihull intervened. In so doing, I shall add emphasis to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The Bill removes some of the more extreme powers that have been used in the past, specifically internment and exclusion orders, and introduces judicial extensions of detention. Therefore, the BIll is qualitatively different from previous measures and it is important that that is taken into account. Furthermore, the Human Rights Act 1998, which is an important new safeguard, will be fully implemented by the time that the Bill comes into force. I take Professor Wilkinson's point that legislation is only one part of the approach that we take in dealing with these modern threats, but that is not to say that it is not an important part.
<P>
I must rebut one point that was made, I think inadvertently, by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. In chapter 18 of his report, Lord Lloyd considered the option of switching on additional powers in times of great emergency, which is what the hon. Gentleman was referring to in his intervention. However Lord Lloyd was talking about really extreme powers such as Army powers, detention orders and the offence of failure to  disclose, which are not in the Bill. The Bill concerns permanent powers, for which Lord Lloyd saw a continuing need.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to issues of amendment. First, I want to put on record yet again what I said on Second Reading and what I have repeated several times in previous sittings: if a better definition of terrorism emerges, we are prepared to consider it. We have not seen one, but if we do, we will be prepared to consider it.
<P>
The whole purpose of the Bill is to avoid rush legislation and to move from a temporary situation to a permanent one. I hope that hon. Members would concede that we have had a considered debate about the issues; these provisions cannot be subject to the charge of being rushed through rapidly or ineffectively. We have set up the review process and we are now compliant with the European convention on human rights and therefore subject to possible judgments from the European Court of Human Rights. We have taken on board issues that could arise from changes in the use of legislation, in technology and in the international situation. In such circumstances, any Government would be foolish to say that they intended to consider the legislation   only once every five years.
<P>
The point of keeping the process under review is to consider situations as they arise. If a judgment is made against us by the European Court, for example, or some new threat emerges, we will consider it. We will not say, "Let us wait for five years to review the situation." With respect, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey did not make the most powerful argument for that. Indeed, we could not do that if there had been a judgment against us by the European Court of Human Rights. I do not accept that such judgments would be less likely if the Bill included such a provision. The Court would consider the issue on its merits and we would then decide how to deal with the situation.
<P>
I feel that the new clause would constrict Parliament rather than freeing it to look at the issues as they evolve, which is what we need to do. I ought to make it clear that unlike the soundbite politician who was Prime Minister when the hon. Member for Aylesbury worked in the Home Office, the current Prime Minister does not interfere in that way. He is cincerned not with quick soundbites, but with serious policy and the positive development of issues. Circumstances of the kind that the hon. Gentleman described could not arise under the current Government; what will arise is a serious  consideration of the issues and the relevant policies.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Is the Minister perhaps a disciple of Dr. Goebbels, who said, "If you're going to tell a lie, tell a whopper"?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> No, I am not, not even in a public relations sense. Of course, I defer to the hon. Member for Solihull whose soundbites in this Committee have been entertaining and positive, particularly on the subject of law. They have kept us all going.
<P>
Joking aside, we must keep the legislation under review and let Parliament decide whether changes are needed. The straitjacket of the new clause would not assist our consideration, so I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark , North and Bermondsey will not press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I was downstairs in the Chamber last night when there was an intervention on the Minister of State, Home Office, the right hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). It elicited from a colleague on the Bench behind me the observation that sarcasm may work orally, but it never works on the  record and does not appear in Hansard. I hope that those who read the previous exchange will realise that there was more than an element of sarcasm or irony in the Minister's reply to the  hon. Member for Solihull. I would not want the record to be misconstrued when future leadership prospects are assessed. Sometimes constructive criticism from the lower orders is a more helpful way in which to give ministerial support.
<P>
As with many of our debates, I have tabled some new clauses and amendments with the objective not of pressing them to a Division but of eliciting a response so that we can judge how to deal with matters.
<P>
The Minister was right to clarify the explanation of the Lord Lloyd point about reserve powers. I did not intent to misrepresent what was said. He was talking about additional, special powers being available in the cupboard, as it were, just as they were in the 1970s. However, even after my further invitation, the Minister did not entirely deal with the point that I made about Professor Wilkinson's contribution. I shall reread that submission and the annexe to the Lord Lloyd report, but my understanding, especially from chapter 8 of the Wilkinson contribution, is that he argued that, although we will need anti-terrorist legislation  in the foreseeable future, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is a serious error to regard any anti-terrorist legislation or special measures as a panacea for eradicating terrorism"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--the Minister rightly conceded that point--but that it is a tool in the box, a contribution. However, on pages 79 and 80, Wilkinson stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Special powers of this kind should be carefully drafted and held in reserve in case circumstances require them."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My understanding is that that should apply not only to the special Lord Lloyd powers but more generally. Although he accepted that there should be a United Kingdom-wide and permanent basis for terrorist legislation, he said that it was important to keep such matters under review.
<P>
Five years is a reasonable period for the review, and that suggestion has not been effectively countered. The exceptional powers have been reviewed yearly. Yearly reviews could continue, but if life becomes more settled and the domestic implication of terrorism is not so consistent, persistent and troubling as it has been, it would be good to have less frequent review period.
<P>
The annual report will be debated if business managers agree, but Members of Parliament will have no power to force a debate. The telling point is that when the powers under part VII and the annual review debate cease, the only debates guaranteed under the Bill will be those required by orders, such as those that add to, or subtract from, the list of proscribed organisations. That is not a proper guarantee that Parliament will have proper control over the Executive; all the power will remain with the Government. If the Government do not want to debate any change, Members of Parliament have no power under the Bill to force them to do so. That is a weakness.
<P>
The Minister said that if the Government need to react to events or to a judgment of the European Court, five years might be too long to wait, but some arguments against the legislation might be countered simply because it is subject to review and has to be renewed. Such legislation is not permanently on the statute book. People could argue in court that the measure is not legislation and, therefore, that it does not have the same civil rights implications as permanent statutes.
<P>
I hope that my facts are right, but when the age of consent case was taken the European Commission and the European Court, a settlement was reached with the European Court under which the Government agreed to legislate at the next convenient opportunity to deal with the discrimination found by the Commission. Therefore, under the Bill, the prosecutions which we discussed the other day require decisions to be taken by the DPP, a Government law officer or independent director of prosecutions in each of the four countries in the United Kingdom.
<P>
As the Minister knows, in the past there was often no prosecution and that would have been the position after the Strasbourg agreement on the age of consent case. If legislation was not compliant, it was agreed that it would not be taken up by the prosecuting authorities. I accept the Minister's point, but there are ways of dealing with the matter. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury pointed out, there is no comfortable way of amending, renewing or deleting legislation in a single clause or amendment. However, I shall talk to the Clerks and colleagues about that procedural matter. Two things should work simultaneously, and that may involve tying in a review of the Government new clause with a review of Conservative and Liberal Democrat new clauses on the annual review procedure.
<P>
There may be ways of tackling the problem of the five-year review period. Previously, I thought that a review once every Parliament was logical and not overly frequent. However, it is not sufficiently frequent given the changing nature of terrorism and the nature of the annual report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his amendment concerns process, not substance, and that that is an inappropriate way of tackling such a critical issue? We have been trying to address the substance of circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that, but do not accept the Minister's view. Process is a way of getting into the debate about substance. I accept the proposition that we are likely to need legislation on terrorism for the foreseeable future. However, should we legislate for ever, and review measures only on the instigation of a Government who may sometimes--given the history--act in haste? On the other hand, should we build in a process that allows us to consider and deliberate? There may be several ways of achieving the latter, but Parliament must ensure that there is effective legislation to deal with and counter terrorism, and that civil liberties are not undermined, taken away or devalued by legislation granting exceptional powers. There is not much between us on substance, but we are discussing mechanisms as a way of getting into the debate on substance.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and the Border): I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. If, however, in the near future, terrorism no longer existed, there would be no mechanism to trigger the Bill and no harm in having it. It would fall into desuetude, like those Acts which imposed draconian penalties on horse-drawn carriages without carbide lights. Once history has moved on, there will be no harm having a law which will not be implemented because there will be no need for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I accept that. However, one could argue that we should proceed cautiously in moving from an annual review of emergency powers to a position in which there is no opportunity for review at all. We should review that position at least once in the near future to make sure that we have got it right, which may lessen the difference between the right hon. Gentleman and me. After that there will be a less strong argument for reviewing it all the time. I understand the Minister's point, but I still think that we should bring this back in the near future and that Parliament should be able to do so. The only way we can do that is by including a provision in the Bill. We have rehearsed the arguments, and the record will show that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> May I take the opportunity of this final point of debate to express my personal thanks to you, Mr. Malins, for the way in which you have conducted the Committee, to your colleague the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) for the way in which he conducted the Committee when you sadly could not be with us, and to the Committee as a whole. The spirit of the discussion has been full, direct and open. I pay particular tribute to the hon. Members for Aylesbury, for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), who led for their parties, for the open and direct way in which these matters have been discussed.
<P>
I should also like to thank my hon. Friends who have shown great forbearance, and have made outstanding contributions to the Committee. I should like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for east Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office for dealing with his responsibilities. All members of the committee have behaved in a way that has given credit to Parliament and the House. I should also like to thank the officials from the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office who have worked exceptionally hard, both to help the Government spokespeople in Committee and to make sure that the various pieces of information that hon. Members have requested from time to time have been made available to them as rapidly as possible. I should like to thank them for their work. Finally, I should like to thank the Clerk and his team who have ensured that we have all understood issues as they have moved along. Can I take this opportunity to thank you again, Mr. Malins, and to thank everyone for a positive Committee stage.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I associate myself with the compliments that the Minister has just paid to you, Mr. Malins, to Mr. Stevenson, to our Committee Clerk and to officials from the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office. Our thanks are also due, as always, to the Hansard writers, the members of the House of Commons staff, the police service and the badge messengers who have helped to ensure that our proceedings have gone along in an orderly fashion.
<P>
I should like to return the compliment to the Minister by saying that I have very much appreciated the way in which all members of the Committee have approached a subject that is so important that it merits a measure of bipartisanship. Where there has been disagreement, it has on the whole, been expressed in a measured fashion. The Minister, with the support of his officials, has sought to reply fully to the Committee's concerns about the detail of the Bill.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister has thanked his staff and members of the Committee and so has my hon. Friend. I have a slightly different point to make which probably only one of the old Back Benchers can make. The Minister was generous in his thanks to the staff, but I hope that he will not, as a member of a reforming Government, abolish the custom and tradition of thanking his staff in a more tangible form in due course. One hopes that as the Bill proceeds through the House and other place, a time may come--perhaps when the Bill receives Royal Assent in May or June--when the Minister wishes to thank those on his Bill team, his lawyers and those from the Northern Ireland Office who have helped him and supplied him with information. I want to help the Minister with the potential political difficulty that he faces.
<P>
He will not wish to fall into the same trap as the hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Jack Cunningham) by giving over-lavish hospitality--clearly, the Minister cannot take his staff on Concorde trips around the world--but he may wish to hold a soire with a modest amount of refreshment. In those circumstances, one would not want the Public Accounts Committee querying whether the Minister had been partial in issuing invitations. I suspect that if he were to invite others along with his staff--yourself, for example, Mr. Malins--there could be no criticism whatever that he was favouring his own staff by spending a modest amount of public money on a suitable thank you. To give him even better cover--as this has been a non-partisan Committee--if the Minister were to extend an invitation to his hon. Friends and Opposition Members who have assisted him, there could be no criticism of him at all. I am sure that you would accept an invitation, Mr Malins, should one be forthcoming.<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have served on many Committees, but--following the final point made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean)--there were broader invitations to the end-of-Committee celebrations for some than for others. I am sure that the Minister will follow the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion. I watched the second part of "Blair's Thousand Days" on Sunday--although the title was somewhat unsuitable because the programme was no more about Blair's 1,000 days than about flying--and noticed that although there was a decent celebration after the passage of the House of Lords Bill, it was an entirely partisan occasion.
<P>
I want to add my thanks to the Minister's team--if I can single them out--for their speedy response to our inquiries. I have not checked, but I guess that  very nearly  all the items that we requested have been delivered. If there are outstanding matters, I am sure that they will be forthcoming. Both Ministers were extremely collaborative and co-operative in their handling of difficult issues. We all understand that there is a difficult balance of interests to be struck. My thanks also go to you, Mr. Malins, and your colleague, and to colleagues on the Committee.
<P>
As Committee members will know, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) was not very well last week. Although I understand that he is now recovering, he has not been in the best of health since he felt unwell in Thursday morning's sitting. That is why he has not been with us for our final sitting. We wish him all the best and a speedy recovery.<P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should like to say thank you, on behalf of my co-Chairman and myself, to those who have been of such help to us: the police, the doorkeepers, Hansard, the officials who work so hard and, in particular, Mr. Fox, the learned Clerk, who has kept me on the straight and narrow. Hon. Members will have no idea how difficult it is to follow some of these matters. Without my Clerk, anything could have happened. I also want to thank the Ministers and the Front-Bench spokesmen for their  excellent contributions. This has been a serious and thoughtful Committee to which everyone has contributed well. A word, too, to Back-Bench Members, who have also contributed. In my experience--although never on this Committee--Government Whips sometimes discourage Back-Bench Members from speaking. When I walked in to serve on my first Standing Committee 15 years ago, I was told to sit in my place for 170 hours without  speaking. In contrast, the contributions to this Committee from Back-Bench Members have been excellent throughout.
<P>
It has been a privilege to chair the Committee, which has been one of the most thoughtful, serious and good-humoured Committees that I have known.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
