Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): When we broke for lunch,
we had started our debate on amendment 2. In some respects,
there is an overlap with the previous debate and the ability to take
samples from someone who has been arrested. The amendment seeks to add
a new provision, so that the power under section 2(1) in relation to
fingerprinting should be exercised no later than</div>
<a name="10020289000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;six months from
the date of arrest or if earlier the date that it was decided that no
further action would be taken in connection with the events or
circumstances which led to the arrest.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020289000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It follows on
from the previous debate, in that we need to understand the ability of
police officers to take samples from someone who has simply been
arrested. The language of clause 2 seems to be open ended. The Minister
gave only a brief response on the previous group of amendments, which
covered a similar point, so it is important for us to understand how
the process works. Similarly, clause 2(4) on non-intimate samples seems
to be without time limit.</div>
<a name="10020289000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I alighted on
a period of six months in the amendment because I understand that,
because of internal requirements, the Crown Prosecution Service
normally takes up  to six months to decide whether to charge
someone  who has been arrested in relation to particular facts
or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>circumstances. I question whether that is an appropriate time limit for
allowing DNA samples to be taken following arrest. In other words, it
should not be some sort of open-ended period. We should alight on
something reasonable and appropriate, hence my reason for using the
amendment&#151;to probe the Government on some of the detail and to
find out whether six months might be an appropriate
limit.</div><a name="10020289000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would seem perverse to have an unlimited power to take the fingerprints
of those arrested for, but never charged with or convicted of, an
offence, beyond any agreed retention period in relation to DNA samples
if taken at the outset. In the previous debate, I sought to make the
argument that there is a distinction between persons who have been
convicted, persons who have been charged and persons who have been
arrested.</div>
<a name="10020289000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that there was some response, albeit rather swift, prior to lunch. It
would help if the Minister said why the Bill seems not to include a
specific time limit, similar to that in relation to other provisions,
on the specific point of persons who have been arrested and the ability
of the police to take samples from them.</div>
<a name="10020289000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020289000366"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): This is
only a drafting point. I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend the
Member for Hornchurch has said, but there is another category of
situation in which time could be relevant, and that is when a trial has
not taken place but there has been no decision to discontinue. In other
words, the prosecution authorities have made the arrest, but have not
taken the matter to trial or, in fact, have decided not to have a
trial; they are still pondering whether there should be a trial and/or
gathering evidence or whatever. That is an additional category to the
one mentioned by my hon. Friend, and perhaps it should be reflected in
the approach that he takes to the imposition of time
limits.</div><a name="10020289000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000367"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> Amendments 2, 4, 12 and 14, which have been
tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, would place limitations on
new and existing powers in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to
take DNA samples and fingerprints from people who have been arrested or
charged with an
offence.</div><a name="10020289000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Committee knows, clause 2 will allow the police to take
fingerprints and non-intimate DNA samples from people who have been
arrested for a recordable offence and subsequently released&#151;this
is the crucial point&#151;either while they are still on bail and
their fingerprints or sample have not already been taken, or if the
initial fingerprints or samples taken have proved inadequate for
analysis. The amendments would prevent the police in England and
Wales&#151;there are corresponding amendments to clause 8 for
Northern Ireland&#151;from taking fingerprints or samples in such
circumstances any later than six months after the date of the arrest or
earlier.</div><a name="10020289000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that this is a straightforward point. I happen to believe that if
there is an ongoing investigation, as is the case if a person is on
bail or if the police wish to have a further analysis of the samples,
the police should be able to take fingerprints or samples from a person
after they have been released from custody, even more than six months
after the initial arrest. I am of the view, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>and it is debatable, that new evidence might come to light and that
there might be a need for further investigation. Fingerprints or
samples might be required from the person in order to prove or disprove
their involvement in a particular offence. Therefore, there are
reasonable grounds for the power to be
enacted.</div><a name="10020289000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
6 already limits the power of the police to require a person to attend
a police station for the purpose of having their fingerprints or sample
taken. I therefore believe that the changes in the Bill are adequate. I
cannot offer any further explanation, so I hope that that is
satisfactory for right hon. and hon.
Members.</div><a name="10020289000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000368"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister of State for
that clarification. He highlighted the two limbs and said that,
obviously, one of the factors was whether the samples taken had been
inadequate. This is something that will come up for other provisions in
the Bill. I do not know whether he is able to do so immediately, but
can he give the Committee any insight on the frequency with which
repeat samples are taken&#151;for example, when a sample has been
taken but it is not possible to create a profile from it? It would be
helpful to understand whether that is a common issue or the exception
to the rule, if I may characterise it like
that.</div><a name="10020289000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000369"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts that I cannot
give him the figures or the frequency at the moment, but I will
certainly look at the issue and write to him, and, if you feel that it
is necessary, Mr. Cook, I will copy in other members of the
Committee. If the matter is still of concern, it can be returned to in
another place or at a different stage of the
legislation.</div><a name="10020289000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000370"></a>The

Brokenshire.</div><a name="10020289000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000371"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am sorry, Mr. Cook, I did not
want to rise until you called
me.</div><a name="10020289000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Minister of State for his clarification of those
points. However, it would aid our better understanding of the clause
and the amendments if we understood whether samples were required more
than once and with what frequency. None the less, in the light of his
comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="10020289000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="10020289000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000372"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Perhaps I can offer some clarification. It is
important that all members of the Committee who seek to take the Floor
should stand up, so that I know when they want to speak; otherwise, you
will fail to catch my eye. You stand first and you are called second.
We understand that, don&#146;t we?</div>
<a name="10020289000045"></a>

Brokenshire:</b> We do.</div>
<a name="10020289000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000374"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good.</div>
<a name="10020289000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000375"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 3, in
clause 2, page 2, line 41, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;provided that the
power under this subsection may not be exercised if the person has been

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000376"></a>The

following: amendment 5, in clause 2, page 4,
line 7, at end insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;provided that the power under this
subsection may not be exercised if the person has been acquitted of the

end insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;provided that the
power under this paragraph may not be exercised if the person has been
acquitted of the offence or the relevant charges have been
withdrawn.&#146;.</div><a name="10020289000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000377"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We come to what could be described as a
further, parallel amendment. The amendment provides that</div>
<a name="10020289000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the power under
this subsection may not be exercised if the person has been acquitted
of the offence or the relevant charges have been
withdrawn.&#148;</div><a name="10020289000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have debated the use of the power in relation to those who have been
convicted of an offence and, under the last group of amendments, those
who have been arrested. The present amendments deal with the right to
go back and take samples when someone has been charged with an
offence.</div>
<a name="10020289000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is intended to test Government thinking about the extent to which there
should be the right to go back if someone has been acquitted of an
offence or the charges against them have been dropped. At that stage,
it would be open to someone to ask why the police should come back when
no charges are extant against them. The authorities had a clear
opportunity to take DNA examples and fingerprints, so what is the
justification, now that the person has been acquitted or had the
charges against them dropped, for saying that the police can require
them to submit fingerprints or a sample? The purpose of the amendment
is to test the thinking and logic behind the belief that it is
appropriate to cover such an eventuality.</div>
<a name="10020289000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is also intended to look at the cumulative impact of the three cases
that I mentioned&#151;conviction, arrest and charge&#151;and to
make it clear that when one falls away, the others will also fall away;
in other words, we should not continually be coming back to a person.
That comes back to the point that we made in the previous debate about
someone who has been arrested and charged, but who is then acquitted or
who has the charges against them dropped. Again, why should a sample be
submitted at that point?</div>
<a name="10020289000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to understand why the provisions are necessary in the context
of the clause. The relevant supervising officer can require their
utilisation
when</div><a name="10020289000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taking
the fingerprints is necessary to assist in the prevention or detection
of
crime.&#148;</div><a name="10020289000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is quite wide ranging and open and seems to permit what might be
described as simple recall exercise. The police might want to recall
someone who was previously charged because they did not take a sample
at the time and they want to take one now, even though the person is
innocent of any charges at that stage and would, in all other
circumstances, be regarded as a free person.</div>
<a name="10020289000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
probe the Minister on the safeguards that may be required. Is there any
potential to push the envelope? As we debated previously, the case can
be made much more clearly and effectively in relation to persons who
have been convicted. However, I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>appreciate hearing from the Minister why it is felt necessary to cover
the eventuality of people who have been acquitted or whose charges have
been
dropped.</div><a name="10020289000336"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000378"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I rise again to support my hon. Friend, but I have
two suggestions for drafting amendments, so that if the Bill proceeds
to the House or another place and Conservative Members table amendments
in such terms, my hon. Friend might reflect on my
suggestions.</div><a name="10020289000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
3 would
insert</div><a name="10020289000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provided
that the power under this subsection may not be exercised if the person
has been acquitted of the offence or the relevant charges have been
withdrawn.&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="10020289000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as it goes, that is perfectly clear, but a situation could well
arise in which someone has been convicted of a related offence in the
same trial. One should contemplate what the drafting impact would be.
It is only a drafting point, but my hon. Friend might care to reflect
on it. Conversely&#151;if the person has been acquitted of the
offence or a related offence&#151;it is quite possible for somebody
to be charged with offence A but tried for a slightly different offence
and acquitted of it, because alternative verdicts are available. My
hon. Friend&#146;s drafting would not take full account of that. It
is only a drafting point, but Committee is for
drafting.</div><a name="10020289000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other point is also a drafting point. My hon. Friend is, rightly,
saying in effect to the Committee that the power to take samples,
specimens or fingerprints should expire on two crystallised events: an
acquittal or a decision to withdraw. However, there is a third
situation, to which I alluded in the previous short debate. There might
be no trial and no decision to withdraw; instead, there might be a
period of further reflection, examination and inquiry into evidence. In
other words, the case might not be left in limbo, but the decision
whether to try might be held in suspension while further investigations
are made. My hon. Friend should also address that third
situation.</div><a name="10020289000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I have in mind&#151;I am drafting on my feet&#151;is that if
neither an acquittal nor a decision to withdraw applies, the power to
take fingerprints should not be exercised at the expiration of 12
months, or any period we like, from the date of the arrest. In other
words, we ought to contemplate the situation of suspension and provide
an end date beyond which fingerprints should not be taken. Again, it is
a drafting point, but what  are we here for if not to try to
improve the language of the
Bill?</div><a name="10020289000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000379"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The answer is simple. As drafted, the amendments
would mean that if a decision not to proceed were taken, it would be
impossible for us  to return for a viable set of DNA samples
from an original that proved inadequate for analysis. I accept that
there are few circumstances in which that would be the case, but there
might be occasions where a sample does not prove adequate. If the
amendment were  accepted, with some slight on-the-feet drafting
tweaks by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, it might cause difficulties. I will give an example.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div><a name="10020289000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mark Dixie was
convicted of the murder of Sally Anne Bowman based on DNA taken after
he was arrested in a pub brawl in 2006, following which arrest he was
released without charge. Let us say that in that instance, where
ultimately he was released without charge, there was a small percentage
of an opportunity&#151;I am not even sure of the
percentages&#151;that there was poor analysis of his DNA following
his release after charge. Let us say that, in that case, for
Mr. Mark Dixie, that 1:1,000, 1:2,000 or 1:3,000 chance, or
whatever it might be, the DNA was not properly available for analysis.
Under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment the DNA database could not
subsequently have matched Mr. Mark Dixie, as it did
following the murder of Sally Anne Bowman. Mr. Dixie is now
serving a 34-year minimum sentence in prison for the murder of that
individual.</div><a name="10020289000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept&#151;the Committee will have to accept&#151;that that might
be a small, infinitesimal occurrence. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon.
Gentleman wants to intervene on me, giving the statistics on that.
However, if the provision prevents, potentially, one incident from
happening, helps bring somebody to justice, gives justice to the victim
and helps bring a murdered to trial or put someone away for 34 years, I
think that it is worth the candle. I ask the hon. Gentleman to seek
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020289000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000380"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear clearly what the Minister says. There
needs to be a focus, when DNA and DNA samples are taken, on the matches
being correct. I accept that there should be provisions to deal with
the retaking of DNA in circumstances where, for example, there is a
dispute about whether the sample matches the profile and to deal with
such eventualities. I understand the logic of the Minister&#146;s
argument in respect of the need to ensure that adequate records are
taken in circumstances where, for example, someone has been arrested in
connection with a crime of violence or a sexual offence. However,
again, it is a question of whether there should be a long-stop and
whether such a matter should be left open for ever and a day. In some
ways, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham was making that point. Even in the example that he gave,
that eventuality did not occur: the evidence was there and a conviction
was secured. When even the Government are saying that there should be
limitations on the period during which DNA records are retained, it
therefore follows that there may be an argument for a limit or a
long-stop on the period during which further samples can be
taken.</div><a name="10020289000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000381"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am sympathetic to the point that my hon. Friend
makes, but I recognise that the Minister has made a not unworthy point
that needs serious consideration. Does my hon. Friend think that one
way forward might be to create a statutory presumption, in the terms of
his amendment, but give the power in the statute to disapply the
presumptive time period on the ruling say of a senior police officer
for good and sufficient reason? We would have to find a statutory
language that would justify the senior police officer disapplying the
presumptive time period. Doing so would thus combine my hon.
Friend&#146;s argument with that of the
Minister.</div><a name="10020289000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000382"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend
and the Minister of State that there are serious issues connected with
this matter that should be considered in striking the proportionate,
right balance. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>I am sure that we will discuss that in more detail when we come
to the debate on retention and that the Minister will argue for his
time period just as we will argue in favour of
ours.</div><a name="10020289000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are serious issues to be discussed: I do not demur. I recognise that
and appreciate my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s suggestion,
albeit we need to consider what is simple and understandable; I would
not wish unnecessarily to make matters less understandable or more
complex.</div><a name="10020289000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000383"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that we are only
keeping the samples for six months, which self-evidently indicates, in
respect of his concerns, that if we do not know by the end of the
six-month period that the sample is adequate, that is a self-defining
end
period.</div><a name="10020289000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000384"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point on
taking the sample and keeping it for a six months. However, he is
making a separate point, which is that even if the sample had been
taken and, perhaps, it was discovered after the six-month period that
for whatever reason it was inadequate, there should be some residual or
reserved power to come back at that point. I may have misunderstood his
point, but that is the essence of what he is suggesting in relation to
the clause.</div>
<a name="10020289000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
about understanding the circumstances in which a sample may be deemed
inadequate to create a profile that is then retained on the DNA
database to allow and permit matching. I will certainly reflect upon
what he and my right hon. and learned Friend have said about the
provisions, because it is important that we get the detail right. The
Committee has heard concerns about striking the right balance in
relation to proportionality and whether there is a need to put in place
some long stops to achieve that balance. At the same time, we need to
recognise that there will be limited circumstances in which we need to
analyse in detail whether there should be some reserve or residual
power to permit the taking of samples or fingerprints. In the light of
the comments made by my right hon. and learned Friend and the Minister,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020289000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000385"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000386"></a>The

following: amendment 55, in clause 2, page 3,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000387"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Amendments 58 and 59 are very similar in terms of
their consequences to amendments 54 and 55. Amendments 58 and 59 relate
to non-intimate samples and amendments 54 and 55 relate to
fingerprints. The proposition is the same in both cases, namely the
circumstances in which either fingerprints or non-intimate samples can
be
taken.</div><a name="10020289000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
2(3)
states:</div><a name="10020289000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to this section, the fingerprints of a person may be taken without the
appropriate consent if (before or after the coming into force of this
subsection)&#151;&#148;</div><a name="10020289000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know I would not like that&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div><a name="10020289000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) he
has been convicted of a recordable
offence,</div><a name="10020289000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
he has been given a caution in respect of a recordable offence which,
at the time of the caution, he has admitted,
or</div><a name="10020289000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
he has been warned or reprimanded under section 65 of the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998 for a recordable
offence&#148;.</div><a name="10020289000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a previous debate, the point was made that where somebody has been
arrested and convicted, all the analysis of past evidence suggests that
there is a risk of further offences and so on. The Minister would
probably say&#151;I know that my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch has said this&#151; that when somebody is arrested, that
in itself, historically and by looking at the statistics, suggests that
they may well go on to commit an offence in the future, which is the
justification for taking the
fingerprints.</div><a name="10020289000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill, however, takes us to a lower level, because it relates to a
caution&#151;albeit in respect of a recordable offence&#151;or a
warning or a reprimand. I very much doubt whether there is any
statistical evidence that somebody who has been given a
caution&#151;albeit in respect of a matter that he has
admitted&#151;or a warning or a reprimand can be shown as a matter of
empirical evidence to be more likely to commit offences in the future.
It may be true of people who have been arrested and it is true of
people who have been convicted, but this is a situation of a less grave
kind. As I am very cautious about extending the circumstances in which
people can have their fingerprints and non-intimate samples taken, I
ask myself: is it right to create a trigger point that is less than a
conviction? That is the issue for the Committee and it applies to both
non-intimate samples and fingerprints. That is the only point that I
want to make at this
stage.</div><a name="10020289000337"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
<a name="10020289000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000388"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the concerns of my right hon.
and learned Friend about this provision, whereby the right to seek
samples and fingerprints can be used not simply on the basis of
conviction but also on a caution being issued. While he has
characterised the situation at a lesser level, an issue will arise
relating to the broad way in which cautions are now being used. Some
very serious offences, such as rape, are simply being disposed of by
way of a
caution.</div><a name="10020289000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000389"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Perhaps my hon. Friend should stand the argument on
its head. If one struck out the ability to take fingerprints on the
basis of a caution, some of the incentives for the police to proceed by
caution would fall away.</div>
<a name="10020289000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000390"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the sentiment behind what my
right hon. and learned Friend says, and I agree that cautions have been
overused in the rush to summary justice. The pressures of sanctioned
detections to bring of crimes to justice under previous regimes, has
led to a situation in which quite serious offending has been dealt with
by a legal slap on the
wrist.</div><a name="10020289000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
argued earlier about using conviction information as a means of
identifying what further offending might take place, and we looked at
the need to go back and take fingerprints or samples. If someone has
received a caution for a recordable offence&#151;that may be a very
serious offence&#151;I would be concerned if we could not go back and
deal with that category of offender. If one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>accepts a caution, one accepts liability. There is criminal liability
denoted by the acceptance of a caution. That might not be fully
understood by everyone who receives a caution; nor might the
implications of accepting a caution, and the fact that it may show up
on Criminal Records Bureau records in future. Some people have applied
for jobs, without appreciating the fact a caution is regarded in the
same way as a conviction, only to find that it is very much on the
record.</div>
<a name="10020289000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
and learned Friend makes a fair point about whether cautions have been
used too frequently. I get the sense that the Government are beginning
to accept that that is the case, and there are reviews into the way
that summary justice is being used at the moment. Cautions have been
given for quite serious offending, and while I am sympathetic to my
right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s point, because of the way in
which this measure has been applied over a number of years, it will be
very difficult to exclude this category. His proposal underlines the
over-use of cautions, and I appreciate his nudge technique in saying
that if this power were withdrawn it would have an impact on future
behaviour and the use of cautions by the CPS and the police. We need to
be careful because of the way in which this approach has been used
previously.</div>
<a name="10020289000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
appreciate assistance from the Minister on a technical drafting issue.
New subsection (6)(b) talks about someone
being</div><a name="10020289000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;given
a caution in respect of a recordable offence which, at the time of the
caution, he has
admitted&#148;.</div><a name="10020289000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
caution normally denotes admission of liability or guilt, so I am
slightly unsure as to whether a separate category is created by adding
the words, &#147;he has admitted&#148;. Would the provision apply
only if there was a formal admission at the time of the caution? Are we
saying, therefore, that if a caution has been issued&#151;with an
element of admission attached&#151;there is also the requirement that
the person has admitted the offence? I would like to understand whether
I am reading into the provision an element that should not be there.
Perhaps the Minister of State and his officials might reflect on
that.</div><a name="10020289000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000391"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I shall look into that point with colleagues,
perhaps after today&#146;s Committee
sitting.</div><a name="10020289000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make two speedy points on the amendments. Essentially, as the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has said,
the amendments would remove &#147;caution&#148; from the Bill. This
is not universal but, sadly, if somebody commits an initial offence,
there is statistically more chance of their committing a further
offence than if they do not commit an offence at all. Whether we like
it or not, individuals facing a caution or a conviction in whatever
circumstances, are statistically likely to, at some point downstream,
have committed another crime. That does not mean that everyone who
commits a first offence goes on to commit several more, but it is
statistically more likely. Effectively, by removing that wording from
the Bill we are removing the opportunity to include on the database
individuals who may show up for further crimes that are not linked in
seriousness to the initial crime.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div><a name="10020289000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
as an example the case of Wayne Bowe, who in February 2009 got into a
fight with 25-year-old Michael Hewitt. Mr. Hewitt was
kicked, stamped and, as he lay unconscious, further attacked by
Mr. Bowe. The victim remains wheelchair-bound in
rehabilitation. He is unable to walk and barely able to speak, and the
prognosis is extremely bad. We have his permission to raise the case
because he and his family know that Mr. Bowe was caught as a
result of DNA from the scene of the crime being matched to the DNA
database. Mr. Bowe had some years earlier been arrested and
issued with a fixed penalty notice, which is one of the lowest levels
of criminal justice disposals. As a result, not only has Mr.
Hewitt now got justice, but Mr. Bowe, rather like the killer
of Sally Anne Bowman, is not with us today, because since 8 October he
has been in prison, where he will be for the next five years and four
months, subject to any further legal proceedings. That makes the case
for the
provision.</div><a name="10020289000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could be universal about the matter; I can listen to the debates.
However, if one person is brought to justice as a result of the
provision, it is worth retaining it in the Bill. I have heard what both
the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman have said,
but if possible, we should retain the provision for such individuals.
We have been able to look at the drafting point regarding new
subsection (6)(b) rather more quickly than I had anticipated. The
wording on cautions just mirrors the existing wording on samples, and I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with our speedy and
judicious
explanation.</div><a name="10020289000094"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000393"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> It came to me in a
flash.</div><a name="10020289000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000394"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I understand the Minister of State&#146;s argument
in respect of the caution, because in the context of the proposed new
subsection it points to an admitted offence.</div>
<a name="10020289000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although my
hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch is right that the number of
people who agree to a caution, notwithstanding the reality that they
are not admitting the offence, do so for the pragmatic reason of not
wishing to appear in a court, there is some inherent intellectual logic
in what the Minister of State said. I am not sure that his logic is as
powerful when it comes to new paragraph (c), which is the subject of
one of my amendments. There we are dealing with a warning or reprimand.
I do not think that a warning or a reprimand carries within it an
admission by the person being warned or reprimanded that he or she is
guilty of the offence. To that extent, the logic that applies to new
paragraph (b) is not running in new paragraph (c), because there is no
admission.</div>
<a name="10020289000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the end of
the day, I am not going to put this to the vote, as I do not have the
troops. In any case, why waste time, because the Government do have the
troops? However, I must tell the Minister of State that it is worth
reflecting on whether a warning or reprimand, of itself, should trigger
the power to take fingerprints and/or samples because it is not of
itself an admission. That being so, the argument that a person has been
guilty of an offence, so is more likely to do it in future does not
run. Subject to those observations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020289000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000395"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000396"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendment
35.</div><a name="10020289000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000397"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> These are minor technical amendments to ensure
that any power to take fingerprints without consent under section 61 of
PACE and the Northern Ireland equivalent order can be exercised by a
constable whether or not the person concerned is detained in a police
station. At present, PACE states that fingerprint-taking powers can be
exercised by any constable if someone is detained at a police station.
As the new clauses proposed in the Bill will give the police powers to
take fingerprints from people who are no longer in police detention, it
is important that we make it clear that these powers can also be
exercised by any constable. I therefore consider the changes in these
amendments necessary and I urge the Committee to support
them.</div><a name="10020289000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000398"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As the Minister of State says, this is a
narrow and technical amendment. It seeks to ensure that a constable is
covered by the provisions in the Bill and, in essence, it makes that
exclusive. In other words, by stating that a constable is the specified
person to take a sample or fingerprints, no other authorised categories
of person could undertake those duties. The explanatory notes state
that the power to take fingerprints under PACE may be exercised by a
constable whenever the power is exercised. Is it intended to allow
anyone else to do so? Is that implied by specifying that it is a
constable? Could persons other than a constable be able to exercise
these powers? As we know there are other circumstances in other pieces
of legislation such as measures on asset seizures where powers that had
previously been vested in the police can now be undertaken by
accredited financial investigators. Are the Government considering that
in relation to this provision, and what case are they making? I am sure
that the Minister will be able to respond and say that only constables
can use this power, which is why it is being made explicit in the Bill,
but I would appreciate that
confirmation.</div><a name="10020289000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000399"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Again, the purpose of the amendments is to amend
PACE. Currently, these powers can be exercised by any constable when
someone is detained in a police station, but the amendments will allow
any constable to exercise these powers when someone is no longer in
police detention. That is the purpose of the amendments, to ensure that
a constable can do that when someone is not in detention for the
reasons that we have mentioned.</div>
<a name="10020289000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
constable has these powers, they are also available to civilian
detention officers appointed under the Police Reform Act 2002. Again, I
hope that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman. Essentially, the powers are
for a constable to use, along with civilian detention officers as
specified.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div><a name="10020289000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000400"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am not familiar with this aspect of police work,
but does a civilian forensic officer who is working in concert with a
constable have the power in those circumstances to take fingerprints
and/or non-intimate samples? If the Minister does not know, he can tell
us later; I am not demanding an immediate reply. However, he will know
that very often forensic officers and scenes of crime officers are not
policemen.</div><a name="10020289000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000401"></a>Mr.

not have that power and that effectively the power is available to the

without consideration of how they were going about that. There is a
desire to focus on those convicted offenders, to ensure that the DNA
profiles of those convicted of an offence are protected and put on the
database.</div>
<a name="10020289000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had argued
for that to happen for quite some time, so we welcome the
Government&#146;s acknowledgement and acceptance of the need to take
this more focused approach, because of the likelihood that it will
result in further convictions, more crimes being solved and more people
being brought to
justice.</div><a name="10020289000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have highlighted some concerns about what might be the wide-ranging and
subjective test applied by an inspector in relation to those who have
been acquitted, those who have been charged and those who have simply
been arrested. However, there is a need to ensure that there are rights
to go back to people who have been convicted of offences; in that
sense, I hope that this power, by bringing more criminals to book, is
an important step forward.</div>
<a name="10020289000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">My questions
are practical. How do the Government now envisage these powers being
used? For example, is there a sense of wanting to prioritise those
convicted of the most serious offences? Is it intended that an approach
should be taken to work through and identify, for example, people who
have been convicted of offences but do not currently have their DNA
records on the DNA database? Is the intention to take a more systematic

<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>approach? Will there be a focus on people who may already be in custody,
as that would seem to be the most effective group to deal with in the
first instance?</div>
<a name="10020289000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister anticipate that, as a consequence of the provisions and the
ability to look back, significantly more DNA profiles will be added to
the DNA database in that way? How many would there be and over what
time period would that increase apply? Is it the intention that
guidance on the use of the power, the exercise of discretion, and how
the new provision can be harnessed as effectively as possible, will be
issued to police forces? Is there an estimate of additional cost or
resource that would be applied to any such guidance?</div>
<a name="10020289000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, if
the intention is for police officers to go back to check records to
assess whether they should approach certain individuals to ensure that
their DNA data are captured, that will have some resourcing and
manpower implications. In respect of what I have mentioned about
seeking to bring more criminals to justice, it would be helpful to know
whether a more systematic approach is anticipated, to try to bring
people to book by means of focusing on the most serious criminals, then
perhaps moving forward to other criminals and then working through in
an almost programme-type way.</div>
<a name="10020289000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,
are the Government simply saying that they will look at the issue on a
more piecemeal basis&#151;if there was some intelligence indication
that such action would be appropriate, or if we had not got the DNA of
a certain individual and we had to go back? There are two markedly
distinct approaches&#151;the provision could be used in an
intelligence-led way, or in a more programmed, more systematic way.
What is the
intention?</div><a name="10020289000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Liberal Democrats have tabled new clause 9, which seeks to delete
sections 9 and 10 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which itself was an
amending provision relating to sections 61 and 63 of PACE. I assume
that that is on the basis of overlap and potential conflict, to achieve
clarity on the various changes and amendments that may have been made
to PACE.</div>
<a name="10020289000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I am sure
the Minister appreciates, when we have lots of amending statutes it is
sometimes quite hard to reconcile precisely where we have got to in
terms of not having a consolidating statute. I assume that this is an
issue of clarity, so that the accumulative amendments can be restated
in one place. However, I will listen to the points that are made on new
clause 9 to find out whether there are other aspects that were not
apparent to me on Second Reading.</div>
<a name="10020289000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000406"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> If I may, Mr. Cook, I shall dilate a
little on an anxiety that I have long had about DNA. I think that it
arises properly in this debate, but if you tell me that I am wrong I
will sit down, and perhaps we can have the debate
later.</div><a name="10020289000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have dealt with DNA quite often in my criminal practice. Perhaps I
might tell the Committee about one case and then say what worries me
about it. I did a case three or four years ago, and I will call the
defendant Mr. X. He was a client of mine who had committed
no offences at all before the index offence, 10 years or so prior to
his trial. In the event, I think, he committed a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>very bad rape. In fact, he entered a private house wearing a pillow case
over his head and raped a woman in very disagreeable
circumstances.</div>
<a name="10020289000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nine years
later, Mr. X was involved in a fracas with a taxi driver and
a DNA sample was taken. The original DNA was not really capable of
proper profiling, but 10 years later, three or four years
ago, the low-copy number technique was better perfected. It was
possible to match the DNA, which Mr. X provided after his
assault on a taxi driver, with the rape. As it happens, although it was
not the only evidence against him, he certainly would not have been
convicted without the DNA. The DNA was absolutely decisive. We tried to
prove that the low-copy analysis was unsound, but that did not run. He
was
convicted.</div><a name="10020289000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
does that tell me? It tells me, and the Committee, that DNA is a very
important detection tool. This chap would not have been convicted
without it. It was in many ways a tragic case, both for the victim and,
curiously, for him, too. He had not committed an offence before or
since, other than the assault on the taxi driver. That is very unusual,
as a matter of
fact.</div><a name="10020289000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case also tells us that maintenance of the DNA database is a huge
deterrent. We all accept that DNA is a huge detection tool and it is
also a deterrent, because there are virtually no offences involving
individuals&#151;rape is an obvious example, but so is common
assault, grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm and so on&#151;that
do not involve DNA passing to the victim, or being left on the site.
The same applies to almost any offence that is committed by a person
who has to enter a premises&#151;one can go on making these points.
In other words, DNA  is a huge deterrent as well as a detection
tool. If that is true, which it is, one asks a difficult question: to
what extent should we extend the DNA database rather than confine it? I
find myself always oscillating between those two
positions.</div><a name="10020289000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
police in the evidence-taking session are in the same position as I am:
they are subject to public confidence. If I asked myself whether I
would mind if the police had my DNA, I think that the answer would be
no. I would want provisos in the criminal law that there should not be
a conviction on the basis of DNA alone and that there should always be
corroboration, but the risk of a mismatch is tiny, although I believe
that there was a mismatch in the Enniskillen case. <i class="I">[Interruption.]
</i>I see that the Minister is making a face. I think the truth was
that the profile was so damaged that although it appeared that there
was a mismatch, it was not possible to say positively that there was.
It was a chap in Birmingham or somewhere, a young man, who clearly
could not have been the person who did the bombing in Enniskillen. It
was something like
that.</div><a name="10020289000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask whether the country is right to try to restrict the database as
narrowly as we are, or whether we should try to extend it. Left
entirely to myself, and subject to the costs and practicalities, which
are huge considerations&#151;I do not for one moment suggest
otherwise&#151;and if the public were to accept it, I would extend
the database for the reasons that I have given. However, I do not think
that the public would accept it, and, because we are  in the
business of reassuring the public, my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch, myself and Front-Bench spokesmen are right to confine the
circumstances in which samples can be taken and retained.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div><a name="10020289000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
clear about this: we are depriving ourselves of a resource that is not
just a detection resource but a deterrent, and that is bad news for the
criminal law. However, one can move only as fast as the country will
accept at any one time, although times may change. That is the one
dilemma that I have always had about
DNA.</div><a name="10020289000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
1988, I was Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, at just about
the time when DNA was coming forward. It was an interesting time.
Things have moved on enormously in the past 22 years and will continue
to move on. I hope that we will not wholly shut our eyes to the
possibility, in time, of developing a much more extensive DNA
database.</div><a name="10020289000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020289000407"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Operation Sheen is examining the extent of previous convictions and

that  we can save a letter by referring to those matters
in  due course.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000412"></a>The

I was operating on the old adage that silence gives

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000413"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for providing
that information. As they say in many circumstances, silence is
golden.</div><a name="10020289000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
6 deals with powers to take material in relation to offences outside
England and Wales. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham has spoken about the interrelationship
between offences in other jurisdictions and whether they exist as
offences in the UK. Amendment 6 and the associated amendments seek to
probe a little further into the rationale for limiting the application
of the power to United Kingdom nationals or residents. The provisions
for taking relevant samples are clearly limited to those two categories
of person, which raises a question about the scope of the
clause.</div>
<a name="10020289000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3
amends section 61 of PACE to give rights to take fingerprints and
samples from UK nationals or residents who have been convicted of an
offence overseas. What rights exist or are contemplated for the police
to take samples from persons in this country who are neither UK
nationals nor UK citizens? It might be important and relevant to
solving crimes and bringing criminals to justice if foreign nationals
in the UK who are not deemed to be resident are suspected of committing
an offence. Obviously, suspicion would trigger provisions such as those
in section 1 of PACE, but the person might have been convicted
overseas. If the Government now seek to use the strategy to which the
Minister alluded to receive information from other Governments in
connection with overseas offenders in the United Kingdom, what rights
exist?</div>
<a name="10020289000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
about the clause is highlighted in the amendments. Why is the power
limited as it is? Should a person who has been convicted of an offence
overseas, whether or not they are a UK national or a UK citizen, be
subject to the power? The Committee would benefit from the
Minister&#146;s response on that. If a serious offender comes to the
UK regularly but is neither a UK national or a UK resident, they would
seem to fall outside the wording of the Bill, even though they might
have committed a serious crime in the UK that would be solved if their
DNA had been taken, based on the information that an offence had
occurred overseas. That is what would happen to a UK national or
resident if it were known and the Government and police sought to use
the power.</div>
<a name="10020289000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
some legal impediment, or some other legal right. There are certainly
rights to take DNA and samples from persons entering the UK at the
border, but the question is what happens once they are here. I
therefore see merit in considering whether the clause should be
extended in the way that I have outlined. It would be helpful to hear
whether the Government contemplate doing so, or whether they believe
that the matter is adequately addressed by other means. As it is now, I
am left with that question in my mind, and I am sure that others will
feel the same way.</div>
<a name="10020289000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000414"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The Committee will be aware that clause
3 applies to a relatively short list of serious offences that are
likely to attract long sentences. I understand where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>the hon. Member for Hornchurch is coming from and hope that I can give
him the reassurance that he seeks, as these matters are obviously dear
to our hearts, too.</div>
<a name="10020289000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current
immigration laws, a person who has been convicted of an offence that,
if committed in the UK, would be punishable with imprisonment for a
term of 12 months or more would normally be refused entry clearance or
leave to enter, except in extremely rare circumstances when there might
be compassionate grounds for allowing visa entry. The UK Border Agency
has advised us that if it is aware that a short-term visitor to the UK
from a visa-national country has been convicted of an offence, it would
normally refuse the entry requirement. It is certainly aware of the
situation and ensures that individuals known to the UK Border Agency do
not enter the country. Self-evidently, a range of other issues could
arise, but the provisions of the amendment are effectively covered
through the work of the agency.</div>
<a name="10020289000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000415"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister of State says about
UKBA. For example, a visa might not be granted, or there might be
checks and the person could be stopped on entry into the UK; other
rights, too, could be used in that way. However, if there were an error
and it was discovered after the event that the person had not been
stopped, there could be someone who was of interest&#151;perhaps
information had been provided about serious offending
overseas&#151;in the UK and it would therefore be considered
desirable to take a DNA profile.</div>
<a name="10020289000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
Minister saying that that is why we need some sort of visa requirement?
Perhaps he will expand on the situation for people coming to this
country from other EU countries. Of itself, that would not seem to
raise the same visa requirements, given the free movement requirements
and the other obligations that we are under as an EU member state. What
would the situation be in such circumstances? How would that be
captured?</div><a name="10020289000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000416"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> This is a rather interesting debate. I am bound to
say that I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch for
focusing on the subject, because I have not addressed the point as
carefully as one should. What the Minister of State and my hon. Friend
have been talking about is more or less what happens at the
border&#151;whether someone can be picked up on entering the United
Kingdom. I can conceive of another set of circumstances.</div>
<a name="10020289000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">A foreign
Government could hear that someone is a short-term visitor to the UK
and say that they would be quite interested to know whether that person
is who they think he may be. That could happen for any number of
purposes, including extradition and intelligence. I am rather doubtful
whether clause 3(1) could be used. Before the fingerprints can be
taken, one presumably has to know that the person has been convicted of
an offence committed abroad&#151;that appears to be the language of
the clause. However, one might be trying to find out whether the person
in question is or is not Mr. X. Mr. X may have
been convicted, but it might not be known whether the chap staying at
the Dorchester is Mr. X. I believe that, in those
circumstances, one cannot use  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>proposed new section 61(6D)(a) of PACE, because one does not know
whether he is the same person. The question is whether one should be
able to.</div>
<a name="10020289000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should the
Bill be redrafted so that we can use the fingerprinting power at the
request of a foreign Government to ascertain whether the chap at the
Dorchester is the person who has been convicted in the United States of
a relevant offence? I do not know, but I think that we should be
addressing that question.</div>
<a name="10020289000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000417"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I have tried to explain that visitors from
countries that require a visa for the UK will already have had a
criminal records check as part of the application process. Nationals
from countries that do not require a visa may be refused entry on
arrival if the UKBA is aware of convictions.</div>
<a name="10020289000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
self-evident that if convictions come to light post-entry, there is
scope to deport. However, if the hon. Member for Hornchurch will
withdraw the amendment, I will reflect on his questions, because I am
concerned. He has brought to the Committee&#146;s attention valuable
points about those unlikely circumstances in which a foreign national
is in the country and the conviction has come to light after entry. As
that person could have been here for some time, the retention of DNA
may be of assistance
generally.</div><a name="10020289000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not saying to the hon. Gentleman that I will accept the amendment or
table one on the subject, but his point is worthy of wider exploration
to ensure that we do not do what I know we do not want to do, which is
to allow individuals to commit crimes. We want to use the DNA base to
ensure that we bring people to justice for future
crimes.</div><a name="10020289000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000418"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> In the spirit of the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s response, and because the matter needs careful
review, I accept what he says about wishing to give it further
consideration. I alighted upon the problem in my examination of the
Bill and there may be other provisions of which I am unaware that
provide some other powers to the police in the circumstances we have
discussed. I am grateful to him for his assurances. In the light of his
comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000421"></a>James

amendments; I do not intend to press them. They are designed to enable
us to understand better the purpose of the
provisions.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div><a name="10020289000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
nature of the searches undertaken, it is difficult to fathom why two or
more non-intimate samples would &#147;have proved
insufficient&#148;. How has that approach been alighted upon? We
discussed earlier the situation that may arise in relation to
insufficient samples being taken. Careful thought has clearly gone into
subsection (2). It may have been particularly careful due to
the nature of the searches that may be undertaken. It will be helpful
to understand what is meant by &#147;have proved insufficient&#148;
and
by</div><a name="10020289000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;non-intimate
samples suitable for the same means of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000422"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The amendments would, as the hon. Gentleman
described, prevent the police from taking an intimate sample from a
person convicted of a qualifying offence outside England and Wales. The
powers contain what I hope are significant safeguards on their
use.</div>
<a name="10020289000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
as with all the powers in clause 3, they can be used only following a
conviction for a serious offence outside England and Wales. Secondly,
as we have said, the police must have taken two or more non-intimate
samples and both must have proved to be insufficient for analysis
before an intimate sample can be taken. Thirdly, the taking of the
sample must be authorised by an officer of at least the rank of
inspector. That is an important
safeguard.</div><a name="10020289000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
as with existing provisions of PACE on intimate samples, the powers in
the Bill can be used only with the consent of the person to be sampled.
Under section 62 of PACE, it is already possible to take intimate
samples where a person is no longer in police detention if two or more
non-intimate samples prove to be inadequate for analysis. Clause 3 aims
to replicate, with some necessary modifications, the current provisions
to allow the taking of intimate samples. If the option for an intimate
sample is not available, that could result in a further series of
non-intimate samples being taken until a satisfactory profile is
derived.</div><a name="10020289000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, I consider that the provisions include a number of important
safeguards for the individual being sampled. A range of issues relating
to inadequacy or unsuitability for analysis could be considered. I am
not a scientist and cannot go through the details, but essentially if
there is not a sufficient sample to create a profile, that means that
it is inadequate or unsuitable for analysis and the matter would need
to be re-examined. I think that that is fair. Some means of analysis
could be undertaken in relation to a range of points around the DNA. I
simply say to the hon. Member for Hornchurch that inadequate or
unsuitable samples would not be able to create a profile. There could
be problems to do with drugs or alcohol&#151;there are all sorts of
reasons. The bottom line is that a judgment is made: have we a
sufficient, adequate sample for analysis? If we do, that is fine. If we
do not, we need to revisit that. The safeguards in the clause are, I
believe, sufficient to deal with the concerns that have been
raised.</div>

Brokenshire:</b> The clause appears to provide for different
information to be incorporated on custody records, notably the power
under which fingerprints are taken and whether authorisation of the
court has been required. The explanatory notes say that the clause
re-enacts provisions of PACE, although I should be grateful if the
Minister of State clarified why it is felt that there is a need for a
change, given that that power exists under section 61(7) of that Act,
which incorporates a requirement to explain the reasons for the search.
That requirement has been maintained and two specific issues are being
added in relation to the power under which the fingerprints are taken
and the authorisation is
made.</div><a name="10020289000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the right hon. Gentleman explain why it was felt necessary to add those
additional points? Was that information already being recorded in some

put that on a statutory footing? I want to understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>the significance and importance of the provision, what data sets are

re-enact the provisions on information because of changes that we are
making to the 1984 Act in other parts of the Bill, and to consolidate
the existing information requirements so that they are easier for
everybody to understand, in the event that both Houses of Parliament
support it. There are no particular changes. The clause consolidates
the information, so that those who have to implement the provision

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000430"></a>Mr.

page 9, line 3, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) In section 24
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (arrest) after
subsection (6) there is
inserted&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;(7)
For the avoidance of doubt, the taking of fingerprints, impressions of
footwear and intimate and non-intimate samples is not, on its own, a
reasonable ground for believing that it is necessary to arrest a
person.&#148;&#146;.</div><a name="10020289000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I do not intend greatly to delay the Committee, because the amendment
is pretty self-explanatory. We are concerned that arrests may be taking
place with the simple purpose of trying to obtain DNA, fingerprints and
other forms of identity. We want the wording to be extremely tight,
which is why the amendment suggests using the
words,</div><a name="10020289000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the avoidance of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000431"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It would be helpful if the Minister responded
to concerns that have been highlighted publicly about whether arrests
are being made simply to obtain DNA records, and explained what
guidance is given to police. It would seem odd and perverse if the
power was being used in that way, so I have some sympathy with the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Winchester. We need to set out
clearly that if there is suspicion for an arrest, it enables DNA to be
taken. There are other provisions that allow for DNA to be taken in
other circumstances following arrest, charge or conviction. It should
not be the other way around. In other words, if one arrests someone and
obtains their DNA, there has to be suspicion to facilitate the arrest
in the first place. I think that is clearly stated in law, but the
suggestions of certain organisations that it is not the case are of
concern. I understand why the hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment
and would welcome a response from the
Minister.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000432"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Winchester
for allowing me to say that in no circumstances is anyone arrested
simply to put their name on the DNA database. That is not the purpose
of this or any previous legislation. The amendment is not necessary,
because under PACE there are already clear criteria for the grounds on
which an individual can be arrested; section 24(4) notes
that an arrest by a constable has to be on reasonable grounds. I
understand that assertions have been made&#151;an ex-officer, for
instance, has made comments to that effect&#151;but I assure the
Committee that there have to be strict grounds for arrest, and the
simple collection of DNA is not, never has been and never will be one
of
them.</div><a name="10020289000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000435"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Clause 5 makes amendments to section 63A of
PACE to allow speculative checking against other information held by
the relevant organisation. The changes will be inserted after section
63A(1D) of PACE, which indicates that subsection (1D), which centres on
provisions relating to samples that have been volunteered by an
individual, will remain in the Act. Subsection (1C) states that
where</div><a name="10020289000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fingerprints,
impressions of footwear or samples have been taken from any person in
connection with the investigation of an offence but otherwise than in
circumstances to which subsection (1) above
applies&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020289000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is the situation relating to arrest&#151;and</div>
<a name="10020289000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that person has
given his consent in writing to the use in a speculative search of the
fingerprints...or of the samples and of information derived from
them, the fingerprints...or, as the case may be, those samples and
that information may be checked against any of the
fingerprints...samples or information
mentioned&#148;</div><a name="10020289000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
the preceding
paragraph.</div><a name="10020289000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
significance of that is that subsection (1D)
states:</div><a name="10020289000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
consent given for the purposes of subsection (1C) above shall not be
capable of being
withdrawn.&#148;</div><a name="10020289000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a debate on information and on samples that have been
volunteered. The substantive provision as outlined in section 63A of
PACE seems to suggest that if one has volunteered a sample,
one&#146;s consent cannot be withdrawn. Even so, the Government have
said that is not the case in respect of provisions dealt with
elsewhere. There may be some conflation with other provisions that deal
with volunteered samples, but I am worried that under subsection (1D),
which is flagged up by clause 5, consent could not be withdrawn if,
when an offence has been committed, someone who has not been arrested
provides a sample to assist with inquiries because they are willing to
allow it to be run against a speculative search against other
databases. How limited is that? Should they be able to withdraw their
consent? It is suggested in other circumstances that consent should be
capable of being taken away, so it should be able to be
withdrawn.</div>

references in clause 5 flag that up, so it would be helpful if the
Minister would clarify the Government&#146;s intentions regarding
samples that may have been volunteered or provided when consent was
given by someone who had not been arrested. What would be the approach
if that person subsequently decided that they wanted to withdraw their
consent? My understanding is that the Government accepted that consent
could be withdrawn, but I may be misreading part of the Bill, so I
would welcome the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10020289000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000436"></a>Mr.

highlighting new section 64ZL. It refers to article 64, and I presume
that is a reference to the Northern Ireland legislation rather than to
the Police and Criminal Act 1984, but it does not seem to refer to
section 63A. It refers to articles 64 and 61(6) (a), but not to
section 63A. It may deal with other provisions, but I
question whether that is sufficiently wide to capture section 63A. It
may do so, and I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000442"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause relates to a power to require
attendance at a police station. The amendment would delete the
provision relating to a person subject to a control order. In many
respects, its purpose is to test and clarify the Government&#146;s
thinking on control orders and alternatives that may be available to
deal with the serious issue of information suggesting that someone is
suspected of a potential terrorist act.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div><a name="10020289000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will be aware that this has been a fairly live issue in the courts and
has been debated generally. He is seeking powers to compel a person
subject to a control order to attend at a police station pursuant to
the provisions of the Bill. We have warned the Government many times
that control orders are not working, and that we would launch a full
review of the control order system with a view to reducing reliance on
it. The Government have maintained the position that they see no need
to do that. They see the effectiveness of control orders,
notwithstanding a number of recent cases. We had one only a few weeks
ago, when two control orders were raised in the High Court and their
effectiveness questioned.</div>
<a name="10020289000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Affairs Committee this morning published a report questioning the use
of control orders. On page 20, the report
states:</div><a name="10020289000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Control
orders no longer provide an effective response to the continuing threat
and it appears from recent legal cases that the legality of the control
order regime is in serious doubt. It is our considered view that it is
fundamentally wrong to deprive individuals of their liberty without
revealing why. The security services should take recent court rulings
as an opportunity to rely on other forms of monitoring and
surveillance.&#148;</div><a name="10020289000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a need to review the current use of control orders; there are other
mechanisms that may be addressed. The Home Affairs Committee focused,
for example, on the admission of intercept evidence&#151;something
the Conservatives have highlighted. It is interesting to note the
powers in the Bill for maintaining the control order regime, seemingly
without any reflection or consideration of their utility. In
considering whether it is appropriate to retain those provisions in the
Bill, I would like to hear the Government&#146;s latest position and
in particular their response to the criticisms raised by the Home
Affairs
Committee.</div><a name="10020289000221"></a>

Committee will be aware that there is a control order regime in place
and that on Monday we had a report on the review of control orders from
Lord Carlile. In my view, a control order is a valuable tool in helping
to prevent terrorist activity, where there is sufficient information
for it to be put in place, subject to all the legal support and hoops
it has to go through.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div><a name="10020289000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch will be aware that as of 10 December last year we
have 12 control orders in place. We have had only 45 control orders in
the entirety of the control order regime. I think it is a valuable tool
in the fight against terrorism, but the Committee does not need to take
my word for it. Lord Carlile&#151;who is independent of Government
and not a member of my political party&#151;scrutinises these matters
very strictly and has said that there would be a damaging effect on
national security if the control order regime were removed. From my
perspective, there is a clear need for the control order regime to stay
in place.</div>
<a name="10020289000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
not about introducing new powers related to control orders. Parliament
agreed the powers in 2008. We have the S and Marper judgment. The
provisions in the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 have not yet commenced.
Amendments 10 and 11 would delete paragraphs 4 and 12 of the new
schedule to PACE. The practical effect of the amendments would be that
a constable could no longer require a controlled</div>

<a name="10020289000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rest my
case. People are placed under control orders because they could be
undertaking activity that we believe to be extremely serious. The
control order is a very serious power and is subject to external
scrutiny and a number of legal hoops. If the amendments were accepted,
we might not be able to secure non-intimate samples or fingerprints
from such individuals, because they would not be able to attend the
police station.</div>

Counter-Terrorism Act 2008. If we accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments, those powers will be removed, so a constable would not be
able to require a controlled person to attend a police station for the
purpose of taking fingerprints or non-intimate samples.</div>
<a name="10020289000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the

helpful, because that is the spirit in which I try to approach the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000450"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We will reflect on what the Minister said
about control orders. I hear what he says about utility and the
statements of Lord Carlile, but as I highlighted at the outset, we
believe there is a need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>bring those suspected of terrorist acts to justice where possible by
using intercept evidence. That is the difference between us in terms of
the approach to be taken.</div>
<a name="10020289000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that a review of the existing control order powers and their use is
necessary. That will obviously have all manner of impacts, potentially
including effects on the provisions to which the Minister has alluded,
but I recognise that that debate is slightly wider than the power to
require the attendance of those subject to control orders at a police
station for the taking of non-intimate samples. In the spirit of the
Minister&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000451"></a>Mr.

and non-intimate samples may only be taken under sections 61(5A),
61(5B), 63(3ZA) and 63(3A) from a person at a police
station.&#146;.</div><a name="10020289000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment speaks for itself. I seek clarification from the Minister
that fingerprints and samples may be taken from a person only at a
police station. He will forgive me; I do not have enough knowledge of
the Bill to know whether it includes examples of situations in which
samples could be taken on the street instead.</div>
<a name="10020289000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek
absolute clarity that under the provisions, it will be possible to take
DNA samples only within a police station and they cannot be taken in
the street or where the arrest takes place. The obvious concern is the
security of the samples if they were not taken in a police station
setting. I seek reassurances from the Minister about the process in
such circumstances and a guarantee that he agrees that a police station
is the most appropriate place in which to take such
samples.</div><a name="10020289000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="10020289000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000452"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise to speak briefly to
amendment 101. My understanding is that the power that is
being created by clause 6 relates to the requirement to attend at a
police station for a non-intimate sample and fingerprints to be taken.
As I read it, it is a means of ensuring that the other powers contained
in the Bill to enable relevant non-intimate samples to be taken should
be used in that sort of environment.</div>
<a name="10020289000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raises an interesting point as  to whether simply
because someone can be compelled to attend at a police station for a
sample or a fingerprint to be taken, that is viewed as being exclusive
or restrictive and what the development of practice is in connection
with the taking of samples. Are we looking at things like mobile
custody suites and, if the amendment were accepted, would it be
sufficiently wide to cover what we mean by a police station? Would some
form of mobile custody suite in the community or within a shopping
area, which is what is being suggested at the moment, be covered? Is it
intended that there should be the capacity to take samples or
fingerprints in such an
environment?</div><a name="10020289000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
flagging up the issue and saying that a sample can only be taken at a
police station, the hon. Gentleman is asking the Committee to consider
whether it would be more practical to look at other environments,
provided that appropriate standards are maintained. The possibility of
contamination would have to be considered. The environment in which
samples are being taken has to be of an evidential standard in order to
create a profile on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>the DNA database along the lines that we have debated previously in
Committee. If we are seeking to provide that someone attends at a
particular place, there should be clarity in the Bill. I agree with the
concept of stating that it should be at a police station while
recognising that the hon. Gentleman has raised some interesting points
as to where technology may be taking us and whether in future, if the
legal and forensic standards are met, samples could be taken in a
setting outside the police
station.</div><a name="10020289000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000453"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The amendment would mean that only samples taken
without consent could be taken at a police station. The hon. Gentleman
has asked a legitimate question about the circumstances under which
that could be undertaken elsewhere. There are three such circumstances:
court, prison or mental health hospital. There are also, as the hon.
Member for Hornchurch has indicated a growing number of circumstances
where that might happen on the street. We currently have mobile units
operating in places like the Notting Hill carnival because there might
well be arrests there and the police on duty would be required to
remain on duty at that locality rather than returning to a police
station elsewhere. There are a number of circumstances where that could
be case.</div>
<a name="10020289000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. If it does not, can I tell him about
one other matter which I hope will help the Committee? Wherever a
sample is taken, it will be sealed for evidential purposes in front of
the person from whom it has been taken. That sample is taken away to
the forensic laboratory and is only unsealed there. Therefore, wherever
the sample is taken, that process is the same. Although the provisional
security of a police station might seem appropriate, the same principle
would apply to a mobile unit at the Notting Hill carnival. If the bag
was unsealed on arrival at the forensic laboratory, there would have
been major contamination and the sample would not be valid. I hope that
that addresses the hon. Gentleman&#146;s genuine
concerns.</div><a name="10020289000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000454"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I am grateful to the Minister of State for that
explanation, but it does not entirely satisfy my concerns. I entirely
take the point about prisons, courts and buildings that are used for
other criminal justice purposes, including a mobile police unit at the
Notting Hill carnival. Will the Minister of State consider a form of
words that says that the procedure could be carried out in a police
station or a designated location? &#147;Designated&#148; would
imply that it had been made clear that the work could take place in the
location. I seek to rule out DNA being taken in the back of an
individual&#146;s car or in a side street in the middle of a riot.
That would be inappropriate, and could give rise to concerns about
contamination and security. Those are not the most appropriate
locations. However, I accept the Minister of State&#146;s point that
&#147;police station&#148; is too narrow. If we had &#147;or
designated location&#148;, that would overcome my concern about the
procedure happening in what I think we would all agree are not ideal
circumstances, and it would meet the Minister of State&#146;s
objective of using a prison, court or that kind of criminal justice
setting. There is a way
forward.</div><a name="10020289000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000455"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I hope that I
have assured him that sample security is the most vital aspect here,
because ultimately the quality of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>the conviction downstream depends on the quality of the sample. It is
not in anybody&#146;s interests in the criminal justice system to
have contaminated samples. My hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary, who
will deal with many of these matters on a day-to-day basis, has
indicated to me that later on technology may have sped up to such an
extent that we wish to take samples in other places. I could simply
accept the proposal from the hon. Member for Winchester that we have
designated centres, but any number of places could be designated and
the problem he has raised would not necessarily, therefore, be
solved.</div><a name="10020289000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000456"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> It would be unlikely, however, that one could, on
the spot, designate the back of somebody&#146;s car or a street
corner. The Minister of State&#146;s point is a slight red herring. I
am trying to rule out that kind of location. There must be a form of
words that gives the Minister of State flexibility on location, but
rules out such on-the-spot decisions about locations, which could never
be
designated.</div><a name="10020289000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000457"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am always happy to reflect on such matters, but
I shall not do so between now and when we complete consideration of the
amendment. My view is that the majority of samples will be taken at a
police station. There will be samples taken in courts, mental health
hospitals and prisons, and in mobile units, and they may be taken at
other venues that the police choose for whatever reason, including the
person&#146;s home if they happen to be housebound at the time. I
cannot envisage all possible circumstances, and cannot find a situation
wherein the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion would help our crucial
capacity to get the sample in the first place. The suggestion might,
therefore, be too restrictive, but as ever, I shall consider it with
officials outside of the Committee. However, I ask the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw the amendment today. We could look at the matter as part of
the guidance or codes of practice for the police further to any
legislative approval. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall
reflect on his points, but I have given him sufficient information to
show both the difficulties that we have and our policy
objective.</div><a name="10020289000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000458"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> On that basis, I look forward to the Minister of
State&#146;s reflections, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

than an offence under section 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act
2006&#146;.</div><a name="10020289000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment deals with the more severe qualifying offences in the clause
that form the list, including murder, manslaughter and kidnapping. I am
concerned about one set of offences within those qualifying
offences.  As things stand, under the clause the
encouragement  of terrorism would be regarded as one of the
more serious offences.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div><a name="10020289000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have talked
in the past about the difference between incitement to terrorism, which
is clearly a serious offence. I have no problem with something like
that being included, but I am concerned about the phrase
&#147;encouragement of terrorism&#148;, from a freedom of speech
perspective, because that that could wrap up some individuals who,
while not specifically inciting terrorism, were talking in general
speeches about the encouragement of terrorism activities. I am
concerned that by including that we are wrapping in a category of
individuals who might suddenly find themselves clustered under the
group of qualifying offences, which are the more severe
ones.</div><a name="10020289000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek some reassurance from the Minister that we will not suddenly find
individuals making speeches that are not incitement to terrorism, but
in which they talk about encouragement of terrorism, being caught in
this set of
offences.</div><a name="10020289000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000460"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I seek clarification from the Minister on the
list that would be maintained under the clause. The Government document
published at the time of their initial consultation on DNA retention in
May 2009 included an annexe containing some 153 different
offences, covering in large measure some of the qualifying offences
that are now in the clause. In the context of the amendment, it would
help me understand the clause if the Minister said how the final list
was drawn up, which offences may have been removed, what is the
rationale for that list. Perhaps he will mention the incorporation of
the range of offences, including those in respect of which the hon.
Member for Winchester mentioned his concerns, especially in relation to
the encouragement of terrorism and the dissemination of terrorist
materials. It would be useful if the Minister told us what the
rationale is and told us about the approach taken in arriving at the
list incorporating the range of offences in the
clause.</div><a name="10020289000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000461"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> It is legitimate for the police to wish 
to have DNA samples from individuals who are  involved in that
type of offences that the hon. Member for Winchester mentioned. It is
reasonable for us to undertake
that.</div><a name="10020289000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal in the amendment expressly excludes important anti-terrorism
measures from being included in the DNA clause. I consider it
appropriate that conviction for such offences abroad should trigger the
power for the police to take biometric material from UK citizens or
residents on their return to the UK, so that that material may be on
our police database. Similarly, a conviction in the UK would attract
indefinite retention of the DNA
profile.</div><a name="10020289000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us be clear. I am not against individuals saying that British foreign
policy is bad or not agreeing with the way in which the Government
approach an issue in respect of Iraq, Afghanistan, the middle east,
Palestine, or whatever. That is not what this is about. However, if an
individual has been convicted of encouraging terrorism or violent
extremism, or if they have convicted of distributing material that
indicates that terrorism is a good thing and should be encouraged, then
I am sorry but I think that we need to keep some sort of tabs on their
DNA, in case that individual who has been convicted of that simple
encouragement or that simple distribution of material at some point
downstream turns out to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>been involved in an incident such as 7/7 or an incident that could
further encourage the development of a terrorist
plot.</div><a name="10020289000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="10020289000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry if I am a bit illiberal on this issue, but I would rather have
such individuals on the database and being checked against activity
that is taking place. If such individuals are on the database because
they have distributed material or encouraged terrorism and subsequently
we find that they have tipped over and undertaken some violent
extremism and we are able to get a conviction because of that
information on the database, then sorry&#151;I am illiberal. I urge
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000465"></a>Mr.

page 15, leave out lines 10 to
14.</div><a name="10020289000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will be very brief on this amendment. I will not put it to a vote, and
if the Committee permits me, I shall withdraw it, but tabling it gives
me the opportunity to make a complaint that I frequently make on these
occasions, which is that there is no power to amend a statutory
instrument.</div>
<a name="10020289000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
it is necessary to have a power given to the Secretary of State to vary
the list because, after all, new statutes will be
passed&#151;inevitably so&#151;and it may be thought that those
future statutes will create offences that should be qualifying
offences. Also, I will say in favour of the Government&#146;s
provision that at least it is brought under the affirmative procedure
rather than under the negative procedure. However, as the Committee
will know very well, there is no power to amend a statutory instrument
brought under either the negative or the affirmative procedure, with
the consequence that if the House approves part, but not all, of the
statutory instrument that is then laid under the powers conferred by
the Bill, it has to either approve or disapprove the whole of the
statutory instrument. That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs
and points to a failure in our procedure.</div>
<a name="10020289000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
frequently drawn people&#146;s attention to that problem. This is
another opportunity to draw attention to it. My point is a short one,
namely that statutory instruments that are laid under these
order-making powers should be amendable.</div>
<a name="10020289000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000466"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman has made a
very wide point and it impacts not only on the Bill but on a wider
discussion within the House. There are numerous opportunities, through
representations to the Speaker and the Leader of the House, to raise
such general issues.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div><a name="10020289000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I will say
about this measure, for which I am responsible, is that any changes
that could be made will be made via affirmative resolution. That means
that there is parliamentary scrutiny. If a Committee such as this one
chose not to affirm the resolution, a Minister such as I would have to
go back and take out the offending measures or amend the Bill
accordingly, before undoubtedly bringing it back at some point in the
future. So that power is still there.</div>
<a name="10020289000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
accept that there is no power to amend statutory instruments and I will
not commit to giving such a power under the Bill. However, I understand
the point that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has made. If we do
not have the options outlined by affirmative resolution, we have to
rely on primary legislation. Primary legislation is amendable&#151;I
accept that&#151;but it is a rather more cumbersome process when we
are dealing with a very fluid situation in relation to terrorism and
terrorist activity. I accept the point that has been made, but I cannot
accept the point that has been made.</div>

workers causing or inciting sexual activity, care workers being

respect of the introduction of regimes for the destruction of

an arrest under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 as it is already

37 alters the substituted section 64ZK(4)(a) of PACE by removing the
erroneous reference to samples and impressions of footwear. Amendment
38 corrects an identical drafting error in the Northern Ireland
provisions. I am happy to go into detail if hon. Members wish, but, in
essence, the purpose of the amendments is to correct drafting errors. I
hope that the Committee will accept the
amendments.</div><a name="10020289000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000475"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister&#146;s brief explanation has
highlighted an interesting point. Government amendment 37 would remove
references to samples and impressions of footwear in relation to
retention for purposes of national security&#151;the footwear element
is not to be included. It would be helpful if the Minister set out how
the utilisation of footwear samples is progressing. That was something
that was brought in after PACE. Why do the amendments appear to make
that distinction? It is interesting to see the utility of fingerprint
evidence, particularly how it is used in, for example, the
counter-terrorism fingerprint database, and how that is the primary
method by which information is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>used by the relevant Governments, and how, in this country, we have seen
a great increase in the forensic use of DNA material.</div>
<a name="10020289000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
throws up the question about where footwear samples fit into the
overall picture. This is a forensic method that has been developed over
time. Clearly, the Minister has given some thought to the issues by
making the distinction drawn in the amendment, but it would be helpful
to understand better how this is now progressing. Is there a footwear
database? To what extent has it now grown? How many impressions does it
show? I appreciate that impressions of footwear can be an important
forensic tool in the context of gang and youth-related
violence.</div>
<a name="10020289000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise
that it is a technical matter, but I would like to understand why the
amendment has been drawn up in this way. It may be that there is some
disparity in the drafting of the relevant legislation. It would be
helpful if the Minister provided further background to how the
provisions are expected to be used and why the change is required. Is
it simply a legalistic requirement, or is there some greater subtlety
or significance that may not immediately be apparent from the amendment
and the notes attached to
it?</div><a name="10020289000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000476"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that
there is no subtlety behind the amendments. The amendments are clearly
in place to do what they say on the tin which, in the case of amendment
37, is to remove the erroneous reference to samples and impressions of
footwear. The section is intended to provide only for the retention,
for the purposes of national security, of DNA profiles and
fingerprints, and not of samples or impressions of footwear that must
be destroyed
earlier</div><a name="10020289000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the Committee that there is no footwear database in place in the
Government and that there is no use of those impressions outside
general criminal investigations. Certainly&#151;I have had it
reconfirmed by those we cannot mention in Committee and who support me
on these matters&#151;that there is no database of crime scene
footwear marks at all. If the hon. Gentleman wishes, I will look at the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> record of the points that he has made and see if there
are further points that I need to clarify for him. However, I simply
seek to ensure that we change the amendments to PACE, as I have tried
to openly say to the Committee.</div>
<a name="10020289000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment
36 agreed

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000477"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 25, in
clause 14, page 29, line 14, leave
out &#145;sooner&#146; and insert &#145;later&#146;.</div>
<a name="10020289000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now turn
to the destruction of samples dealt with in proposed new section 64ZA
of PACE. We welcome the Government&#146;s approach in recognising
that samples should be kept for a reasonable period only, in order to
enable a profile to be derived from them. A wealth of genetic
information can found in a sample, so we need to protect it and ensure
that it cannot be misused. I appreciate the thinking behind the
provisions. They seek to apply certain limits to the period during
which DNA samples can be retained, the focus being on creating the DNA
profile. It is a sensitive issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="10020289000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is a probing one. There is a desire for profiles to be generated as
soon as possible following the taking of the DNA sample. In essence, I
understand that it is intended that there should be a six-month long
stop. If a profile has not been derived within six months, the police
and law enforcement agencies will have missed the chance of doing
so.</div>
<a name="10020289000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
will obviously have the potential to bring savings on storage costs
that might otherwise accrue. At the moment, a significant quantity of
DNA material has to be stored as a result of pre-existing searches. In
the context of the six-month provision, it would help if the Minister
were to say what the cost savings might be if we no longer needed to
store the base material, notwithstanding that it would be coded and put
on the DNA database as a profile. We need to understand the
implications of that. The provision is for a six-month period. Is it
intended to have a phased introduction of these procedures? What would
be the implication if samples were to be retained beyond six
months?</div>
<a name="10020289000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
reading of the Bill, I assume that there might be limitations on how it
could be used. For example, if a sample had not been destroyed within
six months, what remedy would there be? If there is a subsequent
dispute, outside the six-month period, about whether the profile was
derived from the sample, would there be other rights to enable a
further sample to be taken to ensure
utilisation?</div><a name="10020289000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, the amendment is probing. We wish fully to understand the
process of the intended six-month long stop and to be sure that it is
correctly stated in its current format. I have used this important
point to facilitate a small debate on the matter. I welcome the
Government&#146;s approach, although there will be differences
between us on clause 14. However, it would be useful to know about the
guidance on roll-out, and what the cost savings and benefits might be
as a consequence of the introduction of any such
arrangement.</div>
<a name="10020289000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000478"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the
six-month limit is a back-stop provision to ensure that all samples,
even those that cannot be satisfactorily, are destroyed within six
months. The clause clearly requires that samples be destroyed as soon
as the DNA profile has been satisfactorily derived, or in any case no
later than six months after the sample is taken. There is a back-stop,
it is six months for all samples&#151;partial or otherwise&#151;and
that is clear in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10020289000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inserting the
word &#147;later&#148; would mean that the destruction point would
move to six months after taking the sample or later, if at that point
the DNA profile had not been satisfactorily derived. The amendment
would extend rather than limit the six-month period. I would rather
stick with the provision in the Bill. I know that it is a probing
amendment.</div><a name="10020289000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000479"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> How does the provision interrelate with some
of the provisions that we debated earlier on officers&#146; ability
to go back to someone? Obviously, there would be concerns about abuse
of the previous provisions such that if, for example, it was realised
very late in the day that there had been a mistake, someone could be
constantly going back and, therefore, extending a six-month period by
taking a new sample and creating a further 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>six-month window. I do not believe that that is the intention but it
will be helpful if the Minister responds to that
point.</div>
<a name="10020289000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000480"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not the
intention. The intention is clear in the legislation; we have a
definitive six-month back-stop on the maintenance of the DNA samples
prior to profiling. The amendment would extend that period
considerably.</div>
<a name="10020289000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
potential savings, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the explanatory notes,
under &#147;Financial Effects of the Bill&#148;, paragraph 200, it
says</div>
<a name="10020289000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
would also be estimated potential savings of &#163;7.8
million...in each of the financial years 2010-2011, 2011-2012 and
2012-2013. There will also be potential one-off savings of &#163;5.1
million&#148;</div><a name="10020289000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
a result of the provisions, which, in the current financial
circumstances, is not an insignificant sum for the Home Office and
those in the police service undertaking these
activities.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000481"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I have an anxiety. I know that the general view,
which is probably my view at the end of the day, is that the samples
must be destroyed as specified in the Bill. I have made the point about
what an important detective instrument the DNA database is.
Reverting  to the case of Mr. X that I described to
the Committee, 10 years ago they took a sample that was incapable of
being profiled because it was damaged, but in the course of time the
low copy technique came into being and it became possible to obtain a
profile from the damaged
sample.</div><a name="10020289000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are excluding, by our determination on destruction, the ability of
future technology to refine further our ability to profile from
existing samples, and it may be that that is inevitable and right; or
perhaps we have no choice because of public opinion, but that is what
we are doing. We cannot accept that our current technology represents
the only and optimal stage. It will develop, as low copy techniques
came along from the early sampling methods. Somewhere down the track,
we will find that we can take DNA samples from the most damaged and
tiniest of specimens, but if we have destroyed them, there will be no
evidence. I am right in that analysis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div><a name="10020289000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000482"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman is indeed
correct. A DNA sample might be destroyed, at the end of the six-month
period, that could, when technology progresses in five, 10 or 15 years,
lead to a profile that leads to conviction that leads to justice and an
imprisonment. I fully accept that that is the case. We have to look at
these matters in a proportionate way. Again, as with the remainder of
the Bill on the length of time that we are keeping the profiles and the
scope of young people and others on the profiles, we are trying to be
proportionate in relation to judgments that have been made. We have
come to the conclusion that a six-month period is proportionate. We can
justify it and, crucially, it gives sufficient time to establish on the
basis of our current knowledge a profile in the event  of a
profile being drawn from that sample. However, I fully accept the point
that the right hon. and learned Gentleman
makes.</div><a name="10020289000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020289000483"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
response. This is an important issue and I am interested to hear the
potential cost savings that might accrue as a result of the changes
envisaged here. There will be increasing changes through the use of
technology and the destruction should not relate to crime scene
profiles or evidence that may subsequently be used for matching. That
will be maintained and reflects no change when we are talking about
samples. That must be the case. This debate has helped us to understand
the approach and the way in which this would be dealt with. Some
samples from a crime scene may be fragmented, but as our technology
advances it may lead to convictions in due course as we are more able
to extrapolate from them. I am grateful for the comments that have been
made. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020289000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
