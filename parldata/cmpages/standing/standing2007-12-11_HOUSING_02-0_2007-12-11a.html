							<a name="07121212000376">Margaret
Moran:
						</b> Back when I was involved it was RSLs. Under the
Bill, housing associations can lower the amount of public subsidy that
they must invest in affordable social housing by cross-subsidising
through sales at market rates. I have asked some parliamentary
questions about that, which you might be aware of. Do you think that
there is sufficient regulation? In other words, are some registered
social landlords simply selling off at open market rates to bolster
their reserves, rather than to create more affordable
housing? Secondly, in the context of the Bill, will the separation of
the Homes and Communities Agency and Oftenant&#151;we should think of
a better word for that&#151;prevent RSLs that are genuinely using the
mechanism to create more affordable social housing from doing so? I
stress the word
&#147;genuinely&#148;.</div>

							<i class="I">
								<b class="B">David
</b>

							<i class="I">
								<b class="B">Orr:</b>
							</i>
						 The answer to your first question
is I think, on balance, that there is too much rather than too little
regulation of the way in which housing associations dispose of their
assets. At present, before disposing of anything it is necessary to
have the consent of the regulator. We do not argue that there should be
no regulation of disposals, but we do think that there should be more
opportunity for class decisions, if you like, so that if for example
garages are being sold, that might happen without
the specific consent of the regulator for every individual
transaction.</div>
					<a name="07121212000016"><div class="hs_Para">I think
that where housing associations dispose of assets it is in pursuit of
their business plans. That is also part of the present regulatory
environment. If assets are disposed of it is necessary to be able to
demonstrate that the proceeds from that sale are being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>used for proper purposes, for investing in stock or for
cross-subsidising against new social rented homes. If you or any of
your parliamentary colleagues had evidence that sales were being made
merely to bolster reserves, we would be disappointed. That is highly
unusual and I do not think that that is how things happen at
present.</div>
					<a name="07121212000017"><div class="hs_Para">You may not
be aware that it is not at present possible to achieve the core
objective of providing a new supply of high-quality rented housing
without some cross-subsidy. Housing associations on average invest
about &#163;25,000 per unit of money that they raise, primarily from
transfers of shared-ownership housing, towards the cost of rented and
shared-ownership housing. That activity cannot be funded purely from
present Government subsidy and private borrowing. There is that
additional subsidy. You might say that that is a loss-making activity
that under present arrangements can be managed only with that form of
internal subsidy.</div>

						 We are generally
supportive of the idea that there is a separation between the
investment agency and the regulator. The reason for that is that there
have been occasions in the past when the threat of action by the
investment part of the Housing Corporation underpinned regulatory
intervention, and that is not a helpful way of progressing the
regulator&#146;s responsibilities. We believe that future investment
through housing associations should be done by contract: that the new
agency will enter into a contract with the housing association in the
same way as it would with a private developer. There would be an
agreement about the nature of the product to be provided. There is
sufficient protection in the Bill to ensure that the HCA and the new
regulator would have to pay regard to each other; in particular there
is a requirement for the HCA to pay regard to the views of the
regulator. There is sufficient
protection.</div>

						</b> I challenge your point about having to make sales
to bridge the gap; it is borrowing from equity, surely. However, to
come back quickly to the first question, are you assuring us that the
current regulatory framework does not allow within an RSL&#146;s
business plan, for example, the sale of property on the open market,
not just to boost reserves but to pay extremely inflated wages to chief
executives?</div>

						 Any sale of an asset
that has been publicly funded in any way must be approved by the
regulator, so before making such a sale the association must provide
evidence about what the proceeds are to be used for. My view is that
those proceeds are used to invest in the business, to do the work that
housing associations are required to do. If there is evidence to the
contrary we should be disappointed to hear it, and would want to know
about it.</div>

						 Thank you, Chairman. I would just
like to say a couple of things. First, we strongly welcome this Bill,
particularly the part relating to the creation of the Homes and
Communities Agency. We have been supportive of that concept and think
that the objectives for and the powers of the new agency are
sufficiently broadly drawn for it to be potentially a real generator
for new investment. That is welcome. However, the one issue that we
have with regard to the Homes and Communities Agency is, we argue, that
where it owns land it should be required to dispose of it for the
greatest public benefit, rather than for the best consideration. We
think that that would send a strong message about the use of public
sector land in meeting public policy
objectives.</div>
					<a name="07121212000024"><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
with regard to the regulator, as I have already said, we think that it
is important that the sector is properly regulated. We support the idea
of domain-based regulation, that is, regulating the product&#151;the
social housing&#151;without necessarily agreeing that the
organisation should be regulated in its entirety. Indeed, the Bill as
written makes it clear that private sector providers of social housing
will be regulated only in respect of their provision of social housing.
That is proper and should be the case right across the
domain.</div>
					<a name="07121212000025"><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07121212000026"><div class="hs_Para">We are anxious
that the Bill at present creates the potential for the primary
ownership of decisions relating to the policy and practice of housing
associations to rest with the regulator and, potentially, the Secretary
of State, rather than with the boards of individual housing
associations. We are concerned about that. I would be happy to discuss
that
further.</div>

						<a name="07121212000381">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): As always at times
like these the debate still continues about whether a housing
association is voluntary and non-profit-making or whether it is tending
towards private profit-making activity. We have already had a
discussion about what the regulator will regulate. Considering the
balance between the private profit-making activity and the voluntary
non-profit-making activity, should not the regulator be involved in
ensuring that voluntary, not-for-profit housing associations do not
transmute into something quite different, which would be of concern in
relation to the delivery of social housing into the
future?</div>

								<b class="B">Orr:</b>

						<b class="B"> </b>Yes, although there is no
realistic prospect of that happening. My contention is that every
housing association in the country is a not-for-profit social purpose
organisation. When you have visited as many housing associations as I
have&#151;I think that I am able to say that with a degree of
confidence&#151;there is no
question&#151;</div>

							<a name="07121212000382">Mr.
Love:
						</b> Can I interrupt you for a second? There seems to be
a gap opening up&#151;tell me whether you agree&#151;between the
large associations that build and the other more specialist
associations, and there is concern about the large end. For example,
Places for People now has some 4,750 market rent properties. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>balance has been changed. A lot of that has been encouraged by the
Government. I am not holding that body responsible, but the balance is
changing. Are you at all concerned about that? Should the regulator
have a role in that
respect?</div>
					<a name="07121212000031"><div class="hs_Para">

							<i class="I">
								<b class="B">Orr:</b>

						 I think the regulator has a proper
role in ensuring that providers are operating in accordance with their
constitutions and objectives. On the 4,700 market-rent homes, in a
market where there is a real problem for people who cannot afford to
buy, but where there is not enough social rented housing, the provision
of market rented housing is a proper response to the demands of the
market at present and the needs that people are
expressing.</div>
					<a name="07121212000032"><div class="hs_Para">Places for
People probably has in excess of 50,000 homes, of which about 40,000
will be social rented. A small number in relation to that will be
shared ownership and then there are the market rent properties. That
kind of plurality of supply is to be welcomed. It is important that we
look at the failures in the housing market and try to identify
appropriate
solutions.</div>
				
					<a name="07121212000033"><div class="hs_Para">It is not helpful if affordable
social rented housing is going to people who have a bit more income but
cannot afford to pay present market prices for owner-occupation. If it
is possible for housing associations to use their commerciality to
cross-subsidise in pursuit of their social objectives, it would be
foolish to argue against
it.</div>
					<a name="07121212000034"><div class="hs_Para">I will give you a
specific example: the traditional housing association model would be
that the Government provide a grant which, on its own, would allow a
housing association to provide 20 homes for rent. It is a welcome model
and something that we have been successful at doing. However, if, with
the same amount of grant, the housing association can build 100 homes,
sell 50 of them on the open market, use the profit not for paying
dividends but for cross-subsidising against 25 houses for shared
ownership, 25 for social rent, and perhaps providing some play
equipment, then 100 homes have been created, rather than 20. That is
five more social rented homes than would have been the case, and a
contribution has been made to a mixed-tenure, mixed-income community.
It seems that, if we can use that commerciality and profit-making
potential for that purpose, everyone
wins.</div>

							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): Thank you for that
introduction, Mr. Orr. I want to pick up on a couple of
points. You mentioned welcoming the Homes and Communities Agency. A
concern with the Bill that has struck many of us is that the highest
price will be the required criterion for whether a piece of land is
sold. Many of us feel that the public good might require more than
simply a judgment on the highest price; I believe that the Government
may be looking at this again. I would be interested to draw you on that
point.</div>
					<a name="07121212000036"><div class="hs_Para">If I may get
two points in in one go, there has previously been talk of lessening
the red tape for good or excellent housing associations. That is not
forthcoming in the 208 clauses of the Bill. Is it something that you
had hoped to see, and, out of the 1,200 housing associations, what
proportion do you think might have benefited from such
legislation?</div>

						 To answer the first point, it is
clear that one of the advantages of best consideration is that it is a
figure; it is quantifiable, so you can say,
&#147;&#163;110,000 is more than &#163;100,000; take the
&#163;110,000&#148;. An assessment of public benefit is to some
extent a judgment. I believe that the Homes and Communities Agency
should be given the power to determine what is the public benefit,
although it may need to be approved by the Secretary
of State. I cannot give you a one-sentence answer saying,
&#147;Instead of best consideration, here is the descriptor for what
constitutes the greatest public benefit.&#148; The federation would
be happy to work with members of the Committee or civil servants
to explore what that descriptor might be, if that would be
helpful.</div>
					<a name="07121212000038"><div class="hs_Para">The present
arrangements allow local authorities and other public bodies to dispose
of land at less than market value if it is in the public interest, but
that power is not used very often and there is no compelling guidance
that creates a framework. Guidance would be a necessary
component.</div>
					<a name="07121212000039"><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the burden of regulation, we have been going through a fairly
lengthy process over the last few years. Members of the Committee will
know that a review was carried out by Sir Les Elton. I was pleased to
be a member of that review group, which looked into reducing the burden
of regulation on housing associations. It has been helpful and has made
some progress. No housing association in the country would not welcome
a further reduction in the burden of regulation. One of the objectives
of the Bill is to ensure that the regulatory burden is limited,
although those are not the exact words
used.</div>
					<a name="07121212000040"><div class="hs_Para">Our concern is
with other components of the objectives, particularly the line of
decision making that allows the Secretary of State to direct the
regulator with regard to standards, and the regulator to require
regulatory bodies to act in a particular way&#151;even if there is no
misconduct or mismanagement&#151;and to intervene if they have not
followed that instruction. We think that that is imposing a regulatory
burden too far, not so much in terms of the volume of regulation, but
rather because of the decision to relocate decision making away from
the committees of independent, not-for-profit social businesses,
towards the regulator and potentially the Secretary of
State.</div>

regulators, and I am obviously interested in the tenants. I could go
into numerous cases in which I have seen housing associations behave in
what I believe to be an appalling way towards my constituents. I have
no levers to use against them and, more importantly, neither do my
tenants. They cannot run against them at a local election, they cannot
vote against them, they do not have any power to wield against an
offending housing association.</div>

other indicators: they may, for example, be the bigger ones. Therefore,
when I hear someone say, &#147;Wonderful housing association:
it&#146;s big, it&#146;s huge, it&#146;s wonderful, it does great
things&#148;, for me that does not deliver where it needs to, which

						</i> There are a number of things to say about that.
First, neither I nor anyone else involved in housing associations will
say that all practice is perfect in all cases. We do not live in a
perfect world and there is no doubt that on some occasions, the
performance of individual housing associations, either with respect to
individual places, tenants or more generally, falls below the standards
that we expect. However, whenever there is a systematic evaluation of
the performance of housing associations, they always do better than
local authorities. That is in systematic evaluations of tenant
satisfaction levels and related matters.</div>
					<a name="07121212000047"><div class="hs_Para">The issue is about how to
ensure high-quality standards. My argument is that housing associations
as independent organisations have been invested in by the Government to
deliver a service. It is proper that they should be accountable to
Government for the public investment that they have received. It is
correct that the regulator should be able to direct with regard to
rents and housing management standards, and we do not take issue with
that. Our issue is about the extent to which the regulator is
able to require a housing association to do things that are not
necessarily in pursuit of the housing association&#146;s own
objectives, and to intervene even though there has
been no mismanagement or misconduct. The provisions currently in the
Bill would allow that.</div>

Throughout your paper, and the comments that you have made, you refer
to your concern about the threat to housing associations&#146;
non-public body status. I know that that is an accepted piece of
terminology, and I do not want to get into semantics. However, to what
extent would you say that housing associations are public bodies? They
are non-profit-distributing organisations, they work for public benefit
with public bodies, local councils and others; they accept public funds
and resources and they are state-regulated to a significant extent,
although not to the extent that you fear they are in the Bill. To what
extent are they public bodies and to what extent is it important to
differentiate them from public bodies?</div>

						</i> They are not public bodies, and it would
be in no one&#146;s interests for them to be
classified as such. The state has invested about &#163;30 billion in
the work of housing associations, which has been matched by about
&#163;35 billion of private borrowing. If housing associations were
classified as public bodies, all that private borrowing would be
classified as public money, so there is no gain for anyone in
associations being classified as public
bodies.</div>
					<a name="07121212000052"><div class="hs_Para">We tend to make the issue more
difficult than it is. We have private sector organisations that exist
to provide dividends to shareholders; their purpose is to make profit.
We have public bodies that do as they do because they are owned and
invested in by the public and the state. Housing associations are bona
fide third-sector organisations&#151;not-for-profit
social purpose organisations&#151;and it is extremely important that
that status is protected. There is a danger in reclassification. If it
was deemed that the regulator could direct the entity or organisation
in its constitution or its behaviour, there would be a real threat to
housing associations remaining non-public.</div>

of &#163;8 billion for investment in new affordable and social
housing in the three-year spending period from 2008 to 2011. Our
expectation is that housing associations will bring &#163;12 billion
to match that funding and meet the new housing provision requirement.

relates to one of your fundamental concerns&#151;the Secretary of
State&#146;s power to the direct the regulator to go into
micro-management areas of a housing association&#146;s operations?
May I suggest that the Bill brings housing regulation up to date and
takes into account the statutory regime and framework that are in place
at the moment, including the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act
2006? The Hampton principle says that everything should be
proportionate, encourage economic activity and prosperity wherever
possible and look to scale back regulatory boundaries where necessary.
However, is the key point not that that balance needs to be struck and
that tenants need to have the rights and responsibilities that Lyn
described incredibly eloquently? In that respect, the framework that we
are proposing is right. With the greatest respect, Mr. Orr,
you are probably exaggerating the ability of the Secretary of State to

						 The Bill, as drafted, creates the
potential for that kind of intervention. If it is not the intention
that the Secretary of State should intervene to that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>level, I submit that it would be helpful if the wording of the Bill were
amended so that it matches the intention. Part of our anxiety is that
the Bill is being drafted in the present context, where we know the
players, but the regulatory environment that it creates could be in
place for 10, 20 or 30 years, by which time we will not know the
players and the environment in which it is being used. The future
potential created by the Bill is our biggest concern. Of course, the
Bill includes the issue of proportionate regulation as one of the
regulator&#146;s objectives, but it is not clear whether that is an
overriding objective. If the Bill were amended to state that it was the
first objective, or the second or third one after issues about rents
and housing management, we might be less concerned.</div>

potential of the Secretary of State to intervene. I do not anticipate
the Secretary of State intervening daily, but under the legislation it
will be possible for the Secretary of State to intervene for
the purpose of what the jargon calls &#147;policy
passporting&#148;, whereby the Government of the day have a
particular policy objective that is imposed through regulatory
intervention. That is the nub of the anxiety. In Martin Cave&#146;s
report to the Department for Communities and Local Government, he
warned specifically against such policy passporting, but the Bill
increases rather than decreases the danger of it

would consider it very carefully. I cannot say that we would be happy
to see it, but it would create a limitation. As you know, we have
argued that the present test, whereby intervention should take place
only when there is evidence of mismanagement or misconduct, should be
retained. Creating standards, providing guidance on them and asking
people to identify how they perform against them are all fine, but
intervention should take place when there is wrongdoing or failure and
not just when a particular policy of the Government of the day has not
been followed. It is instructive&#151;for us, at least&#151;that

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): I want to
return to the best consideration issue and put two points to
Mr. Orr. First, the key principle  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>of allowing local authorities to sell or lease land to charity or
community groups is accountability to politicians. The
politicians&#151;the cabinet, the leader or the executive&#151;take
the decision to offer the land at less than best consideration. Do you
agree that, as far as housing associations are concerned,
accountability to elected members of one kind or another should be the
key principle, if land is offered at less than best
consideration?</div>
					<a name="07121212000063"><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on another key
principle, if land is offered at less than best consideration, and, for
instance, homes are passed on to owner-occupation, there should be
provisos in the agreement to recompense the public sector for the loss
of the social benefit. In other words, if the benefit of the subsidy on
the land is to remain, there should be a proviso whereby the homes
concerned are always be on a shared equity or rented basis, if the
benefits given by the subsidy on the land are to stay in
place.</div>

								David

						</i> This is effectively the same model as that on
rural exception sites, and we are enthusiastic supporters of it and
wish it to be retained. If the Homes and Communities Agency, a local
authority or any other public body were disposing of land at less than
market value for a public benefit, and a housing association were the
vehicle by which that public benefit was delivered, we would expect
that to be written into the contract or the agreement between the owner
of the land and the housing association and that that would be part of
the long-term contract. We have absolutely no wish to see land offered
at something other than greatest consideration being used for other
than the purpose for which it was
intended.</div>

taken by elected members whether that is through guidance from

contract compliance issue. In the present arrangements, and in any
future arrangements that we can identify, it is a regulatory

						</i> Thank you very much, Chairman, and thanks
for inviting me. Defend Council Housing, which I represent, was formed
nearly 10 years ago to oppose the privatisation of council housing and
council homes being sold off through stock transfer and to campaign for
direct investment. Despite many premature predictions of the end of
council housing, there are still more than 2.5 million council tenants
and strong demand, as witnessed by the number of people on council
housing waiting lists. We argue that council housing is not perfect,
but local authorities are democratically elected and
accountable&#151;you have just covered some of those
issues&#151;with landlords providing secure tenancies at lower rents.
Particularly in the current situation, if we did not have council
housing, we would have to invent it.</div>
					<a name="07121212000083"><div class="hs_Para">Our concerns about the Bill
fall into two categories. First, we have built a broad coalition around
what has become known as the fourth option for council
housing&#151;to bring about changes to the housing revenue account
and housing finance so that councils can improve all existing homes,
build a new generation of first-class council housing and maintain both
the existing and the new as first-class council housing for years to
come. Despite all the warm words on council housing over the summer,
however, there is nothing in the Bill that will provide a mechanism to
achieve a level playing field and secure a long-term future for council
housing.</div>
					<a name="07121212000084"><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are a number of measures in the Bill that we think are quite
dangerous, from the increasing stigmatisation of council housing to the
introduction of a means test. We do not want bog standard council
housing in the same sense as bog standard schools; we believe that
council housing should be first-class housing for everybody, rather
than being only for those who cannot do any better, in the same way as
we all see our local hospitals, schools and other parts of the public
sector as being first-class services for everybody. We are concerned
about the transfer of power from elected politicians to the regulator,
including the blurring of distinctions between local
authorities&#151;there was a discussion this morning about
whether you are going to try to get local authorities in
under the regulator from the beginning, which would
significantly undermine the protections and rights that council tenants
have today over those of housing association tenants&#151;and the
blurring of lines between not-for-profit and for-profit
landlords.</div>

they

situation, although, having said that, a real distortion in council

becoming available has fallen massively, and the availability of new
lets has also fallen massively, so councils have had to limit new
allocations to those in the most desperate circumstances. That has
changed the composition of council estates. John Hills did some useful
work in his report &#147;Ends and Means&#148;. He took a snapshot
in 1979, when 20 per cent. of council tenants were in the top 10 per
cent. of earners. The position now is clearly different. Our argument
is that if more first-class council homes were built, and if the people
on the waiting list were housed&#151;Shelter&#146;s <i class="I">ROOF</i>
magazine has identified that people on the waiting list are from a wide
social mix&#151;that imbalance would be redressed and council estates
would again become mixed communities. The only way of seeing the
eligibility clause is in the context of demands from a particular
political position that wants to reduce council housing and public
housing to housing of last resort, and to push everyone into the
private market. We oppose
that.</div>

100 per cent. of it should be used for the maintenance, management and

money from home owners to pay for a swimming pool. Council tenants
should not be penalised twice, which is what has been going on. What is
particularly absurd and obscene is that money taken out of council

have high levels of historic debt and therefore need support. The Audit

playing field, Governments should take over local authority historic

privatisation, and we are getting lots of stories of ALMOs talking
about stock-transferring their homes, once they have met the decent
home standard, because their HRAs do not stack up. It is clear that
there needs to be a fundamental review of housing revenue accounts. We

affordable housing at people on between &#163;50,000 and

slightly vague. Surely council housing, even in its heyday, was
targeted towards people in housing need to some extent, whether they
were people in substandard housing or people who were homeless. I
entirely agree that there is a need for such housing for people who are

the discussion this morning, we heard the LGA and the Chartered
Institute of Housing say that, in the next month, they hope to come up
with some words that would allow the Bill to take that on. That scares
us.</div>
					<a name="07121212000112"><div class="hs_Para">I said at the
beginning that there are big differences between council housing and
the alternatives. The key thing is that council tenants need to be
consulted&#151;which they have not been&#151;before there are any
changes. I suspect that most council tenants would be in favour of a
levelling-up exercise, if we are talking about RSL tenants and private
sector tenants having the same rights for all tenures, with the
landlord being obliged to consult tenants about management and change
of ownership. Perhaps that would be acceptable to council tenants, but
I do not think that that is what is being suggested. It will probably
be more of a levelling-down
exercise.</div>
					<a name="07121212000113"><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
crucial issues like tenant voice, we do not believe that there is
strong demand from council tenants to change the management of their

clause that allows small groups of tenants to demand a ballot. We see
that more as a landlords&#146; charter, empowering landlords to seek
out those estates where there are two blades of grass and a bit of
children&#146;s playground, where they could build some

that people know when the vote will be and a fair and balanced debate
with resources for people to put both sides of the argument. That is
not what you have in the vast majority of stock-transfer ballots today,
where the council has all of the resources and it pitches a very
straight PR campaign promoting the stock transfer. Often there is no
argument put up against it at
all.</div>

to create the circumstances in which public council housing can be
transferred to the private sector. There is a big lobby in favour of
doing that. However, there are not a lot of tenants across the country
demanding a change of landlord. They want decent, modern homes in

wanted to be a homeowner, a lot would say yes. However, a whole lot of
people face chronic overcrowding, and a whole generation of young
people cannot move out from under their parents&#146; feet. If you
said to each of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>those groups, &#147;Here are the keys to a first-class council home
with a secure tenancy at lower rent, and you can choose between that
and the aspiration to home ownership&#151;this is what you will pay
in rent, and this is what you will have to pay if you get a

towards a desire for first-class council

2003 which rejected proposals for LSVT, although eventually an ALMO

you not recognise that the mere fact of housing being in the control of
a local authority does not necessarily imply democratic control? The
large overspill estates were created in the 1960s, when slum clearance
took place and people were shifted out of one local authority to live
in a new estate that was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>often in the back of beyond in another local authority. Councillors for
areas with overspill estates can find it very frustrating that they
have no representation on the authority that runs the housing, from
which they often feel quite detached. Similarly, tenants sometimes feel
very detached from their landlords. They feel that they do not have a
voice and that they are second-class tenants who come after other
tenants of the authority. In the light of all that, what are your

said about the limitations on the accountability of councils. It is
right too, as has already been said, that council tenants form a tiny
minority in some wards, so they do not register on the political radar.
Some accountability exists, however, whereas registered social
landlords are not accountable at all. It is not a completely black and
white situation, and there is no doubt that some RSLs originate from
the cuddly local community movement. However, the dynamics in the
sector are driving towards massive regional, national and multi-million
pound private companies in law driven by business plans and
increasingly looking to development for profit. In that situation, the
idea that tenants have any hearing or that landlords, operating across
dozens or, in some cases, more than 100 local authority boundaries, are
in the least interested in, or capable of, responding to the needs of
particular tenants is nonsense. Councils have limitations, and we argue
that we need to strengthen the relationship between tenants in council
housing and local authorities. However, that is massively better than
the relationship that most tenants have with
RSLs.</div>

the distinction between so-called not-for-profit and for-profit

overall effect will be to the massive detriment not only of council
tenants, but of RSL tenants. It is dragging the whole thing in the
direction of the private sector. What we know about private sector
landlordism is that it benefits not tenants, but those who own the land
and the banks lending the money&#151;the industry. The answer,

Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): I want to explore a little
further the issue of democratic choice. We have just heard examples of
what I would have thought were fairly unusual circumstances around the
country in relation to overspill estates. Where I used to work in
Buxton, there was an example of a Manchester overspill estate, so I
have seen it there, but in the case of most councils, surely there is a
very direct relationship. In Sheffield, on the council estate where I
grew up, there was a direct relationship between tenants, votes and the
council&#151;a relationship that has now gone because the council has
gone to ALMOs and housing associations. In Chesterfield, people were
able to vote against a council with low satisfaction ratings and elect
a council to which they now give high satisfaction ratings. Presumably
most councils have a fairly direct link, do they
not?</div>

						</i> If we had a research department, I would ask
it, but we do not, so I cannot. Not enough is known about how exact
that link is. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence from talking to
councillors that people know what their tenants association is, and if
there is not a tenants association, they know people who are active in
the community. In particular, they know who is involved when it gets
close to an election, whichever party those people are in.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>
					<a name="07121212000145"><div class="hs_Para">One of the other interesting
things is that there are a number of authorities where there was a
stock transfer ballot in which tenants voted no, and then the political
control of the authority changed at the next election. I am sure a
number of factors are involved in that, but there are cases in which it
has been quite clear that the tenant vote has counted. We do not say
council housing is perfect in a whole number of areas, including
accountability. We are arguing that it offers something that is
significantly stronger than what alternative forms of landlord offer.
Therefore, if tenants choose to remain as council tenants, there is an
obligation on the Government to stop robbing their rents and to fund
improvements. If people on a council waiting list are clearly saying,
&#147;We want to be council tenants,&#148;&#151;actually, quite a
lot of them are saying, &#147;We would prefer to be a council tenant
than an RSL tenant, because we think that the council is a better
landlord, the rents are lower and the repairs are done
better&#148;&#151;a Government who say that they are in favour of
choice should respect that choice. The Bill is an opportunity for the
Government to do that. That means a fundamental review and overhaul of
the HRA to give councils the means&#151;whether you call it a fourth
option or anything else&#151;to improve, maintain and build new

Camden&#146;s case&#151;not to transfer. However, they are offered
a choice&#151;correct me if I am wrong&#151;whereby if they
transfer to the housing association, the housing association keeps all
the rents and reinvests them, but the council keeps only whatever
percentage it is allowed by the Government. Money is taken away from
three quarters of councils. The housing association keeps 75 per cent.
of right-to-buy money; the council keeps 25 per cent. The historical
debt of the housing association is written off; that does not happen
for the council. Even though it is a pretty loaded, undemocratic
choice, there are still 120 or 140 areas where the tenants have said,

credit of council tenants and, to be fair, to the credit of elected

argument. It is an almost unprecedented mandate that the Government
cannot afford to ignore. Lots of people are for or against all sorts of
Government policies, and they might moan and protest. It is partly a
historical accident, but council tenants were given a ballot, and many
council tenants have exercised that right and turned down what was
offered. When you consider the blackmail and bullying that have gone on
in terms of twisting people&#146;s arms to go for the privatisation
solution and the bribes of new kitchens, bathrooms and so
on&#151;people are often desperate for those improvements&#151;we

been controversy in the past about ballots on transfer and how they
have been run. There have been suggestions that ballots are
not always run openly and fairly. Clause 257 of the Bill tries
to introduce principles such as making a ballot mandatory, if it has
not been so before, and establishing a fixed period for tenants to make
their views known during the process. Will that solve the problems that
used to exist in respect of ballots on stock

						</i> By and large, most of the stock transfer
ballots have been run relatively legitimately. The Bill crystallises
what is actually done in practice at present. One of the key issues for
our three organisations is that we want tenants in communities in this
country to be in a much stronger position and to be able to make
decisions about their homes and neighbourhoods. That is fundamental to
us.</div>
					<a name="07121212000159"><div class="hs_Para">One of the things
that is particularly important about the stock transfer ballot is that
councils are forced to engage with their tenants during the process,
and the resulting organisations have generally been some of the better
landlords in this country and have engaged with their tenants. That is
the reality of the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07121212000160"><div class="hs_Para">One of our
concerns is that in changes in the management of housing association
tenants&#151;things like mergers between different housing
associations&#151;tenants are not in a position to have any say. It
would probably be better for them if they were in a position to vote,
because landlords would be required to go through a strenuous process
to engage with them, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>which is what happens in the stock transfer process. I am sure there
have been some incidents of stock transfer ballots that have not been
quite right, but, by and large, the process is relatively robust and is
actually very good at engaging with
tenants.</div>

						</i> The process has improved since it began.
Today, independent tenant advisers are more independent than they were
five or six years ago, and they are not influenced as much by the
existing landlord&#146;s wishes in respect of the transfer, but it is
still sad when a landlord does not really engage until a transfer is on
the menu. Engagement with the tenant should be there as standard
anyway, and it should not improve just because people want to talk
about a transfer. It should be there as the standard, normal thing to
do on a day-to-day basis about all services that are
provided.</div>

Tenants have been inspectors in all kinds of roles within our
organisation, and they have inspected everything that landlords do,
because there is best practice out there. There are very, very good
landlords out there in all sectors. My organisation represents tenants,
and we are not particularly interested in who the landlord is&#151;we
are interested in how the landlord acts and relates to the tenant.
There are good landlords in all the sectors.</div>
					<a name="07121212000166"><div class="hs_Para">Where it is
difficult is where a landlord does not engage with tenants. If tenants
do not know that they have choices, or if tenants and communities do
not know that they can be empowered, they will not be empowered. Many
people in this country do not know that they are empowered to influence
local authorities in any venue and discipline that they take notice of,
never mind the landlord discipline. So I think that we still have a lot
of educating to do, to tell people what is expected from them if they
want to engage in their community and with their service providers,
because it is about engaging with not only local authorities, housing
associations and landlords, but all the disciplines and services that
are provided. If that is the agenda of the Government, there is still a
long way to go.</div>

housing associations. That is not directed at housing
associations&#151;it is true of councils as well&#151;but
unfortunately, in the majority of both sectors, there is a culture of
disempowerment. The landlord makes the decisions and the tenants are
there to receive the service, and sometimes they get a good service and
sometimes they get a bad service. There are only a few examples of
landlords really welcoming tenants being involved in decision-making
processes. Until that whole culture starts to change, trying to drop
resident-led self-regulation on it is not going to
work.</div>

I think that it is about the lack of properties to move to. There are
about 1.2 million people on waiting lists in this country waiting for
houses in our sector. I live in a small unitary authority, and I work
as an advocate on a day-to-day basis to assist people with housing
issues. I currently represent a lady who has six children and wants a
bigger property, but there is not one in the borough that she can move
to. She cannot stay in that community, and her children cannot stay in
that school. They have to move somewhere else because&#151;it is not
a criticism; well, maybe it is&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>right to buy has diminished the amount of stock currently available for
local authorities and housing associations to offer people in need.
There is a real issue about people moving and mobility in the rented

happening at your level. You made the law on the right to buy, and we

in Walsall&#151;I know that you have been to see ours at Burrowes

vehicle. We decided to set up our own registered social landlord, which
would be completely tenant-controlled. One tenant from each of the
eight tenant management organisations is on the board, plus four
independents. It is completely controlled by tenants, but more to the
point of your question, we had lenders queuing up to lend us the money.
We had to go through a process of interviewing them to see which one we
wanted&#151;not what they wanted to do&#151;as our preferred

lenders are competing with each other to lend to tenant-led
organisations as much as to any other organisation. Lenders are not
going to stop lending to the social housing sector, because it is
relatively safe borrowing for them. I worked with the tenants to set up
the Preston community gateway association, which is a tenant-led
organisation that has explicit commitments to things such as tenant
management, and similarly the Watford community gateway association.
Lenders strongly competed to lend to both of them, and they actually
found the involvement of tenants in decision-making reassuring. They
were lending at the same rates as any other organisation, so I suggest
that the CML is not reflecting what is happening in
practice.</div>

the organisation have a philosophy of putting the tenant&#146;s voice

based on the empowerment that they have given to people to write the

tenants&#146; tenure, if it was not transferred rapidly to another
association with greater financial strength and the ability to provide
that safeguard. That seems to be difficult to reconcile with the

short answer. I can understand where the National Housing Federation is
coming from, in terms of trying to protect their members and so on, but
the reality is that when you go out and talk to tenants and explain to
them about organisations in which tenants can get involved in decision
making, both housing association and local authority tenants are
shocked that they do not have those kinds of powers and rights as well.
For years, we have been trying to come up with ways to cajole both
local authorities and housing associations to start to work with their
tenants. In some cases that has had some success, but the reality is
that the majority of social landlords at this stage are not really
working with their tenants and do not have the culture to work in
partnership in decision making with their tenants. In the 21st century
it is shocking that tenants are unable to get involved in decision
making about their homes and neighbourhoods, so if it takes putting it

Although it is on the statute book that, yes, people can set up a

how you get that culture to spread. It is one of the only cultures, or

things. I have been personally involved with trying to develop the
community gateway associations, which are stock transfer associations
that have been about transfer into tenant membership organisations.
There is a long process to develop the empowerment structure within
those bodies.</div>
					<a name="07121212000227"><div class="hs_Para">On the
empowerment issue, you have to make a commitment and work with it for
years. It takes five to 10 years to change the culture and embed that
among tenants and staff, and so on. I would like to talk about the
process that the community gateway associations are going through as an
example of how that has changed. In Preston&#146;s case, a council
that was previously not very receptive to involving its tenants in
something has changed and over 2,000 tenants are now members of the
Preston community gateway association. People have come forward
voluntarily and said, &#147;This is my association; I want to be part
of it&#148; and signed up as part of
it.</div>
					<a name="07121212000228"><div class="hs_Para">The other thing
that I would like to talk about, because I am from the Confederation of
Co-operative Housing, is housing co-operatives. I moved into a housing
co-operative back in 1987 or so and I was staggered by the small-scale
community organisation involving people from all walks of life who got
together to make decisions about their homes in a small community. That
has driven what I have been trying to do for most of my life, which is
to make those kinds of opportunities available to tenants more
generally. That kind of small-scale community approach&#151;the
community identity that comes from that&#151;is the basis on which my
housing co-ops and communities
work.</div>
					<a name="07121212000229"><div class="hs_Para">Part
of the problem, in terms of your question, is that I
do not think that there is enough research into successful models of
empowerment. I can only talk about examples that I have specifically
come across, which have changed tenants&#146; lives. But there are
other examples. There are good examples of housing associations and
local authorities working with their tenants, but the sad thing is that
there are not enough of them and the good examples are not being
disseminated enough to other tenants and other

three organisations and I do not feel comfortable doing so. But many
hundreds of organisations out there have done quality work with
individuals&#151;whether young individuals or people who find it
difficult to communicate with their landlord&#151;and go that extra
mile. There are huge numbers of tiny examples. They are not usually the
winners of awards, because the good examples are hidden in the

examples in there. I have spoken to one or two people in the awards

						</i> Our reading of the Bill&#151;we are happy
to be corrected if it is incorrect&#151;is that there will be a
change in the Government&#146;s relationship with the RSL sector in
particular. At the moment the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>Housing Corporation, acting as both funder and
regulator, has a commonality of interest. With the setting up of the
HCA there appears to be a change, in that the Government seem to want
to derive some sort of return from their investment in social housing,
as opposed to the grant that has previously
gone.</div>
					<a name="07121212000240"><div class="hs_Para">On our reading,
clauses 36 and 37 seem to say that the HCA can demand its grant back
and a return on it&#151;we assume some sort of equity-style return.
Particularly in clause 37 on binding successors in title, that seems to
undermine the security that we get by taking a first fixed charge over
rented housing. That is incredibly technical, and I appreciate that it
is probably more of a detailed discussion. Our reading of the Bill
suggests that the security valuations that we take of our charged
property would need to be adjusted to reflect any grant that has been
sunk into those

Maintaining lender confidence in the current economic and banking
climate will be extremely important. There are only a handful of active
lenders who have deep pockets and are prepared to support ourselves. In
fact, only last week, or the week before, Bradford &amp; Bingley
disposed of its properties, so there is one fewer lender in the sector.
Maintaining that confidence is absolutely crucial at a time when there
is talk of &#163;8 billion of additional grant funding, which in
itself will require about &#163;16 billion of additional private
finance. If the Government are to deliver their objectives of building
capacity and building more properties to satisfy demand, we must
maintain that confidence.</div>

						</i> If you read the press releases that Bradford
&amp; Bingley put out, the issue was about the best use of capital from
its perspective. It felt that it could lend more profitably elsewhere.
There is an issue in the sector about the Basel II capital accord and
the treatment of capital for social housing lending, whereby the
Financial Services Authority has, in my view, arbitrarily imposed a 10
per cent. floor on loss-giving default. This is all getting technical,
but in essence it means that lenders, under that capital treatment,
have to put more capital aside for such lending, and therefore our
returns, which are not great anyway, are reduced.</div>
					<a name="07121212000249"><div class="hs_Para">Not all lenders are able to
seek the advanced status under Basel II in order to get the most
advantageous capital treatment, and one of them would have been
Bradford &amp; Bingley. Most smaller building societies are unable to
compete in the market, because they are unable to get the most advanced
capital treatment.</div>

RSLs has been brought to a situation in which there are only a handful
of lenders. They are all specialist lenders who have a significant
commitment to the sector, the skills to deliver it and the ability to
build internal systems that give them the right capital treatment.
There is nothing stopping a new entrant coming in other than those
issues concerning building the expertise and the capital models that

probably borrow at approximately 1.2 or 1.5 per cent. The market has
got to the stage where it is effectively deemed risk free, so any
change that increases the risk imperils our existing portfolio, and
that is our point. If we were starting with a blank sheet of paper,

taking on increasing risk. They are far more exposed these days to
market forces in relation to build for sale, because they try to create
more social housing out of less grant, so they supplement the grant by

						 Yes, in a

particular triggers that, at any one point, might be sufficient to
change that status 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>in the eyes of the Office for National Statistics. However, we are aware
in a general sense that pushing up regulation willy-nilly and
increasing a culture of control unnecessarily must, in the longest

back. That is why we would be quite selective in our own focus on

voiced to us is that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local

						</i>I think there may be an unintended consequence of the
Bill. We have been lending in the sector&#151;I personally have done
so&#151;for approaching 15 years, and we are comfortable with our
arrangements with the Housing Corporation. We have a good relationship
with its regulatory side, and it has a 100 per cent. track record of
sorting out problems, although it may not be as good at heading them
off at the pass. With the splitting of the investment and the
regulatory roles&#151;I am more than willing to accept that I am
wrong&#151;I am reading into the Bill a change in the role sought by
the investment agency, and that it no longer sees grant given to
housing associations as sunk-free money. It sees grant given to housing
associations as a potential equity investment. We have never had
clarity in the relationship between the grant that the Housing
Corporation makes in terms of priority of repayment and our investment
as a senior secured
creditor.</div>
					<a name="07121212000284"><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 36
and 37 provide the investment agency with the ability to demand money
back from housing associations based on &#147;any
sums&#148;&#151;it does not just say
&#147;grant&#148;&#151;so we see a potential equity investor with
the ability to demand money back, and a regulator, which is another arm
of government, enforcing that liability to repay money, so where do we
sit as senior secure creditors? Yes, you are absolutely right that
risks have been very low. Yes, it is a very safe bet. That is why we
are charging margins that are exceptionally low. As I said in my
earlier example, they are probably 20 per cent. of the margins that a
private rented sector business would be charged if it was not
regulated.</div>
					<a name="07121212000285"><div class="hs_Para">We are
nervous of a change in the status quo that blurs the relations that we
have had with the corporation and that we have had with the money that
the Government have invested in the sector. We are seeking clarity. If
the intention is that our position as senior, secure creditors will
continue and that the grant will be subordinated to our investment, we
will be happy. We are seeking some form of reassurance that that is the
case. That is the basic premise of where we are coming
from.</div>
					<a name="07121212000286"><div class="hs_Para">In terms of the
regulation, I should declare an interest in that I am the chair of an
RSL in an unpaid, voluntary capacity. There is an issue that came up in
the Cave report about regulatory creep. Housing associations have
suffered, for a number of years, from having Government policy imposed
on them through the regulatory regime. That seems to be codified in the
Bill with a number of additional constraints being put on them in terms
of what assets will be regulated and what outputs are expected from
RSLs. That will undoubtedly add to the cost base and will impact on the
delivery of additional
housing.</div>

legal terminology wrong. At the moment, in England, a housing
association grant is an unsecured creditor to RSLs. We are secure
creditors. In this situation there is a statutory obligation on the
regulator to look after Government money, but no statutory obligation
to look after private finance. It is a situation whereby assets can be
transferred between RSLs, purportedly without the consent of funders,
with no reference to funders&#146; charges. That creates uncertainty
about the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07121212000292"><div class="hs_Para">You are
right that currently we have a bit of an uncertain situation with the
ranking of grant, but it has always been deemed to be unsecured. Now we
have situations in which an equity-type investor, which the HCA seems
to be, potentially ranks as an unsecured creditor. In the rest of our
business, an equity investor ranks below any creditors. Those are the
levels of
uncertainty.</div>

						</i> Having said that, the CML has worked closely
with the Government on the shared equity retail schemes. Without
wanting to go into a lot of detail, and to digress too far, there have
been problems with take-up of those schemes. Those problems tend to
centre on the degree to which the schemes are straightforward and
comprehensible&#151;from the point of view of lenders training up
staff to undertake very low-volume work, and the degree to which they
are attractive to and comprehended by buyers. It would be fair to say
that there have been problems on both those counts. We have made
suggestions to the Government, but I am not sure that those problems
could be easily addressed within a public Bill of this sort, to be
quite
honest.</div>

						</b> May I take you back to the issue of tenant
control? Your written memorandum specifically asks us to remove the
reference to control from clause 173(2)(i), which deals with rules
applying to regulators. I understood Mr. Stevens to be
saying that there is nothing inherently wrong with tenant-controlled
organisations, and that the key issue is the nature of the management.
Are you really asking us to remove a reference that would allow
tenant-controlled organisations, when you do not appear to be
inherently opposed to them? Or are you just expressing caution, once
again?</div>

						</i> It is also about the paradigm for
involvement. I do not think that RSLs, tenants or lenders disagree that
tenants should be involved. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>question is whether fundamentally one is going for an activist or a
consultative paradigm. Lenders will tend to favour a consultative one
simply because being a tenant does not mean in
principle that you have an interest in housing management or, indeed,
skills in that direction, any more than getting your mortgage from a
bank or building society means that you want to run
it&#151;particularly at the moment. If a tenant is paying their rent
and paying for somebody to manage the property well and to consult them
effectively to ensure that the service is relevant and of a
high-quality, from their perspective, one could legitimately ask why
that tenant should be expected to manage it for free. If this was in
the private sector, tenants would be looking
askance.</div>

						</i> I do not think that it is an issue of
discrimination, but of asking, when a tenant wishes to get
involved&#151;all the feedback suggests that only a very small
percentage of tenants wish to do so&#151;how that can best be done.
We would prefer alternatives to broad-brush, prescriptive treatments
that imply, at one or two points in the Bill, that the regulator ought
to be saying to tenants, &#147;Come on chaps, you ought to want to be
involved&#148;. Frankly, I do not think that it is the mark of a good
tenant that they should be actively involved in that
way.</div>

that it needs to be looked at specifically. If a tenant is interested
