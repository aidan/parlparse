<P>
On resuming--

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We are looking at the market confidence objective, which is fundamental to regulation. In addition to generating employment and work, the financial services sector has a key economic role in channelling savings and investment into finance for our industry. For that to happen efficiently and competitively, there must be confidence in the market. Consumers who entrust their savings in the market, industries that raise capital, and businesses that enter into and invest in the UK financial services sector, must have confidence in the market.

<P>
It is not simply a question of confidence in markets and exchanges but in the financial system as a whole, including regulated activities that take place inside and outside markets and exchanges. Amendment No. 41 would alter the definition of the financial system, so that the market confidence objective would no longer be to maintain confidence in regulated activities but in authorised persons in so far as they engage in regulated activities. If I understood the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs correctly, the Opposition are suggesting that the FSA should maintain confidence in individual banks rather than banking, and in individual insurers rather than underwriting. If that is not their intention, I have to say that that would be the effect of their amendment.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also seemed to suggest that, under clause 3, the market confidence objective will fail to cover the entire banking sector. That is not the case. As described in clause 3(1), the market confidence objective is designed to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``maintain confidence in the financial system.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In subsection 2, the financial system is defined simply as

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial system operating in the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It includes, but is not confined to, regulated activities. Indeed, although that definition is not confined to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), paragraph (c) specifically refers to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other activities connected with financial markets and exchanges.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Therefore, the entire banking sector is covered, and is meant to be covered, by the market confidence objective.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Just for clarification, is the banking sector swept up only in subsection (2)(c)?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, it is swept up, as it were, by subsection (2)(c) and by the fact that the definition of the financial system includes paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). Of course, that does not constitute an exclusive definition. It simply means that, for the avoidance of doubt, the financial system will include those specific paragraphs.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am listening carefully and, if the Economic Secretary will allow me, I shall intervene when she has had a further chance to respond.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The amendment would appear to have little positive effect, and suffers from three defects in respect of its likely impact on the market confidence objective. First, it could be interpreted as setting an objective for the FSA to maintain confidence in all individual firms: in other words, in the authorised persons who are engaged in regulated activities. That is not what we are seeking to achieve, and I doubt whether Opposition Members want to achieve that. The objective of the regulation is to maintain confidence not in particular players, but in the financial system generally. FSA regulatory action may involve some loss of confidence in a specific firm expressly to maintain confidence in the market as a whole.

<P>
The second difficulty is that regulated activities under the Bill are not carried on only by authorised persons. They may also be carried on by persons who are exempt from the requirement for authorisation or by appointed representatives of authorised persons who are not themselves authorised. There is a risk that the amendment would narrow significantly the definition of the financial system and that the FSA's objective might be attributed as being only to maintain confidence in a subsection of the financial system. I doubt that that is the intention but I fear that it might be the effect.

<P>
The third problem is that regulated activities may be carried on improperly by people who are neither authorised nor exempt. The FSA is certainly not in the business of maintaining confidence in regulated activities carried on by persons who are neither authorised nor exempt. Part of the FSA's responsibility for maintaining confidence in the financial system as a whole requires it to ensure that unauthorised persons who are not subject to an exemption do not carry on regulated activity. Policing the general prohibition is an important part of achieving that objective. The amendment would cast doubt on that difficulty.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am doing my best to follow the Minister's explanation and she is doing her best to be clear. I am not clear where banking comes in, because it is obviously not a financial market. Is it because it is a financial activity, or will it come in under subsection (2)(c) or somewhere else? I should be grateful for enlightenment.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for pursuing the point, because it is important to have clarity.

<P>
The banking sector is clearly part of

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial system operating in the United Kingdom''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Some of its activities will fall within subsection (2)(a), some will fall within paragraph (b) and any that do not fall within those paragraphs are likely to be covered by paragraph (c). Any activities that do not fall within paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) will be covered because the banking sector is an integral part of

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial system operating in the United Kingdom'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
which is the central part of subsection (2).

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I am worried. If the explanation is as vague as that, what is the point of clause 3? If something as important as the banking system cannot be pinned down, what is the point of the rigmarole? Why cannot the financial system simply mean

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial system operating in the United Kingdom''?
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is an interesting point. We believe that it is important to spell out in the Bill, at least illustratively using the word ``includes'', the main activities that fall within the financial system operating in the United Kingdom. If right hon. and hon. Members want to suggest another form of words, we shall happily consider them, but it is difficult to see how the definition could be more comprehensive. I hope that I have at least reassured the Committee that it most certainly includes, but is not limited to, the banking sector. I also hope that I have explained why the amendment might have some unfortunate side effects which I suspect the right hon. and learned Gentleman would not want.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I noted the Minister's use of the word ``comprehensive''. Does it comprehend mortgages and, if not, why not?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We shall discuss mortgages later in the Bill. The Bill's scope and its relationship to mortgage advice and sales are a matter for the scope order that will be made under secondary legislation under the powers that the Bill confers. We will deal with that matter later, but, to anticipate, the Treasury will consult on it.

<P>
On the next substantial issue that was raised, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked about the relationships in the memorandum of understanding between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA in relation to the maintenance of overall confidence in the system and the avoidance of systemic risk.

<P>
The memorandum is, of course, a public document. It establishes a framework for co-operation between the three institutions. It is based on and spells out four guiding principles: clear accountability, based on clearly defined responsibility; transparency, with responsibility made public for all to see; no duplication of the roles of the three institutions; and the regular exchange of information.

<P>
The importance of the memorandum of understanding lies in the creation of the relationship between the three organisations--of which the FSA is only one--and in the way in which it must operate. The relationship is not new. Even before the transfer of responsibility for banking supervision from the Bank of England to the FSA under the Bank of England Act 1998, proper oversight of the stability of the financial system required close co-operation between the Treasury and financial services regulators. The fact that so many of those regulators are now to be joined in a single authority improves and simplifies the mechanics of that co-operation at a stroke.

<P>
The memorandum of understanding established new transparency, although not in response to a new need. The regular exchange of information, some parity of responsibilities and close co-operation between the institutions involved have always been fundamental aspects of ensuring the stability of our financial system. It was never the case, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham perhaps implied, that the Bank could discharge the relevant responsibilities on its own.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for dealing with that point. My point is, however, that the perception was always that the buck stopped with the Governor of the Bank of England; there was a feeling in the City that that was where responsibility was concentrated. The Minister has just said that the memorandum ``established new transparency''. How can we as individuals or as members of a firm that the FSA regulates be assured that the tripartite committee carries out its duties under the memorandum of understanding effectively and properly? What proof will there be?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am tempted to say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The memorandum of understanding is a public document, which is available in the Library of the House of Commons.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> As a matter of fact, it is not. I tried to get a copy half an hour ago. I succeeded in securing it at 8.25 pm from the Library of the other place. It was in a basement.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing that to my attention and for going to such lengths to obtain a copy of the memorandum of understanding. Had he asked me, I would have given him a copy and simplified his search. I will ensure tomorrow that a new copy of the memorandum is placed in the Library of our House. If it will assist members of the Committee, I will happily make copies available to them.

<P>
To return to the question of the responsibilities of the Bank and the other institutions, the Bank could never ensure the stability of the financial system on its own. Systemic risk is not transmitted simply through the payments systems of the inter-bank market. In the global financial system, different sorts of financial intermediary, trader and market are interconnected in many ways. The interconnection of markets is not a threat of itself; indeed, it can help to reduce and dissipate risk. Nor is it especially new; it has been growing for a considerable time. However, it means that a system that seeks to focus on a single sector--in this case, the banking sector--simply will not work. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested earlier that the arrangements under the memorandum introduce an extra degree of delay into our reaction to major financial events, but what is that extra element?

<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Treasury and the banking regulator could not, even under the previous arrangements, operate in isolation from other financial services regulators. The lack of clarity about who was responsible for what did not facilitate a more rapid and better considered response to complex chains of events in the global marketplace.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I might answer the Minister's question. I was simply repeating the words of many Labour Members, who have tried to justify concentrating powers in one body by referring to the need to act quickly and urgently. I was drawing a contrast and saying that those powers have been dissipated.

<P>
However, I respectfully draw the Minister back to my question, because she has not answered it. Saying that the rule book is available and that the proof of the pudding is in the eating does not answer my question. How will we know that the committee has expended its duties properly, effectively and fairly? Where will the record be to assure us?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall explain the respective responsibilities of the three institutions. The simple answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that, in the event of a threat to the financial system that required the three institutions to work together, the line of accountability would, as always, be to Parliament through Ministers. Treasury Ministers would be answerable for the way in which the system and the set of relationships that the memorandum of understanding created dealt with that systemic risk.

<P>
The three institutions have different responsibilities and different expertise. The Bank is charged with oversight of the system and its infrastructure. That includes the payments system, which is a crucial part of the system as a whole. The Financial Services Authority supervises banks, security houses, insurances companies, investment markets and the clearing houses. It therefore has a close understanding of the way in which firms are exposed to each other and how excessive exposure to risk in one might cause a chain reaction in other elements of the system. The Treasury has overall responsibility for the regulatory structure and the stability of the economy. However, it is also the ultimate source of any funds that might be needed to launch the lifeboat in the rescue operation to which the hon. Gentleman referred.

<P>
When they read the memorandum, hon. Members will note that it makes it clear that it is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whether public funds should be committed to any support action. That arrangement is not new, and it is as it should be. It means that Ministers would be accountable to the House for an important decision either to commit public funds to rescue an institution and maintain confidence in the whole system, or not to commit public funds if it were felt that that was the right course of action.

<P>
The memorandum sets out in some detail the way in which the standing committee operates. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham acknowledged, there are good reasons why the minutes of the meetings between the three institutions are not made public. He sought to draw a distinction between discussions on the position of individual institutions and discussions on matters of more general importance to financial stability. I am not sure whether that distinction is viable. It is in the nature of financial stability that one should be wary of making public without careful thought whatever matter of concern has arisen, lest that triggers the crisis of confidence about which one is worried. I am sure that practitioners in the financial community would readily concur with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> If whoever monitors the banking system decides, for whatever reason, to bring in more banks with lower capital adequacy requirements, do they not have a duty to the underlying consumer to say, ``The money that you placed with those banks is slightly less safe than it was, because we have, in effect, diluted the security of the banks now handling your money.''? How would that duty be weighed against the fact that they do not want to cause systemic risk? Which argument is relevant: the transparency argument or the propping up the system argument?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We are going far wide of the amendment. The answer to that question lies in the fact that the Financial Services Authority has to balance the objective of consumer protection, which will clearly have a bearing on capital adequacy ratios for banks, with the principle of promoting competition. It also has to take into account the objective of maintaining confidence in the financial system. The authority will have to balance the relevant objectives and principles against each other and weigh them up as it decides a particular case. For example, the hon. Gentleman suggested the case of a foreign bank seeking to enter this country. The authority will have to decide whether lower capital adequacy ratios would be justified in the interests of competition an of giving consumers more choice, even though that might involve a downside in terms of the protection of consumers who put money into any such institutions and thereby have implications for the market confidence objective. It is a balancing act. If the Treasury or the Bank of England were worried about the FSA's attitude to capital adequacy requirements for new entrants, and felt that an issue of systemic risk could be involved, I have no doubt that the matter would be discussed between them under the memorandum of understanding.

<P>
I was asked about the mechanics of how the Barings crisis would be dealt with under the memorandum of understanding. We all hope that such a case will not occur again, but if it did it would be extremely important that any decision was taken on the basis of a full understanding of the facts. In the case of Barings, the Bank of England was not the only regulator involved in supervising the institution. Indeed, the overseas subsidiary that was racking up spectacular losses was a futures trader rather than a bank. That illustrates the fact that one cannot draw hard and fast distinctions between different sectors of the modern financial services industry. The decision would be taken in the light of the circumstances, using all the relevant information that was available to all the institutions involved.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am still trying to follow the Minister's argument. When she replied to me a moment ago, she mentioned the scope of the Bill. To which particular clauses is she referring in that context?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I think that I am right in saying that it is clause 20, which we shall probably reach very shortly.

<P>
To conclude on the extremely important issue of systemic risk, it does not matter whether action in problematic cases is initiated by the Governor of the Bank of England to the Chancellor, or by Howard Davies to the Chancellor. That is of secondary importance. However, it would be unacceptable to fail to involve the right people at the right time. The memorandum of understanding, as I have explained, governs the relationship between the institutions and ensures, not least through the regular monthly meetings, that they are constantly sharing information and assessing whether there are any risks of a systemic nature.

<P>
I hope that I have gone at least some way towards satisfying Opposition Members by reassuring them that the clause does not omit the banking sector but fully includes it. I hope that I have also reassured them that the arrangements for overseeing the stability of the financial system as a whole are robust and are more clearly and transparently set out than before. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will decide to withdraw his amendment; if he does not, I must advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment was a probing amendment. The Minister's answer to the crucial issue concerning coverage of the banking system seems to us to be, on one hand, satisfactory, but, on the other, unsatisfactory. The answer cannot be found by reference to subsection (2)(c) because that refers to ``other activities connected''--

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Since I obtained the memorandum of understanding between the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, I have been hard at it but hard put to get a full grip on the subject. I still do not understand sufficiently, and so ask for clarification. Before I do that, I want to put my understanding of the purpose of clause 3 in the context of the Bill. Maintaining market confidence in the financial system is the objective. That seems to mean systemic risk--[Interruption]--although systemic risk is not mentioned. Somebody said ``or not'', but systemic risk cannot be excluded from the way one thinks about clause 3; if it is not implicit in the clause, there is something wrong with the drafting.

<P>
Market confidence can be sustained by draconian regulation. For example, such regulation could prevent the clearing banks from lending to almost anybody. That would mean very little systemic risk, which can be ensured by extremely onerous prudential supervision. Everyone agrees on the balance between tight rules, vigorous supervision and lower systemic risk on one hand, and loose rules, little supervision and high systemic risk on the other. The question is this: where is the balance found? Is it found in a vacuum? No--it is found by reference to economic principles.

<P>
Some risk of systemic collapse is accepted--[Interruption.]--Labour Members find this a matter for levity, but I do not. It is a crucial aspect of the Bill, which alters the means by which the financial system is sustained and protected. I shall try to tease out more about that or at least to ask a few questions about the memorandum of understanding.

<P>
As I said, the only way to avoid all risk is to do something quite ridiculous, and no one is suggesting that. There is only one long-run objective of all systemic risk regulation: maximisation of long-run economic performance. It is accepted that too much regulation will reduce economic performance, and that too little will lead to occasional systemic collapses which will reduce long-run output. That is an important and fundamental principle to grasp.

<P>
How is economic performance usually expressed? Usually in terms--I am afraid that I must use these words again--of competitiveness and competition to sustain that competitiveness. The word ``competitiveness'' is often used by economists as a loose substitute for economic performance. I shall not linger for more than a second on the competitiveness debate or on whether competitiveness should be raised from a principle to an objective, because we have already had that discussion. It is, however, the absence of competitiveness from the list of objectives that causes problems in the clause.

<P>
If one asks a central banker what he is trying to achieve--[Interruption.] The Government Whip appears to find this funny. If a central banker were asked what he is trying to achieve in respect of systemic risk, he would be flabbergasted to discover that objectives other than long-run economic performance should be taken into account. In the Bill, however, market confidence, of which systemic risk is a part, sits alongside three other objectives, with which it is presumably balanced. The objectives are also presumably weighed against one another.

<P>
Are we to take it that the task of safeguarding systemic risk is being traded off against any other objective, or does the objective of securing systemic risk come prior to or above the other objectives listed? If I am right in thinking the latter, and even if the Minister refuses to say that such an objective is prior or superior to the other objectives, her argument will not be sustainable. Competitiveness should underpin the Bill; the reason why the Bill is intellectually flawed is that competitiveness is not at the heart of its objectives but should have been. That is why the Opposition have problems with the Bill and why it lacks clarity.

<P>
That brings me to the memorandum of understanding, which is designed in part to clear up those very problems. I have a few brief questions about the memorandum, which, as I said, I have only just obtained, so it is quite probable that I have not yet fully absorbed it.

<P>
As I understand it, it is not just an indicative document but, to use the phrase that the Minister used a moment ago, it ``governs'' the relationship between the three institutions with respect to the delivery of the market confidence objective in clause 3. Thus, it is a very important document for institutions in the City--it is not a mere piece of tittle-tattle on the back of an envelope which has been put out to keep everybody happy.

<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend could help me, because he has read the document and I have not. Is the document referred to in the Bill, and does it therefore have some statutory existence? Where does it come from?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> As far as I know, it is not mentioned in the Bill. Of course, the Minister referred to it extensively when she dealt with an earlier amendment. The first reference that I found to it was in the Joint Committee report. Page 19 of the first report of the Joint Committee states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Minister''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I do not know which Minister, but I assume that they all agree--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``told us that the FSA's responsibilities relating to systemic risk were `embedded' in the proposed objectives, and that making them a separate objective would add nothing; but that she was prepared to consider the matter further.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I think that she should. That is a crucial issue.

<P>
The memorandum of understanding could also be crucial. Paragraph 3(ii) says that the Financial Services Authority will be responsible for

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the supervision of financial markets and of clearing and settlement systems''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That seems fairly clear: if a bank messes up, the FSA is responsible. The FSA says, ``Well, this is the regulatory system that was in place. Even though a bank went to the wall or had a problem, we still think that it is the right regulatory system, for the following reasons.'' It would then explain to the public why there should be no change--or some change--to the regulatory system in light of that banking failure. But what happens if a banking crisis in one bank develops into a systemic crisis?

<P>
As we know, banks have tended to lend like sheep, all in one area. From time to time, they plough over the cliff after some crazy idea, like, to mix a metaphor, Gadarene swine--[Interruption.]--all three of them. Is not it widely held that the banking system did precisely that with respect to Latin America? I do not want to pursue the point, but it is obvious that problems in the banking sector tend to come not as single spies but in battalions.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is not the secondary banking crisis that occurred in the early 1970s--London and Counties and all the rest--a classic example? My political activities were just beginning at that time, although not in this House.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Yes, that is a classic example. Banks tend to mess things up together.

<P>
If a single bank crisis develops into a systemic crisis, who is responsible then? Paragraph 2(ii) of the document states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It will fall to the Bank''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
that is, the Bank of England--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to advise the Chancellor, and answer for its advice, on any major problem inherent in the payments systems. The Bank will also be closely involved in developing and improving the infrastructure, and strengthening the system to help reduce systemic risk''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Thus, the responsibility is shared; it is not unique to the FSA. If there is a little crisis, it is the FSA's responsibility. If it grows, it becomes the responsibility of the Bank of England as well as the FSA. I wonder whether that is a sustainable relationship.

<P>
Until the Bill was published, we knew that the Bank of England was responsible for both eventualities. Now there appear to be two bodies: one responsible for a little crisis and one for a big crisis.

<P>
I turn to another apparent contradiction in what is supposed to be a memorandum of understanding. Paragraph 2 states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Bank will be responsible for the overall stability of the financial system as a whole which will involve . . . the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial sector, with particular regard to international competitiveness. The Bank will continue to play its leading role in promoting the City.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Does that mean that the Bank of England will be responsible for giving advice on the effects of FSA regulation on international competitiveness? To put it in more technical terms, will the Bank have a duty to report on any disintermediation effects in the markets as a consequence of over-regulation? I think that that is what that paragraph means. If so, I should like the Minister to clarify what form such advice from the Bank to the FSA will take; whether it will take the form of meetings; whether there will be regular papers; and whether minutes and other papers will be made public. In particular, will minutes of the tripartite gatherings be made available to the general public?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but I am having difficulty understanding what he is talking about--[Laughter.]--and how it relates to regulatory objectives and market confidence, which is the subject of the clause under discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is fairly clear, Mr. Atkinson. Market confidence is weakened or strengthened according to the effectiveness of the memorandum. If people have no respect for the memorandum, we shall have serious difficulty meeting the market confidence objective laid down in clause 3. The Economic Secretary alluded extensively to the memorandum in order to justify her opposition to an earlier amendment. She said that it was an important document, and that it will govern the relationship between the two institutions, which is pretty strong language. The document is not indicative but governing.

<P>
I shall not ask more questions about the memorandum yet, although I am sure that I shall have quite a few to ask once I have read it a second time, but I should like answers to my two basic questions. First, how will conflict between the FSA and the Bank on the question of prudential supervision be resolved? Secondly, will the Bank of England be responsible for producing reports on disintermediation and the effect of over-regulation? I was trying to explain that a moment ago--

<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): Take your time.


<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am closing my remarks, but a serious point needs to be addressed in paragraph 2(v). If the Bank is to be involved in producing reports on over-Ñregulation by the FSA--privately or in any other capacity--the markets will want to know whether the associated documentation or minutes of the tripartite gatherings will be made public, and what further information can be expected about the Bank's role in respect of financial intermediation and prudential supervision.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am glad to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, who is trying to tease out important questions relating to clause 3. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs asked two important questions in response to advice that we have received. First, is banking covered by clause 3? Is banking part of the financial system? One would have thought that that was perfectly obvious. [Laughter.] However, the Economic Secretary has so far had some difficulty in explaining how it is part of the banking system.

<P>
My second question is slightly more complex, but it helps to tease out some of the difficulties in clause 3. Will a French bank, with a presence in London, lending money in the United Kingdom secured on its property in France, be regulated under the Bill? I declare an interest, because I own a property in France, and I borrowed money on it. But that was a long time ago, and I declare my interest only out of an abundance of caution. I use that example because it is sensible to use an example that one understands to try and tease out the meaning of the Bill which, at present, I do not fully understand, and which, I suspect, a good many other people do not fully understand either.

<P>
I find myself in reasonably good company in this respect. The minutes of evidence and appendices to the first report, volume 2, show that no lesser a person than the noble Lord Eatwell, dealing with precisely the point covered by clause 3--the statutory objectives in relation to the maintenance of properties in the financial sector--says:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I see that objective as rather confusing because it is a bundle of things. I thought one of the main tasks of the regulator was to manage systemic risk, yet it is extraordinarily odd that our regulator is not told to do this.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
For the assistance of the Minister, let me say that I am reading from page 8 of the report, question 29. I refer to question 29, because I think that the Minister, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, referred to volume 1 of the first report on page 19, paragraph 43. In the memorandum of understanding, which has been helpfully dealt with by my hon. Friend in his recent speech, footnote 42 refers to question 29, and it was that question from which I was quoting when I referred to the comments of the noble Lord Eatwell. If one follows those three stages through, it seems clear that people with immense experience of the financial system are unclear about the propositions embodied in the clause.

<P>
The Minister helpfully sought to explain to me how the banking system was covered by the clause, and how the system of granting mortgages was not. I confess that I remain extremely unclear about that. I have it at the back of my mind--and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong--that something to do with the Bill received a clear English award. Am I being premature? [Interruption.] Perhaps I am wrong. I said on Second Reading that in some ways the Bill seemed to be expressed in clear English, but the difficulty was that although it led very clearly from one place to another, having gone from one place to another, one ended up quite confused.

<P>
Let me try and take the Economic Secretary with me through the way that one discovers whether the banking system is covered. Let us consider the provisions in clause 3 on market confidence and then the wording of our amendment, which is believed by those advising us to assist in clarifying the matter. One wishes to know whether banking is in the financial system. Clause 3(1) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The market confidence objective is: maintaining confidence in the financial system.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
To find out what the financial system is, we must turn to clause 3(2).

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we are not discussing the amendment. I have already dealt with that and it has been disposed of. We are now on clause stand part.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am extremely grateful; the fault is entirely mine. I tried to make a point of order immediately prior to the Division in the House; I got caught up during that Division and was not back to pursue my point. I had wanted to discover whether there would be a clause stand part debate, because otherwise I would have had to have spoken on the amendment. I received an indication, given in complete good faith, that there would not be a clause stand part debate. I apologise as I was not back in Committee at the right time to realise that I have been speaking on clause stand part. That does not matter at all to the question of relevance. I am grateful to the Economic Secretary at least for letting me off that intellectual hook for having tied important questions specifically to the amendment rather than to the wider issue of the clause.

<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall now return to my point. The definition of ``financial system'' given in clause 3(2) includes ``financial markets and exchanges''. I hope that the Economic Secretary will agree that that wording does not cover banking--she may be so kind as to nod since it is a brief matter. The Economic Secretary is sitting very still.

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me for mentioning this, but, in view of Pepper v. Hart, with which he will surely be familiar, I seek not to deal with interpretation and clarification of the Bill through nods or shakes of the head from a sedentary position.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that it is difficult for the Official Report to record whether hon. Members have shaken or nodded their heads.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That was helpful. I am familiar with Pepper v. Hart because I argued it on the Floor of the House. I sympathise deeply with the Economic Secretary because the words on which their lordships chose to place meaning were those of the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) when he was Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He said them at around midnight during a finance debate in 1975. They came from a one-and-a-half hour period during which he had been asked 90 questions about a Finance Committee that contained 13 future Cabinet Ministers and two future Chancellors. If the Minister is cautious given that background, I fully understand.

<P>
I shall take nothing for granted, but I assume that the words ``financial markets and exchanges'' are not apt to cover a bank. That might not be correct--I am not saying that they are not apt to cover some activities conducted by banks because, as hon. Members will know, banks may now do one's stockbroking. However, the process of banking is not covered by either ``financial markets'' or ``exchanges''.

<P>
The next question is whether banks will be covered by ``regulated activities'' or by

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other activities connected with financial markets and exchanges.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The problem points up the extraordinary vagueness of the Bill. What does subsection (2)(c) mean? Practically no one involved in a financial market or exchange would not have a bank account. Since banks provide current account facilities, on one reading one might say that that made a connection with financial markets and exchanges. If the draftsmen and the Government who are responsible for it are really going about the matter in such a way, language has no sensible meaning. Consequently, we require a better explanation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My right hon. and learned Friend makes an important point. Under subsection (2)(c), which reads:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other activities connected with financial markets and exchanges'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
could easily be placed the activities of company registrars, whose job it is to register titles to stocks and shares. Do the Government want the administrative work of a company registrar--and it is generally administrative as they do not trade--to be included under the panoply of FSA regulations. As my right hon. and learned Friend notes, that is what they are saying by such a catch-all and vague clause.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend asks a very good question, and my frank answer is that I do not know. I would be amazed and surprised if company registrars were intended to be caught by the subsection, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify it, as it is not part of a definition clause. I have looked to see where the definition clauses are, and I do not think that this clause is specifically or formally described as a definition section to the future Act. I shall come to another aspect of that in a moment, but my hon. Friend asked a serious question that is important in relation to the Bill as a whole.

<P>
I return in my sleuthing to ask where banking is covered in the clause. I am inclined to assume that it is covered by the words ``regulated activities''. If one wishes to find out where regulated activities are in the Bill, one should perhaps follow the Economic Secretary's advice--which I heard, because I was listening carefully--and look to its scope. When she gave that advice, I intervened to ask where the scope was. Being a literal-minded fellow, I had looked through the index to see if any clause is marked ``scope''. As far as I can see, there is no such clause. The Economic Secretary helpfully stated that one should look to clause 20. I looked ahead to that clause, which bears the title ``Regulated activities''. I had already found that title, although it had not occurred to me that it referred to the scope of the Bill. The clause states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An activity is a regulated activity for the purposes of this Act if it is an activity of a specified kind which--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a)Årelates to an investment of a specified kind; or
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b)Åin the case of an activity of a kind which is also specified for the purposes of this paragraph, is carried on in relation to property of any kind.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I assume that money is property of some kind. Will the Minister be kind enough to clarify whether ``property'' as referred to in clause 20 includes money? Property does not necessarily mean money; very often it means material property or chattels.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Or intellectual property.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Or intellectual property. The term ``property of any kind'' might be seen to be wide enough to include money. Will the Economic Secretary clarify that point?

<P>
The Economic Secretary has another answer, however, which is the one that I take to be correct, and she will perhaps confirm my remarks when she has considered the matter. Clause 20 states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```Specified' means specified in an order made by the Treasury.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That means that if the Treasury decides to state by order that banking is a specified activity, it will then become a regulated activity covered by clause 3. Will the Economic Secretary tell us whether that is how banking is intended to be covered? If it is intended to be covered by that method and not by some more exclusive method, where and how are mortgages excluded? It seems entirely open to the Treasury to specify mortgages just as it can specify banking.

<P>
The net result of these provisions is that I am brought back to the same position as that of Lord Eatwell. When he asked questions on 16 March in the Joint Committee, he saw the objective that is clarified--if not defined--in clause 3 as ``rather confusing''. As the object of the Committee stage of a Bill is to try to clarify and improve legislation, I hope that the Economic Secretary will be able to help us on that front. As I said, it would be interesting to hear her explanation. I shall go through my question once again, so that she or those helping her can make notes. Will a French bank that has a presence in London and which is lending money into the United Kingdom that is secured on a property in France be regulated under the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have listened mesmerised by my right hon. and learned Friend's expertise, which he has picked up with remarkable dispatch. I look forward to hearing the Economic Secretary's response. I have a more pedestrian aim, which is to try to get out of the Government the precise limits of the objective in the clause.

<P>
The importance of that is shown by referring back to--without in any sense debating again--clause 2, which specifies the authority's general duties. It states that the authority, in discharging its general functions, must have regard to four objectives, one of which is enumerated at greater length in clause 3. The authority's general functions are defined in general terms in clause 2(4). Those functions consist not only in rule-making, but in the giving of advice and guidance. Clause 2(4)(c) refers to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``its function of determining the general policy and principles by reference to which it performs particular functions.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The wording is somewhat opaque. However, I assume that the reference to ``particular functions'' of the authority means that it must be guided by the objectives in each and every activity that it performs or attempts to perform. That is extremely important, because there are only four of those objects. It follows that if the authority were to step outside those four objects, it would be deemed to be at variance with the requirements of the Bill. We must therefore consider carefully not only what the four objectives are, but their scope. For example, the market confidence object confines the authority to pursuing confidence in the UK financial system only. I have a few questions about that.

<P>
First, although it is plainly sensible to give an organisation responsibility only in areas where it can exert power and influence, we are in an interconnected global system of financial services. To some extent, it may be assumed that we have at least partial responsibility for other jurisdictions if they face the systemic risks or problems that have been outlined by my hon. Friends. One can imagine a situation in which a large foreign bank located in London were to be on the receiving end of enforcement action by the authority. That action could be fully in line with the requirement on the authority to seek to maintain confidence in the UK financial system, and could also be important in pursuing the other objects, such as the protection of consumers and the reduction of financial crime.

<P>
However, in taking such action, the authority could trigger a collapse in the foreign country from which the bank originated. That could be of little concern to the FSA, or indeed to most deposit holders or shareholders in this country. The bank concerned might have liabilities that are owed abroad, and its shareholders may be largely foreign. If the FSA took that action, and triggered a collapse in a foreign country--perhaps a near neighbour such as another EU country--would that not be incompatible with some of the at least presumed responsibilities that we have? Will the Minister comment on the confining of the meaning of the financial system to that of the UK only?

<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Secondly, I note that the regulatory objective of market confidence refers almost entirely to activities. Of course, the given list of meanings of ``financial system'' is not exhaustive, but it nevertheless specifies the important features of the financial system, including financial markets and exchanges, regulated activities and other activities connected with financial markets and exchanges. I wonder whether such a list excludes, at least by implication, the authority seeking to maintain confidence in things other than activities, such as products.

<P>
In the previous debate, the Government were urged to regulate or authorise financial products rather than activities or the process of delivering products. Amendment No. 52 which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats, called on the FSA to improve the quality of investments. I am sure that that is a laudable object--I wish that someone would improve the quality of my investments--but history shows that it is dangerous to assume that Governments can do that. I just remember a Government exhortation for us to buy items such as victory bonds and war loans. The more gullible members of the public did exactly what the Government suggested--

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> And got fleeced.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Indeed--with disastrous results. I cannot remember what 2Ω per cent. consols are now trading at. Perhaps some of my more alert colleagues who trade the markets might know.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not trade the market, but I happen to know that people have recently been making rather a lot of money from buying them--they got so low that they have started to go up. But at the time to which my right hon. Friend refers, it was a matter of patriotism to buy them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. and learned Friend has characteristically piled into them at the very moment that they are going up, but many of the people who were told to buy these wretched Government products during the war and just after were not so lucky. If they are still pathetically holding their war loan, hoping that it will be redeemed at par, they are sadly disillusioned. Of course, they have been very safe. To that extent, they might be said to have been a good investment. I am sure that if the Government were sued for mis-selling those products at the time, they would claim that it was an entirely appropriate and safe investment for widows and orphans. But it has been disastrous in every other way and has performed extremely poorly against equities and other savings products.

<P>
It is therefore important that the Government resist the temptation to attempt to maintain or promote confidence in any sort of financial product. What interests me here is whether any attempt to do so would be compatible with this object, in which case perhaps that is itself an answer to the Liberal Democrats, who wish the FSA to extend its activities in that way.

<P>
I defer to my hon. Friends' knowledgeable points about systemic risk and the need to maintain confidence in the financial market as a whole, which is perfectly true. However, most people in this country would not understand what on earth they were talking about. What they want is confidence not in products--I think that they understand that the Government cannot guarantee that--but in what might be called the micro-economy. Put another way, they would like micro-confidence in the economy. For example, when they receive a share certificate after buying a share, they want to be confident that it represents part of the ownership of a company and that it gives them rights to vote at the end of a general meeting, to receive a dividend and to receive party assets of the company in the case of a wind-up. They also hope that it limits their liability. That is extremely important: before the great company law reforms of the last century, people were very unwilling to invest because it meant unlimited liability. As everyone probably knows, Sir Walter Scott wrote all those wonderful books to discharge the debts that he incurred by being a partner or investor in a publishing company that went bust. It was nothing to do with him, it was not his fault, but he was jointly liable for all those debts. The great step forward was when, under one of the Gladstone Administrations, company law was reformed so that people could not lose more money than they had put into a company in the first place.

<P>
People want to be confident that that remains the case when they buy a share and receive a share certificate. They want to know that when they buy a pension, someone will pay them the money or buy the annuity for them when they retire. When they buy a savings product such as a unit trust or an investment trust, they want to be reasonably confident that the organisation concerned invests in the products or in the shares that have been advertised. That is the sort of market confidence that people want, and it appears to be covered by the clause. But so does a lot else beside. Clause 3(2)(c) seems to cover just about everything; it states that the definition of the financial system includes:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other activities connected with financial markets and exchanges''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That seems to encompass everything that we do with money every day of our lives. When we draw money out of a bank, put money in or buy practically anything, we are undertaking an activity connected with a financial market or an exchange.

<P>
On the face of it, the clause is not very helpful because it does not seem to limit anything, but if it does, it would be useful to know what those limitations are. If it is entirely unrestricted, the authority must spread its wings, or it might be assumed to take on objectives and responsibilities that go well beyond what we have always assumed are connected with market confidence in the more traditional sense.

<P>
There is more in the clause than initially meets the eye. We are right to concentrate on it, because we shall soon be leaving the part of the Bill that deals with the authority's general duties. These provisions are of overriding importance; they set the tone of the FSA and represent standards against which the authority and, perhaps, conflicting objectives, will be judged in future. A response to these and other matters raised by my colleagues will be very welcome.

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been an interesting hour and a half, or so. It confirms my view that the sooner we modernise the hours of the House of Commons, the better it will be for the quality of our debate.

<P>
The questions raised by Opposition Members at considerable length are nothing like as difficult as has been suggested. The financial system includes, but is wider than, the three specific activities or matters referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). In other words, the financial system includes regulated activities, but is wider than regulated activities. It includes banking, not simply because some of the activities of banks fall within paragraphs (a) and/or (b) and/or (c), but because banking is part of the financial system in the natural meaning of those words.

<P>
Market confidence is not the same in terms of competitiveness; it is a matter in its own right, and is properly singled out in the clause. Market confidence includes, but is wider than, managing systemic risk. As Howard Davies said in evidence to the Joint Committee, market confidence includes maintaining confidence in fair prices, the operating of clean, honest orderly markets and proper supervision of institutions' credentials. So market confidence includes the management of systemic risk and maintaining the standards of the system as a whole, but it is not confined to that.

<P>
As the memorandum of understanding clearly states, managing financial stability is a common objective of the three institutions whose roles and responsibilities are clearly delineated in that memorandum. The FSA has a role in helping to maintain financial stability, but it is not the only institution with such a responsibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No. I gave way extensively in the debate on the amendment, and, if I may say so, a great deal of time has been wasted on this matter. I sympathise with the desire to deal with clause 20, but we would do better to debate it at the appropriate time. Clause 3 sets a clear objective to which, under clause 2, the FSA must pay regard as far as possible in discharging all its other powers and responsibilities under the Bill and, therefore, I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry to have to speak again. I want only to raise an issue that I would have mentioned in an intervention in response to the Economic Secretary. It is absurd to suggest that a great deal of our time has been wasted debating systemic risk. The management of systemic risk in the British banking system is one of the most fundamental matters that could be brought before the House of Commons. The Bill will alter the management of that risk, and we are trying to examine exactly how it will do so.

<P>
The Economic Secretary has not responded to my argument that systemic risk is, in a sense, more important than the other objectives that are listed and, therefore, making it part of market confidence, alongside three other objectives, represents a lack of clarity in the Bill. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has said, that is exactly what Lord Eatwell thinks. He said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I see that objective''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
that of market confidence--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as rather confusing because it is a bundle of things. I thought one of the main tasks of the regulator was to manage systemic risk, yet it is extraordinarily odd that our regulator is not told to do this. Now you are telling me that it is bundled into market confidence but it is put in with all these others aspects of market abuse''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
by which he meant the other three objectives. He continued:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is quite different from market abuse. Do you think that there should be a clear objective of managing systemic risk?''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
He was asking an important question, but Howard Davies did not give a proper answer to it during the Joint Committee's examination; nor has the Economic Secretary attempted to answer it--she has made disparaging and dismissive remarks.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because I wanted to ask the Economic Secretary--who made it clear that she would not give way--why mortgages are not covered. Did my hon. Friend understand her to say that the financial system, in the natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase, plainly covered the banking system, with which I would entirely agree? I do not understand why it does not also cover the mortgage system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am not sure about that; I have not really got a full grip on the Economic Secretary's response to the points that my right hon. and learned Friend made. Perhaps I am being generous--I do not think that she tried to deal with that important point, which must be clarified.

<P>
I should like to add to the other issues that I raised, because the Economic Secretary made no effort to answer them. When does a bank failure become a banking failure? When does a bank failure become a systemic risk failure for the purposes of the Bill? Those matters have not been made clear in the context of the memorandum of understanding, and an explanation should be demanded of the Government.

Question put and agreed to.
