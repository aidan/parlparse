<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence, I have an announcement. Amendment No. 584, which was tabled on Friday, should not have appeared on the amendment paper this morning since the Committee agreed clause 77 last week. We shall therefore begin with new clauses. Revised groupings are issued this morning; the paper issued yesterday grouped amendments Nos. 310 to 317 under schedules 4 and 5, but they were debated on 6 June on clause 90 and should not have appeared again.
<P>
We now come to new clause 19.
<H4><center>New clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Consultation with Local Commissioner</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``.—(1) If, at any stage in the course of conducting an investigation under section 55, an ethical standards officer forms the opinion that the matters which are the subject of the investigation relate partly to a matter which could be the subject of an investigation under Part III of the Local Government Act 1974, he may consult the appropriate Local Commissioner about the investigation and, if he considers it necessary, inform any person who made the allegation which gave rise to the investigation of the steps necessary to initiate a complaint under Part III of that Act.
<P>
(2) If, at any stage in the course of conducting an investigation under Part III of that Act, a Local Commissioner forms the opinion that the complaint relates partly to a matter which could be the subject of an investigation under section 55 of this Act, he may consult the Standards Board for England about the investigation and, if he considers it necessary, inform the person initiating the complaint of the steps necessary to make an allegation under section 54.
<P>
(3) Consultation under subsection (1) or (2) may relate to any matter concerned with the investigation, including—
<P>
(a) the conduct of the investigation, and
<P>
(b) the form, content and publication of any report relating to the investigation.
<P>
(4) Nothing in section 32(2) of the Local Government Act 1974 or section 59(1) of this Act shall apply in relation to the disclosure of information in the course of consultation held in accordance with this section.
<P>
(5) In this section ``Local Commissioner'' has the same meaning as in Part III of the Local Government Act 1974.''.—[Ms Beverley Hughes.]<P>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Under your excellent chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien, we made rapid progress last week and we have therefore almost concluded consideration of part III of the Bill. There are two further matters. The first is new clause 19, which gives ethical standards officers the power to consult with the ombudsman. This provision has been agreed with the ombudsman. It is important that ethical standards officers can, when necessary, call on the experience of other bodies, including the ombudsman and, where appropriate, discuss specific cases with them. New clause 19 provides for that. This provision will, where appropriate, enable ethical standards officers to form close working relationships with the ombudsman and, therefore, facilitate the work of both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): We have no difficulty with the new clause, which is relatively sensible. Effectively, it provides a link where one is missing. Will the Minister give the Committee an example of the sort of case that an ethical standards officer would refer to a local commissioner? It is difficult to look at this in writing and envisage the sort of circumstances that will be covered by the clause. It might be helpful to see exactly what the draftsman had in mind, if not today, perhaps in the form of a letter.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I will certainly be happy to reply more fully in a letter. There will be cases in which the remit of the ethical standards officer investigating allegations of misconduct by individuals overlaps with that of the local commissioner, where the maladministration is on the part of the local authority. One can envisage cases of that sort in which consultation would be appropriate and I shall be happy to provide some examples in due course.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.
<H4><center>New clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restitution order</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where matters considered by an interim tribunal or a case tribunal are or become the subject of criminal proceedings in a court, it shall be open to that court, in considering any penalty resulting from verdict of guilty, to apply a requirement, as part of any penalty, that a restitution order be made so that any loss to the local taxpayer is repaid.''.—[Mr. Waterson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is one of the Opposition's new clauses. We are having the debate the wrong way round. It might have made more sense to debate the abolition of surcharging first. The new clause is aimed at filling a gap that might be left by the abolition of surcharging, which we shall deal with when we reach clauses 84 and 85.
<P>
There is a consensus throughout local government that surcharging is a blunt instrument and that it should go. However, the principle underlying it—that wrongdoers should pick up the bill for their misdeeds and the problems that they cause for local taxpayers—is not wrong. It is a sound principle and I am open to the Minister's suggestions as to how to approach it more effectively.
<P>
The new clause would ensure that, when someone is found guilty in criminal proceedings, the court can apply a restitution order to reimburse local taxpayers. In a sense, the Government have already accepted the broad principle underlying this and a subsequent new clause—that a financial penalty or restitution should be applied. In another context, the Government tabled their own provision on paying compensation in the event of maladministration. That is right and it mirrors our new clause: the basic principle is the same.
<P>
The new clause would probably need to be invoked only rarely: because it would apply to criminal proceedings, a higher standard of proof would be required within the audit system, for example, so the risk of injustice or unfairness would be minimised. It would provide reassurance to local taxpayers that elected representatives who abused their position or were simply incompetent would not get away scot-free. A financial penalty may, albeit only rarely, be appropriate. It is right that a criminal court deals with such serious cases. I cannot imagine that the Minister would have any problem with the broad principle underlying the new clause, but with the battery of advice and expertise at her back, she may well find a better way of approaching the problem.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The new clause is interesting and many Committee members will agree with the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. When wrongdoing has led to criminal proceedings, the principle of having a mechanism for restitution—either to the council as a whole or to individual members of the pubic—is right.
<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is aware of the recent case at Broadlands council, whose chief executive—with the support of the Conservative group on that authority—took actions, including opening her mail, against a Labour member of the authority, which were subsequently found to be unlawful. The council had to pay £20,000 to the aggrieved Labour member. That was a substantial loss of council income and, following the hon. Gentleman's line of argument, the Conservative members on that authority who approved the chief executive's actions should be held to account.
<P>
We must remember that the new ethical framework is not of itself aimed at tackling criminal issues. Where criminal misconduct is suspected or uncovered in a case referred to the Standards Board, it would be passed to the appropriate authority—usually the police—to deal with. As the new clause implies, that could arise in particularly serious cases in which an interim case tribunal considers suspension and it subsequently becomes a matter of criminal investigation.
<P>
However, when the actions of a councillor, councillors or political groups on a council have resulted in financial loss to the authority, the courts are already able to order restitution from the council, if they consider it appropriate. That does not prevent the authority from separately seeking to recover losses arising from misconduct, which they may do either through a compensation order in criminal cases or through civil action proceedings. With his legal expertise, the hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the powers that criminal courts possess—including compensation, confiscation and restitution orders—to recover losses in various circumstances. As I said, they are over and above the civil proceedings that councils may wish to instigate in non-criminal cases.
<P>
We agree with the spirit of the new clause and with many of the hon. Gentleman's comments. However, the powers open to the courts and the avenues open to councils through civil proceedings already provide sufficient mechanisms for councils to pursue compensation and restitution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am still minded to withdraw the new clause, but I remain concerned about some of the Minister's remarks. She tried to make an uncharacteristically cheap party-political point about Broadlands council.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It is a serious matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not aware of the details and I am certainly not going to comment on it. It would be relevant to the new clause only if there had been criminal charges in that case. [Interruption.] The Minister may refer to a court judgment, but I assume that she means a civil court. For the new clause to be appropriate, there has to be a successful criminal prosecution—not civil proceedings. In other words, there must be a conviction based on the standard of proof required in criminal cases in this country.
<P>
I hear what the Minister says about civil proceedings and it may be open to councils to start them for recovery, but the point of the new clause is that it would be more convenient and appropriate to deal with it at the same time in the same case by the same court. It could be more dangerous for the people involved if the case were dealt with by a wholly different court, which might reach a different conclusion based on the same evidence.
<P>
We disagree with the Minister that the circumstances are covered by existing law. In any event, the new clause is important symbolically to make it clear that the abolition of surcharge does not give a green light to anyone who might be contemplating corrupt actions. Nevertheless, I am relieved that the Minister accepts the principles behind the new clause and we may return to the issue later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Clause 84</center></H4>
<H4><center>Surcharge etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<P>

<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 518, in page 57, line 9, leave out `and (5)(b)' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5)(b), (7) and (8)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to clause 84, which repeals the surcharge provisions in sections 17 and 18 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It is a technical amendment to ensure that the appropriate provisions—
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Can the Minister assure the Committee that she has checked the accuracy of the amendment? If she wants to omit subsection (8), can she tell me where it appears in the Audit Commission Act, 1998?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I cannot go into too much detail. I never pretend that I know whether a technical amendment is correct. We employ parliamentary counsel to check such matters, which are frequently a mystery to me. However, I am told that subsection (8) was inserted into the Audit Commission Act by the Greater London Authority Act 1999.
<P>
Amendment No. 518 is a technical amendment to add a missed reference and ensure that all the appropriate subsections of section 17 are repealed.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We accept that this is a purely technical amendment. However, it was a bit worrying that the Minister did not know the answer to that question. Committees are the last line of defence against sloppy legislation and I would hate to think that a court case could take place because nobody knew where the subsection was. However, I am sure that if a draftsman says that something is right, it must be so. I now flag up the possibility of a short stand part debate on the clause.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> In many senses, this is an historic occasion. We are repealing the surcharge provisions in the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the Secretary of State's power to sanction an item of account. Surcharge has caused much excitement over the years. We might best remember the issue from way back in the Clay Cross case. I will not mention the other case involving surcharge that people remember and about which they are concerned. All that I will say is that proceedings currently before courts will continue to be subject to the legislation that was current when those cases commenced.
<P>
The Nolan committee recommended the repeal of surcharge. The operation of surcharge allows financial penalties to be imposed that bear little relation to the gravity of individuals' misconduct. One of the many reasons for introducing the new ethical framework was to remove such anachronisms and eliminate the difference between local and central Government approaches to punishing financial wrongdoing.
<P>
Nolan recommended repealing surcharge because it was unfair for local government officers and members to be subject to surcharge when other public servants were not. The law was defective and although surcharge was in theory a means of restitution, that was not the case in practice. There were technical difficulties in calculating the relevant sums, which were often beyond the means of the individuals involved and bore no relation to people's ability to pay or their culpability.
<P>
We have considered those arguments and we agree that the surcharge provisions in sections 17 and 18 of the 1998 Act should be repealed. Removing the relevant surcharge provision from section 17 of the 1998 Act does not affect the auditor's ability to apply to the courts for a declaration that an item account is contrary to law. I have been deliberative about that point to ensure that the hon. Member for Eastbourne appreciates that the auditor will still have that power.
<P>
Under the new arrangement, the Standards Board and adjudication panel rather than the auditor will determine whether there has been misconduct and any issue subsequently will be pursued through them. These changes affect all the bodies to which surcharge provisions currently apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I thought it was right for us to have a short debate on this because, to the untutored eye, these matters look fairly technical. We are, in a sense, drawing a line under a longish period of surcharging in English law and British local government. Not many tears will be shed at the wake, but it is important that we mark its passing in some way.
<P>
As I said a moment ago in a different context, it is common ground across parties and local government that the day of surcharging has gone, although the principle behind it is still important. There should be some mechanism for financial punishment of wrongdoing. The problem with surcharging, as the Minister said, has always been that it is a blunt instrument. Sometimes people can blunder into doing something and almost biblical punishment is rained down on them in the shape of surcharging.
<P>
It has also contributed to a large body of law on the issue of ultra vires. We spent much time on part I of the Bill debating the new power and the question of ultra vires. But the reason that it is engraved on the souls of most local councillors is, I suspect, mostly because of the dangers of surcharging. The Minister was delicate enough not to go into too many details about recent cases that have brought the concept into disrepute on grounds of procedure, cost and general inappropriateness to the needs of modern local government. We saw what happened in such places as Hammersmith and Fulham over interest swaps and so on, which seemed like a good idea at the time but went disastrously wrong.
<P>
At the moment, the district auditor has a duty to surcharge anyone who is responsible by wilful misconduct for a loss or deficiency. There is a great body of law also about the meaning of wilful misconduct and the Minister referred to the fact that the auditor will still have some power to deal with items that he or she does not find appropriate. However, clause 84 removes the ability to impose the surcharge. There remains the possibility of declaring an item of expenditure to be contrary to law but, according to the Library brief, it would be for the Standards Board and the adjudication panel to decide whether there had been misconduct and what, if any, action should be taken.
<P>
I am also informed that the amendment would remove the reasonable belief defence under the 1998 Act, which, again, many people consider is simply not sustainable in the modern world. It will be interesting to see whether the provisions that are being made in other parts of the Bill will fill the entire gap left by surcharging, but neither Opposition nor Government members of the Committee will shed a tear at its passing.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 84, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 85 and 78 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 79</center></H4>
<H4><center>Options for elections</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I thought that it might be appropriate to have a short debate on the options in the clause, although our main debate will be on clause 80.
<P>
The clause sets out three options for schemes for the election of councillors, two of which—elections every year and the all-out system—are already used by some councils. Having experienced both systems, I know their pluses and minuses. Many years ago, I was a councillor in Hammersmith and Fulham, which had the all-out election system that we will discuss in more detail on later clauses. It produces some certainty in council policy for a significant period because those in control of the council—assuming that someone is in control—can plan ahead and that is a good thing. However, it also means vast swings backwards and forwards. [Interruption.] I hear murmurs of assent, although they may have been the opposite, from former members of local government. In London, there were enormous swings, contrary to the swings in national politics at the time. Good, experienced councillors were swept out of office simply because the Government of the day were unpopular, or vice versa.
<P>
In Eastbourne, there are elections every year—we may discuss voter fatigue in more detail later. It is one way of keeping a finely honed, lean, mean, election-fighting machine going, but it causes problems on the local council because, for some of the year, councils do not necessarily behave as responsibly as they should in looking to the future. With Liberal Democrats on the other side, people are constantly jockeying for position and looking ahead to the next election, which will inevitably be the coming May. The Liberals of Eastbourne have now returned to opposition, probably with some relief, because it is their natural metier.
<P>
There are genuine problems with both systems; it is interesting that the Government are introducing a further option—the second option in clause 79—of a term of office of four years and elections every other year for half the council in each of those other-year elections. I hope that that has made it simple, straightforward and easy to understand. It is a new system. The Minister may tell us if it is an import from another country or countries and, if so, what is their experience of the system. It seems to be regarded as a half-way house between the two options, which is the only thing to commend it. I should like to know why the Minister recommends it as a third option when local government has happily existed with one of the previous two options for a long time.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I shall be brief because, as the hon. Gentleman said, there will be a more extensive debate on clauses 80 and 81.
<P>
I shall make two or three points now: first, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that different systems have different strengths and weaknesses. I am not sure that election turnout is the most relevant criterion for assessing the benefits of the systems, but different systems perhaps offer more accountability and transparency to the electorate. We shall doubtless debate that later.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, we are talking about an enabling power. The Government are not proposing in the Bill to bring those schemes into force. We recognise that a cautious approach is needed. The extent of the changes with which local authorities have already had to grapple means that it is sensible for us to take our time to consider whether the election schemes in particular areas should change.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): In the Green Paper, the Government said that they were minded to implement a system of retirement by thirds. The gist was that that would prevent council leaders from sleeping easily in their beds. What has happened since to make the Government, in these exceptional circumstances, retreat from being prescriptive? They cannot quite persuade themselves to abandon the possibility of being prescriptive later.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> As I heard one of my hon. Friends say from a sedentary position, ``You can't win.'' It seems that that is sometimes the case with the Opposition. I was talking not about retreating from that position, which we are still minded to implement, but about timing and recognising that to change election systems is significant. It is right that we take time to do that.
<P>
My third point relates to the second alternative outlined in the clause, which the hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned. That option is not an import from elsewhere. It is simply a mechanism that is designed to achieve broadly the same aim as annual elections, in areas where there are two tiers of local government—a district and a county. By having elections by halves in those areas, we achieve a system that is similar, but recognises that there are two different layers in the local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I do not understand a single syllable of what the hon. Lady has just said. Could she try to translate it into English? It does not make sense in any known language. She was explaining why halves were somehow equivalent to something in a two-tier system. I simply do not understand what she is getting at.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman reads Hansard, he will find that it makes sense. I am sorry that he could not work out the logic of what I was saying. Let us start from the experience of the electorate and how often they vote. An election by halves in two-tier areas provides an annual opportunity to go to the ballot box, in the same way that an election by thirds does in other areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I assume that electors enjoy voting so much and it is such a popular activity that they must have the opportunity to vote every year. Therefore, in a two-tier system, the hon. Lady will ensure that they vote for the district, then the county, then the district and so on. That will be a wonderful form of entertainment. It is just as well that she believes that turnout does not matter.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I have never said that turnout does not matter. I said that the evidence on the relationship between election systems and turnout was not clear. However, there is an equally important reason why we should give people more opportunities to go to the ballot box—accountability. That is the strength of our argument.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> In moving the amendments, I am expressing the hope that we can have a wide-ranging debate on the principle of the clause and, as is our practice in this Committee, obviate the need for a stand part debate. Sharp-eyed members of the Committee might have noticed that amendments Nos. 21 and 342 are identical. That was simply to ensure that officials were on their toes. I hope that the Minister's briefing reflects the fact that the amendments are identical. We should at least thank our lucky stars that they were grouped together, or we might have had a ``Groundhog Day'' experience and had to repeat the debate—how unlike our usual deliberations in Committee that would have been.
<P>
The clause and those that follow it are all too typical of the Government: we are back to control freakery with a vengeance—[Hon. Members: ``Oh!''] Ignore the farmyard noises of Labour Members, Mr. O'Brien. The Government believe that voting is good for people, and that elections should be held as often as possible. The Under-Secretary, who has left the room for the moment spoke about an annual ``opportunity'' to vote. She lives in the bizarre, unreal world of new Labour thinkers, in which the great British public lust after every opportunity to cast their votes in the village hall. Well, it ain't necessarily so. We have had long discussions about turnouts, but the Government's philosophy on elections seems to be the more, the merrier; they hope that more people will vote if they have more opportunities to do so. That is a curious approach, one that is worthy of debate and requires some pretty hefty justification.
<P>
Clause 80 gives the Secretary of State the power to change the frequency and timing of council elections and, in effect, to dictate whether councils use the all-out basis of every four years, as in London boroughs; the thirds system, as used in many areas; or the wholly new half-and-half system that foxed my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)—and who can blame him? The Minister may talk about the provisions being enabling provisions, which is technically and literally true, but that is only part of the story. As my right hon. Friend immediately spotted, the Government are absolutely committed to having more frequent elections in parts of the country that do not have an annual opportunity, to use that phrase again. They regard it as a way to revitalise local democracy.
<P>
Let us consider some of the comments made to the Joint Select Committee. No evidence suggests that that policy will increase turnout, any more than evidence suggests that the concept of directly elected mayors will do so. With a uniform lack of success where Ministers are concerned, we keep trying to get the point across that people must have reason to go out and vote in the first place: they are not interested in structures or the annual opportunity that the Government, in their munificence, give them; they have to feel that it is worth their while to get out of their house, pub or place of work to go down the road and vote, because it affects their lives directly and intimately. They must think that voting is important, either because they are angry about something or happy about and supportive of something.
<P>
Many shire areas and places such as Eastbourne already have annual elections. I do not think that there is evidence that that has fostered greater enthusiasm among voters. What evidence does the Minister have? The Government are looking down the wrong end of the telescope. They think that by fiddling around with procedures and election frequency, they can magically increase voter participation. We have serious doubts that enthusiasm will increase unless the Government stop telling local government how to organise itself and how to organise elections, and start to give it real powers and decision-making abilities.
<P>
The thrust of our amendments is that the Government could usefully start by allowing local councillors to choose their election systems themselves. Why should it matter if in Wandsworth, for example, elections are held every year, while Lambeth, next door, has a different system? Why should it make any difference if that is what suits the people of a particular local authority area or the local council? I do not believe that a one-size-fits-all approach is necessary. As long as the election system is democratic, open and credible, why should all councils follow the same system? It is rather worrying that the Government are, in effect, taking powers to determine the timing and frequency of elections, not simply for a category of councils or for all councils, but for individual local councils.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, we must be clear about what we are debating. We not debating merely giving a Minister the powers in light of the fact that the Government are going to consider the matter and that the approach will be carefully thought-out and, to use the Minister's word, ``cautious''. The Government have already signalled their clear intention, when they said in ``Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People''—unconscious humour—that they intend to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make this the standard pattern of elections for all unitary councils in future, including London Boroughs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unless the Minister is resiling from that and saying that she has in fact thought better of it, that is the Government's intention. They have already made up their minds. The idea that, on this or any other important aspect of the Bill, the Government have anything but a closed mind is simply risible. They have a clear notion of local councils run on new Labour, modernised, holistic, lines, that will have people flocking to the ballot box year after year, simply as a result of the wonderful new system that they are introducing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): As ever, I am entertained by the hon. Gentleman, but he is discussing serious matters, and the Committee would like to contribute. Will he at some point discuss accountability? What he is saying about turnout contains much truth, but does he not feel that it is important for everyone engaged in democracy to find a way of holding representatives to account? The question of accountability might be better attended to more, rather than less, often, for example, through annual elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks with great experience of local government. I should make it clear that, as I thought that I had already said, everything I say is intended to be serious. Perhaps my natural bubbling good humour undermines my arguments on occasion.
<P>
Why are people not to be able to make up their own mind? I openly debated my own experience of being on a council with an all-out system and of representing a constituency that holds elections every year. Each of those systems has advantages and drawbacks, as all will agree, so why are local areas not to be able to make up their own mind?
<P>
We can tinker with the frequency of elections, with voting in supermarkets, and with all sorts of exciting ways of allowing people to vote, but, as we have found, with the single exception of 100 per cent. postal ballots, none of them work. We even went to the trouble of creating a high profile, exciting, heart-stopping mayoral election in London, with all the trimmings—including fireworks—but still hardly any more people bothered to vote. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree—no doubt he will intervene again if he does not—that such tinkering will not, in itself, do the trick. People must have a reason to vote; whether they do so annually, every four years or every two years is secondary to my case.
<P>
I see no reason why all councils should take the same approach. Why has the Minister reached that view? Why should not neighbouring councils adopt different systems to each other? The amendments attempt to deal with three matters. First, local councils should have a right to veto the Secretary of State's proposals. Secondly, the authority should be empowered to be proactive and petition the Secretary of State to introduce a particular system from the menu of three options—the Government are keen on having three options; I do not know why. Thirdly, a local authority should be allowed to consult with its electorate and the results of that consultation should be allowed to feed in to the decision. In all those ways, the Secretary of State's untrammelled powers to intervene would be reined in and local people would have a greater say.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is interesting and instructive to look at some of the comments made in July last year in the report of the Joint Select Committee. It listened to the Government's arguments that the provisions under discussion, and those for directly elected mayors would increase voter turnouts. Paragraph 161 of the report states: ``Even they''—the Government—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>however, are more confident of the diagnosis than the prescription.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It referred, inevitably, to Professor Stoker, who said, in his evidence that the current system
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has ``now virtually lost all democratic legitimacy. Since 1973 in metropolitan districts turnouts have bumped along at about the mid-„30s level . . . We know from another survey that has been undertaken that less than 12 per cent. of 18–24-year-olds actually claim to have voted in local government elections.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee commented somewhat sharply on Professor Stoker's evidence by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>He had no truck with the argument that it might be the decline in local authority power that caused the lack of interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a significant point, which, to some extent, I have made already. Clearly, if one is signed up to the new Labour, new local government network view of life, no matter how eccentric it may sometimes seem, one cannot accept for a moment that turnouts are affected by lack of power and decision-making by local government. We are not here to discuss Conservative party policy for the next election, but we believe that when people do not see the relevance of local authorities and what they do, that becomes precisely the issue. I have referred before to the hole-„in-the-road test, whereby people cannot determine easily which local authority is responsible for a particular problem. When a locality has more than one local authority, people have massive problems—sometimes exploited by Liberal Democrats in their leaflets—identifying which council is responsible for a particular activity. All Committee members will have encountered that problem on the doorstep.
<P>
I should also refer to Professor Stewart's evidence. It seems that Professor Stoker and Professor Stewart are joined at the hip, as no paragraph in the report that deals with the evidence of one fails subsequently to deal with the evidence of the other. Professor Stewart took the view that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>even in the 1930s turnout in local authority elections was in the 30 to 40 per cent. range.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In some cases, therefore, it may have been a bit higher than it is now. In his words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there was no golden age of turnout.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As we have heard before, he asserted that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is no firm evidence that elected mayors would have an effect on turnout.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With an interesting degree of foresight, the Committee states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The effect of direct election of a mayor on voter turnout will to some extent be tested, in London in May 2000.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How right it was.
<P>
More recently expressed concerns about the changes are also significant. The Local Government Information Unit said in one of its briefings:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We continue to be concerned that the powers given to future Secretaries of State are too wide.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is our concern, too, which is why we tabled the amendments. The unit goes on to state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the legislation could allow for councils to be able to apply to change their electoral arrangements to the Electoral Commission or the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of our amendments tried to deal with that. The unit concludes by stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The powers of the Secretary of the State should be limited to changing the pattern of elections by categories of council, not by individual councils as proposed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important that the Minister should justify why Ministers want the power to order a specific council rather than a category of council to change its arrangements.
<P>
In many ways, one of the most interesting submissions on the subject of elections that we received was from SOLACE, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives—[Interruption]. I am sorry; I did not hear what the Minister muttered, but no doubt we shall hear it in full voice when she winds up the debate. The chief executives are worth listening to, not least because they have to make the arrangements work in practice. They mention election fatigue among voters. I have yet to see any definitive evidence one way or another, but I cannot believe that the might of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has not been able to point the way as to whether the so-called annual opportunity increases or depresses turnout or is wholly neutral in its effect.
<P>
SOLACE states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we must increase interest in local government but generally speaking people in this country do not like constant elections.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is some truth in that. It talks about the problem of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Artificial boundaries, particularly in rural areas. If new schemes are to be introduced then multi-Member wards sometimes have to be imposed somewhat forcefully in rural areas which often causes resentment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
SOLACE is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>sure that parties will receive complaints from their local workers in that they get fed-up with too much campaigning.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure that SOLACE knows the mind of the average political activist, who is lost and rudderless if he does not have an election to fight and centre his life around. There is a slight air of unreality when the submission continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thus, for example, a particular party with a limited number of workers— {**w4.**}
<P>
</UL></FONT>I wonder which party it has in mind? I thought that every party had a limited number of workers—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would prefer spread-out elections that enables them to get their team working in different wards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not agree. It suggests that there might be a rolling programme of elections, rather like what happened 200 or 300 years ago, when general elections would take weeks and the results would come in from around the country on a rolling basis. No one seems to have thought about the results from one area affecting those in another.
<P>
SOLACE continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For authorities to move from 4 year to, say, a 2 year cycle would increase costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be interested to hear what work the Department has carried out on costs, given SOLACE adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>increased costs appear to be a greatly forgotten area of the modernising agenda.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amen to that.
<P>
SOLACE goes on to make the following worrying comment, which its representatives repeated when they came to see me:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Overall, there seems to be a striking lack of linkage to Home Office legislation relating to elections . . . there is a general feeling amongst most Chief Executives that the number of Councillors in local authorities should be reduced as we move to a new model of executive and scrutiny.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That brings me on to an issue to which we will return, which is whether the Government have yet another secret agenda to reduce the number of councillors in some councils. We discussed that in the context of the long-term effect of changing structures and having two tiers of councillors, including one that finds itself on the back benches, as it were, with no real role. It has always seemed to us that the inevitable consequence must be fewer councillors. We have tabled an amendment to deal with that elsewhere, so I merely flag the point up rather than labour it now.
<P>
We know that the Government are committed to annual elections. It is pointless of them to suggest that that is not true, as the commitment was in their election manifesto. They want to make that ``the standard pattern''. They want to increase the frequency of elections in most councils. As we have heard, the notion of the third option—in effect, the second option—is that in two-tier areas the pattern would be of half the councillors being elected in alternate years to the relevant councils.
<P>
The part II provisions about new executive forms do not make it clear whether Ministers envisage changes in the numbers of councillors elected to councils in their new roles, and nor does part IV. The Library research paper states, with its usual delicacy:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It might be argued that fewer councillors are necessary to carry out the different scrutiny and representative roles envisaged as part of the new executive arrangements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is spot on. It is high time that Ministers came clean about that part of their agenda for local government. Things are bad enough as they are, given the groundswell of opposition, complaint and criticism about the Bill among councillors, including many Labour councillors. That would become even worse if it became apparent that the Government had it in mind to slim down the size of the authorities, because all the decisions that matter will be made by no more than 10 people. The other councillors, apart from those fortunate enough to sit on scrutiny committees, will have nothing much to do.
<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee. They make three genuine attempts to limit the Secretary of State, who is asking for extremely sweeping powers to impose on individual councils, let alone groups or categories of them, about the timing and frequency of council elections. With the appropriate safeguards, we feel that local councillors themselves should make the decision. Over many years, people have evolved systems that to suit local conditions well. Some may want to change those systems, in which case we think that they should be able to petition the Secretary of State.
<P>
Why should the Secretary of State seek such draconian powers if it is not to impose yet another part of new Labour's dreadful modernising agenda on local government? No one really wants the annual opportunity, to use the Under-Secretary's phrase, of going to the ballot box to vote for a council that, under this Government, will have less power and authority to make decisions for local people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I listened to the hon. Member for Eastbourne with considerable interest, even though he laboured long and hard to make relatively few points. As I understand it, he is not sure which of the Government's three election options he prefers. He believes that there is no evidence that changing election frequency will have a direct impact on turnout, and is concerned that there might be a secret Government agenda to reduce the number of councillors.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to make rather too brief comments about the central thrust of his amendments. I agree that neither his nor my views really matter, nor should the Secretary of State's view matter. What should matter are the views of the local electors in specific areas.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am delighted by the Minister's response. It is important to ensure that the matter will simply be determined by the Secretary of State after detailed consultation at a local level. We will need an assurance from the Minister that the Secretary of State will not impose a specific way of carrying out the elections in a given local authority area without being certain of the views of local electors.
<P>
The issue is simple. I know which of the three options should be adopted in my local authority area, but I would not dream of discussing it now. It is not relevant to our discussions what I think should happen in Eastbourne or elsewhere. Such matters should be determined at local level. The hon. Member for Eastbourne believes that the Government have a secret agenda to reduce the number of councillors. Does he agree that the starting point from which to consider whether there are too many elected representatives might be this place, rather than local government? If he presses the amendment to a Division, he will have my support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister's watchword is ``accountability'', which, she says, will be enhanced by the opportunity to hold annual elections. I am not misquoting or misinterpreting the hon. Lady's remarks. It is interesting that, over the past three years, the Government have created several elected bodies and, curiously, none of them have elections by thirds. The Scottish Parliament does not. If accountability is at the heart of the clause, it is strange that the Government did not consider that Scottish people should have enhanced accountability. They have even retreated from that by introducing an element of proportionality into the measure. The Welsh Assembly is, after all, only a big county council; it is not even an important county council, yet it does not hold elections by thirds.
<P>
People are not elected by thirds to enhance accountability, so why the sudden enthusiasm for accountability in local government and the belief that one particular mechanism delivers it, when that has not been apparent up to now? If the Government are silly enough to create regional assemblies for which the demand is confined largely to a handful of people in Newcastle, will elections by a third be held to those assemblies to enhance accountability? Suddenly we face the onset of accountability-itis in local government. Will it work? Why do the Government want it? What the Minister is really saying in the Green Paper is that too many councils are dominated by one party, that they have tended to be corrupt councils, and that the Government want to ensure that their leaders do not have the certainty—[Interruption.] The Minister mutters, as she frequently does, but she knows that that is the logic behind her argument. If she reads her own Green Paper, she will find that that is spelled out clearly.
<P>
If annual elections will be helpful, such a mechanism does not need to be introduced. In my part of the world, we hold annual elections in practice, because the county council goes to the electorate every four years as prescribed under legislation. Craven district council and Harrogate district council are elected by thirds. They could apply to change that electoral system, but that would be their choice, and it should remain their choice. There are annual elections. [Interruption.] The Minister continues to mutter in a gravelly voice.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman telling me that I have missed something—that there is choice about when the county councils hold elections?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I said that the county councils have to hold elections every four years according to legislation. The Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary, said that the Government want the opportunity to hold annual election. I was merely saying that intervention by the Government is not necessary in my constituency to achieve that result because, in practice, the system delivers it and balances it between the district and the council authority, which was a point made by the hon. Lady earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that we must always bear in mind that other elections will take place, such as the parliamentary election, the European Parliament elections and, possibly before long, regional government elections?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to draw my attention to such matters. People are not elected in parliamentary elections by a third. Accountability for national Government does not require people to go the polls annually. The European Parliament's election system, which was introduced by the Government, is an absolute negation of accountability on a regional list. There is not even a political mechanism for reporting back, yet the Minister has the gall to talk about accountability. The introduction of such an abomination of an electoral system for the European Parliament produced exactly the result that was anticipated—a tiny turnout. It so happened that that worked to the advantage of my party, for which I am grateful. Some districts in my constituency had turnouts of about 46 per cent., but, on average, the election turnout was pitiful.
<P>
By definition, annual elections diminish what is at stake and, as a result, lack of interest, not accountability, will be achieved. People vote when something is at stake. All the evidence shows that people vote to change matters. If there is all-out voting in a local authority, even with its restricted powers, issues may cause local agitation and people will want to vote about them. Election via thirds is almost calculated to remove the ability to make a difference, which must be at the heart of the willingness of voters to participate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath would not presume to make a prescription, nor would I. It is up to my electorate and my council to decide what suits them. All-out voting every four years is the most likely system under which something will be at stake. If I had to choose a system, it would be single-member wards because it would bring that about. The matter brings us to what should be done before the Government can make a move—re-warding. There is the most appalling disequilibrium in wards. I have taken the precaution of checking my facts: the smallest electoral division in north Yorkshire county council—[Interruption.] The Minister chortles, but I am a journalist by trade and I like to ensure that my facts are as up to date as possible.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That is not normal for someone in that profession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> For those of us who have worked on the Financial Times, such a practice is normal, although it may not be common.
<P>
The Fulford ward, which ironically does not include Fulford, has an electorate of 1,040. The Huntington North ward, which does not include Huntington, has an electorate of 872. The Poppleton ward has an electorate of 2,821 and Tadcaster East ward has an electorate of 3,604. The average electorate is 5,900 and the largest ward, Catterick, has 8,472 and it may now be even larger. That shows the real problem in local government that must be resolved. My district has been re-warded, which was not an urgent task, yet the Electoral Commission has declined to accelerate the re-warding of the county council, which is urgent. That job is far more urgent than the machinery that the Government are just tinkering with, to no apparent purpose. They will not be able to implement the scheme until the Electoral Commission has made a thoroughgoing review to put in place proper re-warding. Otherwise, seats would be disproportionately weighted, which would be absurd.
<P>
Do the Government intend to implement the scheme universally? The hon. Member for Bath asked that question, too. Do they intend to have the same system throughout the country? Will different councils have different systems? Are we returning to our former uniformity? [Interruption.] I am sure that the Minister's conversation is delightful; no doubt she is trying to think of answers to my questions.
<P>
We face the possibility of a mayoral election in which the ballot is called on a petition of 5 per cent. and which needs no threshold to be valid. A risible turnout might, therefore, elect the mayor. Moreover, annual elections might discourage turnout, as they will diminish what is at stake. We are therefore moving towards a universal system of absolute minority participation in democracy.
<P>
The next general election—I chance my arm—is likely to have the lowest turnout since the first world war. Some inner-city wards have dangerously high levels of abstention because people do not feel involved in the process. I do not believe that the proposal will do anything for democracy and it will do even less if we believe that people must vote for something that is at stake. I would love to hear the Minister's opinions on the current debate about the removal of social services from local government, which the Secretary of State for Health virtually promised on television at the weekend—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying from the principle of the stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> With respect, Mr. O'Brien, I do not believe that we have reached the stand part debate yet. I believe that we are debating the amendment.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With the health service we are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am illustrating the powers of local government, which are at the heart of the debate. I shall not dwell on the matter. You, Mr. O'Brien, have drawn to my attention the fact that you may not believe the relationship between social services and local and health authorities to be relevant. No doubt if I were to ask the same question about ring-fencing education funding, you would feel that that was just a little tangential, too, so I shall not pursue that argument—although, as you will be aware, both issues are hot currents in the debate on the competence of local authorities.
<P>
If we are, as is alleged, giving people more accountability over less substance in local government, why all this performance? Perhaps the Minister should close down local government and the Government could save a Minister of State's salary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has a point. What is at stake is not merely whether a particular election would change control but the effect of the 18 years' war against the powers of local government that his party conducted while in government. Is he about to reveal a complete change of heart in that respect, which would be welcome?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> First, I am not in the business of repentance politics. The measures that I introduced as the Minister responsible for local government were necessary and sensible, as many people in local government agree.
<P>
Secondly, I note that the Minister's statements are virtually identical to those that I made when I was in her place; indeed, I suspect that they were written by the same hand and may have been pulled off the same machine. Given the importance of local authority spending as part of public expenditure as a whole and the Government's responsibility for control of the envelope of public expenditure, it is inevitable that central Government will decide the proper level of local spending. We share that view.
<P>
Thirdly, the Government have managed to encapsulate in three years whatever we did in 18 years. They have set off at a much faster pace. I am not clear about their destination, but if you, Mr. O'Brien, were to permit me to mention social services and education and the tendency—
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that he does not agree with his party's policy to remove education from local government?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause deals with the power to specify a scheme for elections and the hon. Gentleman should concentrate on that. I agreed to widen the debate earlier, but we must keep to the clause now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Brien, and I am sorry that I provoked the Minister into making remarks that were so clearly out of order. The issue at the heart of the debate is what makes people vote in local elections. My contention is that they do so if they want to vote in favour of, or wish to change, a particular policy. If people become less preoccupied with the policy at stake, they will become progressively less likely to vote. The mechanism does not matter two hoots.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): My right hon. Friend spoke about having something to vote for. Most parties seek a mandate in elections. One of the difficulties with thirds is that there is often no real mandate because of the structure of the wards. The ward's decisions are often specific to the wards, so the political party in control can change without any change of mandate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> It is rather like the German electoral system, though I know that you would not want me to pursue the subject at length, Mr. O'Brien. The latest German Government is the first since the war to have come to power as a result of an election. Interestingly, the same can happen in local government. Changes can slip in without the electorate taking a decisive view, or when only part of the electorate has decided on a change of power.
<P>
I should like to know the Government's exact purpose. Are the Government still minded to introduce a universal system? Will it apply to all councils, to the mayor, and to county councils, which the Minister rightly said have a statutory duty to go before the electorate every four years? Will it apply to individual councils and, if so, what criteria will be applied? What will be the gain, other than the curious notion of accountability, for which the Government display a selective affection? These clauses should be entirely removed from the Bill. They add nothing to it, other than an obsession with tidying up for a purpose that has not yet been specified—and it would be excellent if the Minister did specify it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I wish briefly to join the debate on accountability. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon that there is no connection between accountability and the frequency of elections. One of the greatest complaints of district councillors is that they take the rap for the activities of the county council. If the county council, the main precepting authority, increases its precept and it reflects on the council tax, the luckless councillors coming up for the one third election frequently take the rap for decisions that had nothing to do with them.
<P>
An elected mayor with a four-year term will be Mr. or Mrs. Big in a particular city. Again, these people will take all the responsibility and the raps for their actions. However, councillors coming up for election—from the same or a different party—will suffer for mistakes that an elected mayor might have made in the early part of his tenure. Regular elections are not inherently fair and do not necessarily enhance accountability. Some wards in Newcastle gain only a 10 per cent. turnout, but Newcastle city council takes no regard of that. There is no genuine accountability there; the same party will win those seats in perpetuity.
<P>
I agree with my right hon. Friend that true accountability in local government can be secured only when the electorate believes that it can make a difference. If electors believe that they can reduce burdensome taxation or that the authority is failing them in some way, they will vote all-out and make a difference to that authority. That, not the frequency of elections, is what encourages accountability. Having said that, I agree with my hon. Friends that we should not be prescriptive and that we should allow local authorities to make up their own minds.
<P>
The Government now seem to be warming to the idea of regional government and assemblies. I noted the Minister's outpouring to the excellent Newcastle Journal with which my right hon. Friend and I both learned our trade. What would happen if there was an elected regional assembly in north-east England? Would that mean that all the subservient councils would have two elections, with an all-out election every other year? That is exactly the same two-tier system as has been suggested for counties and districts. There would then be two tiers with a unitary authority. That would be another muddle to sort out later if the Government are stupid enough to move to regional government.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting debate and it has served to show the confusion of the official Opposition. They have gone back to saying, ``Forget everything we did in 18 years. We should not have done any of it. Local government should have been left on its own and if we leave it on its own now, everything will tick along.'' In reality, we have a fragile democracy that needs to be cultivated and encouraged in a variety of ways. It is clear that the electorate do not think that democracy can be satisfied simply through the ballot box. The public are looking for more ability to influence government at every level and they are concerned that their voice should be heard. Our local government agenda is designed to enable the ordinary citizen to be at the centre of what is going on to a much greater degree. In best value, which became law on 1 April through the Local Government Act 1999, the public's role in deciding the priority for services is much clearer and to the fore than it was in the past. At every stage of the Bill, Opposition Members have said, ``Are you serious about consultation?'' Our commitment to effective consultation throughout government is clear. That does not mean, of course, that we can do everything that everybody wants, but people must feel that they have the opportunity to play their part. I have consistently said that in order to ensure that we get a robust democracy, we need to ensure that the public feel that government at every level is about them and their lives.
<P>
It is true that there are different tiers of local government, but not that, as the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) said, one is subservient to the other—they have different roles. I like the system that the South Africans have now. They call them ``spheres of government'' rather than tiers and that expresses more accurately the different roles at each level. We have to make sure that each level has an appropriate system. We are not suggesting that local government should become a legislative body or that it deals with legislation in any way. Legislative bodies have a different role from local authorities that deliver services. They work at a different level and with a different purpose from other tiers of government.
<P>
That is why there are different arrangements for devolved bodies such as the Scottish Parliament, for the national Parliament and for local government. If we had suggested exactly the same system for all those bodies, we would have been criticised by Conservative Members for not appreciating the differences between them, but that is the beauty of opposition. We know something about that, and about what one can indulge in. Hon. Gentlemen cannot pull the wool over our eyes about what they are up to; they still have many lessons to learn and we will ensure that they have the opportunity to do so, as that is what the country wants.
<P>
The clause enables the Secretary of State to specify, by order, that a scheme for elections should apply to a particular principal council or description of a principal council. An order may also specify the year or years in which elections are held. The schemes which may be specified are limited to the three schemes defined in clause 79.
<P>
We heard much about councils being able to decide the appropriate form of election. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), who were Ministers, know that that is not the position at present. Under reorganisation, when a new unitary authority was proposed, the Local Government Commission could listen to representations made locally about whether councils should have elections of one third or all-out. Beyond that, however, in London, in counties and in metropolitan authorities, there is a prescribed mode without local determination. There is much confusion among the electorate about what our models are. As those hon. Members who served on the Committee considering the 1999 Act, which dealt with best value, know, we said many times that councils should work together effectively so that the public do not have to be experts on who is doing what. I accept that it is difficult because, at the end of the day, accountability is important. Hon. Members know that that measure, which also dealt with changes in local government finance, contained another form of accountability in respect of finance. That encouraged local councils to consult on how they organise their finances and their budget for the next year; the Secretary of State will have to take that into account when deciding about capping and so on.
<P>
In several ways, we are endeavouring to increase accountability because the work of councils such as Barnsley, which carried out extensive consultation, and wider surveys, clearly show that the public want to be more involved in priority setting, in local decision-taking and organisation. On that basis, it is right to try to increase accountability, because that is what the local electorate want.
<P>
One of the great problems in British democracy is that local government elections have never attracted a high turnout. I teased the hon. Member for Mole Valley that his party has never realised that it is not simply a matter of powers; the hon. Gentleman, with his experience of the international scene, knows that many authorities in his second country have fewer powers but there is a much greater turnout in elections. There is not a simple causal relationship; there are many cultural differences across the board that have led to the pattern in this country.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
For the future of democracy, we must continue to do what we can to increase voter turnout. If there were a simple answer, I suspect that a previous Administration would have found it. The previous Government considered whether it was worth getting rid of local government altogether and decided that it was probably not worth the trouble—they would deal with it anyway. I strongly believe that local people must have influence and hold their council to account.
<P>
Clause 80 provides that when the scheme of elections involves the election of only a proportion of councillors in any one year, an order by the Secretary of State may include provision for identifying the wards, electoral divisions and councillors that may be affected by such a change. That is necessary, as right hon. and hon. Members noted, because the number of councillors in principal councils may not be evenly divisible by the frequency of elections being proposed and there is thus a need to identify the seats that are to be elected at the proposed elections. Similarly, it will be necessary to identify which electoral divisions of counties will have elections in any one year. An order may specify the method to be used for identifying the electoral divisions, wards and councillors in such cases, or it may direct principal councils to propose to the Secretary of State methods for identifying electoral divisions, wards and councillors.
<P>
Hon. Members said that in their local authorities, even though they may be two-tier, there are annual elections. In our consultation following the White Paper, it was said forcibly that it was not fair that district councils, which do not have the greatest powers, should have elections by thirds every year, while county councils, which have greater spending powers in the area, should have elections only every four years. We propose a system that gives a better balance, so that half of the county council would be elected one year, half of the district council the next year, half of the county council the following year and so on. Annual elections would thus continue; it would be clear who was standing for the council in a particular year and there would be greater parity between the county and the district councils.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If the logic is that the greater the power, the more frequent should be the elections, we should have parliamentary elections every six months.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not say that. Those who made representations to us said that the way it was done was not fair. I have already dealt with the argument about Parliament having elections every six months and I will not repeat what I said. The determination that county councils could have elections only every four years was perceived as unfair and we were asked to find a way of achieving greater clarity and greater parity between districts and counties.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I have two questions, the first of which comes from my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, who has muttered ``Who by?'' Does the Minister not recognise that in a county in which the political power is marginal, she will effectively disfranchise 50 per cent. of the electorate at a stroke at each election? A political change could occur when only half the electorate voted that could not have taken place in an all-out situation.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is not necessarily true that only half will vote. It is likely that the Local Government Commission will not move large wards into two-member wards. However, they might. There will certainly be some two-member wards in county council areas, so we must be able to specify schemes as the clause sets out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I would love to ask the Minister so many questions about clarity and parity being the prime movers, because I thought that the issue was accountability. She said that the clause would allow the Government to specify the schemes. Is it the Government's intention that the Secretary of State will, by regulation, require county councils to have elections every two years? Can we have a straight and clear answer to that question?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that the Government intended to do that, although we have not publicised the timetable. We want to ensure that we have learned all the lessons from the 1999 Act and the new schemes at this year's elections and we want to work with the Local Government Commission. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, it would not be sensible to introduce the measure overnight.
<P>
The programme of re-warding was put back enormously by the reorganisation, which left us with more problems than solutions and took up an inordinate amount of the Local Government Commission's time and energy. The commission is now behind with the work that it wanted to do. A lot of work needs to be done before the Secretary of State can make the changes, but we made a manifesto commitment and we are not rowing away from that commitment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Let us pursue the issue a little further. The Minister said that the timetable for introducing two-yearly elections was not clear and that the prime blockage came from re-warding. Is it the Government's intention to wait until re-warding has been completed in all county councils, or will they roll in the two-yearly elections immediately after re-warding in each council? Will county councils that do not need re-warding have to move rapidly to such elections?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall not use the powers this side of a general election. We intend to use them, but the precise reason I gave for the individual powers is that there are specific issues to which we may need to respond as things develop in individual authorities. We are not asking the Local Government Commission for a re-warding of every county council, nor are we saying that we shall wait until a re-warding has taken place before we do anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I thought I was clear, but I am hopelessly confused by the Minister's latest reply. Is she saying that she may introduce two-yearly systems individually, not universally, but only when the warding situation is sufficiently balanced to permit it? In other words, no two-yearly elections will be introduced unless there has been either a re-warding or the existing warding is satisfactory. The Minister appeared to say that she might introduce it in any case. I was not quite sure what the circumstances for that might be. She also said that it did not necessarily depend on the election commission. It might be helpful if she would go back and try the last few squares again.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not say what the right hon. Gentleman thinks I said. All of the proposals in part IV are for enabling provisions. There is no timetable for implementation in the Bill because the Government have not yet come to a firm view about exactly how and when the provisions should be used. Both my hon. Friend the Under Secretary and I have made that clear throughout the debate on this and the previous clause.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> So all this might be abandoned?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have said that it is not an immediate priority and that nothing will happen this side of a general election. In any event, whatever we do will involve close consultation, obviously with the Local Government Commission, but also with local government and, through it, the electorate. These clauses will allow us to proceed when we are ready.
<P>
The ability to name individual wards and so on is necessary at any stage because, as I have already said, we may, particularly in county areas, still have wards with simply one member because of the nature and size of county councils. Unless we moved to unitary status, it is unlikely that there would be wards with more than one member in some of the most rural areas.
<P>
It is interesting that some Opposition Members now have experience of more than one type of authority. The hon. Member for Mole Valley, for example, had, I suspect, no experience of two-tier authorities until he moved his seat at the last general election.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I had the pleasure of the Greater London council.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That is very different, but yes, I suppose so, when the GLC had the Inner London Education Authority. I apologise but, still, the hon. Gentleman did change to a very different sort of area when he moved his seat at the last election. Any Government must carefully consider such differences, but it is also true that there is significant demand from the public for greater local accountability. That has been our motivation.
<P>
We heard a long speech about turnout. I have never argued that our main purpose was to increase turnout, so I am confused why the right hon. Gentleman assumed that it was.
<P>
The Government do, however, believe that local accountability can be strengthened by increasing the opportunities for the local electorate to give its verdict on the local authority through several means—including, of course, the ballot box. My area does not have annual elections.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I bet that the hon. Lady's agent does not want them.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman would be surprised. Exactly the opposite is true: the councillors do not want them, but many others do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Does the Minister accept that it would be disappointing if the turnout either stayed the same or decreased as a result of more frequent elections? Is that not relevant to her concerns about accountability?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have already said at some length that there is no evidence of a causal relationship. An extensive study was carried out for the Department at the university of Plymouth by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, together with Maxwell Stamp plc. It was published in April last year. It showed that annual elections did not necessarily raise turnout. There may have been a negative correlation, but simple correlation does not necessarily imply causality.
<P>
Opposition Members touched on the more interesting point that the study identified a link between turnout and electoral competitiveness. Where there was potential to change political control of a council, or where more than two parties contested a ward, there was a significant impact on turnout. That, more than whether an authority elected by third or by all-out, made the impact.
<P>
Part of the problem is that politicians believe that they are experts on elections and draw extensively on their own experience of them. As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Mole Valley, people who are elected on the basis of annual elections see no problem; those who are not, see huge problems. Having observed the two different methods around the country, I became convinced of the strength of annual elections. They do sometimes pose problems, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne knows, but we are here to examine the operation of different systems and to judge what best delivers the expected outcomes. If the main outcome is accountability, annual elections should be chosen. That is the Government's view.
<P>
We cannot accept the amendments. Amendment No. 341 would allow authorities to choose which scheme of elections should apply. Amendment No. 21 would give local authorities a veto over any changes to the frequency of elections. That runs directly counter to our manifesto commitment, which was set out in the White Paper and provided a clear pattern of elections for all authorities in England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We have debated district councils at length and the Minister referred to counties and two-year terms. Does she intend unitary authorities to be subject to similar changes?
<H4><center>[MRS. RAY MICHIE in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Yes, Mrs. Michie. We intend that this should stretch to them too and, of course, for them the most appropriate will be a third, a third, and a third, not a half, and a half.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I apologise for interrupting the Minister again, but why is a third, a third, and a third appropriate for a unitary authority and a half and a half for a county council? I am genuinely confused about the logic here. The Minister keeps saying that this is about improving accountability.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We do not think that it would improve accountability if we insisted on a third, a third, a third in counties and districts. Both the counties and districts argued strongly, following the White Paper, that that would lead to great confusion. People would be asked to vote on the same day for two different authorities. I know that they do so with parish elections, but that will not happen in future. In year one, there would be a county election, in year two, a district election, in year three, a county election, and in year four, a district election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister is losing me. According to my mathematics, if in any four-year period there have to be two county elections and three district council elections, there has to be an overlap more frequently than she is saying.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are proposing that districts will also shift to a half and a half. We came to a compromise in our discussions with the Local Government Association following the publication of the White Paper that in a four-year cycle, year one might be district, year two, county—right?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Okay. That was what I meant when I talked about greater clarity for elections.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 may seem to have its attractions, but the Government cannot accept this one either. Given the approach that we have adopted for increasing the frequency of elections, I do not think that there is much of substance in relation to the schemes for elections themselves on which a local authority could consult the electorate. In some instances, there would be no options to choose from.
<P>
I hope that, having had the debate, Committee members understand that the option on halves is specifically for two-tier authorities, not for unitary authorities, metropolitan authorities and so on. We shall need to work closely with local government on the detailed implementation of the policy and local authorities will in turn need to consult local people on the implications for electoral arrangements and transitional issues, just as they do at present for electoral reviews and their implementation.
<P>
Under the White Paper, there is no scope for options for the scheme of elections itself. There is nothing to consult upon. The amendment misses that point. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Eastbourne to withdraw amendment No. 341 and not to press amendments Nos. 21, 114 and 342.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am afraid that I am not prepared to recommend to the Committee that we withdraw or not move the amendments. I intend to press them to a vote. The Minister talks of greater clarity but to be blunt, her attempts to explain have left Opposition Members more confused than before she started.
<P>
The Minister keeps taking a few strokes, like a nervous swimmer and then lurching back to the tried and tested piece of wood, as if words like ``accountability'' had some kind of magic that made everything understandable and transparent. What do Ministers intend? First we were told that the provisions were in the manifesto and that definitely their policy will be to have annual elections all over the place, at times when they do not happen at the moment.
<P>
The Minister seemed to say that the Government would reconsider the issue, that they might move away from that position and that they had not made up their mind. However, she then came back and said that they would go ahead. I pay tribute to the Minister for being able to make all three points simultaneously, during the same speech. If they do go ahead, Ministers will impose their own judgment on local councils.
<P>
It is no good for the Minister to talk about having a robust democracy when, along with her right hon. and hon. Friends, she is flailing around trying to find other ways of representing the views of local people. The Government are trying to take the politics out of local government—that is what the measure is about. It is a pathetic attempt to change things by making people vote more often. The Minister has backed away from the notion that turn-out is relevant, but we think that it must be as it shows the level of interest that voters take in the issues before them. Does that not have a relevance to accountability?
<P>
The Government are flogging a dead horse. The only good thing that arises from the measure is the Minister's confirmation that they will not do anything about it before the general election. As their lead in the opinion polls is down to a mere 3 per cent., we will be able to sort the matter out. That would be an argument for withdrawing the amendment, but we feel strongly enough about it to press it to a Division.

<H4><center>Power to change years in which elections held</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is important to have a brief stand part debate because we do not see the need for the clause. That is why we proposed to remove it altogether and are minded to vote against it on stand part.
<P>
The powers are separate from and additional to those in clause 80. Clause 81 would give the Secretary of State power to alter the timing of elections in particular councils without changing the electoral scheme, as in the power set out in clause 80. If I have misread that, I am sure that the Minister will tell me. We do not understand why the Secretary of State should have that additional power, given the wide-ranging powers that he will have if the preceding clause becomes law. The provision under subsection (3) will allow the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>secure the retirement of existing councillors at times different from those at which they would otherwise retire.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State will have the power not only to change the scheme for elections in a council but to sack councillors who have not served their full term, when they were elected on a different basis. He will be able to change the time when elections are held even when he is not changing the scheme for election. That is unnecessary and needs justifying, and we hope that the Minister will do that.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The clause enables the Secretary of State to change, by order, the years in which elections take place for any local authority or class of authority, including parish and community councils. The power will enable the timing or phasing of local electoral cycles to be changed without changing the scheme or frequency of elections. The provision could be used to re-align the cycles of elections at different levels of representation in a particular place in order to achieve a better spread, for example, so that elections take place in different years. On the other hand, it could be used to provide a greater coincidence of elections in that area.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have no immediate plans to use the order-making power in the clause in relation to English local authorities. However, it will be available to the National Assembly for Wales to rationalise electoral cycles of Welsh local authorities, as set out in the Welsh local government White Paper, ``Local Voices''. The issue has become resonant in Wales. As a result of devolution, the Secretary of State will work with the National Assembly and that needs the power that the Bill will give them.
<P>
I was surprised by the manner in which the hon. Member for Eastbourne spoke to the amendment because, as I am sure that his colleagues could tell him, Ministers already have that power through electoral review orders. It is the norm that, if an authority's boundaries change significantly after a review—as happened in Exeter and Plymouth this year—the Secretary of State determines when the new electoral cycle will come into being. Some authorities in which there has been re-warding have had their all-out elections this year; others will have them either next year or in 2002.
<P>
Therefore, that power already exists. We want to make it clear that it applies to the areas in the clauses that we have been discussing and that it can be exercised by the Welsh Assembly in relation to Welsh authorities.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 344, in page 56, line 41, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Whatever changes are made by order under this Part the total number of councillors in any local authority affected by these changes shall remain at least the same as at present'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a sense, I dealt with the matter dealt with by the amendment in an earlier debate. We have a deep-seated suspicion that the Government have a secret agenda, part of which is to reduce the number of elected councillors in some authorities. The amendment would act as a safety net and ensure that the total number of councillors would be unaffected, whatever changes were made under the provisions by the Secretary of State. We need that amendment to the Bill, unless the Minister gives us a cast-iron guarantee that there is no such hidden agenda or intention.
<P>
We have debated long and hard the issues arising out of new structures that the Government are trying to impose on local government, largely against its will. It is not the time or place to rehearse all the arguments about the executive-scrutiny split and the effect that it is likely to have on individual councillors who have no part in the decision-making process. They may not be involved in scrutiny, but may simply be consigned to the back benches, where they benefit from neither salaries nor pensions and their ability to affect matters or represent their constituents is very limited. To add insult to injury, the Government may turn around and say to councils, ``As a result of these much needed reforms, some of you do not have a real role at all. We therefore think that you should reduce the number of councillors.'' Councils that currently have 80 or 100 members might find that their numbers are cut back dramatically. That concern has been expressed to me by councillors of all persuasions, the LGA and others.
<P>
The provision is simple. It does not need to be pressed to a vote if the Minister is prepared to dispel all our suspicions on the grounds that they are unjustified, unworthy and not based in fact, and assure us that there is no long-term or medium-term intention to reduce the number of councillors in any given local authority.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I shall make two points in response to the hon. Member for Eastbourne. He has begun to rehearse again the Opposition's argument that our proposed changes will result in second-class jobs for some councillors because they are not on the executive, and a less satisfactory role for many councillors. Without repeating the argument at length, we reject such a limited view of our proposed changes to political management structures. He completely fails to understand, as he has done throughout our consideration of the Bill, the real importance that we attach to overview and scrutiny, the role of the full council and the important role of committees in matters such as planning and licensing, which will continue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman argued earlier that the changes would result in less and less power for councils to make decisions for local people. I completely reject that view. The new power and the duty of community plans that we have given local authorities provide a platform from which local authorities can provide the leadership that is local government's true role. Councils will have more power to make decisions and do the best that they can for people in their area. I reject his basic premise that the changes that we propose will result in a lesser role, or a diminution in role, and therefore lead to a reduction in the number of councillors.
<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman is of a naturally suspicious mind. Perhaps, he will be reassured if I tell him that, irrespective of that argument, the amendment is unnecessary. The purpose of the order-making powers in this part of the Bill is to change the frequency of local elections and the phasing or cycle of each election. I say to him categorically that those powers cannot be used to change the number of councillors that make up a council. That is covered by other legislation, and by the work of the Local Government Commission for England and the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales. The Secretary of State cannot implement electoral change without first receiving recommendations following an independent review undertaken by the commission. Therefore, it is impossible for the powers in the Bill to be used to change the number of councillors. We have no intention of doing so, and the Bill does not provide the powers to do so.
<P>
If my first argument did not reassure the hon. Gentleman, I hope that my second argument does, and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not wholly satisfied. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the powers are not in the Bill, but that does not mean to say that they are not at the back or even at the forefront of the Government's mind.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I said that we had no such intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> At the moment, they say that they have no such intention. I suppose that we must take that at face value, but I suspect that we shall be in ``I told you so'' territory at some point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) In determining the amounts of grants, the manner of their payment and any terms and conditions under subsections (5) and (6), the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, the Assembly, shall consult such organisations representing the interests of local authorities or of disabled persons in receipt of such welfare services as he considers appropriate, and in consideration of any representations made to him under this subsection, and at his discretion, may modify his proposals in the light of any of those representations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is important, and I feel reasonably confident that the Government will accept the spirit of it, if not the wording. The Committee will be aware that the Government have been concerned about arrangements for providing support to various groups of vulnerable people. They produced a consultation paper called ``Supporting People: A new policy and funding framework for support services''. That paper arose from the interdepartmental review of supported housing, which was charged with finding sustainable long-term funding arrangements for vulnerable people's support services. Clauses 86 and 87 are about the welfare services that the paper detailed, and they provide a legislative framework to implement the Government's new policy.
<P>
We shall debate the more detailed issue of housing benefit shortly. It is a means-tested benefit to help people on low incomes meet the cost of rented accommodation. It can pay up to 100 per cent. of the rent, depending on the claimant's circumstances. At the moment, it can also be used to provide limited support services relating to the provision of adequate accommodation. That is usually, but not exclusively, interpreted as relating to the fabric of the building.
<P>
Support for such people—including vulnerable people on probation and those with learning disabilities and mental health problems—is provided in a variety of other ways. It can come through Housing Corporation-supported housing management grants, probation accommodation grants and home improvement agency grants. I hope that the Minister will confirm my understanding that the intention of clauses 86 and 87 is to sweep away those rather complex arrangements and introduce a single budget specifically targeted at support services.
<P>
If that is the case, I strongly welcome the Government's intention. Local joint commissioning panels from social, housing and probation services would work together to administer the support service. The intention would clearly be to minimise bureaucracy and administration, to enable joint decision making to tackle gaps and overlaps, and to achieve overall value for money. All that makes eminently good sense, and I support it unreservedly. Also, I understand that the Government will guarantee that the total for the single budget will be at least the sum legitimately spent in previous years through the various budgets on such activities. I welcome that as well.
<P>
The Government are consulting widely on the details of the scheme's introduction. Again, that is to be welcomed. Annual grants will be provided, but the Bill does not show that following initial consultation and the scheme's introduction, there will necessarily be any subsequent annual consultation with relevant local interested parties on the grants that will be allocated.
<P>

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is simple. It would ensure that, after the first round of consultation, which is predominantly about the introduction of the scheme, there will be an opportunity for consultation with all the relevant parties each year about the grant to be allocated to a local authority. The Government have accepted the importance of such consultation in respect of other legislation, such as the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, section 54 of which, for example, provides the type of consultation that will be necessary in respect of that Act.
<P>
The amendment will not place an additional burden on the Government. I am sure that they would accept such consultation as good practice. I seek first from the Minister confirmation that my interpretation of clauses 86 and 87 is correct and that the Government intend to introduce a single grant that will sweep away much of the current complexity. The various bodies currently responsible for grant-making of one type or another will have to work together to ensure that gaps and overlaps are removed. Secondly, I should be grateful for an assurance from the Minister—she could either accept the amendment or say that local consultation will take place with the various relevant interested parties in each year in which grants are to be made through the new scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We support the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats. It is right that there should be consultation on such matters. We agree that the Minister should give the assurances sought by the hon. Member for Bath. Clauses 86 and 87 hang together on such issues and I shall make most of my points in the stand part debate on clause 87. That seems to be at the heart of the proposals, especially on support for housing and the housing benefit regime. Representations have been made by a range of organisations, such as Age Concern, Mencap and the National Association for Mental Health, but rather than being out of character and repetitious, I shall deal with them under clause 87.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The amendment refers to an important aspect of such work. I have been involved in the group that has been studying how we can get out of the enormous hole that we were in, when we came into Government. We found that no one had any idea of what was being spent or how effective that spending was. A court case that had been ongoing for many months and which finished in July 1997 upheld the view that housing benefit should cover only bricks and mortar charges, such as rent and services related to the fabric of the dwelling. The majority of local authorities had been using housing benefit to meet a wider range of service charges for personal support, such as counselling and advice for people preparing for independence, but also support for older people, rough sleepers, ex-offenders, those with learning difficulties and physical disabilities and young care leavers. The court ruling left a potential chasm for those services to drop into. It is clear that the previous Administration knew of that potential chasm before the court case began and that they did nothing to address it.
<P>
Therefore, we were faced with an enormous problem in dealing with the most vulnerable people. We knew that we had to do something for those who are far too often out on the margins and are the least prioritised. Therefore, we have introduced an interim scheme, though which we intend to find out how to help the most vulnerable in our society to receive the support and housing that they need. We need to create a regime of care that will give them as much independence as possible.
<P>
The scheme is transitional at the moment—the new scheme will be introduced in 2003. We are monitoring carefully so that we can introduce that scheme, which will consist of a single grant that will integrate the various complex funding systems that are in place, and will be distributed by local authorities. The new grant will come at least to the amount spent in the previous year. It will be based on an estimate of what was spent in the last year—not of the previous scheme but of the interim scheme—during which we will have the monitoring in place.
<P>
Consultation is an important part of the development of the supporting people proposals. I welcome the principles behind the amendment. We are engaged in an extensive consultation process with all stakeholders, which will feed into the guidance for local authorities on the new grant. We believe that the continued input of practitioners and of users is essential.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister referred to the present consultation. Will she tell us about the Government's thinking on the matter? I acknowledge that it might change in the light of further consultation. The definition of welfare services provided at the end of the clause is, no doubt deliberately, very general. However, will she confirm that the Government intend that personal care services, including home help and the provision of meals, residential care homes, secure provision and intensive programmes of counselling to change behaviour are likely to be the only forms of support outside the scope of the grant?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That is a detailed question to which I will have to return. Residential care is certainly outside the scope. However, I will check and come back to the hon. Gentleman with the other information.
<P>
We want consultation to ensure that the system is workable at a local level and that local authorities are ready for implementation in 2003 and for the changes that come after that.
<P>
<B>Ms Margaret Moran </B>(Luton, South): I welcome the thrust of my right hon. Friend's comments and especially those regarding the holy mess that was the legacy of previous funding arrangements for supported housing. Will she ensure that, before the new scheme is introduced, there is a review of effectiveness across local authorities, especially for those vulnerable groups that require a level of service across the country? I am referring particularly to the funding of refuges. Survivors of domestic violence find that there is a wide variety of funding throughout the country. In some places, notably the south-east, there is only one refuge, or no refuge provision. Women's Aid is concerned that the new form of grants might not rectify some of the problems with the variety of funding for supported accommodation for survivors of domestic violence.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Government have an extensive scheme to increase the number of refuges for women who have suffered domestic violence. I can assure my hon. Friend that we are very much on top of her concerns. Indeed, the Women's Aid Federation is part of the consultation process.
<P>
To answer the hon. Member for Bath, I have been told that personal care services will fall outside the scope of the grant. Further guidance on what will be inside its scope will be part of our consultation.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment, because it will not lead to the most effective type of consultation. We want to adopt the idea and table an amendment on Report. The hon. Gentleman's amendment singles out a particular client group. The grant will cover a range of client groups and we want all those groups to be included. Subsection (10) says that any determination, guidance or directions may be different for different local authorities. Consulting widely on individual cases and exceptions does not seem to be the best way to proceed. A more precise amendment would ensure a genuine, effective and participative process, involving the right people at the right time.
<P>
I agree that there should be consultation on nationally applicable determinations, such as the allocation formula. The new amendment should allow local authorities and other stakeholders to be involved at an earlier stage of decision making on the general guidance, thus increasing their influence on the final proposals.
<P>
Any determinations regarding individual local authorities would be a matter of consultation between the authority and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. In light of those proposals, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Given the assurance that the Government will table an amendment based on the spirit of my amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 86 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
