</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. You were not present at our 13th sitting when we discussed amendments relating to the definitions of the phrase "natural features". The Minister for the Environment said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the many letters that I received was written jointly by the Country Landowners Association and the British Mountaineering Council. It proposed excluding liability from
<P>
natural features of landscape.
<P>
That is their drafting, not mine.--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 18 April 2000; c. 394.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Committee members will have received a letter from the Country Landowners Association and the Mountaineering Council pointing out that that statement is untrue. The original letter did not include the word "natural"--the proposal was to exclude liability from "features", not "natural features", of the landscape.
<P>
I am concerned because this is the third time that I have had to pull the Minister up for being at least ill prepared. On 18 April, I pointed out that he had wrongly attributed a remark to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and that he had discussed an amendment that had not been called.
<P>
I inform you, Mr. Malins, and the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), that we cannot tolerate being palmed off with inaccurate responses that have not been thought through. If the situation does not improve, our good will may evaporate.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will withdraw his remark and apologise to the Committee. He must accept that the letter removes the last vestige of whatever fig leaf he may have used to cover the word "natural", which has been widely condemned in Committee and outside. He should find new phraseology that meets the needs of the CLA, the British Mountaineering Council and the many other organisations that are involved.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not strictly a point of order for the Chair, but the Minister may care to respond briefly.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> The Minister does wish to respond briefly.
<P>
The comments of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) on the wording of the letter, which was sent to Committee members, were entirely correct. I shall return to that in a moment. However, he made a meal over the other issues that he raised--they are exceedingly minor. He said that I responded to an amendment that was not before the Committee, but I suspect that my response was helpful because the amendment had been tabled. I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman is not interested in extra, although perhaps unnecessary, advice.
<P>
In this context, my understanding--I shall check on this because I speak from recollection, and I do not want to mislead the Committee--is that there was a change in the letter's drafting and that the original drafting contained the phrase "natural features". However, the wording was changed by those who wrote the letter--the CLA and the British Mountaineering Council--to omit the word "natural".
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was perfectly correct to say that the letter as received did not contain the word "natural". I therefore apologise for referring to the phrase "natural features". I did so on the basis of the letter's original draft rather than the version that was sent out. However, this is not a terribly serious issue. On the other hand, I make it clear that, although the hon. Gentleman may think that there is a widespread view that the phrase "natural features" should be removed and replaced with "features", that is not so. There are at least two divisions on the matter. We are certain that the phrase "natural features" has sense and purpose. However, I accept that the letter sent by the CLA and the British Mountaineering Council did not contain the word "natural".
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. During last Tuesday morning's sitting, I intervened on the Minister to say that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs had taken evidence from Forest Enterprise in which it had said that it could not allow greater public access because of insurance problems. I was wrong about that, and I unreservedly withdraw the remark. The evidence was given by a private forestry company.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will be grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Byelaws</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment 324, in page 9, line 26 after 'may', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'on application by any person interested in access land, or otherwise,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 276, in page 9, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() for securing compliance with the general restrictions in Schedule 2 and any other restrictions imposed in relation to the land under Chapter II.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 369, in page 9, line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>', and with such bodies as appear to them to be representative of persons who will be affected by the byelaws, including persons with an interest in the land.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendments address two issues relating to byelaws. Amendment No. 324 is straightforward. Under the Bill, it appears that access authorities are the only organisations that can initiate or make byelaws. While it may be right that they are the only bodies that are allowed to make byelaws, the Bill contains no opportunity for anyone else to be involved in initiating them.
<P>
The amendment therefore proposes that anyone with an interest in the land should have the right to request an access authority to initiate certain byelaws. It is important that the Bill should contain that power. The amendment would not change the fact that only the access authority can make the byelaws, but would give others with an interest the opportunity to apply for them.
<P>
Amendment No. 276 would slightly extend the scope of the byelaws to ensure that they covered the existing restrictions in schedule 2 and the rest of part II, which deals with exclusions. I hope that the Minister appreciates that the byelaws must be substantive and give the force of law to the restrictions that we have debated during previous sittings.
<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) intends to speak to amendment No. 369, but, if so, I assure him of our support.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I welcome you back after our short break, Mr. Malins.
<P>
Amendment No. 369 deals with consultation on the selection of byelaws. During previous discussions, the Minister has been loath to accept that local access fora should be included in the Bill as a means of discussing such issues. It would therefore be appropriate for access authorities to be required, when drawing up byelaws, to consult  bodies that represent people who are likely to be affected by those byelaws. That works on both sides of the fence. Those who seek access will want to know what further restrictions are to be placed on them, to consider whether they are reasonable and to have the opportunity to make representations. Equally, those who own or have an interest in the land will wish to make representations. The amendment seems entirely sensible, and I shall not labour the principle that lies behind it, as it is self-explanatory. I should be grateful to hear the Minister's views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The Bill reflects careful consideration of the role that byelaws should have in helping to ensure effective management of the new right of access.
<P>
I shall deal first with amendment No. 324. As we have discussed in previous sittings, the Bill already contains numerous restrictions on the new right. Any criminal penalties under existing legislation will apply to access land as they apply elsewhere. We do not envisage that byelaws will be needed in many places, because the provisions in the Bill and in existing legislation will generally be sufficient, and because most users will be law-abiding. However, we recognise that there may be certain circumstances, especially in busy areas, in which byelaws might be needed to control activities. That might include--to give an example that I have used before--byelaws prohibiting bathing, if that were shown to present a special problem in a particular place.
<P>
If there are particular problems, those with an interest in the land will be able to draw them to the attention of the access authorities. Some bodies, such as the National Trust and English Nature, already have powers to make their own byelaws and may choose to do so on access land. It is not necessary for there to be a special right of application for individual landowners, and to set up a special procedure--as the amendment proposes--could have the undesirable result of encouraging hundreds of applications for individual byelaws in different areas. We expect access authorities to take an overall view of what, if any, byelaws are needed in their area. We would expect them, in so doing, to take account of the views and needs of local landowners, users and others with relevant interests.
<P>
Amendment No. 276 seeks to allow access authorities to make byelaws for securing compliance with the restrictions in schedule 2 and imposed under chapter II. That would allow access authorities to create criminal sanctions for any breach of the restrictions in schedule 2, and would also allow the criminalisation of trespass. As I have said, we do not expect byelaws to be needed, other than in specific circumstances in which they may assist in addressing a particular problem. There is no need for a power to make byelaws that criminalise any minor breach of a restriction.
<P>
The purposes set out in clause 17(1) are the purposes for which any byelaw should be made--that is, to deal with real problems of preserving order, to prevent damage or to stop disruption. If an access authority considers that one or more of the tests in subsection (1) has been met, it may make byelaws for that purpose. If the tests cannot be met, I see no reason why byelaws should be made. Again taking swimming as an example, there might arguably be justification for a byelaw in exceptional circumstances in which real harm was being done. However, that does not mean that we should allow for the possibility of swimming being made a criminal offence everywhere.
<P>
Amendment No. 369, tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, would require access authorities, before making byelaws, to consult bodies representing those who would be affected. Although the amendment makes specific reference to consulting representatives of those with an interest in the land, it would also include representatives of users. We have provided that access authorities should consult the appropriate countryside body, before making byelaws. Such a body will, of course, bear in mind the interests of those affected by the byelaws. The byelaws will have to be confirmed by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales, who will wish to ensure that there has been full consultation in the drafting of the byelaws. Indeed, the Secretary of State may wish to invite the public to submit comments on the byelaws, if any novel or controversial issues arise.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will agree that the provisions will serve their purpose well, as the similar powers in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the Countryside Act 1968 have done. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am not entirely happy. The Bill does not address the issues, particularly those raised by amendment No. 276, which deals with the activities set out in schedule 2. We are worried about this issue, and have debated it at length. The sanction for trespass is inadequate to address some of the problems. Some of the activities are offences under wildlife legislation, for example, but many of them are not. That is why we sought to include the provision in the Bill.
<P>
The right to apply for the making of byelaws or, in the case of the proposal by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, the need for consultation--two sides of the same coin--should be in the Bill. It is all very well for the Minister to say that Ministers will take that into account and would expect the access authority to be consulted, but it would be more helpful if that requirement were written into the Bill. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said clearly that byelaws are essential to back up the Bill, especially in relation to the exclusions in schedule 2. The Bill must provide for the restrictions to be applied and enforced. The RICS urges a set of national model byelaws based on schedule 2 and including provisions for closures. As with all model byelaws, they could be adapted, as appropriate, by the local body. It also says that a financial penalty for infringement of byelaws is a more successful deterrent than withdrawal of the right of access for 24 hours.
<P>
Although byelaws may, in practice, be rarely enforced, they define the rights of users. The Minister did not deal with that critical point. No one is suggesting that the full power of the criminal law should be brought to bear automatically on everyone who transgresses schedule 2, but that option should exist, because it would, in itself, be a deterrent. As the RICS says, there would be times when such an option would be useful, but, in practice, the deterrent effect would be important, even if the criminal law were not often invoked, It may not be a major issue, but it still rankles with us. I shall not detain the Committee any longer as other hon. Members may wish to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I was not persuaded by the Minister's reply. He relies enormously on what Ministers expect or would like to happen and on what they will exhort others to do, rather than putting the relevant provisions into the Bill. I cannot see the point of that. If there are to be byelaws that will amend the rights conferred by the Bill, there must, in all circumstances, be proper consultation. Consultation via a third party--in this case, one of the countryside agencies--is helpful to the process, but, if I were on an access authority considering the matter, I would want to hear representations from the people who would be affected. Other authorities might be badly advised on the matter. Indeed, it is not unknown for local authorities to receive bad advice and fail to consult adequately. The Secretary of State might be asked to confirm byelaws, only to decide that the consultation process was inadequate and return the byelaws to the relevant local authority, asking it to do better next time. That would be a pointless, iterative process. A simple amendment would make it clear that access authorities should not curtail the rights of those who seek access, or change conditions of access under the Bill, without first consulting, listening to the arguments for and against--assuming there is not general agreement--and making a balanced judgment.
<P>
I am disappointed by the Minister's response and I wish that he would consider the matter further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. As I have said, I am keen on, and strongly support, consultation, and I am certainly not suggesting that it should be evaded. However, I am saying that the Bill adequately safeguards consultation through, where necessary, intervention by the Secretary of State, although such intervention would be exceptional. We have also made it clear that there should be a light touch and no undue bureaucracy. The hon. Gentleman and I share the same view--the question is how to achieve our aim. If his proposal were adopted, a representative of the users--that is, any member of the public--could, after the byelaws were made, register a protest on the grounds that he or she had not been consulted in that capacity. Endless problems could arise regarding the question of who should be consulted to ensure the full and statutory meeting of the legal requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is being a little disingenuous. Amendment No. 369 would require access authorities to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such bodies as appear to them to be representative.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, they could be challenged in law only if they exercised that responsibility recklessly. In other circumstances, there would be no redress for someone who had not been consulted on that basis. Provisions that require consultation with bodies that appear to represent those who should be consulted are not unusual in law. Such provisions can be found in many different legislative areas, and consultation should not be equated with bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am persuaded by the hon. Gentleman's persistence and conviction in respect of the importance of consulting all relevant parties. Although I make no commitments, I will have a further look at ensuring that there is full consultation, but the process must not give rise to inflexibilities, which would help no party. On that basis, and without making promises, I shall reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> As a helpful suggestion, could not the matter be dealt with by issuing guidelines to each byelaw-making authority? Authorities would then have to consider certain bodies before deciding what byelaws to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Before making byelaws, access authorities are already expected to consult the appropriate countryside body. As I said, the body takes account of those affected by byelaws, including members of the public. Guidelines on the making of byelaws and their extent are a step further, and are unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am sure that members of the Committee appreciate the Minister's open-mindedness and willingness to look again at the points that have been made, particularly by the hon.  Member for Somerton and Frome. He said in his first remarks that most users would be law-abiding; nobody has suggested that they will not be, but implicit in that is that a few will not be.
<P>
I was reminded, in the last few days, not of a precise analogy but of one that serves to illustrate the point. A new lay-by was recently built on the main A14, just outside the boundary of my constituency, and the Highways Agency used large wire-netting baskets full of rocks as the barrier to contain it. I have watched over the past few weeks as the rocks in those baskets have gradually disappeared, to the extent that this week they have gone altogether, and there is just a heap of mangled wire left. I suspect that people have taken them for their gardens or whatever, but it shows that one cannot guarantee that, even there, everybody will be law-abiding. I know that that is not an exact analogy to the right of access, but we have talked about people taking stones from dry-stone walls and we must cater for the minority who are not law-abiding as well as for those who are.
<P>
In the spirit of the reasonableness of the Minister's remarks to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Chris McCafferty </B>(Calder Valley): I beg to move amendment No. 362, in page 10, line 7, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(6A) The relevant confirming authority shall publish guidance to access authorities as to the matter which may be included in such bye-laws and the purpose thereof with the intention that bye-laws in the areas of each access authority may be consistent with the bye-laws in any other access authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take cognisance of the Minister's response to the previous amendment, but this amendment seeks to eliminate confusion and help to ensure the smooth implementation of the Bill.
<P>
The Bill's great strength is its universality: it provides a national framework for access. The Committee is debating the minutiae of the Bill clause by clause to ensure, among other things, clarity. By the time the Bill reaches its final stages, walkers and landowners will understand exactly which land it relates to. However, the implementation of local byelaws could cause problems for walkers, especially those new to an area to which a byelaw relates. The Ramblers Association has expressed concerns about that.
<P>
It is common to find wide-ranging differences in local byelaws--for instance, in relation to parking restrictions--and I am sure that I am not the only member of the Committee to have inadvertently fallen foul of such byelaws. I suspect that it would be much easier to fall foul of an obscure and possibly perverse byelaw relating to a certain piece of land. I am not suggesting that local access authorities should not have the right to pass legislation pertinent to their own area--heaven forfend: that would be a serious thing for a Member of Parliament to suggest. However, they should receive guidance on the matters that may be included in such byelaws and their purpose and should ensure consistency with byelaws in other areas. Failure to achieve consistency could result in total confusion and in offences inadvertently being committed by honourable people. That is why the amendment requires the relevant confirming authority to publish guidance to access authorities and ensure consistency throughout the country.
<P>
It is worthy of note that the Countryside Agency believes that any byelaw-making power should tackle exceptional circumstances only, because the national framework of common law offences is already extensive and consistent. Other agencies suggest a set of model byelaws, I suspect for similar reasons.
<P>
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will recognise the wisdom of guidance and accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I had not realised when I intervened on the Minister just now that the hon. Lady was about to move her amendment. I wholeheartedly support it and I hope that she will persuade her hon. Friends to support it. We want a Bill with a light touch but which, above all, is clear so that people know its precise effects in different areas and where they may choose to walk. The amendment is sensible and helpful.
<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The intervention of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) is nicely emphasised in the amendment and I shall return to the matter in a moment.
<P>
I hope that I can persuade my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Ms McCafferty) that the purpose of her amendment, although entirely proper, and I understand its rationale, can be achieved without legislative prescription. Her amendment proposes that the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales should publish guidance to access authorities when making byelaws with the aim of achieving greater consistency between different authority areas. I accept the good intention in the amendment.
<P>
We entirely agree that byelaws should follow the general principles of good practice, such as not duplicating existing criminal offences. The point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold was that the Secretary of State, when issuing circulars on the legislation to access authorities, may wish to include guidance on the making of byelaws on access land. Such guidance could give an indication of what byelaws might comprise and when they might be needed, along the lines that I have previously suggested. I am not saying that that will always be necessary, but it is one way of meeting a problem that we recognise. However, there will be scope for the relevant part of my Department to make available more detailed guidance and assistance when that is required and for that reason we do not believe that it is necessary to include the provision in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I try to persuade the Minister to meet us half way? If the amendment had stated that the authority "may publish guidance" instead of "shall publish guidance" would the Minister have been inclined to table such an amendment on Report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In other words, the amendment would state that the relevant confirming authority "may"
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>publish guidance to access authorities as to the matter which may be included in such bye-laws and the purpose thereof with the intention that bye-laws in the areas of each access authority may be consistent with the bye-laws in any other access authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is nothing if not ingenious. I doubt whether it is appropriate to put in a Bill covering statutory powers and obligations the fact that the relevant confirming authority may issue guidance. However, the Secretary of State already has that power through the issuing of circulars, which meets the hon. Gentleman's requirements.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley will accept my point. The issue is fair and proper, but the Secretary of State can ensure consistency by issuing circulars and guidance. I hope that she will accept that we are trying to meet her point and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms McCafferty:</B> I would prefer my right hon. Friend to reconsider the matter before Report. I accept his assurances, but I would prefer that they were written on tablets of stone. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() Before determining the number, role and function of wardens the access authority or district council shall consult with any local access forum that may exist in their area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> We come now to the important issue of wardens, and the appointment thereof. I have tabled three of the amendments in this group--amendments Nos. 201, 202 and 370.
<P>
In a way, amendments Nos. 201 and 202 deal with the same issue--the lack of confidence felt by people on all sides of the argument in local authorities' having either the firm intention or adequate resources to provide the wardening services that would make the Bill a success. Such success would depend on local authorities' acknowledging the need to appoint a sufficient number of wardens, and on the Government's recognising that that will cost money and that there must be adequate provision for local authorities to make those appointments. The cost of this will fall largely on the  rural local authorities, which tend to be those least well served by the funding formula as it is presently constituted.
<P>
Amendment No. 201 deals with the question of clarity. Those of us who have worked in local government over the years know that one of the best ways of ensuring that something does not happen is to give the duty of implementing it to more than one authority, or to different tiers of authority in the same place. If no single tier has a clear duty to provide, it is often the case that none will do so. In the case of areas that are not unitary authorities, the access authority will be the county council.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for either an access authority or a district council to appoint wardens in order to make clause 18 work. That either-or option is not helpful in this instance. Usually it would be helpful to give more than one authority the power to implement certain measures. However, this requirement is not a statutory duty. Clause 18 states that the authorities "may appoint" wardens as necessary. In such circumstances, both tiers will find it difficult to fulfil a non-statutory duty effectively. Moreover, as it is not a statutory duty on either authority, the Government will not feel the need to make allowance for it in the funding formulae or in the standard spending assessment for either tier. That makes it a weak provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 201 seeks to leave out the words "or a district council", thus making it clear that a single tier of authority must be responsible for this duty. In the case of a unitary authority area, that will be the unitary authority; in the case of a county authority area, it will be the county authority; and, if the area is within a national park, it will be the relevant national park authority. That would provide clarity; everyone would be clear as to who was responsible for these appointments. The appropriate authority would then make or not make those provisions accordingly.
<P>
Amendment No. 202 relates to an even more substantive issue, and I am pleased to see that it has the support of Conservative Members. It is the perennial amendment to leave out "may" and insert "shall". Unless the appointment of wardens is a statutory duty, funding will not follow, and authorities will find it difficult to make it a priority to meet the needs of such cases. We have seen that in many instances in the past. If we are to give authorities this new responsibility, there should be a duty to provide them with the officers to make it work. That does not necessarily mean that there will be an onerous duty on every local authority to provide wardens where they are not needed. The clause says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as may appear to the authority to be necessary or expedient.<P>

<P>
Therefore, having considered the matter, the authority may say,"The land within our jurisdiction is of a nature or an extent that is incompatible with having to appoint wardens, and we do not agree to do so". The insertion of "shall" rather than "may" would ensure that every authority had to consider the needs of access land in its area and decide whether to appoint wardens and, if so, how many would be necessary to deal with any problems that arose.
<P>
In amendment No. 370 we return to consultation. Again I seek to insert the words "local access forum" into the Bill in a way that has not been done so far, because this is quintessentially a matter that authorities should consider with users, owners and those with an interest in the land. Together, they will decide how many wardens there should be in a certain area and what their role should be. The Minister will probably say that a good authority will do that in any case, that that is the purpose of a local access forum, and that it would be foolish if it did not do so, but he steadfastly refuses to include such a provision in the Bill and claims that to do so would be over-regulation. I am not sure that invisible over-regulation is better than viable over-regulation: if everyone expects somebody to do something, it is better that it is explicit than implicit. At least we then know where we stand.
<P>
If the Minister rejects all the amendments, clause 18 would be very weak. There is a real risk that, despite large areas of country now becoming access land, the appointment of wardens to assist with that process, particularly where the local authority properly focuses on its urban areas rather than on its less-populated rural areas, may go by default. That would be a shame, because the wardening system, particularly in the early stages of operating the Bill, is crucial if authorities are to know what they should be doing and how they should be doing it and, on rare occasions, are to police those who are determined not to play by the rules, as the Minister suggested.

<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I was interested in what the hon. Member for Somerset and Frome said and agree with chunks of it. As he said, I and some of my hon. Friend's support amendment No. 202, although I have reservations about some of his other amendments. I was grateful for his explanation of the thinking behind amendment No. 201, which appears to take a swipe at district councils. I had the possibly unworthy thought that, in view of the events taking place on Thursday, the Liberal Democrats' attachment to district councils may be about to be much softer than it has been in recent years.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman explained that he was merely seeking clarity. In all seriousness, there is virtue in having clarity in these matters, but it is not necessarily achieved by excluding district councils from being the relevant body in this matter. If the Minister wishes to achieve the desired clarity, he may find ways of doing so that allow district councils to play a larger role, especially as far fewer of them will be under Liberal Democrat control after Thursday.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It might be useful to discuss individually the amendments that were tabled by my hon. Friends and me. Amendment No. 327 would have a similar effect to amendment No. 202. 1 agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that wardening is of critical importance. If we are to place on the statute book realistic legislation that benefits those who own and manage the land and those who wish to use it for recreational purposes through access, it is vital to have a decent, credible, sensible and properly resourced system of wardening. I go further than the hon. Gentleman in this regard--that system will be vital during the early stages, but it will continue to be critical while succeeding generations are encouraged to access land. In relation to safety, owners and occupiers will need to have professional advice on how to manage access.
<P>
Amendment No. 325 would extend the power to appoint wardens to the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales, and it would encourage us to face up to the real problems of resourcing. Our approach would establish an alternative to the discretionary spending of local authorities. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport told the Country Landowners Association that such funding could be made through the new opportunities fund. That alternative means of funding could involve corporate bodies in certain circumstances. The Government should consider such innovative forms of funding and recognise that wardening is a vital part of the Bill.
<P>
If amendment No. 327 were agreed to, local authorities could appoint sufficient numbers of wardens "as is necessary". The Bill merely states that they can appoint
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such number of persons as ... appear ... to be necessary.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our fear is that wardening is unlikely to be sufficient when there is no obligation to provide the service. The Government must confirm the funding of wardening--I am sure that we all agree that successful management requires effective wardening.
<P>
Amendment No. 326 is a technical amendment that would enable the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales to fulfil the provisions of amendment No. 325. It would replace the singular reference that states that only the authority can appoint wardens with a broader phrase that encompasses local government and the relevant countryside body.
<P>
Our amendments stress the importance that we attach to wardening. I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that this matter is an important test of the Bill's practicality.
<P>
I have not discussed amendment No. 370, which, broadly speaking, makes a good point. However, consultation with local access fora should not be taken as gospel if a simple head count is involved. Clearly, the fora will represent different interests; that is their purpose. In a situation in which the owners or managers of the land very much favoured wardens, but others thought them unnecessary, someone would have to make a judgment about the relative salience of wardening to the various interests represented in the forum. With that caveat, it would be sensible to insert into the Bill the activities of the local access fora.
<P>
An inadequate wardening system could adversely affect the Bill and disappoint those who are most in favour of it. It could lead to worse safety provisions, and more accidents, in the years ahead. I am sure that the Minister does not want that to happen, and I therefore urge him to take the amendments seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> This is an important part of the Bill. Those of us who live in national parks are aware of the work of national park wardens, who are considered to be friends both to landowners and to those gaining access. Every year, they take part in many rescue operations involving people who get stranded or are overtaken by the weather. The effect of wardening in open country will therefore be critical. Wardens' skill and expertise will be available not only to users, but to landowners and occupiers. It is vital that the scheme is wardened carefully. I say that not because I want to have a second kind of police force out on the hills, but because important safety factors are involved. Given the work that national park wardens regularly do, I am aware of the amount of work that will inevitably be created by the extra 4 million acres of access land. I am sure that the Minister will take that matter seriously.
<P>
I am worried, as are many people outside the House, that the Government may have paid too little attention to the operational implications of the new rights of access to open country. We need to know more about issues such as resourcing and signage. Page 32 of the explanatory notes makes no reference to financial or manpower implications, yet, if the scheme is to be implemented properly, those matters should be to the fore.
<P>
Broadly speaking, I support the amendments. I hope that the Minister will tell us more about how he envisages the operation of the wardening system. Does he favour the extension of parallel appointment to the Countryside Council for Wales or the Countryside Agency? Does he agree with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport about the possible use of the new opportunities fund? Does he recognise the necessity of avoiding further strain on local authorities? Their budgets are already under considerable pressure, and they may think that this is not the most important matter with which they have to deal. A mechanism should be built in to ensure that resources are in place so that the necessary manpower is readily available without extra cost being placed on local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> We will debate restrictions on access in respect of fire when we reach clause 23. However, the adequate provision of wardens to detect fires at an early stage is critical in many moorland areas. Does the hon. Gentleman have that problem in his constituency?
<P>
<B> Mr. Llwyd:</B> I entirely agree. My uncle used to work as a fire warden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Is he a Tory?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I do not think so. I have never asked him about his politics. I shall do so when I go home next weekend, and report back. I hope that I will not be disappointed.
<P>
My uncle was often involved in fire-wardening during the summer months, when the weather is especially dry, and it is clear that a risk exists that we need to address. However, when appointing such people and deciding where they will be based, we must ensure adequate local discretion. We must also consider how the provision of  wardens will be financed. We cannot expect local authorities, the Countryside Council for Wales or the Countryside Agency to find the money. I know that the Minister will refer in all sincerity to the need for a light touch. That is fine, but there are potential problems and dangers associated with providing access to 4 million acres of land. We need adequate wardening, and I ask the Minister to respond--as I am sure he will--to the various points raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I, too, share the view that wardening is important. The provisions in the Bill that will enable access authorities and district councils to appoint wardens will, in our view, allow the reasonable provision of wardening on access land. I hear what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) is saying about the need to pay for the costs associated with providing adequate manpower, and I agree that that is a real issue. However, I am sure that you will agree, Mr. Malins, that the issue should be dealt with when we consider amendment No. 384, when there will be a specific discussion on such matters. I shall be happy to deal with the issue then.
<P>
Amendment No. 201, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, would remove from the Bill district councils' power to appoint wardens. We have empowered district councils, as well as access authorities, to appoint wardens because they may wish to respond to a need for wardens at a more local level. Wardens may usefully fulfil a local need, and if district councils are prepared to commit funds for that purpose, we see no reason to prevent them. The question whether there is a case for appointing wardens to act over an area of land is a matter for the relevant authorities and those to whom they are answerable. I see no reason why that power should be taken away.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made an interesting case. In his view, empowering councils to appoint wardens would reduce the likelihood of access authorities appointing wardens, but the point could be argued either way. In my view, empowering district and county councils to appoint wardens will increase the likelihood that wardens will be appointed. Primary responsibility for appointing wardens will lie with access authorities, but I do not want to prevent district councils from appointing them if they so wish.
<P>
In a similar vein, amendment No. 325 would enable the countryside bodies--the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales--to appoint wardens on access land. We have given those bodies various functions under the Bill, the most significant of which are mapping access land, and authorising closures and restrictions outside national parks. We have done so because it is important that those functions are carried out by a national body that is able to take decisions on consistent grounds in different parts of the country. The same considerations do not apply to wardens. Local authorities such as national park authorities, highway authorities and district councils are better able to determine whether wardens are needed in the particular circumstances of the locality. They are more likely than national bodies to be familiar with the services provided by wardens.
Amendments Nos. 202 and 327 propose that access authorities and district councils should be required to appoint wardens, placing them under a duty to make appointments where that was "necessary or expedient". As in the case of byelaws, we do not consider that wardens will be needed on all access land. It must be for the authorities concerned to consider all the local circumstances and decide whether, or to what extent, wardens are needed. It would not be right to impose a special one-off duty to appoint wardens. Authorities will need to balance all their functions regarding access land--along with their other functions--and judge how they can best exercise their powers, while taking account of local wishes, as expressed, for example, in the local access fora.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 370 would impose a statutory duty on authorities to consult local access fora, when appointing wardens. We have already debated the nature of local access fora, and hon. Members will not want me to repeat the arguments. There is no reference to local access fora on the face of the Bill, so it would not appropriate to refer to them as suggested in the amendment. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that access authorities should take into account any views put forward by the local access forum. That is precisely the sort of issue that local access fora should consider, and I would expect their views to be seriously considered by the relevant local authorities.
<P>
There is sufficient provision in the Bill for the appointment of wardens. I am keen to see wardens deployed wherever necessary. The amendment would reduce local authorities' flexibility in using their powers in that regard, and, therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. I acknowledge the fact that he accepts the importance of wardens to the operation of the Bill, but I do not think that exhortation will be sufficient to create the number of wardens needed to do the job properly. The thread running through the amendments is that there should be a duty on someone to appoint wardens where necessary or expedient.
<P>
In local government, the history of non-statutory duties has not been entirely happy. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, when local authority budgets were under intense pressure due to capping and other constraints, non-statutory services always lost out. Either they ceased to operate, or they were not adequately developed. When times are hard, an authority--whether it is a unitary or a county authority--will try to protect the education service, the social services, the fire brigade and its contributions to the precepting bodies before the non-statutory provision of wardens. The situation is different in respect of the national park authorities, which exist purely for the purposes of the national park. The wardening service is clearly a key issue that they must consider when allocating their budgets. That will not be the case for a county council in considering its budget. My fear is that few wardens will be appointed and that those who are will be appointed by authorities that are extremely committed to making the Bill work or have sufficient resources to enable them to have substantial countryside budgets to which funds can be reallocated. In my experience, not many local authorities are in that position.
<P>
The Minister acknowledged that providing for both tiers to be able to appoint made the appointment of wardens more likely. I can only trade experience and say that the opposite is often the case. It was interesting that the Minister said that he considered that the primary responsibility lay with the access authorities. It would be helpful if that were stated in the Bill. If the primary responsibility lay with the access authorities and the districts had a permissive authority to add, improve, enhance or top up, that would be helpful. If the clause read, "an access authority shall" or "a district council may", I should be happy as there would then be a clear duty on one tier of authority to provide wardens. The Government would recognise that in their funding formula, the standard spending assessment would contain an element in the block to provide for it and the district councils would not be prevented from topping up if local circumstances suggested that more was needed. I would welcome that, but the clause is worded differently. At present, the wishy-washy word "may" applies to either authority, and I do not believe that an adequate number of wardens will be appointed on that basis.
<P>
On consultation we agree to differ. I wish that I shared the Minister's confidence that every authority will work in the best possible way, consulting as much as possible and ensuring that local access fora are set up and operate effectively. I have no doubt that it will happen in good authorities, but I have no doubt that it will not happen in others. That is regrettable and the Bill will be less effective as a result. Clearly, the Minister clearly will not move on that point and I will not persuade him of it, as we have repeated the debate several times already.
<P>
On that basis and because we may wish to return to the question of "may" or "shall"--
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman, I hope, does the decent thing, I should tell him that I share his genuine concern that there should be adequate wardening. I know that that concern is strongly felt by Opposition Members and I want to make it clear that it is strongly felt by the Government too.
<P>
I would counter the hon. Gentleman's point that if it is left to local authority discretion it will be well down the order of priorities by saying that many county councils already appoint wardens, even though they have no statutory duty to do so. That is an important point, which shows that his pessimism may not be wholly justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Yes, some county councils do appoint wardens. I am pleased that my own county council, of which I was once leader, is one of them, so there are circumstances in which that happens. But will the number of wardens be adequate to the task with which they will now be presented, which involves a huge expansion in the amount of relevant land?
<P>
One hopes that local authorities will take all their responsibilities equally seriously. I am not here to knock local authorities. I have represented them nationally for many years and I firmly believe in local governance, but there are competing priorities. One has only to look at the rights of way system, which we shall come to later in the Bill, and the priority given in some areas to establishing and maintaining the rights of way network to see what happens to many countryside issues when authorities are faced with the overwhelming demands of maintaining statutory education and social services on a limited budget.
<P>
It would be inappropriate to embark on a long debate at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr Green:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's disappointment. The Minister's aspirations are not matched by the practicalities of the legislation. I invited the hon. Gentleman to consider the point made by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors that in areas where there is much access to the countryside at the moment, one warden for every 400 hectares is thought to be a sensible use of resources. It is clear that without the amendments to the clause, there will nothing like that amount of wardening cover. The new land, which may be less suitable for wide access than existing land, will have worse warden cover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman's valuable contribution highlights the scale of the problem if the job is to be done properly. I do not believe that it will be accorded the priority that the Minister wants--although I have no doubt about his intentions--by hard-pressed local authorities and we need a mechanism to support them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to re-emphasise the point about the difference between local authorities and their success with the existing rights of way system. Some authorities provide a reasonable amount of money to pay staff to ensure that proper access is maintained on rights of way, but there is a huge variation because some local authorities give the matter low priority. If the same applies to the additional wardening duties in the Bill, it will merely widen the differential between local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There are differences of priority and intent among local authorities, but there are also differences in the level of resources that they can apply to the problem. No account is taken of the length of the footpath and road network when applying the current funding formula and no account will be taken of the amount of access land within a local authority area unless the formula is changed. The problem is significant, but I do not believe that I shall be able to persuade the Minister to change his mind at this juncture. Placing a duty on local authorities, as opposed to providing a permissive right, is something to which we may wish to return later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 383, in page 10, line 25, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'in the area of the council or access authority which appointed him'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a brief and obvious amendment. Clause 18(3) gives wardens appointed under subsection (1) power to enter any access land. That implies that a warden could enter any access land anywhere in the country, as could an ordinary walker, but he could exercise his powers of authority as a warden. That is not sensible and there should be some control. The amendment would restrict a warden's right of access to the area of the organisation which appointed him. That seems to be a straightforward point that the Government may have missed. Otherwise, perhaps the Minister will explain why a warden could be in a wholly different part of the country yet have the extra rights of access of wardens and the powers and authority to deal with transgressions under schedule 2 and so on. The amendment is perfectly straightforward and I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
11.45 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman to the contrary. The Bill provides for wardens to enter any access land in carrying out the functions for which they are appointed. The amendment proposes that wardens should have the power to enter land only in the area of the authority by which they were appointed, in carrying out their functions. We accept that wardens will generally need to enter access land only in their own area, but they will also need the power to enter other access land if necessary. For example, at the boundary of a district or county a warden might need to enter adjoining land in order better to view the land that he is required to patrol, or to reach his designated patrol area from the nearest public highway.
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, a warden might have clear reasons for wishing to keep an eye on the activities of someone who had moved from the area of the council that appointed that warden, but who should continue to be watched because the warden felt that they are likely to do harrn. For example, if there were a serious breach of the restrictions, the warden might wish to make a note of a vehicle registration, which could mean having to follow a person to the place where he had parked his car. I am sure that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire would not intend this, but it would be odd if the warden's powers of entry ceased at the local authority boundary. As we have discussed in previous debates, such boundaries can be difficult to locate in open country and might be rather arbitrary with respect to the warden's functions.
<P>
That is the thinking behind the proposal. We are not expecting wardens to wander all over the country. However, to impose an arbitrary territorial limit would defeat the whole purpose of the provision of adequate wardening. On the basis of my comments about the need for the warden's powers of entry not to be limited to the appointing local authority's area, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be content to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> This was a probing amendment, to which the Minister has responded admirably. He put forward a convincing argument for the need for wardens to be able to go beyond their immediate area.
<P>
I am still slightly worried about the all-embracing term "any access land". It should be possible to phrase the provision in such a way as to cover adjoining areas in which the sensible requirements to which the Minister referred, such as monitoring individuals under suspicion, need to be carried out. That makes perfect sense, although the wide-scale approach in the Bill is slightly unnecessary. However, in the light of the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 384, in page 10, line 34, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(5A) The Secretary of State (as respects England), the National Assembly for Wales (as respects Wales) or the appropriate countryside body may defray or contribute to the cost of wardens appointed under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the vital issue of resources in relation to the provision of wardens. At various points during the Committee's deliberations, we have observed the Government resisting amendments relating to access points and, to some extent, to local access forums. The Minister has said that, although he accepted the arguments in some of those amendments, he was not prepared to provide the means to fulfil their objectives. The discussions that have taken place over the past few minutes have made it clear that wardening is another case in point.
<P>
There is widespread agreement that wardening will form a vital part of the practical operation of the new regime proposed in the Bill, yet the Government are not prepared to accept the responsibility to ensure that it will actually happen. In terms of amendment No. 384, it would be instructive for the Committee if the Minister would give a breakdown of what he and his Department believe will be the overall cost of a decent, practical wardening system on access land, and of how that cost will fall on access authorities and national agencies. Will the Department be responsible for meeting those costs? I daresay that the Minister will say that such costs could be provided through SSAs. When we discussed the likely balance between the statutory and discretionary responsibilities that local authorities exercise, it was clear that statutory responsibilities have to come first. There is no guarantee that a discretionary responsibility such as that which we are considering will be met, even if the SSAs are changed to take account of the extra responsibilities.
<P>
Will there be extra funds to meet local authorities' additional obligations? Without such resources, the Bill is much less likely to work and more likely to antagonise relationships between walkers and owners, and, conceivably, between owners and the authorities that will enforce the legislation.
<P>
This small amendment reveals much about the Government's attitude. Are they committed to making the legislation work or do they want to make a gesture towards access? Such a gesture will be made on the cheap and without a commitment to provide the resources that are needed to make the system work. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I touched on this matter earlier. The SSA for rural districts and counties currently does not reflect the extra cost of delivering services to rural areas. I should guess that about 65 per cent. or 70 per cent. of my constituency, for example, is national parkland--the rest is entirely rural and includes much access land. Unless there is a mechanism to deliver assistance for wardening, the current provision will not be adequate, in view of the amount of access land that will be freed up. Why should the extra burden--in financial terms, that is what it is--fall on an authority that is already struggling with the fact that what we might call the rurality aspect is not adequately reflected in the SSA?
<P>
I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) and ask the Minister to explain whether there will be ring-fenced central assistance funding for wardening. In the current financial climate, hoping that local authorities and access authorities will make the money available is hoping against hope. I hope that the Minister will identify a way in which to provide responsible authorities with sufficient funding to provide adequate wardening. That will help to make the Bill a success.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I, too, am concerned about the cost of providing wardens. Paragraph 179 of the helpful explanatory notes states that the running costs
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>are estimated to be 2.2 million annually with one-off costs of about 6.4 million: these cover costs of mapping access land; providing wardens, stiles and information to help manage access; producing codes of practice and other guidance; and establishing local access forums. Public sector manpower effects are expected to be limited.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot believe that it is possible to provide all of those functions adequately with 2.2 million. I did a quick sum and found that if 150 people each paid the measly sum of 25,000, the cost would be more than 3 million. I cannot believe that that figure of 2.2 million is accurate. The Minister must explain how he expects local authorities to provide an adequate warden service on the amount of money that has been allocated under the Bill. There appears to be a huge gap in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Once again, I express my support for those who are concerned to ensure that adequate wardening is provided. I agree with Opposition Members and with bodies such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors that the provision of wardens is a key part of the overall package for the effective management of access, together with the provision of information, stiles and signs.
<P>
However, it is important to say that in practice the introduction of a statutory right of access may have little or no impact in some areas--either because there is already de facto access or because the area is remote, with relatively few walkers using it. I am therefore unsure about the suggestion in the RICS report--to which the hon. Member for Ashford referred in a previous debate--that there should be a minimum of one ranger for every 400 hectares of open country. By my reckoning, given that we are talking about approximately 1.5 million hectares, that suggests a veritable access army of some 4,000. However, I agree with the recommendation that the type and level of ranger service should be based on assessments of the needs of particular areas, and that those should involve the relevant access authority, landowners and managers. I would also expect that to be precisely the kind of issue that the local access forum should consider, together with other measures for promoting responsible public access.
<P>
The regulatory impact assessment that was undertaken by my Department included an assessment of the costs involved in managing increased public access. The assessment suggests that the cost of extra wardens may be up to about 2 million per year. Additional funding will be made available to local authorities in the usual way by revenue support grant, a specific grant or other financial support. We shall give further consideration to the precise mechanism for funding before the right is due to be brought into operation. It is not necessary, nor would it be normal practice, to specify in the Bill that the Secretary of State or the National Assembly may defray the costs involved.
<P>
On the basis of what I have said, the commitment that I have given, and the figures that appear in the regulatory impact assessment, I ask the hon. Member for Ashford to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister has given an interesting response, at the beginning of which he appeared to suggest that the introduction of the statutory right of access would have little practical impact. That rather begs the question as to why we are here. I assume that it will have a large practical impact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In some areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that clarification.
<P>
The Minister's reply was ultimately unsatisfactory, largely because of the coincidence of the fact that local authorities have only a discretionary duty to act and the vagueness of the funding provisions. He was, of course, right to say that it would not be normal practice to include in the Bill the defrayment of possible cost for local authorities. However, he is placing potentially onerous and very expensive new duties on local authorities, and they would be right to suspect that central Government are seeking the kudos, but not the obligations, involved in paying for those extra duties.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have just done some brief sums, and I estimate that the 2 million that the Minister announced will provide a measly 80 wardens across England and Wales. Does my hon. Friend think that that is adequate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It certainly is not adequate, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold for his high-speed maths. Even if the Minister is correct in saying that, in some areas, the Bill will have no practical impact, he will nevertheless agree that, in any sensible regime, it will require more than 80 new wardens. If he wants to challenge my hon. Friend's calculations with further calculations, members of the Committee will doubtless be interested to hear them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Bill will provide an extra 2.7 million in public expenditure but, in providing 80 additional wardens, 2 million of that money will instantly be soaked up. Other duties, such as mapping  and guidance, will have to be paid for from the remaining measly figure of 700,000. That is further evidence that the Government have got their sums completely wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure whether I agree that the Government have got their sums wrong. It may well be that they have got them right, but are hoping that someone else will pay the bill. Clearly, expenses will be incurred, and as it stands, the Bill will ensure that everyone except the Department will pay. We want to ensure that payment is fairly spread among those responsible for enforcing the provisions.
<P>
I am not satisfied with the Minister's response, so I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wishes to press the amendment, he will doubtless do so. However, before finally deciding whether to do so, he might like to consider my response to one or two of the points that were raised.
<P>
The regulatory impact assessment was undertaken by experts who used the best information available. I reiterate that the Government will cover the additional costs to authorities. Indeed, that is a standard requirement of the new burdens procedure.
<P>
On figures and numbers, I noted from a sedentary position that the calculations made by the hon. Member for Cotswold depended on an assumption--I shall not say whether I agree with that assumption--of an annual salary of about 25,000, by which he divided the figure of 2 million. However, many areas in which the greatest pressures exist are already wardened, so we are talking about additionality. Moreover, much land to which the Bill will provide new access will be relatively lightly used, and it is unlikely that wardens will be needed in such places. The Government have not got their figures wrong; we have looked at the matter carefully and will cover the cost in full. One simply cannot make calculations by dividing the overall figure across the whole country, because the conditions are different in different parts of the country. We have taken account of that fact, and our estimates are reasonable. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to take that into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am slightly puzzled by the Minister's attempted clarification. He says that the Government will meet all extra costs in full, but that is a rather all-embracing statement. Neither he nor other members of the Committee can know what those extra costs might be. I presume that he is establishing a discretionary ability for local authorities to appoint wardens. Is he seriously saying that any level of cost incurred in employing wardens will be met from central Government funds? I cannot believe that he is, and I should be grateful for clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I repeat that we will meet the reasonable costs of local authorities, in respect not only of wardens but of stiles, signage and the rest. I again point out that a case must be made for the need for new statutory wardens. There is a role for voluntary wardens, probably quite a big role. Again, that is an element in our calculations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I detect some slithering around here. In his clarification the Minister used new words such as "reasonable" and "voluntary".
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before my hon. Friend sits down, irrespective of the outcome of the amendments, will he press the Minister to look again at the financial calculations that we have been given to see whether they are realistic?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister will have heard what my hon. Friend has said. It makes sense for the Department to do that. Nevertheless, local authorities will be right to be suspicious of the Government's motives and potential actions in this regard, so I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>', after consulting persons interested in the land,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Earlier in the Committee's proceedings we discussed at great length the importance of informing walkers and other users about the issues relating to the land on which they are walking--not just the extent of the land but the exceptions in schedule 2, the issue that we shall discuss later of land being closed off and issues relating to whether dogs should be on leads and at which times of the year. Both sides of the Committee accept that a vast amount of information must be transmitted to those embarking on a walk in open country. That is why the two amendments are important.
<P>
The Bill simply gives an access authority power if it wishes--"may" is the word used--to erect and maintain notices. I am sure that the Minister will respond by saying that of course an access authority will do that, so the amendment is not necessary, but I am not certain that that is the case. I can well imagine access authorities saying that it is up to the landowner, as he is the person directly affected, to put up his own signs. That is unreasonable, particularly as the Government have frequently said that they do not expect the Bill to place extra financial impositions on landowners. Clearly, an obligation to erect signs becomes a cost element.
<P>
Amendment No. 330 would simply change the word "may" in subsection (1) to "shall". We are not stipulating the number or frequency of such notices or where they should be placed, which is clearly a matter for local discretion, but access authorities should not have any discretion about the necessity to erect notices. Amendment No. 331 would require access authorities to consult before erecting notices. Again, that is a straightforward obligation that needs little explanation.
<P>
Earlier in the Committee's proceedings the Government resisted other measures that we proposed to help communication. They opposed the restriction of access to via access points, which we proposed specifically to ensure that walkers would at least have to walk past a noticeboard, even if they did not read it. They also resisted the proposal to give owners, landowners and occupiers compensation for the costs that they bore. However, later in the Bill they create the offence of erecting a misleading notice. I assume that they wish to keep that provision in the Bill.
<P>
Only one conclusion can be drawn from the position that the Government have taken on those three separate issues--that the notices must be erected by the access authority. Therefore, it should be obliged to do so. Otherwise, there will be many of the consequences that the Government seem to think that we are exaggerating, but which are nevertheless real fears for many people who own or occupy land, such as vandalism or people inadvertently breaking some of the restrictions in schedule 2 or walking on land that is closed for the summer. That is why the notices are essential. Maps are not adequate, because they will not be changed to inform people when land is closed or periods when dogs must be on leads.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will understand the significance of obliging access authorities to erect and maintain notices, instead of simply allowing them to do so if they wish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): Will the hon. Gentleman concede that his amendment is extraordinarily open-ended? He simply wishes to substitute "shall" for "may". The amendment seems to go no further. Can he explain how, if the word "shall" is used, an individual can enforce the right by a private action or through a judicial review?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am slightly puzzled that the hon. Gentleman, who we learnt earlier is a lawyer, should ask that question. It is open to challenge in the courts by anybody if a public body such as an access authority fails to fulfil its duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong about that. It is clearly established that, where a statute places general duties on a local authority, a private action does not necessarily lie. The amendment would require notices to be erected on every boundary, which is surely an extraordinary burden to place on an authority.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> As I said, we are not trying to stipulate numbers or locations of notices and that could not possibly be read from the amendment. Our objective is simply to require signs to be placed where the authority deems that appropriate. I cannot follow the hon. Gentleman's logic of resisting our sensible and straightforward proposal. As time goes by, access authorities will identify the main areas of open country that are accessed and the logical sites on which to put such information will become obvious. They may be near car parks or convenient to other forms of transport. That will be a matter for local discretion, but the principle should not be a matter for discretion and should be an obligation on the authority to erect those notices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> In addition, if such a burden were placed on the authority, there would be some uniformity and the signs would be easily recognisable and understood by all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that important point.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will start his comments by saying that we all accept the need for notices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I seem to have got it word perfect. We believe that that need should be converted into an obligation on the authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall not start with those words, but we all agree that appropriate signs should be erected and that it is important to provide the public with necessary messages. A continuing thread throughout our debates has been the difference between statutory and discretionary matters. One consequence of making the provision statutory might be a plethora of signs in the countryside, which I am sure the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire does not want. That would certainly not be acceptable to Labour Members and I cannot believe that it would be acceptable to Opposition Members. Clause 19 provides for access authorities to use their discretion when erecting notices. Signing will be required to be universal, but the boundary of access land will not need signing because it will be reasonably clear and identifiable on maps and on the ground.
<P>
Amendment No. 330 would place a duty on authorities to erect notices showing the boundaries of access land and excepted land and giving information about the effect of the general restrictions in schedule 2 and any particular restrictions applying on the land. I am not sure how that would work and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas). The hon. Gentleman did not understand the point made by my hon. Friend when he said that the amendment was open-ended. When would the authority know that it had fulfilled its duty? Presumably it would not have to cover every point of the boundary. How much would it have to do to meet its statutory requirement and at what cost? The cost effectiveness of communicating necessary messages to the public should be taken into account.

<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> With respect, the Minister is being slightly disingenuous. Anyone who is accustomed to walking in national parks knows that there are signs here and there. There is not a plethora, as he put it: signs appear not every 10 yd but where necessary. In answer to his question, I am afraid that the courts will take the view that an authority has fulfilled its duty when it has reasonably met an expectation. That is no more preposterous than the current regime in national parks, which works very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We are talking about a statutory requirement, and the extent of that requirement is a matter of concern. The amendment would replace the word "may" with the word "shall"; it does not state, "shall, where appropriate or expedient", although that may be the intention behind it. A discretion to erect signs where it is judged necessary is close to a statutory requirement to do so where expedient or necessary, and we believe that a discretion to do so is adequate and right.
<P>
Under the Bill, the authority will be able to erect signs where they are most needed--perhaps at frequently used access points or locations where the boundary of access land may not be clear. The duty that amendment No. 330 would impose could, on the contrary, flood our uplands with a sea of unwanted signs, although I am sure that that is not the intention. None of us wants to see that outcome. We believe that it is right for local authorities to use discretion in assessing where and when notices are required. Authorities experienced in providing notices relating to public access may well be able to offer examples of good practice for others to follow.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 331, I do not consider it necessary to require authorities to consult those with an interest in the land before erecting notices. Access authorities will be able to ascertain the precise location of boundaries and restrictions applying on the land. However, I agree that authorities will usually want to discuss their proposals with landowners and, perhaps, other interested bodies such as local access forums and walkers' associations. Those with an interest in the land may well know which sites are used most. It will be in the interests of the authority and those involved with the land to liaise with each other to ensure that an adequate number of notices are erected in the right places. Indeed, authorities may often act in response to specific requests from landowners. It is unnecessary to provide for that in statute; again, it is more a matter of good practice. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I have to say that I am very disappointed with the Minister's response, particularly in respect of amendment No. 330. He is trying to set hares running that do not exist. He talks about a plethora of notices throughout the countryside, but our amendment could not lead to that. Under the clause as it stands, notices may indicate the boundaries of access land and excepted land; it does not state that they must be erected on every boundary, corner, twist and turn. Notices could be erected at appropriate access points, indicating a localised map of boundaries. To be frank, the suggestion that thousands of notices will be erected simply to ensure that obligations are met is fatuous. Ultimately, the courts alone will decide what constitutes the carrying out of a statutory duty. In practice, a combination of factors such as the size of the land, its historical access points--we are dealing with common land as well--the ease with which people can access it, the likely number of access points and the number of car parks will provide a localised indicator of the number of notices required. That would also deal with the point that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy made about the current experience of national parks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a relevant parallel with the system of footpaths? Local authorities have a duty to ensure that footpaths and bridleways are adequately signposted, but there is not a plethora of signs throughout the country--there are enough to ensure that paths are readily accessible and easy to use, with clearly understandable routes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend draws an important analogy. The principle is already enshrined in law. The Minister is searching for reasons to reject the amendment rather than deploying sensible arguments. We do not wish to create a plethora of signs, and the amendment would not do so. I made it clear that we perceive the necessity for there to be a discretion in respect of numbers, locations and types of signs. Access authorities should not be able to absolve themselves of the responsibility of erecting some signs, depending on the nature of the land.
<P>
As the Minister is determined to resist the amendment, regardless of the arguments, there is little to be gained by pursuing the matter at the moment, although we shall wish to return to it at a later date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 474, in page 10, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(iii) any other matters which may assist public access to access land and its proper management.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 386, in page 10, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1A) An access authority may establish and maintain information points to advise and assist the public and persons interested in access land.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am attempting to assist the Minister in dealing with the potential accumulation of signs in the countryside, about which he is clearly concerned.
<P>
The Minister's reply to the previous debate suggested a conundrum. Few access authorities already have the powers to put up the signs to which subsections (1) and (2) refer. I accept that subsection (3) is legally necessary because defraying the costs of a private individual could be considered to be ultra vires in the case of a local authority unless it is provided for by a specific power. However, subsections (1) and (2) deal with highways authorities or national parks authorities putting up signs in the furtherance of their duties to provide access to land. Is it not the case that they already have those powers, and that there is no problem with them acting in that way in the furtherance of their duties?
<P>
If that is not so, and subsections (1) and (2) are therefore otiose, the powers should be presented in such a way as to allow the access authorities to put up any signs that may be necessary to assist access to the land or to assist the proper management of the land. If the only power to erect such signs is conferred by subsections (1) and (2), the clause is extremely restrictive in that it implies that the only signs that access authorities can put up concern the information that is included in those subsections. Throughout our consideration of the Bill, the Minister has agreed with Opposition Members who have said that it is helpful for access authorities to provide the maximum information and to make it as clear as  possible, by putting up notices, what people are and are not allowed to do, including any temporary amendments of which they need to be aware.
<P>
The wording of the clause suggests a conundrum: either subsections (1) and (2) are unnecessary or, if they are necessary, an additional subsection such as that suggested in amendment No. 474 is required to enable access authorities to display other information. Otherwise, it will be left to the private landowner, and exactly the circumstances that the Minister was so concerned about will arise: there will be a proliferation of signs in rural areas and nobody wants that. There are already far too many because of the unnecessary restrictions that are placed on highway authorities and the requirements on them to over-engineer their roads. We do not want the same to happen in open countryside as a result of the Bill.
<P>
With respect, the Minister cannot have it both ways. Either these signs are necessary and the authority is necessary; or they are not and it is not.
<P>
12.30 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The points that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has just made are right. I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 386, which is grouped with amendment No. 474. We are taking a slightly different approach, but with the same overall objective, which is that the information should be available, as the clause seems to limit the information that could be displayed on a notice. That is the conundrum to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
Amendment No. 386 suggests that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An access authority may establish and maintain information points to advise and assist the public and persons interested in access land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause limits the information to be provided to boundaries and restrictions of access under schedule 2, but other information may be relevant. Cautions may have to be applied such as "Beware of mineshafts" or "Beware of peat diggings", other helpful pieces of information or even information about people going about their daily business and doing some work on the open land. Walkers need all sorts of information so that they can have maximum enjoyment from their walk and have the least possible impact on other users of the land--physically, in terms of liability or in any other way. Amendment No. 386, which takes a different tack from the lead amendment on the same point, says that access authorities should have the power to erect wider information points.
<P>
The Minister has made great play of the authority's power under the clause to erect and maintain notices and has resisted our desire to make that obligatory. Yet he seems to be restricting the power to certain areas. If access authorities started to erect notices for wider purposes, perhaps they would exceed their powers. That would be particularly obtuse and none of us want it. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will recognise that the access authority must be allowed to put up information on a wider range of issues than the fairly narrow ones stipulated in subsection (1)(a) and (b).

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> I want briefly to seek clarification from my right hon. Friend the Minister of the effect of the amendments on the Local Government Bill, which is being considered in Standing Committee further down the Corridor. As he knows, that Bill moves towards giving powers of general competence to local authorities. How does he think the responsibilities of access authorities under this Bill will be affected by the Local Government Bill when it comes into force, as it will drastically reduce the scope for arguing that what an authority does is ultra vires?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for South-East Cambridgeshire are on to a point. I repeat that we support the need to provide information to the public on their rights and responsibilities while exercising their right of access, which benefits not only walkers but those managing the land. The only difference between us is whether the Bill needs to require the provision and the use of access points.
<P>
We are keen that, where appropriate, steps are taken to promote positive management of access, by providing information about routes across the land, such as public rights of way, or useful means of access. As I say, that is helpful to walkers, particularly those less familiar with or confident about walking across open countryside.
<P>
I accept that there is no provision in the Bill for access authorities to erect notices other than those showing the boundaries of access land and giving information on any restrictions that apply. I am therefore willing to consider, as proposed by amendment No. 474, whether we need a power to provide information on other matters. If we are persuaded that a specific provision is needed, we shall table an amendment later.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West asked about the proposed general competence to provide for people's economic, social and environmental well-being. It is preferable to provide a specific power for local authorities to erect notices rather than to rely on general powers--for example, to further the economic interests of their area. Therefore, although there may be some overlap with the general competence, it is appropriate that specific rights should be written into the Bill.
<P>
As suggested by amendment No. 386, information points are a useful way to communicate a range of information. They are something that the Countryside Agency is looking into carefully and already has the power to provide, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said in introducing the amendment. But information points are not the only way to get information across to the public. The agency is considering a range of mechanisms, such as the internet and a telephone information service, as well as general publications such as a code of practice. But I do not believe that access authorities also need that power: it would be better if the provision of such information lay with an overarching body. However, as I have said, we are considering an amendment to the clause to provide that access authorities may erect notices offering information on other matters that may assist public access to the land. Taken in conjunction with the powers in chapter III relating to means of access, that would allow for the provision of what would effectively be information points.
<P>
In the light of the Government agreeing to consider amendment No. 474, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the helpful tenor of his reply. I am interested in his response to the hon. Member for Clwyd, West, because the power does not quite reach the power of general competence in the Local Government Bill. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is better that it should be an explicit power in this Bill, because we are dealing with a specific instance, instead of relying on a more general area of competence that may be open to challenge.
<P>
Given the Minister's helpful comments and his assurance that he will consider the amendment and come back at a later stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 385, in page 10, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1A) The owner of access land or excepted land may serve notice on the access authority for that land requiring the authority to erect and maintain notices pursuantt to subsection (1) on or at the boundaries of his land.
<P>
(1B) If the access authority does not erect a notice as required under subsection (1A) within 28 days of service of a notice upon them, the person who served the notice may apply to the magistrates' court for an order requiring the authority to erect a notice.
<P>
(1C) In considering any application under this section, the magistrates' court shall have regard to the desirability or necessity of erecting a notice and the reasonableness of requiring the access authority to do so.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will regard this as a helpful amendment. To some extent, it deals with his fear that there will be a plethora of signs, and would provide an additional and practical power.
<P>
The Bill contains no power to compel an access authority to erect notices, although there will be cases in which that will be desirable. The amendment would create a quick, simple and cheap method of doing that. Judicial review would be another option, but that would be too long and too expensive, and would, in any case, be inappropriate, as that process was designed to deal with legal errors, rather than with the intrinsic merits of a case. The amendment would allow landowners to apply to the local magistrates court for an order requiring the erection of signage. Local magistrates would form an independent view of the merits of the case for erecting a particular notice and the reasonableness of the request that the access authority should do so. Thus, there would be a way of having a local appeal that could be decided reasonably quickly and cheaply. Without such a provision, there could be an indefinite stand off between the owner and the access authority about whether a sign would be desirable.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept such a simple and practical amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am disappointed by the amendment. The hon. Member for Ashford, his colleagues and I have been at one on many issues relating to access information, but the proposed mechanism is not the right one. It is entirely inappropriate to substitute the magistrate's bench for the local elected authority in matters of resource, discretion and local consideration. We should, of course, consider ways to ensure that delinquent authorities that do not take their responsibilities seriously are made to do so, but the proposed mechanism is not the way to do it. I do not support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That was an interesting intervention. It shows that our belief in the use of proper discretion, through appropriate mechanisms and without excessive heavy-handedness, is having some effect.
<P>
As we have discussed, we have given access authorities the power to erect and maintain signs that provide information to the public on boundaries of access land and on any restrictions in force on that land. We are confident that authorities will erect notices where they are needed. If users or people with an interest in the land are concerned that an area of access land is not sufficiently clearly signed, they can draw that to the attention of the access authority and/or the local access forum.
<P>
I have already expressed my view that notices showing the boundaries of access land should be used reasonably sparingly. They should be adequate, but not excessive--we do not want a forest of signs. The countryside bodies and others, such as Ordnance Survey, will in due course publish guidance and maps which will show the public where they can find open country to which they will have a right of access. In many cases, the boundaries of that land will be clear, and they will be marked on maps and guidebooks. In some cases, landowners will wish to erect signs or markers to confirm those boundaries.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, it would not be reasonable to place a duty on access authorities to erect signs whenever or wherever landowners so desired. I am glad that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome shares my view. For example, it would be unreasonable and impractical if, whenever a landowner chose to exercise his discretionary right to exclude or restrict access, even for one day, the access authority should have to erect signs warning the public that the land had become excepted from the statutory right. I am aware that that was not the intention that lies behind the amendment, but if we went down the route that it suggests, that might happen. The amendment would give access authorities little choice but to erect signs wherever and whenever a landowner requested them to do so. Any failure by the local authority to act on a notice that was served by the landowner would cause the matter to be referred to the magistrates court. That is hardly the appropriate forum and I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that that approach does not involve a light touch. In any event, it would probably cost the applicant more to lay a complaint against an authority than to put up the sign himself The suggested sanction is out of all proportion to the purpose.
<P>
In slight mitigation, I point out that, under the Bill, access authorities will be able to act where they see fit and they will be funded for that purpose. They will also be able to defray, or to contribute to, the cost of erecting such a notice by someone who has an interest in the land. I hope that that goes some way towards satisfying the hon. Member for Ashford. The authorities should not be obliged to respond to every landowner who serves notices requiring the erection and maintenance of such signs. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am afraid that the Minister spent most of his response discussing an Aunt Sally that does not exist. He said, in his closing words, that an access authority will be required to act in response to a request by a landowner. Amendment No. 385 simply does not aim to have that effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Ah.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If the Minister read the amendment, he would understand its point. Proposed new paragraph (1C) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the magistrates' court shall have regard to the desirability or necessity of erecting a notice and the reasonableness of requiring the access authority to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would not do what the Minister alleged it would do.
<P>
I also part company with the Minister in relation to another matter. He said that access authorities have the power to do various things. The amendment would deal with situations in which access authorities do not exercise their powers in a sensible way. I do not find his explanation particularly compelling. However, I have made my point, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 277, in page 10, leave out lines 42 to 44.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 282, in clause 20, page 11, line 7, leave out 'Chapter' and insert 'Part'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> These are brief and technical amendments. They would tidy up the definition of exclusion or restriction. Such a definition is contained in clause 20, but it applies only to chapter II. That definition also needs to apply to clause 19(2), which is in chapter I. That is a convoluted process and it seems more straightforward to extend the definition in clause 20 to the whole of this part of the Bill and, therefore, to render clause 19(2) redundant. The purpose of the amendment is to simplify and improve the drafting of clause 19.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful, but one should resist the Greeks even when they come bearing gifts. However, I hope that I can put his mind at rest. He is ingenious when examining the precise structure and effect of the terminology.
<P>
These technical amendments are concerned with where terms should be defined in the Bill. The definitions of exclusion and restriction of access are set out at the beginning of chapter II, which then proceeds to provide for how such exclusions or restrictions may come about. Setting out the definitions in that way, where they are chiefly used, is the most helpful method of drafting for a user of the Bill. The special provision in clause 19(2) is there to avoid any doubt that the exclusions or restrictions referred to in clause 19(1) are indeed those defined in clause 20. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's acknowledgement that our purpose in the amendment was to be helpful and that it was entitled to be heard. He thinks that we come as Greeks bearing gifts whenever we try to improve the Bill, but I accept his point and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment, No. 278, in page 11, line 1, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 279, in page 11, line 2, leave out from first 'defray' to second 'or'.
<P>
No. 280, in page 11, line 2, leave out from second 'defray' to end.
<P>
No. 387, in page 11, line 2, at end insert 'reasonable'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am not sure whether I am a Greek or trying to be helpful, but I am trying to create some fairness in the Bill. Clause 19(3) allows authorities to contribute towards or to defray costs incurred by anyone who erects such notices as are referred to at the beginning of the clause, and that is welcome. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold highlighted the mathematical challenge that the Government will face in keeping costs within the small amount of money mentioned in the explanatory notes. We are concerned that, despite the intention that authorities should be able to contribute towards the cost of erecting notices, they will not be able to do so or will refrain from doing so because they will not have the resources to do so. Amendment No. 278 would make it obligatory to make that contribution and amendment No. 279 would remove the words "or contribute towards".
<P>
Both Ministers have said on many occasions that the Bill was not designed to create extra costs and burdens for owners, and that is welcome, but I am not sure that the optional approach in clause 19(3) complies with that overall objective. It should be obligatory. We are not suggesting that owners should be able automatically to erect all kinds of notices, regardless of cost, in the knowledge that they will be recompensed. However, as a matter of principle, they should be recompensed for costs incurred under clause 19(1)(a) and (b).
<P>
Amendments Nos. 279 and 280 are consequential amendments, which would provide for the payment of all expenses reasonably incurred. That would avoid the potential problem of landowners being entitled to receive compensation for anything. Amendment No. 387 deals with the issue of reasonableness.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will say that this is another example of the burden of heavy-handed regulation being placed on access authorities. However, that is not our intention. We simply want to meet the Minister's own aspirations of ensuring that extra burdens are not placed on landowners by the Bill, and that any costs that they incur as a result are recompensed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It might be churlish of me to say to the hon. Gentleman that he has clearly emphasised his commitment to a party that is highly regulatory and has been determined, in the course of this morning's debate, to impose as many burdens as possible.
<P>
We have provided that access authorities may contribute to the cost of a landowner erecting a suitable notice--or refund the cost in full. We have not made that a requirement because authorities must be able to use their discretion in judging whether a contribution should be made. It may be reasonable for authorities to reimburse landowners who have put up useful and informative signs. However, as I explained earlier, I do not want to see a plethora of signs on open country or to promote such an outcome by providing that signs will always be funded at public expense, regardless of whether a sign is needed or how much it costs.
<P>
As I and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State have often been at pains to point out, the Bill presents a balanced approach to increasing access. Members of the Committee correctly noted that no duties are imposed on access authorities under chapter I, and tabled several amendments, which we have discussed this morning, to remedy that perceived deficiency. Equally, however, access authorities are under no duty to enforce the provisions of chapter III, which gives authorities powers to take action to secure and safeguard means of access.
<P>
Once again, I remind hon. Members that we are allowing authorities to use their discretion and understanding of local circumstances to decide whether and when to act. It would be absurd if access authorities were to be under an obligation to appoint wardens, make byelaws and erect signposts on all access land, regardless of need--as the amendments that we have discussed this morning would require--and yet be under no duty to secure that people should have access to the land. Although I have rejected the amendment, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire realises that if I were to accept it, the quid pro quo would be a duty to secure that people have adequate and proper access to the land.
<P>
<P>
We remain committed to a light touch and a deregulatory approach, where that is appropriate. Authorities should be able to exercise their discretion in the light of local circumstances--for example, by consulting local access fora about requirements in their areas. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> If the clause remains as drafted, authorities only "may" have the opportunity to recompense. That means that if an authority runs out of money, for example, there is no method of appeal for an 
<P>
owner-occupier who has erected a notice and feels hard done by because he has not been given the money for doing so.
<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I understand that. However, the general thrust of my argument remains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
