<H2><center>Standing Committee B</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 1 July 1999</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/117/1999117.htm">Food Standards Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Those members of the Committee who are convinced that, because it is 1 July it must be summer, may remove their jackets if they wish to do so.
<P>
Before we embark on clause 2, it may be helpful if I make two points. First, we are cognisant of the fact that it is Agriculture questions on the Floor of the House this morning and the usual channels have agreed that the sitting be suspended at about 11.20 am to enable hon. Members to attend the Chamber.
<P>
Secondly, given that clause 2 deals broadly with the appointment of members of the agency, it is inevitable that our debates on the various groups of amendments will overlap. On that basis, I shall entertain a reasonably wide-ranging debate on the first amendment on the understanding that the Committee does not have a clause stand part debate.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appointment of members etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 1, line 17, leave out `twelve' and insert `fifteen'.
<P>
I can be reasonably narrow in my remarks because other amendments might cover the same ground. Thank you for your announcement, Mr. Gale, that the Committee may suspend its sitting slightly earlier than usual, thus proving once again what a shambles the Government have created for the House with Committees meeting at odd hours of the day and night and in the early morning, as now.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> Give the right hon. Gentleman some breakfast.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Government would disapprove of what I would have for breakfast, as they would disapprove of the rusty nails that I drank last night.
<P>
My amendment is straightforward. An executive board comprising 12 members is about right if they could be appointed from anywhere in the United Kingdom by the Government in England acting jointly with the appropriate authorities. However, given that the Government have, for some extraordinary reason, decided that the board's membership should include a representative from Northern Ireland, a representative from Wales and two representatives from Scotland, it will be stacked disproportionately heavily in favour of the Celtic parts of the United Kingdom and, in those circumstances, leave England under-represented.
<P>
If we consider the balance of population, Scotland has one-ninth of the population of the United Kingdom, so for it to have two representatives on a board of 12 members is absolutely extraordinary. We are working on the assumption that the Government are running scared of Scottish and Welsh nationalism and that they will not wish to reduce the number of representatives from Scotland and Wales.
<P>
Furthermore, irrespective of what may happen in the next debate, I assume that the Government will insist on keeping one member from Wales, one from Northern Ireland and two from Scotland, so the only way in which to restore the balance and for there to be some justice in the system would be to increase the overall size of the board from 12 to 15 members, although ideally 12 members is probably enough. For the board to comprise 15 representatives would not make it disproportionately large, nor would it make it unmanageable or unwieldy.
<P>
When I was a Minister, we reduced the number of members on boards from 30 to about 18, and that seemed to work. Sometimes we cut the membership to 15. It would be nonsense for the Government to say that 15 members of a board is far too many to be able to make decisions. Various quangos throughout the country are made up of more than 12 people. I do not think that 15 members would make the board more efficient, nor do I think that that number will make it less efficient. It will make it seen to be fair. It is nonsense for there to be a board of 12, with four people representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and only eight representing England, which is by far the largest partner in the co-operative effort.
<P>
Another point--my hon. Friends may return to it in the next debate--is that the Government have been assiduous in stressing that those who are appointed to the board will not be representatives. Philip James will not represent the Rowett research institute; he will represent the wider public interest. Those appointed from the Public Health Laboratory Service will not represent the laboratory service but the public interest. Those appointed from the food industry will not represent Nestle´ or Mars but the wider general public interest--and rightly so. Whoever is appointed, whatever their background or discipline, will not be representing the industry that they left behind; they will be taking a wider, overall view of food safety and food standards in the interests of consumers.
<P>
It is illogical, having stated that principle, for the Government then to say that the Welsh, the Scots and the Northern Irish will be represented. Some people will be specifically appointed from those areas, regions, countries, territories--whatever is the politically correct term that does not cause offence to those on the various Celtic fringes--and, although they will not have a clear remit under the Bill to represent the interests of consumers in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland, it is clearly implied and they will feel that it is their task.
<P>
No one is supposed to represent a background, a discipline, a science, a skill or an industry except those people specifically appointed to represent Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I find that illogical. The Government are trying to design a system that will cause no conflict of interest. We have all seen the advertisement published this week in The Guardian, which stresses, as we do in our prayers in the Chamber, that those who are appointed must leave behind all interests and prior affections, being absolutely neutral and having no conflict of interest--except that some people will have the duty of representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is illogical.
<P>
I ask the Minister to think seriously about this. The Government will have a slight problem of presentation on their hands if they are seen to have overpacked the board with people from those important and interesting parts of the United Kingdom. Those areas have a vital role to play in food production and food safety, and some of our finest food and drink comes from there. Nevertheless, the Government will be seen by producers in England, and perhaps by consumers in England, to have overstuffed the board with people from the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, who will thus have a disproportionate say in the organisation. I understand the general political reasons why the Government may not wish to reduce the representation from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The best solution would be to increase the board to 15, to allow three more members from England. It would make the board no less efficient.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I listened with interest to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean). I wondered whether he was speaking to amendment No. 94 or to a later amendment. Amendment No. 94 would increase the membership of the agency from 12, excluding the chairman and deputy chairman, to 15. The right hon. Gentleman has not made a good case for that increase. It is important to restate that the members of the board will not be representative of any sectional interest, nor will they be representative of any of the devolved authorities. Members appointed from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will contribute to the expertise and general experience of the board, although they will be appointed by the appropriate authority. For example, a Scottish toxicologist or a Welsh vet might be appointed. That is why the provisions for consultation on appointments have been clearly set out in the Bill. No case has been made to expand the board's membership, and I would not accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Would it not be better to choose members of the agency on basis of skill? Surely it is better to choose the best vet or the best toxicologist, rather than choose people arbitrarily because they come from a part of the United Kingdom that happens to have been chopped off by recent devolution legislation.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is taking what I said too literally. I was providing an illustration of how the right interaction between appointments from the devolved authorities and the search for a proper balance of skills in the agency's boards will be achieved. Of course, we are looking for the best people, as the job descriptions and advertisements for potential candidates make clear. The amendment specifically deals with the number of members on the board. I suspect that we shall have an opportunity later this morning to discuss how to achieve the right mix of skills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister says that I have not made out a case for the amendment, but she has certainly made no case for rejecting it, nor <P>
given any justification for stipulating that people must be appointed specifically from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. She has not said that sectional interests must be represented or that the board must be representative, so why is it necessary to specify that a minimum number of people will be appointed from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? If it is her view that the best people will be appointed from wherever they reside in the United Kingdom, there is no need to lay down quotas for appointments from the smaller parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I intervene on my right hon. Friend because I do not think that I shall be able to make a speech later. Will he press the Minister to say what sort of attendance record she will expect from those members and what the quorum will be? Unless enough members of the board are present, certain matters might be compromised.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is a possibility. I am not sure what the quorum for attendance at board meetings will be, but I suspect that, with reasonable expenses being paid to its members, there will be few absences on important board occasions. If such a board is overstuffed with people from whatever background or from whatever nationality, there will be an imbalance and the perception in England will be that it has missed out again. The Government have created a new quango, but they are running scared of the nationalists in Wales and Scotland and, therefore, as a sop, extra people will be appointed to the agency, 90 per cent. of the business of which will be conducted in England. The Minister illogically wants to stipulate that a minimum quota of people should be appointed from parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): Liberal Democrats support the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion in amendment No. 94 to have 15 members. However, Scotland has a different food standards regime, in so far as, for example, raw milk cannot be sold there, as it can be south of the border. I understand that the ban on the sale of beef on the bone will be reversed shortly in Wales. The regulatory regimes in those countries are different, so would it not be appropriate to have minimum representation from them on the board?
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but the logic of his argument is not that the Food Standards Agency should therefore contain more Scots because they have an entirely different legislative regime, but that Scotland should have an entirely separate Food Standards Agency. Neither I nor the Government want to pursue that at the moment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman argues that the legal regime is entirely different in Scotland. I do not like the term ``regime'' being applied to the Scottish legal system; it is not such a bongo-bongo country yet. The legal system in Scotland, founded on Roman-Dutch law and St. Thomas Aquinas, is such that much of the legislation passed in this House contains different clauses for Scotland, and applies differently. Much separate Scottish food legislation has been passed. Nevertheless, as the Government are establishing a Food Standards Agency with general powers that will apply equally in each of the countries of the United Kingdom, it is illogical for the hon. Gentleman to say that the board must contain more Scots members because things are done differently up there. His argument should be for a separate FSA.
<P>
Tabling the amendment was an exploratory attempt to ascertain whether I could persuade the Minister for Public Health to accept the illogicality of setting a minimum quota for people from the territories. Her answer did not satisfy me, and although I do not expect to be successful, I shall press the amendment to a vote.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden). I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 17, after `members', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`appointed for a term of four years renewable once'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 22, after `State', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`following public advertisement'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The amendments are designed to set more clearly the parameters for the appointment of the agency's members, chairman and deputy chairman. Amendment No. 4 would specify in the Bill a time limit on the length of term that members may serve. It proposes an appointment term of four years, which is renewable once.
<P>
In drafting the amendment, we examined several comparable organisations, although the FSA is something of a hybrid, falling somewhere between a quango and a non-ministerial statutory body. I asked the Library for assistance in examining precedents, and it cited the example of the Health and Safety Executive, to which officers may be appointed for a three-year term and then must be reappointed by the Secretary of State. I also examined the statute for the Food from Britain council, a quango in its own right, to which, again, officers are appointed for a three-year term that is renewable once.
<P>
In exploring what would be an appropriate length of time, I discovered yesterday to my interest an advertisement for the FSA positions, which was placed in yesterday's edition of The Guardian and in a Sunday newspaper. The advertisement states explicitly that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Board members will normally be appointed for three year terms which are renewable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the Government have placed a time limit in the advertisement, it is not too much to ask for that limit to be stated clearly in the Bill. Therefore, our amendment is relatively straightforward. To limit the terms of office of appointees to bodies such as the FSA gives any Government the opportunity to change a board's complexion. There may be a change of Government--we in opposition hope that there will be--and a change in the direction of the agency's strategy. Even a fine change of direction could necessitate a change of personnel in such positions.
<P>
The advertisement states that the terms are renewable. That seems open ended. How renewable are they? How many times can the positions be renewed? As is stated in the Register of Members' Interests, I used to serve on the Food from Britain council. From my experience there, single renewability has always struck me as a good idea, as it requires any agency to look for succession and for a fresh crop of people with the right skills to fill positions. Open-ended renewability may not always be a good thing.
<P>
Renewability in public appointments tends to go through on the nod without any proper systematic appraisal of a present board member's suitability to continue in his or her position. According to best practice in the business world, performance evaluation takes place when renewal of a contract is considered. That is not largely the practice in public appointments so far as I am aware. For that reason, we are keen that the Bill be amended in a way that is fairly consistent with what the Government imply is their intention in the advertisement. We are refining the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 relates to the need to advertise publicly for the posts. It helps that the advertisement appeared in time for us to discuss it in detail as part of our debate. We read its small print with close attention because it gives a lot of information about what the Government are looking for in terms of the attributes and skills of the agency members, chair and deputy chair. We shall discuss later the question of interests.
<P>
In this debate on the advertisement that we want the Bill to require, it is interesting to see how the Government regard the balance of relevant skills that the Minister has already referred to. The advertisement states that the Government are looking for:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Specialist expertise in ... biochemistry, epidemiology ... risk assessment ... consumer affairs, food transport and preparation or public communication.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
From that, I envisage that the Government will draw from a body of scientists, medical researchers, statisticians and those who specialise in the logistics of food transportation. We have strong concerns about the placing of an advertisement which, in some way, steers the composition and, therefore, the ultimate direction of the Food Standards Agency. It is important that the Bill should include the need for a public advertisement and for a proper discussion of what it should contain.
<P>
The advertisement states that the agency must have integrity and that its members must demonstrate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``freedom from conflicts of interest''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall address that when we debate later amendments on the interests of agency members. However, the advertisement raises a number of questions in relation to the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
Placing the advertisement in good time is of paramount importance. We should like the Bill to include that prerequisite and the need to constrain more precisely the period for which members are allowed to serve on the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> When the Minister replies, I should be grateful if she would say in which newspapers, besides The Guardian, the advertisement was placed.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I shall be happy to provide Committee members with a list of the newspapers in which the advertisement appeared.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary and, therefore, we cannot accept them. The procedures that govern the appointment of members to the Food Standards Agency follow the Nolan-Peach rules, which provide a sound, effective basis for the organisation of and decision on appointments to public bodies. I am sure that I do not need to remind the Opposition that adherence to those rules is necessary for public bodies to meet the highest standards of conduct.
<P>
It is worth stating the seven principles of public life to which those rules relate--selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. All those principles are developed in specific ways in the job descriptions for the chairman, deputy chairman and members of the board.
<P>
The Nolan-Peach rules allow for three years to be the normal period for appointments; appointments to the agency board follow that. Therefore, the first appointments will be for three years, with the option of renewing those appointments twice, up to a maximum of 10 years. Our expectation is that length of service may vary from six to 10 years.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) is aware of the importance of the need for a degree of flexibility. Some people seem to be great prospects when they are appointed to a board, but do not deliver when they are in post. Others find that professional or family commitments prevent them from continuing to give the necessary time.
<P>
The experience of appointing to a range of public bodies suggests that stability is important. It is not desirable for all the members of such a body to come to end of their term of office at the same time. It is, therefore, unnecessary for the Bill to define further the length of time for which the appointments are to be made.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 6 would require members of the agency to be appointed after the placing of a public advertisement. Members will be appointed after public advertisement. The Nolan-Peach rules do not prescribe public advertisement, although they make it clear that Departments should take every available step to widen the field of candidates as far as possible. We gave a clear commitment on Second Reading that the posts would be publicly advertised, and they have been. The combination of public advertisement and proper consideration of applicants at the sifting stage by an independent panel is intended to ensure that we get the best people and the right diversity of skills and experience for those important appointments.
<P>
To answer the question asked by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, I confirm that the advertisement has appeared or will appear in The Sunday Times; The Times; The Guardian; The Scotsman; The Herald; the Western Mail; the north Wales edition of the Daily Post; the Irish Times; the Irish Newsletter; the Belfast Telegraph; The Irish News; New Nation; the Asian Times; Eastern Eye and the Caribbean Times. Amendment No. 6 is therefore unnecessary.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It does not appear in Tribune!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Minister mentioned the Nolan-Peach rules; we accept the importance of those rules and the way in which they govern public life. We have confidence in them and on that basis have no qualms in withdrawing our amendment, although I am a little disquieted that the rules are not prescriptive on the need for public advertisements before appointments are made. I stress that it is imperative that the Food Standards Agency is seen to be completely above board. The question of integrity is therefore paramount and I would have thought that it was all the more important that advertisements were systematically issued before appointments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 17, leave out from `members' to `appointed' in line 22.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No 95, in page 1, leave out from beginning of line 18 to first `the' in line 22 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) one member shall be appointed by the appropriate authorities for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland acting jointly; and
<P>
(b)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 7, in page 2, line 1, leave out lines 2 to 4 and insert `Secretary of State'.
<P>
No. 8, in page 2, line 6, leave out from second `the' to `shall' and insert `Secretary of State'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I should like first to correct an omission on the issue of interests that I made in our previous sitting--I do not think it is significant, but I should perhaps mention it. I declare in the Register of Members' Interests ownership of a very small parcel of land that produces a very small amount of food each year. That could imply an interest.
<P>
The group of amendments takes us back to the issue raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border on the constitution of the agency and its members. Like my right hon. Friend, I was disconcerted by the Minister's response, which was highly dismissive and did not set out arguments to justify why the clause was phrased in the way that it is. As I have said, our thrust is not to negate or undermine the Bill or its purposes; it is to improve its effectiveness. However, there are real problems and inconsistencies with the way in which the clause is drafted. In many ways, the clause gets to the heart of the Bill's structure and operation because it raises the issue of the FSA's relationship with the other countries, territories or provinces--or any of the other descriptions of the UK that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border used in the hope that one of them would be universally acceptable--in other words, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and England. We shall return to that point in amendments to other clauses, but the point is probably most pertinent in relation to clause 1.
<P>
The agency will have responsibilities across the whole of the United Kingdom. It is therefore essential that it should act consistently across the whole of the United Kingdom. As presently drafted, the Bill raises the prospect of there being different food standards in various parts of the UK. Scottish Ministers could decide something different from the Secretary of State for Health.
<P>
We must consider how the members of the board are to be appointed. First, however, I must say that I am rather disappointed that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is not here today, because the amendments to clause 2 are of most concern to him. I shall probably be told that he is in Edinburgh for the opening of the Scottish Parliament, but what are his priorities? He is a Minister in the United Kingdom Government, not the Scottish Executive. Not being here when the Committee is dealing with the very question that I thought was the point of his being a member of the Committee seems to negate that fundamental objective. I hope that he is here for later sittings and that we can challenge him then. I wondered whether he had resigned, given that his job becomes defunct from today.
<P>
We propose that the Secretary of State should make all the appointments to the agency. We agree with the Minister that we want the very best people, regardless of where they come from. That must be the guiding principle but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said, there is a great inconsistency in suggesting that they cannot be appointed to represent any sector of the food industry but saying that it is perfectly acceptable that they represent a geographical area. I do not think that the interests of the Scottish or Welsh consumers are any different to those of the English consumer.
<P>
The second inconsistency is in the detail of clause 2. Subsection (l)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one member shall be appointed by the National Assembly for Wales''<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
However, subsection (l)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``two members shall be appointed by the Scottish Ministers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In Wales, the Assembly--the democratic body--makes the appointment; in Scotland, the appointment is made not by the Scottish Parliament but by Scottish Ministers. I cannot understand why the Government do not want to give the responsibility to appoint Welsh members to a vegetarian Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is still food.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It is only half food. I cannot understand the inconsistency of requiring the Assembly to make the appointments for Wales, but requiring Ministers to make them for Scotland. We then come to Northern Ireland. Subsection (l)(c) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one member shall be appointed by the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean the UK Minister for the Northern Ireland Office who takes responsibility for those services? Does it mean that the civil servants should make the decision? Without going too much into the events of the past 48 hours, can we hope that it means that Ministers from the new Executive--if there is one--of the Northern Ireland Assembly will make those decisions?
<P>
Lastly, subsection (l)(d) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the others shall be appointed by the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we believe that to mean the Secretary of State for Health. In its drafting, the Bill contains huge inconsistencies about who should make the appointments. We shall discuss the sort of people who might be appointed in later amendments, but we believe that it would be far more effective and beneficial for the agency if all the appointments were made ultimately by the Secretary of State. Of course, he should consult his colleagues--unless different parties control the different Assemblies and Parliaments--but the final decision should rest with the Secretary of State. It is wrong to discriminate, which would happen under clause 2(1).
<P>
Another aspect of the agency's relationship to the various parts of the United Kingdom is that it could be affected by something called the national food safety week, which was started seven years ago by the Conservative Government. What might happen in future? Will there be a national Welsh food safety week? Will Northern Ireland and Scotland have a food safety week? Yes, they may, but will they all put forward the same safety proposals? [Interruption.] Perhaps it should be in the Bill. It is nonsensical to have different food policies--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot have members conducting conversations across the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> We should not have different food safety policies in different parts of the United Kingdom. We believe strongly that the best people should be appointed, regardless of where they live or what they do. In that we support the Government. However, members should not be appointed to represent different parts of the UK. The other inconsistency is that some appointments are made by a democratic body, and others by an appointed Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 95, which is in my name. I remind the Committee that it would insert a paragraph stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one member shall be appointed by the appropriate authorities for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland acting jointly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I tabled it in anticipation of the Government's rejection of amendment No. 94. It is another attempt to ensure a perception of justice and fairness in the board. If the board has only 12 members and a chairman and deputy chairman, it should have a proper balance of representation from around the UK.
<P>
The amendment would permit one member only to be appointed to cover Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Nothing would stop more than one member, who may have originally come from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, being appointed by MAFF or the Department of Health in England. That person may have had a Scottish background--not that I am putting myself forward for membership of the board. If England was not as under-represented on the board as the Minister intends it to be, it would be perceived as being more fair.
<P>
The proposition that the authorities can act together jointly is not so off the wall as it may seem. For example, clause 2(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The chairman and deputy chairman shall be appointed by the appropriate authorities acting jointly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly the Government envisage that the appropriate authorities can act jointly in order to reach a conclusion on who should be the chairman and the deputy chairman. Of course, the chairman and deputy chairman may hail from any part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
In such circumstances, the appropriate authorities should act together to ensure that all the board members come from any part of the United Kingdom. In particular, jointly acting authorities should ensure that at least one member comes from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
<P>

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government cannot say that that would be unfair. If they believe that the amendment is unfair and would reduce representation, the Minister must justify the basis for that belief. Why does Scotland--which has a population of 5 million--have two members on the board, when England--which has a population of 50 million--has only eight members on the board?
<P>
The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot justify Scotland having two members on the board, when England has only eight members. My amendment does not seek to give England representation proportionate to that of Scotland. I am disappointed--indeed, shocked--that Liberal Democrats Members have not tabled an amendment suggesting that England should have another 32 members on the board, which would be the number under proportional representation. On the basis that Scotland has two members representing 5 million people, England would be entitled to about 30 members. That is clearly nonsensical, but it has never stopped Liberal Democrats tabling amendments in the past. I therefore congratulate the two Liberal Democrat Members of the Committee for not going down that route on this occasion.
<P>
Our discussion of the previous amendment may not have been the occasion for the Minister to offer an explanation. However, amendment No. 95 certainly offers him an occasion to justify eight members representing 50 million people and two members representing 5 million people. Will he tell the Committee and the outside world why that is fair?

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I endorse the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. It is utter nonsense to presuppose the acquiescence of the English, which is at the core of the devolution process in which the Government have engaged over the past year. Why on earth should 85 per cent. of the population have the representation specified in the Bill? 15 per cent. of the population will have an arbitrary 33 per cent. representation on the Food Standards Agency.
<P>
If the agency is to be truly independent and served by the very best people who really do know about food production and food matters, is it important where those people come from? No, of course not. We want the best 12 people who can be found. Whether they live in Wales--the border of which is 50 yards from my house--is beside the point. Whether they come from Wales, Scotland or England is completely irrelevant.
<P>
The part of the country containing the majority of the population will surely produce the greatest number of experts. However, under the clause's arbitrary provisions, that area has a lesser chance of being represented on the agency. Clause 2 limits the skills that will be available to the whole population.
<P>
The agency will give advice and--if the Government have their way--enforce it in relation to matters that dramatically affect the production, distribution and retailing of food throughout the country. However, clause 2 limits the skills of the 12 people appointed to the agency. I therefore support my right hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I shall reply to the final question asked by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border.
<P>
By and large, we do not seek to justify the proportionality that he implied. That is not the name of the game. Today, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament get full control of powers devolved from Parliament. The thrust of conflict and aggression underlying all three speeches--albeit less marked in that of the Front-Bench spokesman--is therefore disturbing. The idea of conflict between the various parts of the United Kingdom is inappropriate. However, it is symbolic of the Opposition's approach to devolution.
<P>
If Committee members examine the clause in detail, they will find that the figures that it gives are minimum. There may be five or six people from Scotland on the board, although there must be a minimum of two such members. The figures are not prescribed and are not intended to be proportional.
<P>
Therefore, that argument is not worth a candle and the Committee should not spend too much time on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Why does the Bill specify a geographical origin for some agency members? Why is that relevant? The agency should have the best people with the best skills and knowledge. Where they live does not matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall seek to justify the FSA membership, but I shall not do so on the grounds implied in the question asked by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border.
<P>
I want to tackle the lapse of memory of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). National food safety week has nothing to do with the Government. It is organised by the Food and Drink Federation; it is an event led by the private sector, which has Government support. There is no Government national food safety week.
<P>
There have been seven national food safety weeks, three of which I have launched, one jointly with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health. A representative of the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland was present at each of those launches. Therefore, I do not accept the charge that I come from England, but sometimes wear a Great Britain hat and sometimes an England one.
<P>
That is not an issue. National food safety week is not controlled by the Government; it is organised by industry. The idea that provision for the event should be included in the Bill is nonsense.
<P>
Why have we set minimum numbers for agency membership? That question goes to the heart of the matter, and it is quite legitimate to ask it.
<P>
We are legislating to set up a UK-wide agency in an area that this Parliament has freely agreed is subject to devolution. We, therefore, had to be careful about timetabling in the White Paper, ``The Food Standards Agency: A Force for Change'', which was published in January 1998. We wanted to introduce the Bill before the devolution process was complete; that would have led to a tidier arrangement.
<P>
However, the parliamentary process is such that the Bill is the first measure to pass through this House setting up a UK body in a devolved subject area. It does that at the very time that the new devolved bodies are being elected, set up and are assuming their powers. Therefore, it is a matter of some delicacy that we get the arrangements right.
<P>
In future, Parliament will legislate in other devolved areas. In some ways, the Bill makes provision for setting the rules and understanding the procedures. We are doing our level best to get that right.
<P>
A later clause in the Bill makes provision for the Scottish Parliament to vote to take on such powers, as it is entitled to do. Parliament cannot prevent such a vote.
<P>
However, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly have already debated and accepted the idea that the agency should be UK-wide. Nevertheless, because the subject area is devolved and we want--and are obliged--to respect differences within the United Kingdom, we intend that there should be an FSA committee or board in Scotland, Wales and, indeed, Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is less defined, because the cross-border arrangements--if they ever come about--will affect the whole of Ireland, so a different procedure will be used there. However, each region will have a broad, committed committee or board.
<P>
The Food Standards Agency must be accountable to the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, as it must be to the House. It will be an important United Kingdom-wide body, dealing with devolved matters. The membership links were thought appropriate so that the 12 people, good and true, plus a chair and deputy chair, appointed to the board for their individual expertise, life skills, experience, will come from a matrix of backgrounds and experience, some of which are set out in greater detail in the document that will be sent to those who telephone the hotline for the jobs.
<P>
The total number of members is the only constraint that we place on that matrix of backgrounds and issues. We have agreed on a maximum of 12 members, plus the chair and deputy chair, and to include two members from Scotland, one from Northern Ireland and one from Wales. If we were simply to do that, we could find someone for the agency on a bus in Princes street. Therefore, the members must have a background of expertise in food technology, chemistry, public health or interests related to the issues and expertise that we want the agency to have to enable it to perform its national role.
<P>
Because those people will come from the devolved parts of the United Kingdom, they will be able to chair the boards of the devolved FSA in those areas, creating direct communication links with Scottish Office Ministers, the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The agency will be a national body, so it is common sense to be consistent, so far as possible, across the United Kingdom and, therefore, to have a United Kingdom-wide agency. Much of our food law is determined in Brussels, and no one will be able to ignore European Union directives, although that is no one's intention. The decision on whether to create a body just for England, or wherever, was taken early on.
<P>
The remaining members appointed by the Secretary of State have been constantly referred to as the English members, but they will not be English members; they will be United Kingdom members. There is no predilection about where they come from. It was decided to have joint agreement between the Secretary of State for Health, the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales about the chair and deputy chair, because that seemed a sensible way to produce good working arrangements. Another clause deals with the chief executive. MAFF is not mentioned in the advertisement.
<P>
The clause refers to Scottish Ministers but to the National Assembly for Wales because of the different legal structures of those bodies. No one claims that those bodies are the same. Scotland has a primary law-making Parliament, but the Welsh Assembly deals with secondary legislation. If one wanted the agency to fall at the first hurdle in devolved matters, one would ignore devolution. It would not make sense to ignore devolution given that powers have passed to the Scottish Parliament that could enable it to take such matters unto itself without recourse to this Parliament. Ignoring devolution could create the conflict that has been referred to this morning. We want the arrangements to be based not on conflict, but on consent. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I request the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) to withdraw.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is easy to make mistakes as a result of sitting at different times on Thursdays.
<P>
I hope that I have explained that we have gone down this route to meet the needs of the laws that Parliament has enacted. It might come as a shock to some hon. Members, but from today even as Ministers we have to ask ourselves who is responsible for what while we become used to the new working arrangements. We must treat with respect those who have been democratically elected to carry out the functions in the devolved Parliament and Assemblies. It is important that language is not used thoughtlessly, causing unnecessary difficulties.
<P>
On devolved matters, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald)--who is obviously in Edinburgh today--could be a useful go-between as a United Kingdom Minister for us as GB or English Ministers, depending on which hat we are wearing, and the Scottish Executive. In my experience, when there is good news, we are English Ministers; when there is bad news, we are GB Ministers. My experience in MAFF is borne out by a series of examples from the past couple of years, which I shall not go into.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does that mean that the Minister will be a GB or United Kingdom Minister permanently, because he is always expecting bad or even worse news?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, there is lots of good news every day.
<P>
These are obviously probing amendments. I would not be so antagonistic as to say that they represent a deliberate attempt to unpick the devolution arrangements, which would happen if they were accepted. I hope that I have explained why those people will be appointed to the board. Of course, we will have no knowledge of their backgrounds. They will be chosen from those who respond to the advertisements in the press. We have no list of the great and the good in a drawer in Whitehall, whatever anyone might think. If hon. Members wanted to be really negative, they could ask what would happen if we received no applications from people in Scotland and Wales. I do have an answer to that purely hypothetical question.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border probably knows better than most members of the Committee about the vagaries of working in the United Kingdom, given his background. I have just noticed from the Register of Members' Interests that, notwithstanding his Scottish background, he is basically the leg man in the House for police superintendents in Scotland and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> England and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> So the right hon. Gentleman is comfortable dealing with matters that relate only to England and Wales, bearing in mind his background and the fact that Scotland has its own laws. He understands the cauldron in which we live peacefully in this country of different regions. The Bill is designed to reflect those differences with some consistency and without excessive bureaucracy. This field of law is governed partly by Brussels. We do not have much discretion, and it involves differences in the United Kingdom that we want to reflect rather than taking a heavy-handed approach and saying that everything must be the same everywhere. That would be nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister gives an interesting explanation of why an arbitrary four members will come from the devolved areas. That explanation shows that devolution commitments that the Government have made and have met through legislation are incompatible with and contradict commitments that will be made under clauses 1 and 2 if the Bill is enacted. The Bill specifies that the first four places cannot be taken by representatives from England, where 85 per cent. of the population live. However, it is likely that more experts will come from England than from the devolved areas, where only 15 per cent. of the population live. We are trying to establish the best agency with the best people, and the commitment in clause 1 is incompatible with the commitment to the British people on devolution being enacted today in Edinburgh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not accept that, because we are not using a crude, rigid idea of proportionality. If we were, the Scottish Parliament would not be the size that it is, given the population of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament is a quarter of the size of the House. Mathematical, rigid boundaries create dissent and conflict, because minorities feel that their voices are not being heard. That is an important consideration that we do not want to sweep away.
<P>
We are not a unitary state, and it would be entirely wrong constantly to refer to English members' disproportionate representation on a UK-wide agency. I accept that there is a conflict, but it exists only in so far as we are establishing a UK agency in a devolved area with the consent and agreement of the devolved institutions. They understand the merit in a UK body that takes account in its membership, working arrangements and arrangements for accountability to those other bodies of the existence of those bodies. That is a recipe for success rather than conflict, and it takes account of the reality of life in the United Kingdom. I cannot understand why that should present a problem--except for people who adhere to an ideology that is root and branch opposed to the devolved process, and believe that might is right and that, as the English have more members than anyone else, they should therefore give orders to and dominate the rest of the United Kingdom. I disagree with that ideology.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister's last comments are a misinterpretation, although perhaps not a deliberate one, of my intention. I made it clear that we wanted the best people from the United Kingdom to serve on the agency. I am not fighting for any one national corner, but merely saying that it would be more sensible not to state arbitrarily that one-third of members should come from 15 per cent. of the population.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I understand why the Minister sat down when he did, because he was beginning to get in rather a muddle over his justification--or non-justification--for opposing the amendments.
<P>
We are not trying to unpick devolution. There is no need to rehearse that debate. The Opposition have made it absolutely clear that we shall not try to unpick devolution, and we are not attempting to do so with these, or any other, amendments. If the FSA is to be a UK-wide body as the Minister says, to insert territorial representation seems contradictory. If all 12 members, the chair and deputy chair come from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and are the best people, so be it. English nationalism or domination has nothing to do with the subject, as the Minister implied that it might. We simply want the best people on the board; we have no ulterior motive. He said that the clause allows the minimum number of members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but it does not frighten us that there could be several more. As I said, I do not care where all the best available people come from. We want to identify and highlight the inconsistency in the Bill.
<P>
The Minister also sought to ridicule my comments about food safety week and promptly went on to say that he had launched the previous three. That is another inconsistency. Food safety week is run by the industry but has huge Government support--at least, it did in our day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It was after I relinquished my duty, but I had the privilege of attending the launch of the first food safety week. The food industry mentions it only because the Conservative Government fully supported and encouraged the industry to take the initiative on food safety, rather than see the initiative taken by a nagging Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My right hon. Friend, with his experience, puts things even more clearly than I can. The Minister said that there was a gentleman from Scotland behind him when he launched food safety week. That is fine and underlines the fact that it is a UK operation, as the FSA is supposed to be. If it will be UK-wide, why should we say that the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Ministers and Northern Ireland Departments should appoint a set number of representatives? I do not care where the members come from so long as they are the best.
<P>
The Minister said that he wants the FSA to reflect the differences between different parts of the United Kingdom, which was why I said that he was getting in a muddle. To reflect the differences will fly in the face of the FSA's being a UK-wide operation, as it implies that there will be differences in the ways in which the agency monitors, enforces and carries out its duties in different parts of the country. Then the Minister suggested that, as it was a UK agency, all the members would eventually be the same, but the advertisement states otherwise. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``6-7 days a month for members who are specifically appointed as members with special responsibilities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ... and 3-4 days for other members ... £20,000 a year pensionable for members with special responsibilities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who also chair local Advisory Committees and £8,000 a year ... for other members.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The apparently UK-wide agency will actually have members with special responsibilities for some parts of the United Kingdom, so there is huge inconsistency again. We shall return on a later clause to the issue of advisory committees and the absence of one for England. The Minister has wholly failed to justify what is laid out in clause 2.
<P>
My other challenge to the Minister was on the different nature of appointments by the democratic bodies and Ministers themselves. I do not follow his reasoning about the Scottish Parliament having responsibility for primary legislation and the Welsh Assembly having responsibility for secondary legislation only. Our point deals not with that, but with who is put on the board. There is a Welsh Cabinet Member with responsibility for agriculture and I assume that there is one for health, although I do not know who that is. Appointments should be made either by appointed Ministers and Secretaries or by the bodies themselves, rather than in the inconsistent way stated in the Bill.
<P>
I am disappointed in the Government's response. I had intended to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the Minister will respond further to my remarks before I reach a final decision.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Perhaps I may respond briefly to the Minister because some of his remarks were targeted unfairly at me. At least we now know the measure of the style that he adopts to persuade us of his argument. We know when he has a brief in which he does not really believe. Gone is the punchy, forthright Minister whom we know and love, who is absolutely certain that he is right and who gives the Opposition a nice slap at this early hour in the morning to keep us in place. When the hon. Gentleman adopts the style of ``Believe me, I am here to achieve consensus throughout the United Kingdom'', we know that he is on a sticky wicket. They would not believe it in the pubs of Perry Barr.
<P>
It is the Minister's Government who are building into the Bill seeds of potential conflict. They are setting Scotland on a route to independence--sooner rather than later, perhaps, but that is for another occasion. The conflict will arise from the Government setting a minimum quota for members from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They should accept the principle of the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that it does not matter a hang where the members of the agency come from.
<P>
The basis of appointment under the Nolan rules is for the Government to accept the best vets, doctors, epidemiologists, microbiologists, and food transport logistical experts from whatever part of the United Kingdom. Given that whoever is appointed will be scrutinised carefully from all sides--the media will take an intense interest in their background and they will be liable to criticism from every quarter--there is no harm in the Minister not having a quota from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. If they are the best people available, it does not matter where they come from.
<P>
However, the Minister is sowing potential seeds of conflict by saying that some countries will be treated more favourably than others. It is extraordinary that the chairman and the deputy chairman will have a United Kingdom responsibility; others will be members representing Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and those whom I thought would be English members will be United Kingdom members, too. The possibility for muddle in their respective responsibilities will be remarkable.
<P>
I do not expect there to be confusion in reality because I assume that all the members will muck in and undertake what they think is appropriate. Nevertheless, the Minister is setting up an odd structure under the Bill. He would not come before the House with such a measure were it not for the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the possibility of a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland. He has had to create a completely artificial structure for the board of the agency to accommodate the devolutionary process. I am not seeking to unpick that process; I do not need to--over time, it will unpick itself as inevitable tensions become evident between a Scottish Parliament and what remains of the United Kingdom Parliament.
<P>
The first conflict will be about finance. As the Government are learning a tough lesson in Scotland, so the Minister will learn that we cannot be 95 per cent. pregnant nor 95 per cent. independent. The fact that the Government have given the Scots 95 per cent. independence will not be satisfactory to the Scottish people in due course. However, I do not wish to go down that route today; I wish merely to head off the Minister from accusing me of sowing seeds of conflict. Unless the Minister is seen to act fairly for the rump of the United Kingdom--whether he is wearing his English hat or his United Kingdom Minister hat, restricted to the boundaries of England--there will be demands for England to be fairly treated. The same demands will be heard in this Parliament when some hon. Members are seen to have a dual mandate and even voting rights. As of today in this Parliament, the equalities that used to exist between all hon. Members have been replaced by unevenness and drastic imbalance.
<P>
The Minister is setting up a similar inequality in his board--some people will be exclusively the Scottish director or Scottish representative, while those appointed from England will be UK members of the board. The Minister admits that confusion arises when Members sit at odd hours of the day and night in Committee--even a senior Labour Back Bencher was caught out this morning.
<P>
I am sorry that the Minister seems unlikely to accept a reasonable amendment. If he accepts the principle of what my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is saying--that members should be appointed on their ability and skills, and that territoriality, nationality or national boundaries should be irrelevant--there is no merit whatever in having a quota for members from a country of the United Kingdom.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am more than happy to provide clarification. I do not want to press the point, but ``the rump of the United Kingdom'' is just the kind of phrase that I referred to earlier. It is conflict language.
<P>
To answer the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, the reason for the inconsistency is the decision to set up a UK agency in a devolved area. The intention behind the construction of the membership is to knit that inconsistency together in a way that works and that will deliver good decision-making processes. Our experts have reminded me not to fall into the trap of referring to where people live or where they were born, although Opposition Members, and I, have done so. The clause makes it clear that the appointment is in the gift of Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales; it is up to them. There might be a world-class expert in microbiological safety of food, who worked in a research institution in London or food valley, and who happened to be from one of the territorial backgrounds. Ministers or the Assembly might say, ``That person will be good for the agency because of his background and skills, and, as the appointment is in our gift, we will choose that person''.
<P>
This will not be the last time that we discuss such matters in relation to a devolved area. I freely admit that I did not explain the differences adequately, as I used the shorthand. The Scotland Act 1998 put the powers of executive responsibility in the hands of Ministers in the Scottish Parliament. The Government of Wales Act 1998 does not have the same arrangements for executive responsibilities. Those powers were vested in the National Assembly for Wales, and the Assembly, therefore, decides who should be Ministers. Legally, it is the National Assembly for Wales that makes the decisions; it is in the Assembly's gift to make the appointments. The two devolution Acts have set out the Executive responsibilities differently.
<P>
Anything that I say on Northern Ireland will be subject to some incredible caveats. In some ways, the less said the better. We have had experience over the years with direct rule, and the powers did not cause a problem under the former arrangements. Certainly, the UK-wide body, to which the all-Ireland food safety body may be added under other agreements, could be said to be another inconsistency and another complication. However, it is one that we freely accept. If the people on the island of Ireland wish to do it in that way, we are happy to live with it because it will be in their best interests. It will probably be the only example in the European Union of two sovereign states dealing together with food safety arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of clarification, will  the representatives appointed, for example, by Scotland be primarily responsible to the Scottish Executive, or will they be appointed for their expertise and be expected to use their expertise rather than to act on any political instruction that they may receive from the Scottish Executive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The latter; they will be appointed for their expertise. Of course--it is even implied in the job description given in the advertisement--the FSA will be quasi-devolved, with an executive board in Scotland. Those members will be accountable to the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament. The FSA will be accountable to the devolved authorities because it is a devolved matter. I make no bones about the fact that we are in uncharted waters.
<P>
Those people, coming to board meetings in London where the headquarters will be, will have no political instructions from the Scottish Parliament. They will be aware of what has been discussed there, but there will not be a link; they will not come with that sort of baggage. I hope that I shall not be contradicted, because I have always understood that we are putting together a UK-wide agency with responsible members. We need class people; they cannot learn on the job. We can discuss the matter in later amendments, but that is what I understand to be the situation. That has always been the case, and it can help to make the system work.
<P>
It will be an interesting institution. There is nothing comparable, although hon. Members can obviously search for models, as we did. We did not follow the model originally proposed by Philip James in his report, on which most of the Bill's provisions are based; it would have been a body like the Health and Safety Commission or the Health and Safety Executive. That proposal was seriously considered, but we explained in the White Paper in January 1998 why we did not want to proceed with it. There is no comparable quango, partly because of devolution but also because many of our rules are governed by our membership of the European Union.
<P>
I have tried to explain and reinforce what I said earlier--I hope to the Opposition's satisfaction--about the arrangements for appointing members. If not, I shall try again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for offering to have another go. I appreciate his candour. I remain unconvinced about the idea of separate nominations from the various bodies, but I am pleased that the Minister has clarified the inconsistency of whether the body or the Executive would make the appointments. We continue to have grave misgivings about the idea of having some members appointed by other bodies, but the Minister's explanation has helped. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I wish to make two announcements. First, members of the Committee will have noticed that the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) entered the Room earlier. It is the duty of the Chair to protect the integrity of the Committee and to ensure that nobody is allowed in who is not an appointed member of it. It has transpired that the incident was a genuine misunderstanding; the hon. Lady had been given a notice of attendance card for another Committee with this Room number printed on it and that is why she was here. It was not anything to do, as the Minister of State said earlier, with the confusion caused by the time of the sitting. On behalf of the authorities of the House, I place on record an unreserved apology for any embarrassment caused to the hon. Lady; I shall inform her that that apology has been made.
<P>
The second matter that has been brought to my notice is that early this morning, Viscount Whitelaw passed away. It is not the custom of the House to suspend sittings other than for the death of a Prime Minister and our proceedings will therefore continue. However, I would like to say that Lord Whitelaw was a distinguished member of the other place and of this House and was widely respected, indeed loved, on both sides. The opportunity will arise later for hon. Members to pay their respects in the appropriate manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 1, line 22, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The appropriate authorities shall ensure that, of all the members appointed,
<P>
(a) at least two have practical experience of primary food production;
<P>
(b) at least two have practical experience of food processing;
<P>
(c) at least one has practical experience of food storage and distribution;
<P>
(d) at least two have practical experience of food retailing; and
<P>
(e) at least two have practical experience of food preparation in the hospitality industry.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 99, in page 2, line 8, leave out `experience' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`practical experience of food production'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 9, in page 2, line 9, after `safety', insert `or production'.
<P>
No. 97, in page 2, line 9, after `safety', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, production, processing, storage and use,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This is an important group of amendments and I hope that the Committee will understand if I talk on them briefly before attending to some other duties.
<P>
The amendments seek to ensure that, just as people from various parts of the UK will be on the board of the agency, people from various disciplines will be on the board. I am sure that the Minister will tot up the total number of representatives that we suggest and say, ``Ah, that would be unfair; there would be an over-heavy production bias if they were all appointed.'' However, I seek to establish the principle that people from those disciplines should be on the board. It is important that we have on it people who have had practical experience of primary food production, food processing, food storage and distribution, food retailing and also that the hospitality industry is represented--I think that I have got the terminology roughly right to cover the main disciplines in the food industry.
<P>
To deal first with the last sector I mentioned, there is a tendency in the Bill, as everywhere else, to forget about the hospitality industry--as it likes to be known. When we talk about food, people immediately start talking about supermarkets, shops and corner shops and forget the huge size of the hospitality industry, which ranges from the Waterside Inn at Bray to hundreds of portable kebab takeaways--no doubt there are some outside the nightclubs in Perry Barr. Not that one holds different opinions about the qualities of those foods, but the agency may no doubt conclude in due course that the food from some establishments is organoleptically preferable to others.
<P>
Unless the Minister includes people from some of those backgrounds on the board, the agency will be severely lacking in the practical experience that it will need. Yes, it is important that there are microbiologists and chemists, but the food industry, particularly in the food processing sector, has learned in recent years that it must have people with food technology degrees. Goodness knows what a food technology degree consists of--I assume a bit of science, chemistry and microbiology. A tremendous amount of practical food processing experience is required before one can analyse why outbreaks involving food safety occur. In a case of salmonella, for example, a microbiologist will determine under the microscope that the bacteria is salmonella and decide the type, strain and strength of it, but if one is trying to eradicate or reduce salmonella in the food chain, experience shows that people need practical knowledge of how it can get into mayonnaise in the first place. Without raking over the coals of the past, if the Minister were to study the history of salmonella outbreaks, he would recognise that practical experience of the food processing and storage industries is essential in trying to prevent such outbreaks.
<P>
I do not take pleasure from the huge number of chickens that I ordered to be killed during my time as a Minister in trying to reduce salmonella outbreaks; indeed, I shudder to think about it. However, I followed a policy of reducing the number of chickens that might have salmonella in an attempt to reduce the number of eggs with salmonella. I have not looked back to ascertain whether that policy was successful, but I have a funny feeling that salmonella remains in chickens and, in certain circumstances, in eggs. Depending on how we prepare, use and store them, mayonnaise and eggs may ultimately contain salmonella, but their safety depends more on end use than on production methods.
<P>
At the time, I followed advice from microbiologists that, because an end product contained salmonella, we had to exterminate a few million chickens to eradicate the problem. Those with practical experience of primary food production techniques said that that would not work, because the circumstances in which eggs are produced present a small salmonella risk. Chicken meat, like other meat, presents such a risk. That risk can be reduced if the meat is prepared, cooked, stored and used wisely. It cannot be eliminated by trying to exterminate every animal that may present it.
<P>
The Government of which I was a member might have been more successful on that occasion had our hand not been forced by the overwhelming weight of public opinion and by Her Majesty's loyal Opposition--who encouraged us to exterminate nearly everything in sight--in that futile attempt to reduce salmonella outbreaks. Perhaps if we had had more balance, we could have explained that those with practical experience of food production techniques knew that it would not work and that, even if only one chicken remained in the UK, the risk of salmonella would remain, depending on how products were treated and used.
<P>
I think that the Minister will accept the validity of the points that I am making in tabling amendment No. 100. He will probably say that he cannot accept the numbers because they are far too great and would create an overwhelming majority on the board, which would be unfair and would be seen to be stacked in favour of the vile producers as opposed to consumers. However, people who produce food also have consumer interests at heart and at stake. There is no merit in being producers who poison their public, so it is in their interests to ensure that food consumed in this country is as pure and clean as possible.
<P>
I shall not labour the point. The Minister will no doubt say that the microbiologists and scientists whom he will appoint--those at whom The Guardian advert is directed--will have some practical experience. However, I am worried that the terminology used in the advert will discourage those with practical microbiological experience in industry. The advert gives the impression that those who have worked in industry are not welcome; that they are bound to have an interest, so they will not be appointed. The Minister shakes his head. He will need to do more, perhaps in the adverts that he will place in The Sunday Times or The Times later this week--

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I cannot change the advert.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> No, but future advertisements should make it clear that, while such skills as essential or desirable, people in industry with those skills would be welcome to apply. It should not merely be doctors, those who work in public health service or microbiology laboratories who are welcome to apply, which is the impression given by the advert. The Minister must ensure that the board is represented adequately and that its members have background knowledge of the practical food production industry. I am not suggesting that the board should be stuffed full of farmers, but it should include those who know something about primary food production, food processing and the restaurant trade.
<P>
The Minister has enough experience to know that there is not one person in the country who can represent even a fraction of the restaurant trade. As soon as a member was appointed who represented the classier restaurants, the huge and ever-growing British sandwich industry would complain. If someone was found who could satisfy that industry, cafe owners would complain that their interests were not represented, as would the hoteliers. But there must be someone, somewhere, who can deal with the hospitality side on the board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 9, which I will move formally at the appropriate moment. It expresses our grave concern that the Bill excludes from membership of the agency people with knowledge of production, be they farmers or food manufacturers. I cannot help but refer again to the advertisement, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Specialist expertise in areas such as biochemistry, epidemiology or risk assessment would be valuable to the Board, as would experience in areas such as consumer affairs, food transport and preparation or public communication.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may say that food preparation covers what the amendment would include in respect of food production. I contend that it does not, particularly given that the advertisement goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Integrity and freedom from conflicts of interest will be essential.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall return to interests when we discuss the next group of amendments. Nevertheless, that wording seriously undermines any assertion that someone with knowledge of primary production or the manufacturing side of production would be excluded from the board. I shall use myself as an example. Obviously, I am excluded from the board by my membership of this House, but the fact that my little piece of land produces about £2,000 worth of grain each year could be seen as a conflict of interest. Thus, people in similar situations may feel that they cannot apply.
<P>
Whatever the Minister may say is meant by the words in the advertisement, if it is not the meaning that others attribute to it the problem will arise that the Government have discouraged people who have a knowledge of production from applying. That is not a vague concept that has been whipped up by the Opposition to use as the basis of an amendment. It is essential that all sectors of the food industry are represented on the board from, as has been said, plough to plate, farm to table or, as someone from the livestock sector said to me yesterday, from conception to consumption.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> It could be the other way round.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Fair enough.
<P>
The Bill will not ensure that the board of the agency includes people with an adequate range of knowledge and experience. Producers should be represented, including those in primary production. The advice that goes into board meetings and that which the agency sends out should be fully representative and of good quality. Overall, the total membership of the agency should cover the principal parts of the food industry, not merely those mentioned in the advertisement.
<P>
I want to substantiate that point by referring to two organisations at different ends of the food industry spectrum. One is the Food and Drink Federation, which said that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would support amendment of the Bill which would explicitly acknowledge the importance of including, within the Agency, experience of food manufacturing operations and procedures.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>FDF is concerned to ensure that appointees to these extremely important and influential positions have the widest range of backgrounds and experience. Whilst the Agency and its staff should be and be perceived as `independent', experience of the food and drink manufacturing industry and the way in which it operates is vital.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Its document continues by referring to conflicts of interest, which we will debate later.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other equally important organisation that I shall refer to is the Soil Association, which said to the Government that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as a direct consequence of the structure of the Agency excluding those with an agricultural interest and excluding the agency from any significant role in the development of broader agricultural policy, those involved with the Agency will be either unqualified or unable to correct . . . deficiencies''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those two very different organisations are concerned about the constitution of the agency's board as described in the clause. That is why we feel strongly that we simply need to insert the word ``production'', as we propose in amendment No. 9, to make it clear that the FSA will not exclude people with such experience and knowledge from membership of the agency. That will ensure that such expertise contributes to the agency's advice and the measures that it may enact, so that it can achieve the credibility with the food industry that it must have.
<P>
If the board contained no one with any experience of producing food, there would be a serious credibility problem. It would be easy for both primary production and food manufacturing parts of the food production sector to lack respect for and be dismissive of the agency. We do not want that. The agency should be credible with every sector of the world of food if it is to be effective. That is our guiding light. It is essential that people perceive that their interests are properly covered by the way in which the agency is constituted. That is why we tabled amendment No. 9.
<P>
I look forward to the Minister's response. I do not think that he can hide behind the words in the clause, as the impression that they give to the outside world does not answer my concern. Both the Bill as drafted and the advertisement clearly give the impression that production will not be included in the agency's membership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to add one or two points to reinforce what my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said. In our first sitting, I said that the two real tests of whether the FSA was successful would be whether it developed a world-renowned reputation for excellence, and whether it had the complete confidence of the public. The composition of its board will largely contribute to its success. The Minister therefore has to tell us carefully what that composition will be.
<P>
I refer to amendment No. 100, which was tabled by my right hon. Friend. The Minister must assure us that every sector of the food industry will be represented. Many people will follow our debates, either directly or in Hansard, and they will look carefully at what the Minister has to say. We should avoid having too many people from pressure groups; although they have a wide and excellent role to play, they tend to be blinkered and not open-minded. We want people on the board of the FSA who have professional experience, who are prepared to take an objective view and who are prepared to change their mind if scientific evidence shows that it would be wise to do so.
<P>
The BSE inquiry issued complicated scientific evidence, which sometimes seemed to emerge almost daily. The board will eventually have to come up with recommendations as to what should be done in such circumstances. It seems essential to have professional people with scientific knowledge who can understand what will sometimes be extremely complex scientific advice. They will need to be able to make a judgment whether that advice is sensible, whether the research is replicable and whether it can be peer-reviewed. Unless they have a professional background, I doubt that they will be able to do so.
<P>
We are looking to the Minister to state clearly to the industry as a whole that, as my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, every sector is likely to be represented. The composition of the board, of course, will vary from time to time. I hope that the Minister can accept the amendment. If not, he ought at least to say that the five sectors that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border lists in amendment No. 100 will be carefully considered. As a general principle, those sectors should be represented on the board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Special Select Committee, which considered the Bill in the spring, discussed in some depth who should be members of the board. We were emphatically assured by the Minister that the criteria would be laid down by the time of Second Reading. He said that the members would be chosen without fear or favour and that the agency would not be dominated by producers or forceful public interest groups. He said that no one would be excluded from applying and that interests and expertise would be relevant. Nobody would be ruled out because of a beneficial interest. We shall come to interests later. It is expertise that we are discussing now.
<P>
The Government said that the criteria for selection would be made publicly available at the time of the advertisement. We did not learn an awful lot about the criteria on Second Reading, and a lot more could have been revealed in the advertisement. The relevant section of the advertisement states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Specialist expertise in areas such as biochemistry, epidemiology or risk assessment would be valuable ... as would experience in areas such as consumer affairs, food transport and preparation or public communication.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``All members of the Board will need intellectual capacity and collective breadth of experience to tackle issues involving public safety, scientific argument, public concern, media sensitivity, and impact on industry.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on that considerably. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, unless the right balance is struck, the agency will not have the confidence of the industry or of consumers.
<P>
I take issue with some of the public interest groups that gave evidence to the Committee. They came over as being very combative; the Minister said this morning that he did not like that. Those groups saw the industry as being always at loggerheads with the end consumer. They saw industry as always trying to put one over on the consumer. They wanted a strong enforcement agency that would bring the production industry to heel in the interests of the end consumer.
<P>
I do not see it like that. If it is to work properly, the agency must have the confidence of both parties. I see no conflict of interest between the production industry and the end consumer. Of all the industries that one can think of, this is the one in which the consumer must be satisfied. Ultimately the industry needs its consumers to live and to thrive on what it produces. If one buys a bad car, one can walk away. If one gets terminal food poisoning, one does not come back for more. I see absolutely no conflict between the food industry and the consumer. As I said at our first sitting, I would like the agency to distribute information, with food producers being its primary customers for the most up-to-date information.
<P>
I shall cite two foods that were mentioned to the Special Select Committee. On several occasions, considerable hostility was shown to green-top milk by some consumer groups. I have received letters from producers who won international prizes for making cheese using unpasteurised milk, who said that the bacterial count of their unpasteurised milk was lower than that of pasteurised milk. After a horrible food scare in Cumberland, food experts immediately leapt to speak on television to cry out against the dangers of unpasteurised milk. I can find no record of food poisoning caused by unpasteurised milk during the past five years. All the cases of food poisoning that were caused by milk were the result of the pasteurisation process being poorly carried out or of there having been a breakdown in the machinery. My worry is that the board may not include any producers who understand how to handle such materials.
<P>
The other food was raw eggs, which were mentioned also by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. That was another interesting conflict. Many of the public health interest groups were down on the use of raw eggs. Indeed, one said that it should be banned. My right hon. Friend mentioned salmonella. There was a great increase in salmonella food poisoning in the 1980s, but 80 per cent. of such cases were caused by mayonnaise. It emerged in evidence to the Special Select Committee that Mrs. Beeton's mayonnaise traditionally had a high acid content, which used a large amount of vinegar that killed the salmonella. In the huge expansion of sandwich bars in the 1980s, sandwich makers used mayonnaise as a binder to hold together the contents of the sandwiches. There was not a high enough acid content to kill off the salmonella, which resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of salmonella cases.
<P>
I would like the agency to allow the use of raw eggs, but to stress to sandwich makers and to consumers that care is needed. If people want to eat sandwiches with mayonnaise containing raw eggs, they should take the right steps to be sure of being safe. Raw eggs are fine if they are treated carefully. Green-top milk is absolutely fine if it is treated with respect--as it is now. If certain health interest groups had a lock on the agency, and raw eggs and green-top milk were no longer available, a large number of people could be thrown out of work and many consumers would be unhappy because the products would no longer be available.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): I, too, was a member of the Special Select Committee. Can the hon. Gentleman remember how many public interest groups gave evidence? I recollect that only two or three did so. There is absolutely no possibility of the public interest groups forming a majority on the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I cannot remember the number, but I remember that in one evidence session, the Consumers Association was keen to have such a majority on the agency. We need a balance. That is vital. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, if the producers are not well represented, the food industry may well view the agency as the poodle of public health interest groups. That would be disastrous--there would be no co-operation. It is vital that the agency is respected as much by the food industry as by the public and interest groups.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I agree with the point about balance, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although it is important that the FSA is not seen as the poodle of public interest groups, it is also important for consumer confidence that it is not seen as the poodle of the industry? Therefore, the proposals in the Bill represent the proper balance.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I think that we agree, which is interesting as we come from opposite poles. I hope that we can agree that the agency should distribute information to the food industry and to consumers. The food industry should be the first port of call for that information. Therefore, it is vital that the industry is well represented, but neither the industry nor consumers should be dominant. It will be extremely difficult for the selection committee to achieve the right balance. The agency must not be seen as the poodle of public interest groups or it will not have the industry's confidence or receive its co-operation. That is the real danger.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> This has been an extremely important debate. I take very seriously the points that Opposition Members have been made in probing our thinking about the nature and experience of those who will be chosen to be members of the board. I hope that I can reassure Opposition Members that they need not be concerned.
<P>
The White Paper clearly states that the purpose of establishing the FSA is to improve food safety and restore public confidence in the nation's food. The White Paper includes the guiding principles that will determine how the agency will operate, one of which is that it should act independently of specific sectoral interests. I make it clear that it would be as bad for the agency to be packed with food faddists pursuing their particular view of nutrition or other aspects of food safety as it would for it to be essentially producer dominated, which would be the result of amendments tabled by the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> That is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The hon. Gentleman may say that it is nonsense, but that is the thrust of the amendments.
<P>
As stated in the White Paper, the FSA must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a body of individuals who have a proven track record in relevant fields who together provide a reasonable balance of relevant skills and experience, and a majority of whom come from a wider public interest background without any specific affiliation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members should consider all the information--not just the advertisement--that will be provided to applicants for the positions of members, chairman or deputy chairman of the board. It might be helpful if I quote a paragraph from the job description, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Examples of areas of experience which may be of value to the board include but are not limited to: agriculture; biology and biochemistry; commerce generally; communications including advertising and media; consumer safety and health; the food industry (including retail, catering, processing, manufacturing and distribution); economics; education; environmental health; epidemiology; ethics; genetics; law; microbiology; nutrition and diet; public health medicine; public policy making; toxicology; veterinary medicine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The sequence of events presents a problem. Individuals will see the advertisement and may be deterred from applying; that applies especially to those with a food manufacturing background. One does not receive a job description unless one applies for details after reading the advertisement.
<P>
Therefore the Government are proposing a problematic process. As Members of Parliament, we cannot apply for the job. We are aware of the advertisement, but not the job description.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> As with all job advertisements, the advertisement invites potential applicants to request further details, which are provided in an information pack.
<P>
I am happy to send Committee members a copy of the information pack. That may well help and reassure those who have concerns. We have been at pains to address such concerns in developing the materials that will be sent to potential candidates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> During the BSE incident, a problem arose in relation to members of various committees expressing individual views to the media. When the FSA is set up, will committee members collective responsibility? Will the Minister confirm that the FSA will have a single media policy?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> Yes, I can confirm that. Should that not be the case, a shambles would be likely to result, as the hon. Gentleman suggests. The hon. Gentleman may wish to pass that lesson on to the media managers in his party; it is a hard lesson that we have learned over many years.
<P>
I trust that I have made clear how we intend to seek the range of expertise that will be available through membership of the board. The agency will also be able to draw on the expertise of its advisory committees, which contain specialists and non-specialists. The Bill makes provision for the agency to consult widely with those--including the industry--who will be affected by advice that it may give.
<P>
We do not intend to limit the agency in relation to the skills on which it can draw. The agency will fail if it is perceived as a body that pursues a certain sectional interest. We have tackled that by using those representing consumer interests in the definition of public interests. The food industry has as much concern about promoting consumer interests as those pressure groups mentioned by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, which advocate distinct views on certain issues.
<P>
We paid great attention to that when we drafted the White Paper, considered the Bill and judged our response to the Select Committee. The test of success for the agency will be, to a great extent, how far it is seen as broadly representative and authoritative. It will fail, if it is seen as doctrinaire or ideological. We are determined that that should not happen.
<P>
As salmonella has been mentioned, I wish in fairness to place on record the fact that there has not been a substantial reduction in the salmonella contamination of eggs. The Public Health Laboratory Service study in 1991 indicated that about 1 in 600 eggs were contaminated with salmonella, while a Department of Health survey in 1995 showed that the rate of salmonella contamination in eggs was still about 1 in 600. Obviously, the Government and the previous Government have sought to provide protective advice to consumers on how to avoid or minimise the risk of salmonella, but as in so many other areas that will be for the agency to consider, it is not the agency's job to tell people what to eat. It is the agency's job to ensure that people are aware of the risks that they take by, for example, eating raw eggs--which in the opinion of the chief medical officer certainly carries an increased risk of contracting salmonella.
<P>
Having listened carefully to Opposition Members, I am content that the reasonable concerns that they raised have been taken account of and met in the drafting of the Bill and the White Paper; the appointments procedure, in particular, is addressed in the information available for candidates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It may seem somewhat ungallant, but I do not think that the Minister has addressed the point that we raised. She began by saying that we wanted the board to be packed with people from the production industry. That is arrant nonsense. I remind her that we are proposing to add ``production'' to the interests listed in paragraph (c):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``including experience in matters related to food safety or other interests of consumers in relation to food''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not stipulating numbers, packing--or any other absurd interpretation that the Minister has put on our amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the lead amendment, amendment No. 100, which would prescribe nine members from a range of interests specifically concerned with food production.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> That is fair enough, but I am speaking to my amendment, amendment No. 9. In the light of her remark, perhaps the Minister would be generous enough to accept our amendment, which seeks simply to include in the Bill the fact that production is one of the areas of expertise that will be sought in compiling the membership of the board. I hope that she will give that some thought.
<P>
It is all very well for the Minister to say that the advertisement states that more information is available on request; I know from my former experience of running a company that was heavily involved in recruitment that that is not sufficient. The ideal advertisement for a job has one applicant--the right person. That is ridiculously idealistic, but recruitment advertisements should be drafted in such a way that people self-select and those who do not have the relevant experience, expertise or qualifications discount themselves. By not mentioning food production, but mentioning the necessity to be free from conflicts of interest, the advertisement ensures that people will select themselves out of contention for the application. They will not request the information that the Minister has generously undertaken to supply to the Committee and which, she say,  will ensure that our concerns are met. The advertisement will encourage people not to apply for membership if they have the interests that we want to be represented on the board. Before doing anything irretrievable, I hope that the hon. Lady will agree that amendment No. 9 is valid; it would not pack the committee and I hope that she will accept it.

<P>

<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The amendment is unnecessary. I have already made it clear that those with experience of food production can be appointed to the agency, either because of their experience in food safety that goes alongside production or because production is another aspect of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``interests of consumers in relation to food''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Specifying production will add nothing to the Bill. We cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister is just accepting the decision of those in authority above her without reflecting on what we are seeking to do. To suggest that the amendment is unnecessary is clearly misrepresenting what we want to achieve. I give notice that I want to move the amendment formally.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In the absence of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) who has notified those on the Government Front Bench and myself that, as the House of Commons successor to the Viscount Whitelaw, he is, understandably, otherwise engaged this morning, there is no course other than to put to the Committee the Question on the amendment, which was moved in the right hon. Gentleman's name.
