<P>
<H5>10.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. It will be in the knowledge of the Committee that, on Friday, the Government tabled a replacement to schedule 13. That new schedule it was accompanied by explanatory notes, which were of some help in elucidating it reached me this morning. The new schedule runs to 18 pages, and it replaces a schedule of six pages. I do not seek to crow about it, but it represents a substantial development of the Government's thinking in response to some of the points made by the Opposition. 
<P>
It may be a cause for some pleasure that we can feel relaxed about that, but it is regrettable that the Committee should be served with such a major change at comparatively short notice. it amounts to a young Bill, and the other place may wish to address themselves to it once we have finished with the Bill. It contains strange references; for example, in new paragraph 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order the hon. Gentleman has probably made his point of order. I ask him not to go too far along that line. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful for that advice, Mr. Atkinson. The new schedule is a substantial chunk of legislation. We will do our best indeed, in the time available, have already done our best to examine it. We may wish to debate it in more detail on Thursday. However, even if it represents better second thoughts, it is regrettable that it should have been served up at this late hour. I hope that the Government will take note of that, and that we can get on with discussing the restyled, remodelled and updated Bill this morning. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order for the Chair. However, I have no doubt that the Under-Secretary has heard what he said. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood (Wokingham):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Will you or your co-chairman, Mr. Maxton, make time available to debate the new principles incorporated in that fundamental revision of the Bill? The new compilation incorporates much of the existing Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which we were previously told would be repealed, and it changes the Bill's approach to concurrent powers for the Director General of Fair Trading and the regulators. That change is germane to the argument about whether one can base the whole of British law on European law. The Government seem now to have concluded with us that one cannot. Shall we have the opportunity to debate those fundamental issues? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The principles of the schedule will be debated when the schedule itself is debated. 
<P>
Clause 26 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 27 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Powers when conducting investigations </center></H4>
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 13, line 38, after `document', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or to provide him with specified information,'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 165, 31 to 35, 39 and 100 to 104. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The amendments are necessary. They fill a gap in the investigation provisions of the Bill. Although "document" is widely defined in clause 59 to include 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"information recorded in any form" , <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
it will, in some circumstances, be essential for the director general to require the production of information that is not in such a form, but which has been compiled for the purpose. The amendments help to ensure that such information is made available, regardless of the form in which it is recorded. It is important to allow the director general to request information that may not have been compiled systematically by an undertaking in recorded from but may be compiled using the knowledge or experience of an undertaking's sales manager. The amendments will enable the director general to obtain such information, which might otherwise be denied to him. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Before the Under-Secretary concludes his remarks, will he explain why junior officials of the competition authority will now be allowed to issue such instructions? Is it not important that the director general himself should have personally vetted and countersigned every application for such information? That would give us some assurance that the request had been properly considered at a senior level. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No. It would be wholly unreasonable to suggest that the director general, who may, for example, be on holiday, or be sick, must personally vet such requests when the requests may not be serious but may be germane to the investigation of the director general and his officers. Of course the director general must be accountable for all actions taken by his staff, including junior staff. 
<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee, and hope that I have satisfied the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). They will assist the director general and will not harm businesses. Rather, they will give them the appropriate chance to ensure that information requested is made available and that every assistance is given to the director general and his staff in providing information in the conduct of the inquiry and in bringing it to a conclusion satisfactory to all parties. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We should not allow the amendment to go through on the nod without a little more investigation. I should like the Under-Secretary to respond to one line of thought that I wish to deploy and to elucidate something that he said. The line of thought is in connection with the documents and other material to be made available. I am not sure whether that might include, for example, computer discs and so forth and, if so, whether they will be copied, or downloaded, onto the director general's information. In the shape of an electronic record, they are useless for scrutiny by anyone unless they are transmitted in a form in which they can be used. That may relate not only to the transfer of documents but to the transfer of, for example, passwords, signatures or encryption data that enable such material to be read. 
<P>
There is a difficulty with that, which I am sure the Under-Secretary will appreciate. I am sure that the director general will want to operate with good will and reasonably. I concede that the Under-Secretary will want him to do so indeed, we will all want him to do so. However, it will not necessarily be seen like that by the parties involved. They will see it as an intrusion a fishing expedition. They may do so for two reasons because they are not entirely guiltless in their own minds, and may want to protect themselves, or because they regard themselves as above blame, and as merely being intruded on by persons looking for matters that are none of their business. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> Is my hon. Friend as worried as I am by the rather cavalier fashion in which the Under-Secretary dismissed the anxiety expressed a moment ago by my right hon. Friend the shadow President? The Under-Secretary offered no explanation for his Government's change in thinking. My hon. Friend will be aware of what is stated in clause 27, in which reference is made to the need for power conferred in a notice to be "signed by the Director." My hon. Friend will have noticed that, suddenly, the Government think it wholly unreasonable for that signature to be required. In that case, why did their own draftsmen insist on the inclusion of the reference in the first instance? Were they wrong then? Are they wrong now? Do not they know what they think or why? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful, as ever, to my hon. Friend for his perceptive intervention. The point that emerges from the interventions of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) is that Opposition Members are concerned to ensure I hope that Labour Members are, too that the powers are exercised sensibly and proportionately. What may seem reasonable to the Under-Secretary and the director general might be reasonable, but it might not seem so to a business that feels threatened or is under attack. It is important that the Under-Secretary spends more time clarifying the matter and that he does not skate over it. 
<P>
The other point that I want to make is about the information that might be compiled. Obviously we shall study the record, but I thought that the Under-Secretary implied that the documentary evidence that should be produced could be derived material. I am not clear, for example, whether he was implying that an employee would be required to reorder the information available to him perhaps by carrying out a data search and producing a printout, as he might do for his boss, of a particular line of information that was embedded on the database and giving it to the Director General of Fair Trading. I am not sure whether it is reasonable to require an employee to do that, especially as it might be seen as being broadly self-incriminating. In principle, the director general should do his own work. 
<P>
Perhaps I have misunderstood the Under-Secretary, but the general point is that the clause contains powers of intrusion. There might be good and proper reasons for them, but we are saying that they should be proportionate to their task and they should not be executed unreasonably. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I am pleased to respond to the hon. Gentleman. Computer records will count under the clause and rightly so, because so many records are kept on computer. Indeed, those records often reflect the paper evidence. For example, if a firm has many invoices on paper in a competition matter, that might be very germane and a summary is held on computer, both sets of records should be available. 
<P>
I am pleased to say that the amendments will allow the director general to require information to be compiled in a form that might be useful to the investigation when it is not held in that specific, end-product form. For example, information on market shares might be sought, but a company might not compile it systematically in recorded form. However, the knowledge and expertise of the company's sales manager might allow that information to be collected. The amendments will enable the director general to obtain that information, which might otherwise be denied to him.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clarifying that point. However, does he realise that the consequence of what he has said is that, in the pursuit of an investigation, the company or its employees will be required to do additional work, not normally done in carrying out their business, to satisfy the director general's requirements. For the purposes of debate, I concede that that might be necessary, but will the company be compensated under the Bill if it has done extra work at the request of the director general and, at the end of the investigation, is found to be blameless? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The compensation that the company can take comes from the fact that it is facilitating the investigation and bringing it to an early conclusion. It might be in a company's interest to ensure that the information requested by the director general is provided in a different form one that is mutually informative to the two parties. That might cause the director general to reach an early conclusion perhaps even one favourable to the company. Obviously, each case must be considered separately. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point was about fishing trips I think that was the phrase that he used. No, the Bill does not allow for fishing trips. As this morning's and, perhaps, this afternoon's debate will show, this clause and subsequent clauses contain clear instructions that will preclude the director general or his staff from engaging in fishing trips when there are no grounds for suspicion of any anti-competitive behaviour or breaches of the two prohibitions. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell: I am not sure that the Under-Secretary has entirely satisfied me on the matter. We are in the position of someone who has been blindfolded, put in a room and invited to make a full confession to help the police with their inquiries on the grounds that it may be better for him in the long run. There are real concerns, on which we should pause, about the work that business may be required to do under threat of investigation in order to discharge the director general's requests. </B><P>
<P>
I understand what the Under-Secretary is saying, and I am not inclined to invite my hon. Friends to resist the amendment, but it will put great responsibility on the director general to act in a reasonable manner and to target his requests to the precise information required, which can be obtained at the minimum extra cost and work to the company involved. I do not oppose the amendment, because the information may be necessary in some cases, but we must ensure that the director general understands that he does not have carte blanche intrusively to make companies perform activities at their own expense to satisfy his requirements. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division. If he did so, it would embarrass him, as the director general has had equivalent powers under section 3(7) of the Competition Act 1980, which states that the director 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may... require any person carrying on business to furnish to the Director such estimates or returns or other information as may be specified... and specify... the manner and form in which such estimates, returns or information are to be furnished." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
So there is precedent, and we are merely copying what has proved to be of worth in the Competition Act. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give me documentary evidence or information about the number of cases in which such applications have been the subject of resistance by the companies involved, or in which they have attempted to avoid their obligations under that Act? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I have the figure for the estimated number of cases under the Bill, which is 300; the public will want to be aware of that. The utilities statutes, such as the Telecommunications Act 1984, also contain general information-gathering powers in various forms. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that, in accordance with the general requirement of reasonable behaviour, an investigating officer would never take a document from a company without first having satisfied himself that the company had copies of and would therefore be able in any proceedings to refer to that document? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I can certainly assure the hon. Gentleman that no investigating officer would take company records away in an unreasonable manner. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> I must remind the Under-Secretary of a recent case although I acknowledge that it occurred under a Conservative Administration rather than under his in which I was subjected for two or three weeks to requests from a company that documents that had been removed be sent back because it did not have any copies of them. The Under-Secretary may regard that as "reasonable" , to use his word; my constituents did not. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to 300 cases; he did not make it clear whether that was an annual or a cumulative figure. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is estimated that there will be 300 instances a year when the production of business documents is required.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) Before exercising the power conferred by subsection (6)(a) above, the Director shall afford the undertaking under investigation a reasonable opportunity to comment as to the role of the employee or officer in the matter under investigation and as to the appropriateness of requiring such persons to provide an explanation of the document.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 190, in clause 66, page 36, line 45, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) In exercising the powers conferred in subsection (5)(a)(ii) above, the Director shall consult the person notified as to the role of the employee or officer in the matter under investigation and as to the appropriateness of requiring such employee or officer to provide an explanation of the document.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The amendment gives us the opportunity to take the arguments a little further, bearing in mind the comments made in the debate on the previous group of Government amendments. <P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
As the Bill stands, clause 27 gives the Director General of Fair Trading the power to require the production of documents that he considers to be relevant to the investigation. Subsection (6)(a)(ii) gives him the power to require persons, including former employees, to provide an explanation of such documents. 
<P>
We agree that the director general needs strong investigatory powers to ensure that competition policy works effectively; it is often pointed out that these powers give the Competition Act the necessary teeth. We are not arguing about that, but the amendments would ensure that the director general could make a judgment with the benefit of the full facts. We intend not to influence the director general but to ensure that the company has the opportunity to comment on the role of the employee before he reaches his decision. If such information is not made available before the director general's decision, a company may find itself wrongly accused of breaching a prohibition and seek to appeal. 
<P>
The rules for compensating a company are not spelt out in the clause, but I believe that under schedule 8, which we shall discuss later, the rules on costs and expenses from the appeals tribunal will be laid down after the Bill has been passed. We understand from advice received from the Department of Trade and Industry that there is scope for judicial review and that, in a case of maladministration, companies may be entitled to compensation. But, it is stated that when the director general and the appeals tribunal have performed their duties properly, compensation will not be an issue. In that case, it is important to amend the clause so that there is no confusion about whether the director general has performed his duties properly. 
<P>
The Bill does not make it clear whether the director general need have regard to the position of the employee or whether conflict between the company and an individual has arisen. That is important, in view of the fact that ex-employees are also covered by the Bill. The framework for competition policy is set out to target the behaviour of companies not individuals. We believe that it is inappropriate to confer unlimited powers to question individuals who have left the employment of a company under investigation. While it is important to recognise the need to confer strong investigative powers on the director general, it is necessary to have a sensible framework that balances civil rights and ensures that companies do not avoid scrutiny because of small technicalities. 
<P>
Members of the Committee will recall that during a debate in the other place it was argued that the director general should decide whether the person from whom he seeks information is a suitable person to give that information. Rather than weakening the director general's ability to carry out an investigation by giving companies an opportunity to influence the proceedings, the amendment would allow him to review the situation from both sides. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I find myself in considerable sympathy with the amendment, which has been well argued by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey), so I shall not repeat his arguments. 
<P>
I have noted over the years that when the words "judicial review" are mentioned, Government lawyers tend to sharpen their pencils immediately. I am alert to this, not through my own capacities, but because a member of my family is something of a judicial review buff. I hope that the Under-Secretary has read "Judge Over Your Shoulder" , which is available to all Ministers and officials, and that he is thoroughly conversant with the Wednesbury rules on reasonability. We shall not go into them here, but it is clearly important that the procedure should be sensibly followed. The information requested by the director general should be sensible or reasonable and scoped, in that it should be requested from the appropriate person. That is the specific point of the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. 
<P>
Another matter troubles me slightly. The clause applies to past employees. The best people to provide an account of a company's business practice and to say whether there was anti-competitive action may be past employees. However, I am concerned about the relationship between the company and its previous employees. Unless former employees are constrained by the terms of their previous contracts of employment, they are no longer under the control and instruction of the company when they cease to be employees.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Many employees sign contracts that limit their ability to continue their work with another employer because of professional secrecy, commercial confidentiality or an advantage that they may have gained while with their previous employer. A contract of employment that precludes a former employee giving information to a subsequent employer may be overturned under clause 27. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman adds another lane to the channel that I was beginning to explore. There is a problem in a company telling a former employee what to do because, unless there is an explicit term in his contract, he may say, "I don't wish to tell you anything." If a former employee declines to give information, it will make it more difficult for the director general, but it should not be seen ipso facto as a black mark for the company, which has no control over its former employee, unless it is shown that the company has deliberately suborned the individual not to provide that information. 
<P>
The point made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh needs clarification. A former employee may be under contract terms not to divulge information presumably he is not meant to transmit that information through his new employer, but directly to the director general. The nature of the confidentiality agreements that an employee has undertaken need examination to ensure that none of them the employee, his former company or his existing employer is at risk. 
<P>
Those are important matters and, to some extent, deep waters, so I hope that the Under-Secretary can point his searchlight into the depths. We should also remember perhaps we have not made enough of this that there will be cases when a former employee is disaffected with a company. He may have gone to another company for twice the salary, or he may have fallen out over personal matters. When a former employee is the presenter, collator, reproducer or reshuffler of information, there must be some mechanism whereby it is understood that such information may not come from an entirely untainted source. 
<P>
It is our job in Committee to spin and manufacture difficulties, but in some cases, those difficulties will be real. Difficulties will be caused for business, and we should think about them now, not when it is too late. 
<P>
<H5>11 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths: The reason why we reject the amendments is clear; they are likely to cause unnecessary delay to investigations. The requirement that the hon. Member for Daventry is seeking to insert to allow the undertaking under investigation to comment on the role of persons in the matter being investigated, and the appropriateness of their supplying an explanation, could involve the undertaking's solicitors making separate representations to damage the credibility of those people and even to intercept or interfere with their evidence. </B><P>
<P>
For that reason, amendments Nos. 189 and 190 are likely to frustrate investigation and to act against the interests of employees, especially if they are brave enough to want to give evidence but do not want at that stage to share their knowledge with an undertaking. Of course, the undertaking will know that the director general is acting on information when he reaches a conclusion, and the undertaking will be able to take appropriate action then. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary appreciates that the amendment is proposed in good faith; we want to find any weaknesses in the Bill. He will recognise that in today's business world, intellectual property is easily transportable. One has only to download discs on to a lap-top to have a company's whole package of intellectual information to hand. 
<P>
Is not the Under-Secretary concerned that there may be doubts about the veracity of the information passed to the director general by a disaffected employee? The employee may be able to tamper with information contained in a portable electronic medium. Where is the protection for an employer from an employee who, because of some dispute that he or she may have had with a previous employer, is determined to damage the employer, given the availability of a great quantity of information that can be played with, tampered with and presented in whatever way someone wants? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman goes far beyond amendments Nos. 189 and 190 by suggesting that not only should the undertaking be informed of the interview of the employee or former employee by the director general or his staff, but that any evidence produced by that employee in computerised form should be handed over there and then, so that the undertaking can cross-check that it is genuine. 
<P>
It is up to the director general to ensure that he or his officers are satisfied about the propriety of the investigation in all of its aspects. The amendments do not provide that all evidence produced by any employee whether disaffected or a brave whistleblower should be cross-checked there and then, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not propose that in a future amendment. The hon. Gentleman strengthens my conviction that, having considered the amendment fairly, we should reject it I recognise the spirit in which he moved it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Will the Under-Secretary consider a possible case? The director general may have reason to believe that a former junior secretary who no longer works for a firm may have typed a few letters at home on her home computer. He gives the necessary authority, and, two days after notice has been given, people turn up at the lady's home. The lady is working; her teenage son is at the computer doing his homework; the door is jemmied open and the teenage son is told to rifle his mother's computer to produce the documents. Does the Under-Secretary think that that would be reasonable? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am surprised at the right hon. Gentleman's gall in asking that question. Those powers were available to him under the Companies Act 1989 when he was Under-Secretary of State for Corporate Affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry. The facts are plain. The scenario that the right hon. Gentleman speaks of was created under at least four pieces of legislation, which the previous Government were quite willing to operate. The right hon. Gentleman is free to take up the Committee's time with ludicrous examples, but he should also remember that, as a Minister, he was quite happy to deploy the powers of such Acts. I do not remember his giving such ludicrous examples then as he is giving now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Under-Secretary is banging on about ludicrous examples, but they are nothing of the sort. If the Under-Secretary had studied amendment No. 189, he could not credibly say that it does not give a company the opportunity to comment on an employee's, evidence. The amendment manifestly allows it. It states that an undertaking under investigation should have 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable opportunity to comment as to the role of the employee" . 
<P>
Although the Under-Secretary is justified in referring to whistleblowers we would all applaud some instances of such behaviour he should not over-egg the pudding, trying to encourage us to play our violins in a demonstration of sympathy for those brave souls. Such people are sometimes motivated by ill intent, and, under the principles of English justice, the company should have the opportunity to cross-examine them at an early stage. That is what the hon. Member for Eastleigh wants. It is what we want. It is not unreasonable. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I have rarely known anyone with the capacity of the hon. Member for Buckingham for getting hold of the wrong end of the stick. 
<P>
Our worry about amendment No. 189 is that it would create delays; it would not do as the hon. Gentleman suggests. The requirement to allow an undertaking under investigation to comment could generate unacceptable delays and result in the intimidation of employees or at least in approaches being made to them. Further protection is given to such an undertaking if there are doubts: it can appeal to the tribunal if it believes that the decision against it was based on false evidence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Under-Secretary's latest clarification is helpful, though not surprising. I am no expert on the provisions of the Data Protection Bill, but I wonder whether its provision allowing individuals to make applications to the register to have the record corrected if they believe that it is materially false is analogous to the giving of false evidence. Will note be taken of how the evidence of former employees was furnished, and whether it was properly acquired by the employee in the course of his duties or hacked out of a computer and downloaded on to his home line? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That reminds me of the sketch in "The Two Ronnies" , where a person answers the question before it is asked. I made it clear that there is a safeguard. Seconds before giving way to the hon. Gentleman, I said that a decision can be appealed to the tribunal if it is based on false evidence. The example was given of a computer record that had been falsified by an employee. If the company believes that the evidence is false, it has due grounds for appealing to the tribunal. I had hoped that all hon. Members would welcome that built-in safeguard. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Under-Secretary has taken us a little further. His main objection to the amendment seems to be that it would introduce delay. I question that philosophy. In my experience, good law is not necessarily quick law quick and summary justice is the expression that comes to mind. I am therefore not convinced by that argument. 
<P>
The second issue that the Under-Secretary raises is that there is an appeal process. However, I am worried that when a company has been unjustly fingered if that is the correct expression in the vernacular by a malcontent that the cost and delay of the appeal process would fall on the company. I am still less than satisfied by the Under-Secretary's response to those two points. Although he has talked about his anxiety to avoid delay, we have not received guidance on how quick the process will be.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but is he making an intervention or winding up the debate? I should be grateful if he were brief. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I promise that I shall be brief when the Under-Secretary has responded to my comments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Giffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that good law is not necessarily quick law. However, with the Bill, we are trying to replace bad law that is also slow law. The investigative powers that we are giving the Director General of Fair Trading are far more effective because they ensure that there is a direct line of communication to those parties that may be involved in any of the practices that are prohibited under chapters I and II. The reason for that, and for our anxiety about it, is to ensure that we examine how other laws have operated, in start contrast to and more effectively than the investigative powers of the present Restrictive Trade Practices Act. 
<P>
The delay that the amendments might cause to an investigation would be unnecessary. Amendments Nos. 189 and 190 do not confer any real protection on the employer or on the former employee, but provide the undertaking with yet another mechanism for prolonging proceedings. I am sorry to say that we have decades of experience of the delays that can result. In the Bill, we are determined to ensure that they do not occur. We are therefore unwilling to accept the amendment, and I shall urge my hon. Friends to reject it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I run the risk of appearing pedantic, but the Under-Secretary has just said that the provisions in the Bill are more effective. I suspect that they might be more effective or will be more effective, but until they have been tested I am not sure that he can say that they are more effective. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> As promised, I shall now be brief. I am afraid that, try as he might, the Under-Secretary has not been able to convince me. I am still unsure of the answer and shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
</FONT><H5>11.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I should like to ask the Under-Secretary a couple of questions on the same part of the clause subsection (6)(a)(ii) that we debated earlier, but with a different purpose. The subsection states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any person who is a present or past officer of his" <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
referring to the person involved in the undertaking 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or is or was at any time employed by him, to provide an explanation of the document" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
My question is twofold; it relates to the interaction between that power and European Court of Justice rules and to the interaction between the power and the European convention on human rights. 
<P>
It is slightly odd that the Government should propose such a power, given that the objective is to be completely consistent with EU legislation. I understand that the power runs wider than the equivalent power of the Commission, as interpreted by the ECJ. I am sure that the Under-Secretary is more familiar than I am with the case of Orkem v. the Commission, in 1989. The decision in that case is summarised as: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commission may not compel an undertaking to provide it with answers which might involve an admission on its part of an infringement which it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is, essentially, a question of self-incrimination. 
<P>
Is the Government's intention that the subsection should be interpreted wholly in accordance with that rule, as laid down by the ECJ, by virtue of clause 60; or will they table an amendment to make that clear? 
<P>
My second question also relates to self-incrimination. I understand that the Government are incorporating the European convention on human rights into United Kingdom legislation. Article 6.1 provides a right not to incriminate oneself, but the clause seems to contain no such protection. In the absence of any such explicit protection, will the Under-Secretary explain the interaction that he envisages between the clause and article 6.1 of the European convention if it comes into law? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I can certainly tell the Committee that there will be the same defence against self-incrimination as exists under European jurisprudence. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) quoted the decision in the case involving Orkem, which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commission may not compel an undertaking to provide it with answers which might involve an admission on its part of an infringement which it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Bill does not conflict with the European convention on human rights. The Bill contains proper safeguards. The exercise of powers under the Bill will, of course, be subject to the European convention on human rights. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> If it is intended that subsection (6) should be interpreted consistently with EU powers, why did not the Government write into the subsection a requirement for an explanation directly relevant to the document rather than to any explanation that might arise from the document? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> We are clear that the current defences against self-incrimination are widely known certainly, anyone seeking legal advice will be told about them. It is not our purpose to duplicate them in the Bill. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 28 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to enter premises without a warrant </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 15, line 6, after `state', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, to the best of his knowledge and belief,'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B> The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 37. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The amendments correct the discrepancy between clause 27, which provides that a person be required to state the whereabouts of a document <P>
 
<P>
"to the best of his knowledge and belief" , <P>
 
<P>
and clauses 28 and 29, which deal with the power to enter premises, with or without a warrant and which require a person to state the location of a document. There is no reason for that discrepancy and it is right to include the qualification in clause 27, because if a person has a belief rather than knowledge about the whereabouts of a document, he or she must give that information. I urge the Committee to support the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 15, line 13, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) In the case of any entry into premises under this section, the investigating officer shall 
<P>
(a) afford the occupier of the premises a reasonable opportunity to inform his relevant legal adviser, and 
<P>
(b) afford such legal adviser a reasonable opportunity to attend the premises to assist the occupier in complying with the investigation.'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 126, in page 16, line 20, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) In the case of any entry into premises with this section the investigating officer shall 
<P>
(a) afford the occupier of the premises a reasonable opportunity to inform his relevant legal adviser, and 
<P>
(b) afford such legal adviser a reasonable opportunity to attend the premises to assist the occupier in complying with the investigation.'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Opposition are worried about the extent of the powers of entry that clause 28 gives the officer of the director and that clause 29 gives the director or his agents. Our amendments seek to give modest protection to those who may receive such visitations. The power to enter premises without a warrant is perhaps the most worrying, because there will be no court proceedings, whereby an independent-minded member of the judiciary could determine whether there was a reasonable case for forcible entry. Without having satisfied a judge, an officer, on behalf of the director, may force an entry and, under subsection (5)(a) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"take with him such equipment as appears to him to be necessary" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The mind boggles at what that might be, in the case of a locked or bolted door; perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us whether he has in mind jemmies, chainsaws, levers and crowbars. The officer can also request or demand documents and take extracts from them. The powers under clause 29 for judicial approval of an action are only a little more draconian; the provision is phrased slightly differently in regard to the holding of documents and the entering of premises and it is made even clearer that premises can be entered by force where necessary. 
<P>
The Opposition have on several occasions, in debates in the House and elsewhere, expressed our worries that the powers may go too far. Legal checks are necessary before such strong powers should be used. I remain uneasy that, as a result of a previous discussion and decision in Committee, any junior member of staff may start such a process. I found the Under Secretary's justification that the director general might be on holiday or ill extraordinary; someone charged with such heavy duties is always allowed an alternate in such circumstances, and that would be implied by the term "director general" or "director" . The Under-Secretary must have thought that reasonable when the legislation was first drafted, because that draft which we support did not extend the power to sign authorisations to anyone other than the director. 
<P>
Under the clause, a junior official could initiate proceedings, subject to rules that the director general may impose in his own office, use strong powers to enter premises without a warrant and request or demand information. The premises are not restricted to business premises, and we are particularly worried about the director general or his staff deciding to force an entry at a private home. We are particularly worried about junior members of staff, rather than directors or senior executives, making such an entry and even more worried about the possibility of powers being used against former junior members of staff whose association with the company may long since have ceased. 
<P>
When I asked the Under-Secretary a simple question about the possible use of the powers against, for example, a home computer of a former temporary typist who would be somewhat surprised by such a visitation he had two defences. The first was that it was a ludicrous example. It is not; a director general or his staff could genuinely believe that there was, in the home computer of someone who had once worked as a junior secretary for a senior staff member, a piece of evidence that had been destroyed or had never registered in the company's mainframe system. There would be little protection for that former employee if the competition authorities decided to go about their business of getting that information. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary's second defence was that I, as Minister for Corporate Affairs, or previously as an Under-Secretary in that function, had accepted such a regime under the Companies Act 1989. When that Act was drafted in 1987 and 1988, home computers were rare, if they existed at all. We did not have the current situation, where it is common practice for people to have home computers and flexible working arrangements that allow them to do work at home, transmit it via e-mail or the internet to their business and retain that work in their computer. I accept the implied criticism that we did not foresee such an eventuality when my predecessor approved the drafting of that legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Did the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues foresee it when they drafted the Financial Services Act 1986? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I cannot answer for my colleagues who dealt with the detail of that legislation; I can speak only for legislation with which I was familiar. However, there are distinct differences between the Bill and the Companies Act 1989. There are fewer potential investigations or problems under the Companies Act than under the Bill. The Companies Act is used only against delinquent or potentially delinquent companies that commit extremely serious offences. The Bill includes all sorts of fishing expedition inquiries into possible anti-competitive agreements and practices which fall well short of the scandals, frauds and rackets that the Companies Act was designed to tackle and investigate. 
<P>
On both counts, therefore, the Under-Secretary's defence of the Bill's powers is mistaken. I repeat that the issue is not whether the Conservative legislation was perfect; the electorate has passed its judgment on the previous Government and we are now considering Labour legislation. The Government have the opportunity to get things right, according to their lights, and it is the duty of the Under-Secretary to answer for his legislation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The question is not whether previous legislation is perfect, but whether the sort of barely credible scaremongering abuses that the right hon. Gentleman conjures up occurred under similar legislative powers that have been operating for some years. As there is no evidence of that, it seems wise to model our legislation on the investigative powers that are already available. However, if the right hon. Gentleman wants to cite a list of examples in which clear abuses have been exposed to the public gaze, he should do so. The fact is that there is no such legion of cases and that is why the Government are sensible to base the investigative powers that are being given to the Director General of Fair Trading on powers that were recently some more recently than others given to similar investigating authorities in previous legislation. That is more sensible than returning to the woefully inadequate powers of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, which the right hon. Gentleman seems to find perfectly satisfactory 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> As does the Under-Secretary, to an increasing degree. The Government's amendments reincorporate into the Bill large parts of the RTPA. The proposal uses the fanciful phrase that although the RTPA is repealed it will still apply. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow: My right hon. Friend makes a characteristically powerful case. The Under-Secretary doth protest too much. He is either blissfully unaware of or does not care about the growing clamour of public and interest-group opposition to clause 28. It is perceived by a variety of independent-minded bodies to be unnecessarily draconian in character. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That is quite right; my hon. Friend makes another powerful point. 
<P>
I hope that, in his response to the debate, the Under-Secretary might think again about the difficult case that I proposed of the home computer. The advent of the home computer has brought about great changes. It would help if the Under-Secretary were to read into the record the fact that it is not his intention to use those powers against such a person. It would provide guidance for a future director general and it would reassure the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman (South Thanet):</B> The previous Government, of whom the right hon. Gentleman was a member, thought it appropriate to give the electricity companies the power to take an axe to the doors of those who had not paid their bills. Those companies do not do it often; they exercise their responsibility reasonably. I still do not understand why the right hon. Gentleman should believe that the director general and his staff will not interpret the Bill's provisions reasonably, not using the powers when they do not need to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful for that intervention I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us reassurances of the sort that the Hon. Gentleman is trying to suggest. If he did, I would be much happier. I have great respect for the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman). I am sure that one day he will be sitting where the Under-Secretary now sits. His reassurances will then have the full weight of the Government behind them. Until then, however, we need the Under-Secretary to offer that reassurance to former employees and those employees with low-level jobs who might otherwise be afraid that the powers could be used to extremes. 
<P>
The amendment would give reassurance at a slightly different level. It would give companies and senior employees who could afford legal advice the opportunity to take legal advice when either of the strong powers was used to enter premises the clause 28 power to enter premises without a warrant, and the clause 29 power to enter premises with a warrant following a court's decision that it is permissible. 
<P>
It is normal practice in British law that those who have the ability to be legally represented in such situations should be represented. We ask the Under-Secretary to follow normal procedure and confirm in the Bill that that normal human right is to be afforded to senior employees and to companies who wish their legal adviser to be present. I readily accept that junior employees may not want to run the risk or the cost of that, unless another body or organisation can help them. That is why I believe that the Under-Secretary should place a specific reassurance on the record. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my right hon. Friend noticed that clause 30 provides that if entry is made under a warrant and if no one is present and apparently only in those circumstances the occupier may be informed and he may then be given the opportunity to obtain legal advice? It is not clear why that provision cannot be generalised to cover the cases that my right hon. Friend mentioned. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. It is another example of sloppy drafting. We were happy to accept the previous two amendments, because the clauses had been drafted inaccurately and there was some discrepancy between them. My hon. Friend has pointed to another major discrepancy, which helps my case. As the Under-Secretary presumably accepts the drafting of clause 30, why cannot he accept something similar in clauses 28 and 29? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman, who is such a keen student of European affairs, is aware that under European rules and law, and the guidance of the Commission, it is accepted that a solicitor may be called for. It is not accepted that one should have to wait for an unreasonable amount of time for such a person to turn up; nor should the director general's officer leave the premises while waiting for that person to turn up. Given that, is not the amendment redundant? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> No, it certainly is not. As we have explained, and as the Government now accept, there are differences between the British and the European law and jurisdiction. That is why we are spending all this time legislating in the United Kingdom. 
<P>
If all European laws and practices applied and were sufficient unto themselves, we would not need the Bill; we could rely on the treaty and precedents created through the European jurisdiction. It is because we need rules and jurisdiction for intra-state trading to mimic, perhaps, the inter-state trading rules at the European level, in so far as that is possible that we need a body of jurisprudence and practice here in the United Kingdom. 
<P>
It is most important that the Under-Secretary sets the right tone for the exercise of the directorial powers. The hon. Member for South Thanet has done a better job than has the Under-secretary of trying to explain away the inadequate drafting of the Bill, but if he studies our amendments carefully especially amendment No. 125 to clause 28 he will see that they would not cause problems or undue delay. the power under clause 28 requires two working days' notice of intended entry to be given. Our amendment states that the occupier of the premises should have 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable opportunity to inform his relevant legal adviser" . 
<P>
The Under-Secretary could accept our amendment with the proviso that the clock for reasonable time to notify a legal adviser started ticking when due notice of the intention to visit was given. The same two-day period could be used by the occupier to find a legal adviser as will be used by the authorities to give due warning of their visit. I am sure that we could come to a similar arrangement for the timing following a court order, because I am sure that a company would be well aware that a court order was being made. They could then make the necessary legal representations. We have used the phrase "a reasonable opportunity" , but I would be happy if the Under-Secretary were to limit that further in line with my suggested timetable. 
<P>
I do not understand how the Government can deny people such natural justice, especially as they allow them such natural justice if they have sensibly gone out just before the visitation so that they can return with their legal adviser. It is odd that people who are in are not allowed the same protection. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we continue with the debate, I must say that this morning we have been carrying out debate through interventions. It is important that we do not do that, because it gives the debate a poor structure, which makes the record difficult to follow. As many people outside the Committee need to read the record of our affairs, I ask members of the Committee, who can speak as many times as they like, within reason, not to make speeches through interventions, but to keep interventions short. 
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward (Watford):</B> The amendments are unnecessary and, in relation to clause 29, inappropriate. Amendment No. 125 calls for the opportunity to notify a relevant legal adviser of the possibility of an investigating officer entering the premises, but clause 28(2)(a) clearly provides 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at least two working days' notice" <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
of the intention to enter the premises. Any lawyer worth his or her money would certainly be able to arrive in that time.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady will have observed that subsection (3) in effect disapplies the two working days' notice in respect of any investigation concerning parties to an agreement who may have infringed the chapter I or chapter II prohibitions the great majority of cases. 
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I recognise the hon. Gentleman's point, but I still do not believe that it is necessary to give additional time it is not stated how long "a reasonable opportunity" is to advise a legal representative. That is unnecessary when the occupiers of the premises have two working days in which to ensure that they obtain legal advice and representation, if necessary, especially as the subject matter and the purpose of the investigation will be stated in the notice, together with any offences that the director general believes may have taken place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. Lady is sticking to a line of argument that has just been exploded by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. I think that she just conceded the circumstances to which he referred, in which two days' notice would not be available in other words, there would not be an opportunity to secure legal advice. Does she agree that the amendment has merit at least in respect of the circumstances to which my hon. Friend referred? If not, how does she justify her argument that it would be unnecessary in such circumstances? 
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I recognise the hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not necessarily agree that it is necessary to pursue the amendment. In respect of clause 29, it is not only unnecessary but inappropriate. If it is necessary to gain a warrant for entry, the requirement that will need to be satisfied is that the investigating officer will have needed to attempt to enter the premises initially under clause 28, therefore giving the two days' notice required. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Would the hon. Lady therefore say to the Under-Secretary that he should knock out subsection (3)(b) of clause 30, which is more or less the same as our amendments to clauses 28 and 29? 
<P>
<B> Ms Ward:</B> I see no need to knock out subsection (3)(b) of clause 30. Opposition Members have not dealt with my point that it is not appropriate, under clause 29, to give any notice. If the purpose of clause 29 is to gain a warrant, especially to find documents or evidence that may be destroyed if notice is given, understanding that notice will have been given to some extent, because of the requirement under clause 29 (1)(c) to have followed the terms of clause 28, it is not appropriate to give any further notice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Does the hon. Lady not understand that under clause 29, the procedures under clause 28 first have to be exhausted, so of course the company is aware of the procedure? 
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I do understand that indeed, that is why there is no need for further notice to be given for legal representation. The right hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. It is not necessary to accept amendments Nos. 125 and 126 to extend the amount of time required to give legal notice. I am sure that occupiers of premises who believe that they are under investigation and, indeed, have been given notice of that fact, would be able to secure the assistance of their legal representatives within two working days, or, indeed, in a much shorter time if they felt that the offences warranted it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to support the amendments. It is right to take the two amendments together, because they interact with two clauses that should be understood to work together. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) illustrated how easy it would be to lose sight of how the Government propose to proceed on the matter. The insertion of two working days' notice which, if I recall correctly, was done during proceedings in the other place was intended to give some comfort that there was not to be peremptory entry into premises solely on the authorisation of the director general, or, as we now find, his junior officers. In fact, that is substantially disapplied under the clause. On the face of it, the provisions should be straightforward. The director general can authorise entry into premises to obtain documents and evidence. Moreover, under clause 29 (1)(b)(ii), if the director general had reasonable grounds for suspecting that there were such documents, which, if he required to be produced, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would be concealed, removed, tampered with or destroyed" , <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
he will have an alternative way of dealing with the matter. He can go to a High Court judge seeking a warrant, which will do away with the notice period and allow the acting officer to enter the premises directly. That is not to say referring to amendment No. 126 that a reasonable opportunity should not be allowed for a legal adviser to be present. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
What is reasonable in those circumstances might be different from the circumstances in which the director general has no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the documents 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would be concealed, removed, tampered with or destroyed" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
There is a curiosity. There is available the possible structure of a working notice issued by the director general when he does not have grounds for suspecting that the party he is investigating will destroy documents, but when the parties to an investigation are themselves party to the agreement under a chapter I prohibition, or if they are being investigated under a chapter II prohibition, the legislation reverts to the assumption that those who are being investigated will destroy, conceal or remove documentation if they are given adequate notice before entry into their premises. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> I am new to the Committee, but I am learning fast that there are fundamental inconsistencies in what has been said. The hon. Member for Watford failed to recognise that if a provision is applied in one part of the Bill, it should apply in others. The inconsistency can be put down only to sloppiness; it cannot be a deliberate intention. Will my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire give the Government the benefit of the doubt that it is a matter not of malice, but of incompetence? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes. My hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) is learning quickly. If I were being generous, I would say that the Government have been tabling amendments as they have gone along and have allowed inconsistencies to emerge. It is right that we should deal with those inconsistencies in order to achieve more consistent and fairer legislation from the point of view of those who will be investigated. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is agitating, so I shall give way. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, whose generosity of spirit is renowned throughout the House of Commons, but I urge him not to stretch it too far. Does he agree that it is extraordinary that the Government should draft legislation that provides that when the director general suspects that materially relevant documents might be destroyed even though there is no evidence that that is about to happen there should be a power of entry, yet deliberately fails to provide for advance notice to be given, thereby giving the opportunity for legal assistance to be sought. That is an extraordinary way to proceed if one has any respect for the principles of English justice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, it is as ever, my hon. Friend makes a good point. We need to recognise that there are three sets of circumstances under which premises may be entered. First, there is entry into an undertaking that is not itself the subject of an investigation under the two prohibitions. In those circumstances, two days' working notice must be given which, as the hon. Member for Watford said, is perfectly adequate. The inclusion of amendment No. 125, referring to "reasonable opportunity" would not give rise to a substantial change in that respect. 
<P>
Secondly, there are undertakings at the other end of the spectrum that might tamper with, conceal or remove documents. In those circumstances, when the warrant is issued by a judge and immediate entry into the premises takes place, affording a reasonable opportunity under amendment No. 126 would probably not imply lengthy notice. It would simply allow the company time, as the hon. Member for South Thanet said, to obtain a lawyer immediately and urgently when an officer from the OFT enters the premises. 
<P>
We then come to the third set of circumstances and to amendment No. 125, which is important. We are right to press it. It would give those who are being investigated under either prohibition the right to have a reasonable opportunity to have legal advisers present when entry is effected. A reasonable opportunity is not an emergency call to a lawyer who might or might not be available; it is up to two working days' notice. 
<P>
The amendment would not apply when entry is effected by warrant under a judge's sanction, nor when the director general believes that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that documents will be removed, concealed or tampered with. It would apply when there is a reasonable expectation that the party will comply with the director general in securing documents. 
<P>
<B>Ms Jackie Lawrence (Preseli Pembrokeshire):</B> On several occasions I have heard reference to sloppy drafting, but will the hon. Gentleman explain what is "a reasonable opportunity" , giving that the amendment contains no such definition? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On the contrary, and as we have learnt many times, reasonableness is well determined in the courts. It is precisely because there are at least three sets of circumstances that one can understand what the phrase "a reasonable opportunity" might mean. Where two working days' notice is provided for in the clause, that might be a reasonable opportunity. Where a warrant is executed under clause 29, a reasonable opportunity might be a matter of minutes or an hour. The amendment is not intended to allow people an opportunity to tamper with documents if there is reasonable suspicion that they might do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is likely that the courts would ultimately determine what is, or is not, a reasonable opportunity, and that they would be unlikely to construe it differently at least, in their general approach to the words "reasonable opportunity" , as used by the Government in clause 30? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, which concludes the matter satisfactorily. 
<P>
The third group of companies those that are being investigated when there are no reasonable grounds to suppose that they will tamper with, remove or conceal documents should be given a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice and representation, as provided for in amendment No. 125. Therefore, I support the amendment so ably moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> It is striking that several Labour Members have suddenly risen to support the beleaguered Under-Secretary. The hon. Member for Watford has touching faith in the Government, even if it is somewhat misguided. I admired the zeal with which she argued her case and the fact that, in contrast to most Labour Back Benchers, she allowed hon. Members to intervene in her speech. However, the fact that she was wholly unaware that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham had shot her fox was an amusing spectacle. Nevertheless, I congratulate her on proceeding with her case unaware of the damage that had been inflicted on it. 
<P>
The hon. Member for South Thanet is always ready to ride to the Under-Secretary's rescue, and we admire the perspicacity with which he invariably does so. 
<P>
The argument in support of amendment No. 125 has been powerfully made, so it need not be underlined at length. However, it must be emphasised that in supporting the amendment and expressing the concerns that my right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have registered, we are speaking not only for ourselves but for a substantial body of opinion outside the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are circumstances in which it is not appropriate to give notice before gaining entry? In those circumstances, especially if th edirector general believes that any agreement might be infringed or any document might be destroyed, is it not appropriate to enter without notice? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The answer is yes, there may be circumstances in which such entry is appropriate. The significant point is that the hon. Lady has signally failed to identify the circumstances in which such action would be necessary or justified. Given that she devoted her speech to the subject, I had hoped that she would offer us specific scenarios in which such untrammelled power could legitimately and credibly be exercised. She failed to do so. Yes, there could be such circumstances, but I await further and better particulars from the hon. Lady as to what they might be in practice. 
<P>
I do not want to be distracted from the central point. We are arguing on the basis of widespread concern about the scope of the Bill. Even if the Under-Secretary disagrees with the views that we have expressed, I invite him to respect the fact that many people share than and believe that amendments to the Bill are necessary to provide proper checks and balances. He would like to give the impression that it is simply the fevered imagination of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham that causes him to propose the amendments not that there is ever anything fevered about my right hon. Friend's imagination [Interruption.] It is indeed fertile; my right hon. Friend is an imaginative fellow. 
<P>
The truth is that my right hon. Friend expresses widespread specific concern about the clause that has been raised by reputable bodies that, in other circumstances, the Under-Secretary would be only too pleased to be able to invoke in his support. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The CBI. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) says from a sedentary position, the CBI specifically has complained about the powers as drafted. It has said that the powers of investigation are extremely wide and go well beyond those of the European Commission. Even if the breach of the prohibitions is a civil law offence, the powers go well beyond those in many areas of existing UK criminal law. 
<P>
The CBI has well established credentials in the matter. It accepts that the Director General of Fair Trading should be given stronger powers of investigation than he has at present that is a matter for legitimate debate but considers that the powers necessary to enforce the prohibitions must be subject to checks and balances. it is precisely to establish checks and balances and a reasonable parity between the investigating officer, with all the resources at his disposal, and the person investigated, that my right hon. Friend has moved the amendment. 
<P>
What would the amendment do? It says simply that the occupier of the premises should have 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable opportunity to inform his relevant legal adviser" , <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and that that legal adviser should have 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable opportunity to attend the premises to assist the occupier in complying with the investigation." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I may add in parenthesis that in view of some of the violent methods that will be required to secure entry, to which my right hon. Friend properly referred, it is as well that a legal adviser should be present, not least to satisfy himself about the way in which entry has been secured, and possibly, to act as a witness as to the manner of that entry and to any damage to property or injury inflicted upon persons that may be caused in the process. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> As the Under-Secretary made clear earlier that parties being investigated should not have their right not to incriminate themselves infringed, is not legal advice highly desirable when people are required to give an explanation of the status of a document? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. An investigating officer attending the premises will be armed not only with the utensils to ensure that he can get into the property, but with information, lines of questioning and, possibly, evidence. If we are interested in fairness and equity, it is imperative that the person being investigated has immediate access to legal assistance not so that he can welsh on his obligations or get round the law, but simply to ensure that he has a prospect of defending himself within the law. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing that those powers go beyond the powers given in other criminal investigations. I put to him that if the police suspected that he was keeping dodgy fivers in his garage, possibly to be used to fund the helicopter that he uses to fly between Conservative party meetings, he would not expect them to give him notice that they were about to search his garage; nor would he expect them to give him the opportunity to ask his solicitor to be present while they conducted that search. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he does not regard the crimes committed under the Bill to be as heinous as the crimes that attract such powers? 
<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow: The hon. Gentleman makes a poor fist of that argument. The hon. Member for Rochdale </B>(Lorna Fitzsimons) may find the matter amusing, but I fear that although she, in common with her hon. Friends, disapproves of the amendments, she has failed adequately to attend to the content of clauses 28 and 29. If hon. Members had attended to those clauses, they would be aware that, at a cursory glance, at least four references are made to reasonable opportunity, reasonable suspicion and so on. 
<P>
<B>Ms Lawrence:</B> As I pointed out in a previous intervention, Conservative Members have complained about loose drafting. He is falling into the same supposed trap. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Our objection to the Bill, specifically to clause 28, is the absence of a provision to allow people to be represented. That is our principal anxiety. In talking about loose drafting, the hon. Lady appeared to be attacking her own side, although we are not quite clear why. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Ms Lawrence) is confused because our attack on sloppy drafting is not, on this occasion, related to the phrase "reasonable opportunity" , but the fact that the phrase appears in some places and not in others. We do not object to the phrase; it is one of the few phrases that the Government have got right. However, it appears only intermittently. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend is correct. I would welcome consistency between clauses. It would be unforgivable if such inconsistency existed between clauses at either end of the Bill if, for instance, clause 1 provided the relevant words and clause 61 did not although it might be understandable. However, we are talking about two back-to-back clauses which, for no apparent reason, contain different wording in relation to substantially similar matters. The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire is at all times a doughty defender of the Government, but I doubt that she can wriggle out of that one. 
<P>
It would be unreasonable I use that term again to allow the intervention of the hon. Member for South Thanet to pass without being adequately rebutted. A moment ago, in a flight of fancy, the hon. Gentleman started talking about criminal offences. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The Judge Jeffreys attack. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend describes it as the Judge Jeffreys' attack. The hon. Member for South Thanet should be aware that in certain instances we are referring to civil matters rather than to purely criminal matters. People should indeed have the chance to represent themselves, to seek advice and to be able to make the best case. If the hon. Gentleman is so convinced that, in those instances, the evidence is compelling, that evidence will doubtless win the day when the matter finally comes to court. It seems curious that the Government should be anxious to provide themselves with maximum powers yet seek to deprive the persons subjected to inquiry a reasonable opportunity to defend themselves.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, contrary to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, the investigations will not be criminal investigations? The risk to people subject to investigation is that they might transgress the offences in clauses 43 to 45 if they have no legal adviser present; nor would they provide documents as requested, which would give rise to a criminal offence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It would be an extraordinary state of affairs if, precisely as a result of the Government depriving suspected people of a chance to represent themselves, those people should fall foul of another aspect of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> And incriminate themselves. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Yes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry says they could incriminate themselves. If we want to avoid such a ludicrous situation, we should at least give people the chance to defend themselves. It is bizarre that the hon. Member for South Thanet has such a quizzical expression on his face; the purpose of the amendment is eminently reasonable and its effect would be sound. It would improve the Bill and the rights of those investigated. 
<P>
I said earlier that there is a substantial body of support for our position. I referred to the CBI, which believes that the Bill's investigatory powers are too wide and recognises the need for them to be subject to checks and balances. It is not alone. Hon. Members will no doubt be aware of the submission by the distinguished law firm Clifford Chance, among others. We have all been showered with briefing documents about the Bill, but I hope that Labour Members will have read Clifford Chance's submission. As was observed on Second Reading on 11 May, Clifford Chance has said that the investigatory powers those on breaking and entering premises and requiring people to provide explanations on pain of criminal penalties go beyond those conferred on the European Commission. It has also said that the Government have advanced no justification for taking such extensive powers, which are unprecedented in some respects. 
<P>
If there is a justification, will the hon. Member for South Thanet explain why he thinks that everyone else is wrong? Distinguished firms of lawyers, representatives of British industry and the Law Society which no member of the Committee would dispute is an estimable body are wrong, but the hon. Gentleman is right. I do not believe that to be the case. The Law Society is, properly, worried about balance. It wants the Bill to be fair. No member of the Committee would say that the Law Society has an unreasonable axe to grind in this matter. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster (Hastings and Rye):</B> I declare an interest as a solicitor and a member of the Law Society, which is a trade union. It seeks work for its members; the Opposition amendments offer it an opportunity to find that work. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry, but I think that that is an unworthy observation. It is peculiarly significant and oh-so-very typical that once someone has become an hon. Member, he is very ready to turn on his previous profession in such a vicious and unwarranted fashion. I recognise that people want employment, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman, who is a serious contributor to proceedings in Committee and in the House more generally, accepts that he has a duty to respond to the argument that the Law Society advances, and not to content himself with merely impugning its motives. 
<P>
The question is, is the balance right? If there must be powers, can we rest assured that the businesses and individuals who will be subjected to them will have a chance to represent themselves, to argue their case and to be aware of the legal position? Amendment No. 125, which is modest, is designed to ensure a reasonably level playing field. It is about equity, justice and balance. It is difficult to see how Labour Members can object to it. If they refuse to support it, it can be only because they have been subjected to the vibration of the silent message on the pager emanating from their masters. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friends have alluded to the interventions of Labour Back Benchers; I have alluded to the absence of them in the past. I am in favour of audience participation and am quite certain that it is a coincidence that such interventions occur only when we have the pleasure of the Under-Secretary's presence in Committee and not when the Minister of State is present. That is an additional reason for welcoming the Under-Secretary back to the Committee. 
<P>
My right hon. and hon. Friends have properly emphasised the importance of the clauses under discussion. In relation to part I, chapter II of the Bill, which concerns abuse of a dominant position, the admirable research paper provided by the House of Commons Library quotes the words from act 2, scene 2 of "Measure for Measure" : 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"O! It is excellent 
<P>
To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous 
<P>
To use it like a giant." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Those words obviously apply to what we are currently discussing. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire had an exchange with the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire about the use of "reasonableness" , in which she criticised the drafting of our amendment. I do not think that I have previously cited for the Committee the definition of an act of God in Blackstone's law dictionary as an act that no reasonable man would expect God to commit. If reasonableness can be adduced in the presence of the Almighty, it is not unreasonable for my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham to have done so on this occasion. 
<P>
My right hon. Friend referred to the substitution of other officers to sign for the director general. I had a little experience in relation to telephone warrants in my experience, in Northern Ireland; but they are also involved in Customs and Excise investigations the substitute was another Secretary of State. Those who wanted to secure warrants tended to take them to those Ministers who had experience of either Northern Ireland, Customs and Excise or, conceivably, the Revenue, simply because they knew the background to the issue. I therefore still found myself signing such warrants when I was Secretary of State for National Heritage. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary has properly adduced other legislation covering raids of one sort or another; I make no complaint about that. He will know that Ministers are not informed of when raids will take place. That is right the law enforcement agency must be allowed to make its own decisions about its action. If you will allow me the briefest digression, Mr. Atkinson, I remember the raid on Lester Piggott when I was a Customs and Excise Minister. Customs and Excise did not tell me about that raid until it was taking place, and it only told me then because it would be on the tapes in the House of Commons, and it would look slightly odd if the Minister did not even know that it was occurring. 
<P>
There is concern about media presence at a number of raids; we can only assume that the media have been tipped off by someone in the law enforcement agency concerned. That is an infringement of the rights of the raidee, but it is equally clearly a matter for the internal discipline of the law enforcement agency, so that should not concern us here. 
<P>
The hon. Member for South Thanet cited criminal charges, which are of course involved in the raids that I have described, but of course we are not discussing criminal charges; we are talking about having a lawyer present because criminal charges could be brought if the person refused to hand over documents. In a sense, the hon. Gentleman reinforced our position rather than the opposite. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) intervened to question the motivation of the Law Society. As the Law Society is based in my constituency, I insist on rebutting absolutely what he said. Although there has not been death by duel in Hyde park since 1712, on the last such occasion, it involved two parliamentarians who, incidentally, shot each other. I therefore serve warning to the hon. Gentleman that I am prepared to defend the interests of my constituents should the need arise. The amendments are intended to allow the raidee access to legal advice, especially on occasions when two days' notice has not been afforded. 
<P>
I shall reiterate the point that the hon. Member for Watford has had difficulty grasping. Such access to advice reflects centuries of past practice, so it is difficult to understand what Government's objection to the principle can be. I listened to the exchanges we shall be able to read them later but the hon. Member for Watford did not seem to grasp the fact that, if the director general does not give the two days' warning that is afforded to him under the Bill, the raidee will have no idea that the raider is about to arrive and will have no opportunity to seek legal advice. I realise that that might be a new version of the Watford gap, and I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wants to sell off the services there. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My right hon. Friend has trespassed into my constituency albeit, in an attempt to refer to the hon. Member for Watford. From time to time, to explain the whereabouts of my somewhat scattered constituency, I describe myself as the hon. Member for Watford Gap. I thought that I should make that clear to my hon. Friend before he continued to attack the hon. Lady. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, because the hon. Member for Watford might have criticised me for lacking geographical knowledge. That would clearly be an offence on my part, given that north of Watford is so frequently cited as a particular geographical indication. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> The right hon. Gentleman clearly lacks geographical knowledge; Watford is a considerable distance from Watford Gap, I am pleased to say. 
<P>
I fully understand the point that has been made about subsection (3) and the fact that it does not apply two working days' notice. The Opposition have failed to address the fact that subsection (3) will apply only if the director general has reasonable suspicion and it is necessary to gain entry without notice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not want to prolong the debate indefinitely, but I counsel the hon. Lady to reread subsection (3) before she intervenes again; she has not given a precise description of it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My right hon. Friend is right about what the hon. Member for Watford has said. Does he think that it is because of today's tube strike that she is so reluctant to mind the gap? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I alluded earlier to audience participation, and it is profoundly encouraging to see how alert the Committee has become. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Before we leave the point, does my right hon. Friend agree that, to enter premises under subsection (3), the director general must merely have a reasonable suspicion that they are occupied by the person being investigated under either prohibition, not that the person will damage, remove or conceal documents? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for spelling out with absolute precision what I have explained somewhat elliptically to the hon. Member for Watford. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> What the right hon. Gentleman seems to have forgotten in his unfair attacks on my hon. Friend the Member for Watford is that, if officers were to arrive without giving notice, they would be required under European law to allow people to contact their solicitors. However, the officers would not leave the premises while they did so, nor would they allow unreasonable time to find a solicitor. The officers would stay at the premises and conduct their investigation. That is exactly the same as the powers that the authorities have in many other matters, whether or not warrants to enter premises are issued. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Brooke:</B> I am about to sit down. As I have said, I am looking forward to the Government's explanation, which might include the reference that the hon. Gentleman has just made. However, I am surprised that the Government have chosen to press the button of audience participation in the debates on this clause, for I should have thought it sensible from the Government to have moved rapidly on rather than to have increased the amount of debate on it. 
<P>
The only other aspect of audience participation to which we may yet be treated is the Under-Secretary explaining to the hon. Member for Watford why she is incorrect. That would introduce a degree of verisimilitude that I would not necessarily wish him to observe. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Does my hon. Friend wish to intervene? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I wish to make a speech. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am now sitting down, and my hon. Friend may be called. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a lively and interesting debate. At one point, to pursue a military metaphor, when my right hon. Friend was speaking about the merits or otherwise of the Law Society, I was reminded of the famous remark made during the first world war about what a particular person would do in relation to some atrocity which I shall not share with the Committee. That person thought for a moment and said, "I would immediately seek to impose myself between the parties." 
<P>
I conclude with a wartime analogy. I welcome the fledgling contributions of Labour Back Benchers, who have not previously participated in the debate. I was overwhelming reminded of the wartime exploits of the Regia Aeronautica, but in the interests of harmony in the Committee, I shall not follow that analogy further. 
<P>
I return to the substance of the debate. Clauses 28, 29 and 30 should have been taken together. We cannot now redesign the whole Bill, but those clauses form a complex of various types of circumstance. Our debate was useful not least because we were able to seek an appropriate response to particular situations. 
<P>
One confusion, which was illuminated by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, is that two categories of premises appear in the Bill those that the director general thinks may be useful to an investigation but which are not themselves owned by parties to an alleged anti-competitive action or breach of dominant position; and those that are owned by such parties. I give those premises the shorthand names of innocent and potentially suspect. 
<P>
In the case of innocent premises there is, of course, a presumption of innocence, and it is not a criminal matter safeguards are provided. Clauses 43 to 45 allow for two days' notice to be given and for some indication to be given of the purpose of the investigation and the nature of the offence. Those are sensible safeguards. 
<P>
If I was in business, it would not be unreasonable for someone from the Office of Fair Trading to say that he wished to look at my records in relation to my dealings with a third party. I would have plenty of time to telephone my solicitor, saying that I did not understand the law and asking whether I would have to do anything. He might say that I should do this and not that. 
<P>
We them come to cases of suspicion we must remember that it is only a civil action and the director general taking an interest in the activities of a party to an agreement suspected of being anti-competitive, in what I called suspect premises. He may feel that chapter II prohibitions had been infringed by an undertaking, and no one is arguing that he should not investigate that properly. The question is how it is done and what safeguards there are. 
<P>
It is unfortunate that clause 28 includes both types of references the innocent premises and the suspect premises. It does that in subsection (3), which disapplies the safeguards to those premises that are suspected of infringing either prohibition. That may be the easiest way to legislate on the matter, but it gives rise to confusion. If the director general feels that it is appropriate to give notice, he may do so and good luck to him. 
<P>
I hope that if I received such a notice, I would not immediately burn all the files or destroy the computer records. In some cases, however, the director general may feel that there is a danger of such destruction. We all know of cases of firms that have been under investigation in the past for one reason or another criminal and civil that have resorted to such tactics. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Watford is entirely right to say that there should be proper safeguards. The last thing that any of us wants is an owner, who may be aided and abetted by his employees or even his legal adviser, if he is less scrupulous than he should be to be merrily burning the files while the director general and his officers are sitting outside, unable to act. However, it is worrying to have officials arriving and taking action in such a way that leaves the owner of the premises unable to have access to legal advice or to know what is going on. 
<P>
A warrant, which is the specific provision under clause 29, can be shown by the officials. As I said earlier, there are some reasonability safeguards in the operation of that warrant. If the team turns up at the premises but no one is there, the executing officer must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to inform the occupier and to give him the right to call his legal adviser. That does not seem to apply when the notice procedure is implemented or when the occupier is on the premises at the time of the officer's arrival to execute the warrant. There is no obligation on the officer to say, "We are here with our warrant. You may call your solicitor." We want notice to be given when it is reasonable to do so. If it cannot be given, I am not saying that the owner of the premises should be allowed to carry on burning his files with impunity, but he should be given the chance to get advice from his legal adviser and the search should not proceed until that advice is available to him. 
<P>
I expect that the Under-Secretary will be looking for possible safeguards. The hon. Member for South Thanet hinted at safeguards, which may have something to do with European law. We have said in extenso that we are discussing British law. Although it is by analogy with European law, it is not clear to me that the European jurisprudence on articles 85 and 86 will apply. I am no lawyer, so perhaps the Minister can tell us. It is possible that there may be some safeguards under the separate conventions, viz. the European convention on human rights in relation to the action of officers of the state acting reasonably. 
<P>
We need to secure our objectives. First, there must be a clear working distinction between suspect and non-suspect premises. For those that are suspect and in breach of the chapter I or chapter II prohibitions, there should be proper notice, whenever possible, when there is no suspicion that evasive action will be taken. A warrant should be issued, if necessary, but in all cases of entry, the owner of the premises should be allowed access to legal advice before anything irreparable is done. I do not think that that is too much to ask, and I look forward to the Under-Secretary's response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The proceedings are unique, not because of the boring, unfunny, old-boy jokes, or because a former Minister said that his civil servants woke him up to tell him about the decisions that they had taken, fearing that he might read about them the next day in The Racing Post. Our proceedings are unique, not because an Opposition Member had to tell a colleague, "I am sitting down" in case his hon. Friend was too dim to pick it up, but because, for the first time ever, concern for junior employees has been voiced by the Opposition. They have never before expressed their concern for junior employees over holiday pay, sick pay or maternity leave. They have never worried about the exploitation of junior employees by employers, a matter that we in the Government have done so much to eradicate. 
<P>
The Opposition's real concern about junior employees is that they might shop their bosses. We are led to believe that the right hon. Member for Wokingham is acting as the champion of junior employees, standing between the axe wielders of the Office of Fair Trading and the front door, like a super-Spock body, preventing it from being smashed down. Incidentally the right hon. Gentleman did not seem to realise it clause 28 contains no power forcibly to enter premises. The Opposition wanted, as always, to make sure that their real intentions were camouflaged and masked. I shall now tell the Committee of the impact of those two amendments. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government do not accept that it is unreasonable to ask certain employees, even the most junior, to face questioning on competition and investigation matters. I have been told of a case in which it is alleged that the staff of two firms, none of whom were managerial, were exchanging price-sensitive information with a view to fixing the price of scientific equipment. The Office of Fair Trading has told me that, when it makes cartel investigations, it finds that junior staff are sometimes involved. Of course it is not wrong for domestic premises to be entered, subject to proper safeguards being put in place, as has been amply stressed by Labour Members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Griffiths:</B> There will be plenty of time in a moment. The safeguard is that domestic premises may be entered only if they are also used in connection with the affairs of an undertaking. The ludicrous example given by the right hon. Member for Wokingham that the home of a junior secretary, a place that has no connection with the business, could be raided and that the door could be kicked does no credit to the quality of the Committee's debate. The director general's actions are subject to judicial review if he exceeds his powers or otherwise acts unreasonably. 
<P>
It is a procedural feature of the European Commission regime that an undertaking that is the subject of an investigation is given reasonable time in which to secure the services of an in-house legal adviser or a lawyer of its choice. It is the case that the commission will wait only a limited time for a lawyer to arrive and only if it can be confident that the records of the business will remain in the state that they were in when the commission officials arrived. They can do that only by remaining on the premises. 
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading has confirmed that it intends to follow the practice and policy of the EC Commission as set out in explanatory notes to articles 14(2) and 14(3) of EC regulation 17/62, under which EC investigations are conducted. The rights of undertakings to obtain legal advice will be dealt with in the director general's rules, to be made under clause 51. The provision in the rules will be subject to consultation under subsection (3) of clause 51 and to approval by the Secretary of State under subsection (5). It will also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That should reassure Clifford Chance, the distinguished law firms and the Law Society, whose concerns were spoken of by Opposition Members. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If anyone wishes me to give way, I am happy to do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. Will he now accept that I was not trying to stop junior employees from whistle-blowing because they would consent to give the documents; I am happy for them so to do. The Under-Secretary's answer to my question is therefore not right. Will he now give the Committee the assurance that entry will not be forced or documents insisted upon when a former employee or employee is a junior member of staff and the attack is aimed at the home premises? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I can give that assurance when the home premises are not used in connection with the undertaking's affairs. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> We have got there, ultimately. That was a helpful remark from the Under-Secretary. I am sure that it will be an important part of the record when the courts and the director general come to try to sort out the mess and muddle of the Bill, so the amendment has achieved something. 
<P>
However, it would be a good idea for the Committee to put the matter to the test of a vote. We have not received any explanation from the massed ranks of the Labour party in the Committee about why we can have the protection in clause 30 but not in clauses 28 and 29. It is obvious that the draftsmen believe that such protection can be included in the Bill. The Under-Secretary now says that the director general's rules must cover that important issue. Would it not be easier to do that bit of the director general's work for him, as in clause 30, and to include it in clauses 28 and 29 as well? With that in mind, it might be for the convenience of the Committee if we put the matter to the vote.

Clause 28, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 29 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to enter premises under a warrant </center></H4>
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 15, line 39, leave out "mentioned in subsection (1)" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in respect of which the application under subsection (1) was granted ("the relevant kind" );'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 92 and 93. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> This is another minor, technical amendment intended to clarify exactly what documents a warrant under clause 29 will authorise an investigating officer to search for, or take possession of, or about which an explanation may be required to be given when premises have been entered under the warrant. 
<P>
Clause 29 sets three separate circumstances in which a warrant may be obtained from a High Court judge enabling an investigating officer to enter premises in this way. The Bill may not be clear on one point. When the warrant is issued, can the investigation officer exercise his powers under subsection (2)(b), (c) and (e) only in relation to the category or categories of document that were the subject of the warrant? Or could the powers cover all the categories? The amendment makes it clear that the narrower interpretation will apply. In other words, the powers relate to the documents that were the basis for obtaining the warrant in the first place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It seems that the Under-Secretary is introducing a welcome further safeguard, which I would not advise my hon. Friends to vote against, but perhaps he would clarify the situation. My understanding is that, if the director general required further documents, he would have to issue a separate notice or apply for a separate warrant. If during his investigation or search of the premises he stumbled on other information that might be useful but was not actually specified in the warrant, would he have to close the book on that information, take no account of it and under no circumstances notwithstanding that he had secured it or otherwise use it in evidence in proceedings unless he went through the formal procedure again? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The intention is that relevant documents will be limited to those covered by the grounds on which a warrant is obtained and any documents obtained should be treated in that light. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<H4><center>Directions in relation to agreements </center></H4>
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 17, line 23, leave out from `to' to `such' in line 24 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any party to that agreement'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 169, in page 17, line 24, leave out `he considers appropriate' and insert `are required'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The clause covers enforcement and the ability of the director general to give directions. The amendments are directed at two phrases in subsection (1), which empowers the director general to give such directions "as he considers appropriate" and to give them 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to such person or persons as he considers appropriate" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Those are sweeping powers. Is it desirable or necessary for the Government to give the director general such sweeping powers? It is presumably intended that, when the parties to an agreement are confirmed, it is to those parties that the director general should give directions and only such directions as are required to be applied to them, as opposed to those which are deemed by the director general to be appropriate. "Appropriate" is one of those words that is much loved by bureaucracies. It is applied to everything for which they do not have adequate justification but which they consider expedient. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Section 23 of the Army Act 1955. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is ahead of me and, if the opportunity arises, perhaps he will explain that. 
<P>
The two amendments are rightly grouped together because they were designed to provide some circumscription to the sweeping powers proposed for the director general. Their purpose is not to prevent the director general from proceeding in ways that are necessary or desirable in the context of his enforcement powers. However, in relation to an infringement of the chapter I prohibition, it is reasonable that he should give directions to those parties to the agreement. 
<P>
If the amendment were introduced, the remedy would effectively become proportionate to the offence in two ways. First, the remedy would constrain those parties to the agreement rather than innocent third parties who might otherwise be swept up by the application of the director general's powers. Secondly, in so far as he considers that the direction requires activity, the director general could make powers but could not consider appropriate powers that go beyond that. 
<P>
I am advised that this element of proportionality bears some relationship to EC jurisprudence, although I am here straying into areas that are slightly beyond my competence. I direct the Committee's attention to an ECJ decision covering Societe Technique Miniere and Maschinenbau Ulm GmbH, which are no doubt French and German companies. I hope that my French and German pronunciation has here done me justice. That applies to the notion of severability, which I do understand. The provisions or feature of an agreement or practice that violate article 85(1) are void in line with that decision. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
It is therefore reasonable to circumscribe this particular power to give directions, so that EC jurisprudence is given effect. The Minster will no doubt correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to be designed from that point of view. It should also confine itself to the offence created under the agreement that infringes the chapter I prohibition, and to the parties to that agreement.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I applaud the thrust of my hon. Friend's thinking, and I have no wish to detract from the general validity of his point. However, I hope that he will accept that one should not place too much trust in the concept of proportionality as contained within European treaties. Is he aware that there is a protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality in the treaty of Amsterdam? It states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality shall respect the general provisions and objectives of the treaty, particularly as regards the maintaining in full of the acquis communautaire of the institutional balance, which will not affect the principles developed by the court of justice regarding the relationship in national law and community law. It should take into regard article f3 of the treaty on the European Union, according to which the Union should provide itself with the means necessary to obtain its objectives and to carry through its policies." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In many circumstances it is therefore a minimal protection. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not know which astonishes me more the quality of his argument or the quality of his memory. Both are admirable, and he makes a very good point. He strikes the high note and I strike the low notes, through which I try simply to ensure that the Government bring about some consistency between the Bill and EC legislation. 
<P>
As my hon. Friend will know, EC legislation substantially applies in this country and would therefore apply to many of the agreements. We are seeking to defend the interests of those who engage legitimately in the marketplace. It is therefore important that industry is not caught out by inconsistencies between UK and EC legislation, and is not subject to directions and requirements imposed by the director general that are not proportionate to the infringement to the prohibition. 
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee too long, but I shall sum up our intention. First, in so far as the director general has an enforcement direction to make, he should apply it to those parties to the agreement, and not to innocent third parties who should not be subject to such enforcement corrections. Secondly, rather than relying on the multi-purpose word "appropriate" , which is designed for his convenience, the director general should be prepared, if necessary , to demonstrate that, in so far as he gives direction, his proposed measures are necessary to bring an end to the infringement and not simply expedient for his purposes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has, as ever, performed a service by enabling us to pause for a moment on these probing amendments. He raised two points that are essential to the discharge of the director general's duties: the need to act reasonably in his judgments and to ensure that his penalties or enforcement requirements are proportionate to the task in hand. The Minister should have an opportunity to respond to that. I am aware that schedule 9(14) allows the director general to draw up rules for enforcement. The Government should and, no doubt, will consult on those. 
<P>
I have one or two specific points to make. Unless there is an exceptional reason, it is important to tie into provisions only those legal persons who are parties to the agreement. Otherwise, it is conceivable that the director general might impose duties on innocent parties which might be in restraint of trade. For example, it would be open to the director general to say, "X has offended and you, Y, must not trade with X because he has offended." The only way in which the enforcement could take place is if no one traded with Y. That would be inappropriate. The Minister owes it to us to explain the circumstances under which parties other than those to the anti-competitive agreement should be banned or influenced directly by it. 
<P>
I am more concerned about the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"appropriate to bring the infringement to an end." <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
But before I explain that, I want to pick up a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire who has attributed to me more knowledge than I have about the Army Act. The word "appropriate" reminded me of the section in that Act which covers conduct that is inappropriate to a serving soldier, which basically means, "Whatever else we haven't got you for, we'll get you under this." We do not want that type of provision and, in fairness to the Minister, neither does he. 
<P>
When considering the director general's action, and action appropriate to bring the infringement to an end, we need to reflect on the timing. Is the director general obliged to bring the infringement immediately to an end regardless of the consequences, or could he have regard to other considerations? For example, it would not be sensible to end infringement if, in the director general's judgment, that would bring a business to its knees immediately, so leading to a loss of jobs. Equally, if that business was knocked out by the director general's requirements under clauses 33 or 34, and one competitor disappeared from the scene, how would that help consumers? Would they be helped indirectly by the removal of a competitor from the market or directly by the lack of after-sales service? There would be no continuity, which would create a gap. 
<P>
It is worth asking the Minister to clarify whether "bringing to an end" means immediately, or whether the director general will have regard to other considerations as a sensible digression of the infringement to bring matters under control in a reasonable period. The points are not nit-picking. It is important that the director general addresses them. If we are interested in competition policy, we need to ensure that the consequences of enforcement are not unnecessarily onerous on business or likely to give rise, because of literal interpretation, to consequences that we would not wish to see. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Hon. Members will be aware that similar amendments to the clause were debated in another place. I see no reason to change our view. Before any action is taken under clause 33, the director general will have considered whether there has been an infringement of the chapter I prohibition and reached a decision that there has been. He will then judge what directions are appropriate to bring the infringement to an end. We have no reason to suppose that the director general will give directions that go beyond what is necessary to end an infringement, and there is the safeguard that the giving of a direction under clause 33 can, of course, be the subject of an appeal under clause 47. 
<P>
Amendment No. 170 would restrict the persons to whom the director general may give directions, for the purpose of bringing the infringement to an end, just to parties to the agreement. Clause 33 is widely drawn to include "such person or persons" as the director general 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"considers appropriate to bring the infringement to an end" . <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That includes individuals and corporate bodies. 
<P>
As discussed in another place, it is quite possible that the undertakings involved in infringements will be part of, or the whole of, a complex corporate group structure. The immediate party to an infringement agreement may not be the actual instigator of that infringement. A subsidiary may be the entity directly involved, but the infringement of the chapter I prohibition may have been instigated by the parent company. As was said in another place, the director general must have the ability to get at the real culprit and his power to give directions should not be circumscribed in this way. 
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire finds that explanation satisfactory and that he will withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that explanation. I understand the circumstances in which the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any party to that agreement" <P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
may not serve the Director's purposes sufficiently. However, it is not sufficient to say that the use of the word "appropriate" in either set of circumstances is the best way to proceed. The Under-Secretary said that he was confident that the director general would not use directions beyond that which was necessary. It might have been better if the Bill was drafted in those terms. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
