<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind members of the Committee that there is a financial resolution to the 
Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind the Committee that adequate notice 
should be given of amendments and, as a general rule, I shall not call starred amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.31 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, to the Chair. In my first 
year as a Member of Parliament, it is a great responsibility to be presenting a Bill that has the support 
of so many hon. Members, who have campaigned for firework safety over many years. This is my first 
Standing Committee and I should appreciate your guidance and indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, should I 
not understand the procedures.
<P>
I welcome the Minister to the Committee; he is a doughty consumer champion on many issues 
and his decisive action in bringing forward the 1997 regulations under the Consumer Protection Act 
1987 has resulted in a 26 per cent. reduction in the number of injuries, as reported in the fireworks 
injury survey data that was published earlier this week. That shows what can be done by focusing 
action on trouble hot spots, but at 908—25 of which were in Devon and Cornwall—the number of 
injuries is still too high. My Bill will, I hope, help to target such action, which will result in further 
reductions.
<P>
I welcome Opposition Members to the debate and I am sure that we shall benefit from the 
experience of the former Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, the hon. Member for 
Solihull (Mr. Taylor) who, I am sure, will soon take his place in Committee. Other members of the 
Committee have significant experience of campaigning for firework safety and I welcome, in 
particular, the presence in Committee of my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Northfield 
(Mr. Burden) and for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon). They have assisted me greatly in the 
consultations with interested parties that we have had during the past six months. I am pleased to see 
the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) in Committee. I know that his constituents greatly enjoy 
fireworks and that he cares equally greatly about their safety.
<P>
As there was no debate about the Bill on Second Reading, it may help the Committee if I outline 
briefly its intentions. Fireworks provide an enjoyable form of entertainment when they are used as 
intended and in the right circumstances. The last thing that I want to see is fireworks so tightly 
regulated that they are effectively no longer available to the public—with the danger of a black market 
developing or people being tempted to make their own. As I am sure hon. Members will be only too 
aware from their postbags, firework issues are of great concern to the public and to those of us who 
want to improve safety and reduce the distress that fireworks can cause.
<P>
My Bill is an enabling measure; it is based on existing consumer safety legislation and will 
enable the Secretary of State to make regulations on issues relating to the safe use of fireworks, which 
cannot be dealt with under the powers of the Consumer Protection Act 1987. In line with existing 
consumer safety legislation, the Bill specifies that permanent regulations cannot be made without 
appropriate consultation with consumer bodies, trade associations and enforcement organisations. It 
also allows for emergency action in exceptional circumstances and makes provision for the 
enforcement of regulations and for penalties relating to their infringement.
<P>
It is important that the provisions align closely with those in the Consumer Protection Act, 
because it is likely that any future controls on fireworks will be introduced by way of regulations made 
under mixed powers—that is, under the regulation-making powers in my Bill and those in the 
Consumer Protection Act 1987. Hon. Members will note that the Bill incorporates references to 
various sections of that Act. 
<P>
I shall not bore hon. Members by reading a list of all the powers to be given under the Bill, but I 
shall highlight some of them. First—I believe that a number of hon. Members and others share this 
view—there is an urgent need to establish a statutory national training scheme for firework display 
operators. The Bill will allow that to be addressed.
<P>
Secondly, enforcement authorities and trade bodies representing fireworks suppliers are worried 
that there is no system for tracing fireworks once they have entered the distribution chain. The Bill 
will therefore allow regulations to be made to require manufacturers and importers to notify 
enforcement bodies of fireworks long before they are made available for distribution to end users. That 
will allow enforcement authorities to carry out checks and, when necessary, to suspend the 
distribution of unsafe fireworks at source.
<P>
Thirdly, the obvious danger is that unqualified individuals or organisations might attempt to 
obtain from elsewhere in Europe fireworks that have been completely prohibited or are restricted for 
sale only to suitably trained persons. That would clearly not be acceptable; the Bill therefore includes 
a power to control the possession of specified fireworks should it be necessary.
<P>
Fourthly, if used with complete disregard for the safety and well being of others, fireworks can 
be a source of great distress and nuisance. The Bill therefore includes powers to limit the times when 
fireworks may be sold or used. It is envisaged that those powers would be exercised by the Secretary of 
State. Such measures would help prevent the nuisance and distress caused by fireworks being used at 
inappropriate and unreasonable times. For example, it could prove necessary to invoke those powers if 
it became evident that the number and scale of firework displays and the general use of fireworks was 
getting out of hand in the run up to the millennium.
<P>
Also included in the Bill are powers to allow local authorities to regulate public firework 
displays, to ensure that they are safely operated. Regulations made under the Bill may apply in Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Bill is based on the advice and recommendations of local authorities, enforcement 
authorities, safety organisations and the fireworks industry. I believe that its provisions command 
widespread support. I therefore commend the Bill to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are having a wide-ranging debate on clause 1 stand part. That is in order, as 
there was no Second Reading debate. I remind hon. Members that if they wish to raise detailed points, 
they should not do so until we reach the appropriate clauses. We can then keep some order to our 
debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I congratulate you, Mr. Atkinson, on your appointment as 
Chairman of the Committee. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) 
on introducing the Bill, which I and the Liberal Democrats support. Given some of the awful 
accidents that have occurred in recent years, who could argue with a Bill designed to improve 
firework safety?
<P>
I shall dwell for a moment on the special nature of my constituency interest in the matter, which 
I draw to the attention of the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, the hon. Member for 
Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), and of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton. I do so to ensure that 
the provisions of the Bill do not adversely impact on the special nature of firework celebrations in 
Lewes and Sussex generally.
<P>
For those not familiar with what happens in Lewes, I should explain that it is, in many ways, the 
firework capital of the country on 5 November. In some years, as many as 50,000 or 60,000 people 
arrive in Lewes, mostly from Sussex but some from further afield, including some from overseas. The 
town’s normal population is 15,000, but it is five times higher in November. 
<P>
Extensive bonfire celebrations involving fireworks have occurred in Lewes for centuries. It is a 
strong tradition in my constituency and in Sussex generally. There are six bonfire societies in Lewes, 
and others in my constituency at Newhaven, Newick, Chailey and elsewhere. There are other bonfire 
societies elsewhere in east Sussex, which have long been involved in the celebrations on 5 November. 
The bonfire societies in Lewes have tremendous expertise, as I told the Minister when he kindly met 
me and the bonfire societies in June or July last year.
<P>
I seek assurance from the hon. Member from Sutton or the Minister that the Bill will take 
account of the special nature of the bonfire celebrations in Lewes. When I met the Minister I was 
concerned not by his response which was helpful—but by the advice he was given on that occasion, 
which did not recognise the need for flexibility in regard to the special celebrations in Lewes. There 
are two sorts of people involved in firework displays: those who pick up fireworks once a year and 
who are liable to injury unless they are properly, and rightly, protected, and experienced, 
professionally-trained companies that need less protection. The legislation must cover that. I am 
concerned that the Bill may not recognise the special nature of bonfire societies, which have 
considerable expertise but are not classified as professionals. They spend the whole year fund-raising 
and have considerable experience gained over many years, but they would not be classified as 
professional in traditional civil service terms. The training scheme, which I fully support, should 
therefore recognise not “professionals” but, for example, “competent display operators”, a term that  
would allow those who do not gain financial reward from fireworks to demonstrate their competence 
to handle them.
<P>
Up to 60,000 people watch the firework displays in Lewes and the number of accidents is, 
happily, very small. That is a testament to the professional, not haphazard, organisation of the 
celebrations. Discussions are held at an early stage with the police and police explosives experts, the 
fire service, the ambulance service, the local authority, trading standards officers: everyone one can 
think of is involved in the planning for 5 November. I therefore challenge any hon. Member to say 
that our celebrations are not run competently or professionally, even though they are run by the 
bonfire societies. The societies are not professionals in the legal sense, but their attitude is 
professional. Some of my comments come from the bonfire societies, some from Rodney Ash and 
Brian Ellis, the firearms and explosives experts of Sussex police who regularly deal with the bonfire 
celebrations in Lewes.
<P>
I seek confirmation that the Bill will recognise bonfire societies, which demonstrate expertise 
and safety, and will not curb their activities. The emergency regulations that were introduced in 
December 1996 made the serious omission of not recognising the special needs of bonfire societies; 
they recognised professional companies and local authorities on the one hand and individuals on the 
other. Local authorities were enabled to undertake 
firework displays when they had no competence to do so. In the case of Lewes, that was ludicrous; 
Lewes district council—of which I was leader at the time—had no such knowledge or expertise. It 
could presumably get the head gardener to handle the fireworks—when the highly skilled bonfire 
societies were excluded. So the record of recognising the particular situation in Lewes is not a happy 
one.
<P>
This is an enabling Bill and some of the detail will be dealt with by regulation. The devil may be 
in the detail and it is therefore difficult to object to parts of the Bill. However, will the Minister assure 
us that there will be proper consultation with bonfire societies and others on future regulations to 
ensure that their anxieties are taken into account?
<P>
Firework experts and the Sussex police service have drawn to my attention two matters about 
which I would welcome comments from the Minister or the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton. First, 
they believe that clause 1(1)(a) should refer to a United Nations number rather than simply a British 
standard specification.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Sussex police are worried that the definition of fireworks in clause 1 does not include 
agricultural bird scarers, which are on sale at various outlets and are not controlled in the same way as 
fireworks. They can act as bangers. Their omission from the definition of fireworks is unfortunate.
<P>
I have not tabled any amendments, because I want to be constructive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I draw on my experience of agriculture. Bird scarers are used 
temporarily for pest scaring. Therefore, I hope that if regulations imposed time constraints on the sale 
of bird scarers, there would be exemptions to ensure that bird scarers could be bought when they were 
genuinely needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> That is a fair point with which I concur. We should not make life more difficult for 
farmers. However, the public safety aspect of bird scarers has to be tackled.
<P>
In an attempt to be constructive, I have not tabled any amendments. However,  I shall do that 
later if the Minister’s assurances do not satisfy me or the Lewes bonfire societies.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> I welcome you to the 
Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton on piloting the 
Bill this far. It has broad support and will be beneficial. It is a pleasure to attend the Committee with 
so many people who are committed to firework safety: those who have, over the years, devoted a great 
deal of time to it in Parliament, and those who have worked outside Parliament. I add my personal 
thanks to the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth), who has been very helpful and has 
taken a particular interest in the matter. I am pleased to see him here.
<P>
We want to ensure that the provisions in the Consumer Protection Act 1987 allow for firework 
safety to be tackled and that the Bill deals with other outstanding issues that cannot be tackled under 
existing powers. The Bill covers the need for training display operators and provides for the 
establishment of a statutory national training scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for Lewes rightly pointed out that some people who run firework displays 
have considerable expertise. That is important. It is disturbing that, on last bonfire night, which 
showed the biggest decrease in accidents for 23 years—the number of injuries is now below 1,000—
several injuries still occurred. I do not have to remind the Committee that three people were killed by 
aerial shells in 1994, but several people were also injured by aerial shells at various organised displays 
last year. Six people were injured in Eastbourne; 11 people were injured in Plymouth. Therefore, it is 
important to ensure that those who organise displays are competent to do so. That is especially so for 
those who, by virtue of organising displays, have access to larger, more dangerous fireworks, which 
are not now available to the public.
<P>
I am especially keen to ensure that bonfire societies and other experienced users have no 
difficulty in obtaining training. I am sure that they accept the need for training, and I know that they 
want to set an example for others to follow. It is vital that any national training scheme is based on 
similar criteria and sets the same standards for training providers. I hope that that addresses the valid 
points made by the hon. Member for Lewes.
<P>
I commend other aspects of the Bill to the Committee. At present, there is no system for tracing 
fireworks, especially those that are imported. My predecessors and I have been informed of several 
incidents in which people have imported truckloads of fireworks of dubious quality, which did not 
appear to meet British standards, and in which the enforcement bodies have had problems. I welcome 
the opportunity that the Bill provides to examine how those matters might best be tackled and what 
checks can be made to ensure that unsafe fireworks are stopped at source.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister might enlighten the Committee about a difficulty that has just 
occurred to me. Given the Excise difficulties that have arisen with trade through the channel ports 
under the single market, what is the position on private imports? I suspect that such matters are dealt 
with under the rules of shipping, but informal imports might make the regime more difficult. We 
might not be so concerned about those imports if the fireworks are for personal use, although we 
might have to be occasionally. However, if it were to become an organised trade, it might well subvert 
the intentions of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Some of us were concerned when the 
import controls were lifted, I believe, in 1988. Ten years on, we recognise that the free flow of trade 
between Britain and the continent means that there are fewer checks on materials. It is to address that 
specific point that my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton has included in the Bill powers 
to enable enforcement officers to stop dangerous fireworks, which do not meet British or other 
European standards, being brought into the country.
<P>
On the designation of fireworks, I assure the hon. Member for Lewes that there is no need for the 
United Nations number, to which he referred, to appear in the Bill. We are satisfied that the definition 
of fireworks covers all the devices that we might want to regulate and that that will be beyond 
challenge. If we had thought otherwise, we would have taken the necessary steps to advise my hon. 
Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, or moved amendments ourselves, to ensure that that 
intention was carried out.
<P>
Our concern is to ensure that the organisers of displays do not bypass training and the 
mechanisms we are putting in place, evade their responsibilities and put the public at risk. We all 
know of tragic cases in which people have under existing law obtained larger fireworks, set them off 
and imperilled their own health and safety and that of others. That must be tackled; import controls 
must be effective.
<P>
Finally, we need the powers in the Bill more strictly to control the sale of fireworks outwith the 
period leading up to bonfire night and shortly thereafter—and during certain religious festivals. The 
Bill creates powers to limit the period during which fireworks can be sold. I welcome that. For all 
those reasons, I commend the Bill to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the 
Committee’s debate, and welcome the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton to her task. She talked 
about her thrill at this moment. I remember that when my late right hon. Friend Enoch Powell came 
top in a private Member’s Bill ballot after having been in the House for many years, he was like a 
child with a new toy. He suddenly realised what a thrill that was, and I can understand how the hon. 
Lady feels as a new Member.
<P>
The Bill is important, and I appreciate the kind words of the Minister. I shall not oppose the 
Bill, but I should like to make one or two general comments. I welcome the fact that, as the Minister 
has just said, the Bill will allow restrictions to be placed on the sale of fireworks outwith certain 
periods of the year. Even with those periods, it will be important to keep reasonable control of 
fireworks, because I am aware of many people in my constituency who have been terrified, even in a 
period of peace. People who live on their own know something of the fear that loud bangs going off 
constantly can cause. I am glad that those powers are in the Bill.
<P>
While welcoming the Bill’s provisions for Northern Ireland, I wonder whether it is right that in 
legislating we place more and more responsibilities on local authorities. I note that the police will not 
have the same role in Northern Ireland as elsewhere, and I understand that. However, outwith the city 
of Belfast, most of our local authorities are rather small, and I wonder whether they will say that they 
are unable to enforce the Bill because they are crying out for money. I wonder whether that problem 
has been sufficiently thought through.
<P>
I welcome the Bill and wish it all speed. I have one or two simple questions—they may not be as 
simple as they appear to me. The Minister has kindly let me have a copy of the fireworks injury data. 
They are admittedly limited to Great Britain, but I know that there have been injuries in Northern 
Ireland even among professionals. We must face the harsh reality that when humans deal with things 
they are fallible and, sooner or later, accidents will occur.
<P>
Is the Minister satisfied that procedures are in place to deal with the more dangerous fireworks, 
such as Chinese crackers? People have devised means to get round any law. The hon. Member for 
Daventry (Mr. Boswell) made a point about informal importation. I wonder whether Customs and 
Excise has its act together to protect the community from those who will try to make their fortune 
through people who like to subvert law and take their pleasures without considering the consequences. 
Laws are important, but we must be satisfied that procedures are in place to enforce the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Burden </B>(Birmingham, Northfield): I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, 
and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton not only on becoming an expert on 
firework safety in a short time, but on her preparations for the Bill, including consultation with the 
relevant parties. She is also to be congratulated on the Bill itself.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
During the previous Parliament I secured two Adjournment debates on firework safety. Many 
matters that were raised then are covered by the Bill. I first became interested in the matter almost by 
accident a few years ago, when I received a telephone call from my colleague who is now the Minister 
for Competition and Consumer Affairs. He was shadow consumer affairs spokesman at the time and 
was booked to appear on television to discuss firework safety. He had to drop out at the last minute 
and asked whether I could take his place. I said that I knew nothing about the issue. As hon. Members 
know, in this place one needs to pick things up at the last minute. He said, “Don’t worry. We will give 
you a briefing and get you all set up.”
<P>
That was it. After the programme I received phone calls and letters, and had no option but to 
become involved. I do not regret that—even though I said some unprintable things about my hon. 
Friend when I received his phone calls—because the issue is important. The more I studied firework 
safety, the more obvious it became what needed to be done.
<P>
That was in the mid-1990s. The first Adjournment debate that I secure was in November 1995. 
It concerned the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Belfast, 
South—imports. At that time fireworks were being imported from China, containing substances that 
were unlawful, and some of which were so unstable that they could explode even if they were dropped. 
After the abolition of import licences there were no controls to allow monitoring of imports.
<P>
Since that time, matters have improved. Authorisation and classification procedures have been 
handled more diligently. However, there remained a need for awareness of what was entering the 
country, how to trace it and how it would find its way into the shops. There was no procedure 
established for that, and when I secured my second Adjournment debate, I and those working with me 
were still trying to discover the whereabouts in Britain of one of the consignments of dangerous 
fireworks that I had been discussing the year before.
<P>
I am pleased that the Bill sets out procedures for provision of information and checking. Those 
do not apply only to imports. Nothing in the Bill is more onerous for firework importers than for 
domestic manufacturers. However, a procedure would be established under the Bill to ensure that in 
the interest of public safety the transport of fireworks into or around the country would be known 
about. It would enable their whereabouts and type to be known—as well as the fact that they were 
safe. 
<P>
The second of my two Adjournment debates followed the tragedies of 1996 that my hon. Friend 
the Minister mentioned—the deaths of David Hattersley and Stephen Timcke, both caused by aerial 
shells. I pay tribute to Mr. Hattersley’s widow, who has played a prominent role in firework safety 
campaigning since that time. David Hattersley was not inexperienced. He was not operating aerial 
shells or other fireworks for the first time. He had used fireworks at school bonfire parties for some 
time, but that tragic accident still happened, and he lost his life.
<P>
The incident not only tragically highlighted the need to do something about aerial shells and 
prevent their sale to the general public, but it provided evidence, if more was needed, of the need for a 
proper national training scheme. Many firework safety organisations had campaigned for that for 
some time. Responsible members of the firework industry—and that is the vast majority of 
manufacturers and importers in this country—accepted the need for a proper training scheme. I am 
pleased that the Bill provides enabling legislation for that.
<P>
Many people have helped us to reach this stage. My hon. Friend the Minister has played a huge 
role, in Government and when we were in opposition, in improving firework safety. Since we came 
into government he has approached the issue of firework safety with laudable and admirable zeal. It is 
a tribute to his work, and that of his team at the Department of Trade and Industry, that last year’s 
extremely hard-hitting successful firework safety campaign brought about a 26 per cent. reduction in 
firework injuries—the highest for many years. I am not complacent, because injury statistics rise and 
fall. But we should be pleased, should welcome the effort that has been put into it, and redouble our 
efforts next year.
<P>
I pay tribute also to the hon. Member for Solihull, who is not in his place. He was the Minister 
with responsibility for consumer affairs and will recall the Adjournment debates of that time. I had to 
cross swords with him several times about firework safety, and I had major differences with him about 
many of his Government’s policies. But the hon. Gentleman was always committed to the cause of 
firework safety, and he brought about improvements as part of a successful safety campaign. I pay 
tribute to him for responding to requests in 1996 to use his power to introduce a temporary ban on 
aerial shells, which my hon. Friend the Minister has made permanent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the absence of my hon. Friend for Solihull, may I give the Committee the good 
news? He will be here as soon as he can be after another commitment and wishes to speak to the 
amendment tabled in his name. I am most grateful for the hon. Gentleman’s generous remarks. I 
know of my hon. Friend’s commitment to the issue and will make sure, if he does not read the full 
transcript, that it is drawn to his attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burden:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I shall be brief because time is short. The Bill is 
important. When enacted, it will be enabling legislation. That is the right way to do things, because 
many of the issues are complicated and if we tried to tackle them through primary legislation the Bill 
would be huge.
<P>
What has emerged so far—this may answer in part the points made by the hon. Member for 
Lewes about bonfire displays—is a spirit of partnership. Not only Members of the House and the other 
place were involved in drafting the Bill. Representatives of the firework industry discussed it and 
made an input. All sorts of safeguards have been built into it. Firework safety organisations were 
involved and I know that the National Campaign for Firework Safety is taking a close interest. Safety 
organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents were consulted, as were 
trading standards officers and other organisations which, under current legislation, are charged with 
enforcing safety rules. That spirit of partnership has been extremely successful. The practical result 
was a welcome fall in firework injuries in 1997. In addition to a highly successful campaign—for 
which I pay tribute to the work of the fire service—we were able to draft these legislative proposals 
and begin discussions, which we shall continue, to lay the foundation for regulations that will make 
firework safety in Britain the envy of the world. We also want to keep the fun in fireworks—they can, 
and do, provide great fun—while, as far as possible, taking out the danger. That has been the 
Government’s goal.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> I was brought up in Ottery St. Mary, where, as in the constituency of the hon. 
Member for Lewes, bonfire night is celebrated in considerable style. As I said earlier, I do not want to 
regulate matters so tightly that people are prevented from enjoying fireworks or are driven to produce 
their own.
<P>
The powers in clause 5 are wide and flexible; they will enable proficiency and experience to be 
the determining factor in establishing who can be supplied with fireworks, and, importantly, they 
provide for training in the use of fireworks. We hope that that will make possible regulations to define 
precisely those who can be supplied with dangerous fireworks. I hope that when my Bill is on the 
statute book, those of us with an interest in fireworks and firework safety will continue to meet to 
discuss accident statistics such as those that were published this week, and to focus on the further use 
of the Bill’s powers to ensure that those statistics continue to show a decline in accidents involving 
fireworks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> May I just clarify that the hon. Lady intends the determining factor to be the 
confidence to use fireworks rather than the professional status of those who may be involved?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Yes, I believe that the powers in clause 5 are flexible in that respect. The hon 
Gentleman asked for flexibility rather than exceptions, and we are confident that there is such 
flexibility in clause 5.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Daventry that it is entirely unacceptable that people should be 
able to circumvent the provisions by importing products. That would be unacceptable in safety terms 
and the Bill has powers to control the possession of specified fireworks, should that be necessary.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Member for Belfast, South to the Committee and thank him for his 
contribution. Northern Ireland has its own regulations and legislation, and my Bill will enable that to 
continue. Its full powers will be exercisable with, or separately from, their exercise elsewhere in Great 
Britain. I understand that the Royal Ulster Constabulary does not consider that it will need a long-
term interest in day-to-day issues relating to fireworks. The making of regulations for Northern 
ireland is a matter for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. We would welcome the hon. 
Gentleman’s participation in any future all-party meetings on firework safety.

<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 44, at end insert ‘or’.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendments Nos. 4 to 6 and 9 to 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The amendments relate to clauses 4 and 15. They are grouped together because 
they are linked by a common purpose: to repeal sections 30, 32 and 80 of the Explosives Act 1875 and 
to allow for the remaking in updated form of the provisions of those sections in due course.
<P>
The sections relate in particular to public safety. Section 30 of the 1875 Act prohibits the 
hawking, sale and exposure for sale of explosives, including fireworks, in public places. Section 32 
deals with the packaging and labelling of explosives sold to the public and section 80 prohibits the 
letting off of fireworks in public places.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 3 to 6 amend clause 4 so as to allow for the re-enacting in fireworks 
regulations of the equivalent provisions in section 30 of the 1875 Act.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 amends clause 15 to provide that regulations made under clause 4 (1)(a) may 
extend to explosives as well as to fireworks. That is necessary so that any prohibition equivalent to 
those in section 30 of the 1875 Act can cover all explosives, not just fireworks. It would, of course, 
include bird scarers, about which the hon. Member for Lewes asked, if they were being misused. there 
is no intention at present to discriminate against bird scarers or to take action gainst those who use 
them for perfectly legitimate and necessary purposes. If they were to be misused, we would want 
powers to close that loophole in specific circumstances, but that would not include general use in 
fields by farmers.
<P>
Amendment No. 10 amends clause 15 to provide a power for the Secretary of State to amend the 
definition of explosives. Amendment No. 11 changes clause 16 because of the change to the contents 
of the schedule made by amendments Nos. 12 and 13.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments 12 and 13 specify the extent of the repals to the 1875 Act and other legislation that 
is no longer necessary, and provide for consequential amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 
1987 and a statutory instrument which refers to section 32 of the 1875 Act. The amendments are 
technical; they will repeal Victorian legislation which, together with the legislation on explosives that 
the Health and Safety Executive intends to introduce, will ensure that we have comprehensive 
provisions to take us into the next century.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I have a quick question. Do the terms of clause 5 mean that possession of prohibited 
fireworks will be an absolute offence, except for professionals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> We will endeavour to help the hon. Gentleman if he will give us a moment 
to consider his question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Occasionally, the US cavalry is of service when further reinforcements are 
required. Is not it also important, if there is to be a strict liability, that some thought should be given 
to the need for a safeguard if fireworks inadvertently came into someone’s possession? For example, 
they may have been put into a trunk by a malicious person without the owner’s consent. There should 
be a safeguard if the owner could show that that had been done without his knowledge or consent, 
albeit that the fireworks were in his possession. Those are the sort of practical difficulties that must be 
teased out if the regulations are not to be discredited. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am advised that the short answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for 
Lewes is yes. The powers in clause 5 allow for regulations to prohibit the
<P>

provisions cover every contingency.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am concerned about a small matter which the Minister may say can be dealt with by 
regulation. I seek clarification on distance. It  is germane to the safety of fireworks displays and I 
should prefer a provision covering safety distances to be written into the Bill. The distance between 
members of the public and fireworks being set off is a major contributory factor to accidents.
<P>
Mr. Nigel Griffiths: Currently, clause 8 provides for the inclusion in regulations of requirements 
that relate to information with, or in relation to, fireworks and that information can specify distance 
limits. I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman’s specific point is given further consideration and I 
undertake to return to him about the matter before the Bill is discussed on Report.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 15, in page 5, leave out

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Amendment No. 14 would provide greater flexibility to require information about 
fireworks. In particular, regulations may be made under which it would be criminal offence for 
importers to import fireworks and for manufacturers to complete the manufacture of fireworks without 
first complying with a requirement to notify information. I recognise that our international trade 
obligations prevent the actual blocking of imports until information is provided and great care will 
also be needed when drafting regulations under the clause—not least to ensure that they do not 
impose requirements that are more onerous than those imposed on home manufacturers.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 allows for the terms “completes the manufacture” and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“places fireworks on the market”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be defined in the regulations made under the clause although, as I have said, great care will 
have to be taken in the drafting to ensure that we comply with our obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I congratulate the hon. Member for Plymouth, 
Sutton on her Bill. Clause 9 is the most important clause in the Bill. The biggest risk of all is 
dangerous fireworks and the tragedy of aerial shells demonstrates that. I support the amendments, but 
I am not clear who will decide under the regulations which fireworks are dangerous and should be 
kept off the market, whether manufactured in this country or imported. There will always be the risk 
of schoolchildren getting hold off fireworks—it is in their nature—and if we are to be effective, the 
biggest objective of all is to keep away from supply fireworks that pose a real danger to life.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy: The regulations are enabling provisions and there will be wide consultation, which </B><P>
will include who should be responsible for their implementation. As a member of the Institute of 
Trading Standards Administration, I have consulted enforcement agencies. Such matters will be 
decided by the Secretary of State, but they will be subject to the consultation process. Practicality of 
enforcement is essential to the value of any legislation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It would be helpful, particularly when the Chairman is blind, if the hon. Member 
for Lewes stood up to catch my eye. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I am still getting used to the peculiarities of Parliament.
<P>
The clause prevents people who manufacture or import prohibited fireworks from placing them 
on the market. Does that constitute an absolute offence of possession? Does the clause prevent 
individuals who seek to use prohibited fireworks privately or in public displays, without monetary 
gain, from importing them? If it does not, perhaps it should. There is a case for an absolute offence of 
possession of prohibited fireworks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> In principle, the prohibition can apply to individuals and the Bill is clear 
about that. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has the latest copy of the Bill—if he does not, I 
apologise. Clause 7 covers the same ground: if the categories of supply, exposing for supply and 
possessing for supply are included, it is not necessary to add the category of offering for supply. The 
only way in which people can offer fireworks for supply and be a threat to the public is by being in 
possession or able to gain a supply of them. The public are at threat if someone offers for supply a 
dangerous firework that he possesses—in the case of a con merchant, of course they are at threat from 
the transaction itself.
<P>
We believe that the Bill covers the matter that concerns the hon. Gentleman. It will have the 
practical effect of ensuring that enforcement officers, including police and trading standards officers, 
can tackle the problem of people offering items for supply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am sorry if I am being dense, but will the Minister clarify whether it would be an 
offence for an individual to go abroad and purchase fireworks that are legal in that country and bring 
them back for private or public use, without seeking to place them on the market or gain financially?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It can be an offence. The regulations that we shall make under the clause can 
specify the information that would be required not only from business but, in principle, from 
individuals. Provided that that is covered on the regulations—and I see no reason why it would not 
be—it would be an offence for an individual or a company to bring dangerous fireworks into the 
country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burden:</B> I may be able to go some way towards answering the points and allaying the fears 
of the hon. Member for Lewes. The definition in clause 1 of supplying fireworks includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“giving them as a prize or otherwise making a gift of them”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a danger of considering only one definition of supply—the bill gives several definitions. 
The Bill also envisages different regulations, some in relation to people who supply fireworks. The 
intention of the Bill’s supporters is to encourage training for people who use powerful fireworks, in 
whatever capacity. That is where the weight of regulation will be. People who let off powerful 
fireworks are a danger to themselves and others without proper training. The precise legal mechanism 
used may vary, but the 
intention is to ensure public safety rather than concentrating on the trade provisions.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend.
<P>
I hope that I have helped to allay the fears of the  hon. Member for Lewes. I hope that when he 
sees the regulations he will be satisfied that we are tackling all possible loopholes.
<P>

references to forfeiture and suspension notices,’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment adds to the enforcement provisions in the Bill by incorporating most of section 
28 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 on making test purchases. It also incorporates section 29(3) 
of that Act, adding to enforcement officers’ powers of search by enabling them to examine procedures 
connected with the production of fireworks. Consequential amendments are made to include 
paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) of section 30 of the 1987 Act on test purchases.
<P>
Amendment No. 16 also makes drafting changes to the references to sections 28 and 30 of the 
Consumer Protection Act 1987, to make it clear that the references to forfeiture and suspension 
notices in those sections are not relevant for the purposes of the Bill.
<P>
The amendments are the result of advice taken from those who will be responsible for enforcing 
the Bill’s provisions.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 2, in clause 20, page 
9, line 15, leave out ‘Apart from section 14’.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I apologise to you, Mr. Atkinson, and to the Committee for not 
being here at the beginning of the sitting. I had some duties in the Opposition Whip’s office—duties 
that are supposed not to exist. I understand that in my absence, the hon. Member for Birmingham, 
Northfield made some rather gracious remarks about me, for which I thank him. 
<P>
It is my wish to delete clause 14 from the Bill, I have discussed the matter with others; I do not 
think that I am taking anyone by surprise. Amendment No. 2 is merely consequential on the read 
across to clause 20. I have acquainted the hon. Member for Belfast, South with my intention. I seek 
through amendment No. 2 to make the law the same throughout Britain and Northern Ireland, and I 
doubt that the hon. Gentleman will take issue with me on that—I hope not, but if he does, I will try to 
deal with the matter.
<P>
It is worth asking the reason for the drafting of clause 14, which I believe took place a 
considerable time ago, and whether it still has any active supporters. I think that the answer to the 
second question is that it has no supporters. The reason for the clause takes us back to a time before I 
was able to achieve something in this field as a member of the previous Administration and before the 
Minister was in turn able to achieve something. The world has moved forward on firework safety 
across two consecutive Administrations.
<P>
Clause 14 represents an historic attempt by those whose slogan was that if central Government 
would not do anything, municipalities should be empowered to do so. As central Government have 
now acted, we do not need to leave miscellaneous powers in the hands of local authorities—not that I 
have anything against local authorities; I served in local government for 15 years and it is a vital part 
of our constitution. Mentioning the word constitution leads me to remark that—as you, Mr. Atkinson, 
know better than any other member of the Committee—we have no written constitution, we have a 
series of conventions. I would defend that state of affairs, but we are not here today to discuss that.
<P>
One of those conventions is that a citizen of this country is deemed to know the law. That is a 
rather harsh discipline, which has the important consequence that ignorance of the law is no defence. 
That is a tough discipline on the citizens of this country—they are deemed to know the law and to say 
that one did not know what was the law is no defence.
<P>
Given that that is the position, to have the law change every time one crosses a borough 
boundary appears oppressive. The law should be consistent across the land, in fairness to both the 
citizen, who is deemed to know the law and the enforcing authorities. I have it on good authority that 
there are five municipalities in west Yorkshire—speaking without notes, I believe that they are Leeds, 
Wakefield, Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale. They have wisely combined to form a single trading 
standards authority operating across five boroughs. As the enforcement authority, it is entitled to a 
clear path to any offences.
<P>
It would be perverse to have five different sets of byelaws for a single trading standards 
department to enforce. That would not merely offend against my first principle, my making it too hard 
for the citizen to know what is the law, it would offend against my second principle that the law must 
be clear and enforceable, and that enforcing agencies must have a clear path to the offence.
<P>
So the removal of the clause recommends itself on those two counts, but also for the avoidance of 
farce. Most of us who represent urban constituencies will know of boundaries with next-door 
municipalities that are the centre line of a road. The parliamentary constituency of Solihull has a 
boundary with the constituency of Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath. The dividing line is the 
mid-line of a road. My municipality is Solihull metropolitan borough council; the authority on the 
other side of the road is Birmingham city council. If clause 14 survives, those two authorities could 
come to completely different views. One set of firework regulations could apply on one side of the 
road and another set on the other side. It is not inconceivable that a rocket set off on one side of the 
road could land on the other side. I believe that in the counties of California, such problems have 
arisen.
<P>
The clause will create a potential farce—at worst, a potential tragedy, at the very least a potential 
misunderstanding—that is wholly avoidable. The Secretary of State will have adequate powers under 
the Bill. It is otiose to deal out a second set of miscellaneous powers which might become capricious. 
That would not serve the best interests of our citizens or of the Bill. Therefore, clause 14 should not 
stand part of the Bill and, consequently, amendment No. 2 should be agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I very much welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee. His knowledge 
of firework safety issues is invaluable to us all. I pay tribute to him for his work in introducing the 
Firework (Safety) Regulations 1996, on which I have been able to build. I think that the Committee 
will be moved by the force of his argument.
<P>
Last year, the Government ensured that the minimum age for purchasing fireworks was raised 
from 16 to 18. That helps our colleagues in local authorities better to enforce the regulations, and 
makes it much more difficult for younger teenagers to get hold of fireworks. It is inconceivable that 
we should allow one council to operate a more lax enforcement regime under the byelaws than 
another. Of course, it would be wrong if any of those provisions were undermined by one local 
authority choosing not to enforce them as vigorously as another.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> Mr. Atkinson, you will remember that I asked a question about local 
authorities and impositions. In considering such matters, I realised that I could not oppose the 
amendment because I have long argued for such laws. I have no difficulty with the House agreeing, as 
it has in the past, to diverse laws affecting Scotland and other parts of the kingdom.
<P>
Having said that, while the hon. member for Solihull was speaking, I remembered a young man 
who was in my congregation when I was active in parish work, not elected to Parliament. He bought 
fireworks in England because he thought it would be wonderful to have them for his children. When 
he was coming off the Stranraer-Larne ferry, the authorities stopped him for having fireworks, which 
was against the law of Northern Ireland, and he was convicted. Thank God, that did not blemish his 
character—he later became a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and is now in a thriving 
business. The point is that, because of ignorance of the law of Northern Ireland, he bought fireworks 
in one part of the kingdom and thought that he could use them for his family in another part of the 
kingdom.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A subsequent aspect of that story is that the headmaster of a local school thought that young 
people were growing up without experiencing firework displays. He approached that lad’s mother, 
who was a local shopkeeper, to find out whether she could organise something. She spoke to me, and 
the three of us organised a festival, including firework displays, in the sports stadium. It was under 
control, the security forces participated and it was a wonderful evening. The point is that, as the hon. 
Member for Solihull said, ignorance of the law did not excuse that young man’s actions. Although he 
was thinking of his family and had enjoyed fireworks as a boy, he could no longer do so. It is in that 
context that I support amendment No. 2.

Bill, as amended, to be reported.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we adjourn, may I compliment the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton on 
the way in which she has presented her Bill? All members of the Committee know that piloting a 
private Member’s Bill through the House is a daunting task, especially for a new Member. A great 
deal of work had to be done behind the scenes. I compliment her on the way that she has done it.
