discussed on Tuesday, the ombudsman has the power to waive the form and
date limits on the complaint, if he wishes. I can see no obligation in
the Bill for him to give reasons for choosing not to take forward a
complaint. As the complaints procedure is intended to be taken up by
the ombudsman&#151;whose usual approach is primarily focused on
maladministration&#151;it is fair that he should give reasons where
he &#147;chooses not to disapply&#148; the rules on form and
content. Our amendment would place such a responsibility on the
ombudsman, which would be good practice, in any case. I hope the
Minister will confirm that when complaints are not taken forward,
complainants will be given the reasons
why.</div><a name="09062579000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062579000156"></a><b class="B">The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mike</b><b class="B">
</b><b class="B">O'Brien):</b><b class="B"> </b>The powers in the Bill to disapply
the specified requirements mirror those in the legislation governing
complaints about local authority social services. Those arrangements
work well. The ombudsman operates a flexible approach, often using his
discretionary powers for the benefit of the complainant. Every
complaint involves a dialogue between the ombudsman and the complainant
at an early stage. It would be apparent very early, through this
process of dialogue, whether disapplying the specified requirements was
necessary. As that dialogue already occurs, an additional requirement
to explain a decision not to disapply in writing seems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>unnecessary. The aim and practice is that by the time the dialogue has
been completed, the complainant is aware of why a decision has been
made. That is how things have operated up to now and we want that
process to continue to apply.</div>

Commissioner&#146;.</div><a name="09062579000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000160"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The Bill
states:</div><a name="09062579000129"></a>&#147;Every
investigation under this Part is to be conducted in
private.&#148;<a name="09062579000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has resonances of yesterday&#146;s motion on the Floor of the House.
Will the Minister explain to the Committee how far that extends? What
does &#147;this Part&#148; refer to? Is it just the new clauses
before us? Surely the ombudsman should be given the freedom to decide
whether to conduct investigations in public or private. Is he not able
to make that decision? In the week that the Government are feeling a
touch of the heat about matters such as this, I hope they will regard
the ombudsman as having discretion to make that decision more freely
than is apparent in the
Bill.</div><a name="09062579000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commissioner has only civil powers of compulsion, but amendment 105
seeks to enable him to obtain, through a judge, the powers of
compulsion used in criminal actions, that is not just over people, but
over documents, too. Dredging into my past practice as an international
commercial litigator and arbitrator, I remember that it was enormously
helpful in civil cases to be able to apply to a judge to seize
documents under an Anton Piller order, or a subpoena duces tecum. Those
concepts will be familiar to the Minister. At present, it appears that
the ombudsman has no powers to obtain the sort of evidence that might
be required to ensure that this as a complaints procedure, rather than
as a referred, typical ombudsman&#146;s procedure, will give the
necessary satisfaction. Without the opportunity for compulsion, the
appeals process and the complaints process will not carry with them the
confidence that all the evidence necessary in order to ensure that a
complaint is properly heard and adjudicated upon is available, and that
the process is sufficiently robust to be worthwhile, rather than simply
avoiding putting a whole separate complaints process in place and
parking it with the ombudsman. This is a bit of a test as to how
truthfully 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>the scheme is intended to operate, without the powers of compulsion with
which the Minister, in terms of legal concepts, will be
familiar&#151; this balance between the normal powers of compulsion
within the criminal court where, of course, the burden of proof is of a
much higher standard than in the civil courts. This seems to relate to
a more voluntary, civil-type arrangement, and even in the civil courts,
rather than in the case of the ombudsman, as referred to here, there is
a danger that, without the powers of compulsion that I would expect to
have been able to use in relation to a civil action, the
ombudsman&#146;s role and remit could be unnecessarily severely
limited.</div>
<a name="09062579000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000161"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The current local authority scheme operated
by the ombudsman under part 3 of the Local Government Act 1974 contains
exactly the same provision for investigations to be conducted in
private. It is generally also the case with other public service
ombudsmen&#146;s investigations.</div>
<a name="09062579000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our
aims in these provisions is to mirror, where appropriate, the
procedures that apply to the local authority scheme. Of course, if
there are any good reasons for a different approach, we will listen to
them. In the case of investigations being conducted in private,
however, I do not think there should be any difference between the two
schemes.</div>
<a name="09062579000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
also sound arguments in favour of investigations being conducted
privately in relation to these matters. For example, the matters
complained about may be to do with health or care and may be of a
confidential or personal nature. The effectiveness of the scheme is, to
a large extent, dependent on how well it enables the ombudsman to get
to the truth of the matter. This means that procedures that encourage
the giving of accurate evidence are important. If there was a
requirement to hold investigations in public, that might hinder
openness on the part of some witnesses.</div>
<a name="09062579000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ombudsman&#146;s procedures are not like a court of law. They are
meant to be flexible and effective, capable of being carried out
speedily, and they are designed to bring out the salient features as
efficiently as possible, to allow the ombudsman to reach a conclusion
as reasonably expeditiously as possible. While it is possible for
witnesses to have legal representation, the ombudsman aims to regulate
the investigation and to ensure that it does not become costly,
bureaucratic, or unduly cumbersome. I fear, however, that is exactly
what would happen if investigations were to be held publicly. I
therefore believe that it is entirely appropriate that we should keep
the ombudsman&#146;s operation in a particular area without trying to
apply to it a whole list of legalistic concepts that may have a real
relevance in a court of law, but which would undermine the very nature
of the ombudsman&#146;s role.</div>
<a name="09062579000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 105
seeks to allow the ombudsman to apply to the High Court for a judge to
use the powers of the court in relation to evidence. There are certain
powers here anyway for the ombudsman. In the proposed new section 34G,
the ombudsman has the same powers as the High Court to compel the
attendance and examination of witnesses and production of documents.
This means that anyone not complying with a reasonable request of an
ombudsman may be in contempt of court and subject to the penalties
associated with it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="09062579000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a person
obstructs an investigation, or is guilty of an act or omission in
relation to an investigation, which could constitute contempt of court
in proceedings in the High Court, the ombudsman may certify this as an
offence to the High Court. The High Court then would deal with the
person charged as though they had committed the same offence in
relation to the High Court.</div>
<a name="09062579000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eddisbury proposes to make further remedies available to the
ombudsman, which would enable him to take steps beyond those he is
currently able to take. I am concerned that, if we start to extend
significantly the powers of the ombudsman in this area alone, the real
risk is that we import into it a whole series of legal concepts, which
operate perfectly well in the courts, which are designed to protect
those affected by the powers and remedies. However, in the context of
the ombudsman&#146;s investigation, it could become extremely
legalistic, resulting in the ombudsman being judicially reviewed on all
sorts of decisions before the High Court, as well as delaying things
substantially, adding to the cost of the ombudsman, and failing to
fulfil the whole basis of the speedy review and examination of issues
that the ombudsman was intended to facilitate.</div>
<a name="09062579000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the good will and genuine intentions of the hon. Gentleman to enhance
the powers of the ombudsman, the fear is that with those remedies and
powers would come a significant examination of legal detail as well as
importing legal procedures that would be unduly cumbersome. I hope
that, having expressed those concerns, the hon. Gentleman will be able
to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09062579000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062579000162"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Horam</b> (Orpington) (Con): I understand where the
Minister is coming from on amendment 70. He seeks to mirror the
original legislation because otherwise the process might become
burdensome and difficult. He has already simplified the procedure for
hearing complaints by cutting out one of the processes and we are now
down to two, so the burdensome argument does not really
apply.</div>
<a name="09062579000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wonder
whether this is an issue that, in this day and age, would be helped, in
some part, by being held in public. I have a recent personal experience
of these procedures where a resident in Bromley took up with the
ombudsman the behaviour of some of the chief executives of the Bromley
hospitals trust&#151;there have been several chief executives
recently. He tried to obtain information about their procedures and the
way they handled business. What happened in practice was a prolonged
exchange of letters, which was very unsatisfactory. The complainant
felt that every letter contained an element of misrepresentation or
inaccuracy that he had to correct. It went backwards and forwards
endlessly, becoming a prolonged procedure that other people eventually
got involved in. Eventually, it was brought to an end by the ombudsman,
who said, &#147;This is my final decision and I will not take any
more evidence.&#148; In many ways, it would have been better if there
had been a short hearing, where the applicant could have challenged
some of the points made by the ombudsman and his representative. In
fact, it might have been quicker in the end because there would have
been a question and answer session, rather than repeatedly sending
letters backwards and forwards. I take the point that my hon. Friend
the Member for Eddisbury made about what happened on the Floor
yesterday, and I wonder whether, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>in this day and age, we need to move forward a bit and at least give the
ombudsman the possibility of taking this course of action where he
feels it may be appropriate.</div>
<a name="09062579000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000163"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Rather interestingly, I had expected to
find myself being satisfied with the Minister&#146;s answer on
amendment 70 and dissatisfied with that on amendment 105. In fact, it
has turned out to the contrary. The answer we had on amendment 105 has
been helpful. It seeks to give the necessary strength to the process,
but to the extent that powers are described in proposed new section 34G
of the Local Government Act 1974, the Minister was able to highlight
that there is the appropriate appeal in the contempt process of the
High Court. This probably gives the power that we need behind these
measures in order to make the compulsion process likely to take place
in reality.</div>
<a name="09062579000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to amendment 70, my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington made the point
well in the example he gave. The Minister referred to the need to
retain flexibility, but that is exactly what the amendment seeks to
provide. New section 34F(2)
states:</div><a name="09062579000126"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
investigation under this Part is to be conducted in
private.&#148;</div><a name="09062579000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sought to suggest, as the amendment shows, that</div>
<a name="09062579000127"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Local Commissioner may choose to conduct an investigation under this
part in
private.&#148;</div><a name="09062579000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
would therefore be a presumption. The point about flexibility is
therefore better served by our
amendment.</div><a name="09062579000131"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09062579000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062579000164"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Mike </b><b class="B">O'Brien:</b> Let me clarify what we mean by
&#147;in private&#148;. It is possible for the ombudsman to call
both parties into the room and have a discussion between them, so that
they can talk both to each other and to the ombudsman. In those
circumstances it is still in a sense a private discussion. So the
parties may, if the ombudsman were to choose to behave in that way, be
brought into a room with the ombudsman. That is not the way the
ombudsman system has worked up to now. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting
that we should import into one area only of the ombudsman system an
entirely different practice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000165"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The Minister is right to make that distinction.
The reason we are having this debate, even if this is effectively an
accretion to the ombudsman&#146;s traditional approach, is because
the ombudsman would be used as the complaints process for a new area of
activity. That is why this distinction needs to be made. The
Minister&#146;s comments are helpful in so far as they make it
explicit that the intent here is more of an arbitration type of
proceeding, as arbitrations are privately arranged. They park a dispute
and the relationships between the parties can carry on; as against
litigation where more or less everything comes to a general halt and
there is a contentious situation in the court.</div>
<a name="09062579000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As long as it

<a name="09062579000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
will take slightly longer than our canter through recent amendments. It
probes what happens if the ombudsman receives a complaint that he deems
serious enough for action to be taken immediately. We have termed these
&#147;immediate and urgent concerns&#148; and generously allowed
the Minister the liberty to set out what they might be in regulations.
It empowers the ombudsman to inform any or all of the CQC, the local
authorities, the police and the Secretary of State. The specifics on
the face of the Bill relate to issues that, as we all know from our
case work, have been particularly prevalent in the sector in the last
10 years, namely malnutrition, elder abuse and health care associated
infections.</div>
<a name="09062579000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the advisory group on malnutrition, malnutrition is an under-recognised
and under-treated problem. Evidence suggests that over one in 10 care
homes do not have a nutrition screening policy in place and
malnutrition has been found to affect one in three adults admitted to
care homes and an even greater proportion of people resident in
sheltered housing, even though NICE guidance published early in 2006
demands that people resident in care homes are screened when there is
clinical concern.</div>
<a name="09062579000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Malnutrition
in community settings is not being managed effectively. The case for
encouraging care homes to identify and manage malnutrition is
highlighted in the recent data from hospital episode statistics, which
reveal that the number of people being admitted to hospital with a
diagnosis of malnutrition has increased from 72,095 in 1997-98 to
148,946 in 2007-08&#151;a rise of 107 per cent. over that
period. This suggests that the nutritional care people receive in
community settings such as care homes is deteriorating, meaning that a
greater number of people require hospitalisation. The guidance will
help address this situation by encouraging a focus on nutritional care
by adult social care providers.</div>
<a name="09062579000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
mortality from malnutrition is on the rise. The hospital episodes
statistics data is reinforced by figures obtained through parliamentary
questions, which reveal that 263 people died in care institutions,
including care homes, in 2007 from malnutrition&#151;a  9 per
cent. increase over 1998 levels. The guidance our amendment proposes
could help by stipulating that a death from malnutrition in an
institution is an issue of immediate and urgent concern, requiring
action by either the Care Quality Commission, the commissioning local
authority, the police, or the Secretary of State. Rather than go
further into the elder abuse issue, with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>which Members throughout the House are terribly familiar&#151;and I
use the word &#147;terribly&#148; advisedly, as it has been a real
shock to us all to find out just how much elder abuse there has
been&#151;I shall move on to health care associated infections. A
good series of campaigns is highlighting elder abuse, and many of us
are doing our best to focus on it and see improvements.</div>
<a name="09062579000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all
aware of the Government&#146;s performance on HCAIs in hospitals,
which, it has been argued over many years, is not creditable. The
latest Health Protection Agency figures show that the number of
clostridium difficile cases went up by 6 per cent. in the last quarter,
while the number of MRSA cases went up by 2 per cent.&#151;although,
extraordinarily, the new Health Secretary boasted that he was
&#147;proud&#148; of the record on the day that those figures were
released.</div>
<a name="09062579000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear that
the figures expose the Government&#146;s complacency and their
failure to tackle that blight. Just two weeks ago, the National Audit
Office said that almost a quarter of hospitals still do not have
facilities to isolate patients with an infection to stop it spreading.
Instead of taking real action, the Department and the Government have
pursued measures such as the Prime Minister&#146;s flawed
deep-cleaning programme, which has turned out to be one of those deep
embarrassments.</div>
<a name="09062579000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
HCAIs are beginning to appear in community settings, particularly in
care homes. We have figures up to only 2005, so those are still small,
but they are rising significantly. Deaths from MRSA doubled from
0.02 per cent. to 0.04 per cent. of the care home population
between 2001 and 2005. Deaths from C. diff more than trebled over the
same period, from 0.03 per cent. to 0.11 per cent. Those
numbers are more significant if we posit a care home population of
300,000 to 400,000
people.</div><a name="09062579000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Action
on this is moving faster across the Atlantic. In fact, this month
nursing homes in the eastern regions of Pennsylvania began reporting
healthcare associated infections to the state&#146;s Patient Safety
Authority through the Pennsylvania patient safety reporting system.
Legislation signed as long ago as July 2007 made that reporting
mandatory.</div>
<a name="09062579000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
mechanisms will be put in place to enable the ombudsman to take or
alert others to take swift action where necessary? If none, I hope that
the Minister will accept our amendment. I also hope that he will
explain how the Government are acting on health care associated
infections, on elder abuse, obviously, and on malnutrition in the care
sector, as those are clearly pertinent, powerful and distressing
examples. We hope that the complaints procedure, which to some degree
picks up on the power that was lost when community health councils were
scrapped, because they had the ability to look across the system as
well as down into individual complaints, will bring benefit to urgent
and immediate policy
action.</div>
<a name="09062579000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000167"></a>Mr.
Horam:</b> My experience is that the statistics for MRSA and
C. difficile are very late. The current situation is usually nine
months previous, which is one reason that we need to react quickly. I
have constantly found that when looking at the situation, one is
talking about figures that came out nine months ago. That really is
unsatisfactory and I understand that there are reasons for it; it is
not easy to pinpoint those things in accurate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>and timely ways. None the less, when it is apparent that the situation
in a hospital is sliding, we need to take urgent
action.</div>
<a name="09062579000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000168"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I looked at this issue with some care, and
was initially tempted to take the matter back and consider it for
Report. The hon. Member for Eddisbury has put his case in a politically
contentious way, and I certainly refute his suggestion that there is
any complacency about issues of abuse, malnutrition or infection. Those
are all serious matters that the Government, certainly, take seriously;
institutions like the Care Quality Commission were set up to deal with
them. It is precisely because we take those issues seriously that we
took legislation through to set up an organisation like the
CQC.</div>
<a name="09062579000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept
entirely that action needs to be taken to deal with incidents of abuse,
malnutrition and infection, which occur from time to time and must be
tackled without delay where discovered. Under new section 34P, the
ombudsman may provide information to the Care Quality Commission if
that information appears to be relevant to the CQC&#146;s
responsibilities. He can do so as soon as he receives a complaint. He
does not have to wait or investigate; he just sends the information.
The thing about the CQC is that it has the powers to take immediate
action. That includes alerting the independent safeguarding authority
as well as taking direct action such as closing a care home
immediately, for example. Action can be taken.</div>
<a name="09062579000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why the local
authority, the police or indeed the Secretary of State would be more
appropriate needs explanation, as they do not have the regulatory
powers and responsibilities of the Care Quality Commission. The
Secretary of State, for example, does not have a role in regulating
social care directly; that role has been given to the Care Quality
Commission. Similarly, local authorities have a role in commissioning
care but not in its regulation. Action such as closing a care home is
for the CQC, not the local authority.</div>
<a name="09062579000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
informing the police, that is essentially a decision for the
complainant. They might make a conscious choice to complain to the
ombudsman rather than the police, but the ombudsman may always suggest
to a complainant that a matter needs to be brought to the attention of
the police or, alternatively, the CQC. If appropriate&#151;if
prosecution is needed, or a particular aspect of the case requires
police investigation&#151;the CQC is there, and its job is to refer
such matters and ensure that they are dealt with effectively. We have
set up a body to which the ombudsman can go to ensure that the
necessary action is taken.</div>
<a name="09062579000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Orpington raised a reasonable concern about statistics being
delayed for months or, on occasion, for a year or more. That is a
matter of frustration for Ministers as well as for him. He will be
aware that many times, Ministers get only a day&#146;s notice of
statistics becoming publicly available, so we often have only a limited
chance to look at them. We share his frustration about that, but why
does it happen? Because statistics must be collated, validated,
cross-checked and peer group-assessed, and then conclusions must be
drawn from them. Often, that takes time and is a matter for debate
within the organisations providing such data, which often seek peer
group validation.</div>
<a name="09062579000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
takes time. That is, I fear, the price of having reliable statistics.
The delay causes some of the problems that the hon. Member for
Orpington identified, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>but I am not entirely sure how we might overcome them. He is right to
raise the issue and make that complaint, and I share his frustration to
some extent, but I do not really have a way to provide him with a
remedy, unless we want less reliable
statistics.</div><a name="09062579000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062579000169"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): We all share that frustration with
delayed statistics, because they give us less opportunity for scrutiny,
but does the Minister accept that most good trusts have the statistics
straight away? They spot emerging trends and take action to find out
what is going on and work through it. We need to put that on the
record; otherwise, we might come to the conclusion that it is only when
MPs start making a noise that action is taken, which is rarely the
case. Action has usually been taken by the time we investigate, except
in rare
cases.</div><a name="09062579000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000170"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Lady is absolutely right, and I am
grateful to her for putting that on the record. Most trusts take action
in relation to statistics that they become aware of privately, before
validation, peer group assessment and publication. She is right to
point out that it is only where some sort of failure has occurred that
MPs must start voicing concerns. I hope that I have given reassurance
that the powers for the ombudsman to deal with an abuse that comes
before him are indeed available in the Bill and more generally through
the
CQC.</div><a name="09062579000132"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am grateful to the Minister, who made the important and valid point
that proposed new section 34P makes possible immediate reporting to the
CQC and the independent safeguarding authority. That is helpful, as is
the extension to the police&#151;although there is nothing to stop
anyone relaying information at any point to the police&#151;and the
Secretary of State. In many ways it was helpful to explore that. The
Minister rightly observed, in his answer to the hon. Member for Romsey
and to my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington, the timeliness of
statistical information coming out, so that action can be taken in a
timely way, based on knowledge of the evidence base. That has been
useful, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062579000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000174"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> In the Bill as drafted, specifically in proposed
new section 34H(4), the ombudsman is limited to making recommendations
with respect to action that the provider should take. However, it seems
clear that in some circumstances action taken, or not taken, by
individuals working for the provider&#151;rather than the
provider&#151;and other individuals and agencies will have a bearing
on the complaint. By allowing recommendations to be made to the
provider &#147;or any other person&#148;, our amendment would allow
the ombudsman to make more far-reaching recommendations if and when
necessary. In particular, a complaint might arise from circumstances in
which the CQC, the local authority or even the Government should have
been responsible. The ombudsman should have the power to make
recommendations to them in such
situations.</div><a name="09062579000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the Alberti and Colin-Thom√(c) reports into the recent
tragedy at Stafford were prevented from addressing
Government-inspired&#151;some would argue&#151;or
otherwise-inspired systemic failings other than by legislation, but if
there were conflicts of interest, the same principle would apply. One
of the things that has been shocking about the Stafford situation,
which all of us have been wrestling with and trying to understand, is
why on earth, despite all the encouragement of and the law on
whistleblowing, the nurses, for instance, did not get together in the
canteen and decide that it was time to blow the whistle. Some kind of
fear factor appeared to be at play. The system did not operate as
intended under a series of legislative and regulatory measures from
this place. We must all continue to wrestle with the question of how we
create that confidence to come together and provide
information.</div><a name="09062579000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will be able to reflect and explain why the
ombudsman is at the moment limited in that respect. Perhaps our
amendment would help ensure the removal of such a
limitation.</div><a name="09062579000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000175"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Our aim with the new scheme is, as far as
possible, to be consistent with the existing provisions in the 1974
Act, which govern the ombudsman&#146;s handling of local authority
complaints. In those provisions the ombudsman&#146;s recommendations
can apply only to the local authority. In the new scheme they can apply
only to the adult social care provider. The ombudsman&#146;s
recommendations are intended to be a response based on conclusions
reached in the investigation of a complaint about the adult social care
provider. Such complaints are not complaints about the local authority.
Indeed, if they were, they would fall to be dealt with by the existing
scheme under part 3 of the 1974 Act. The ombudsman is not dealing with
complaints about the Care Quality Commission, the Secretary
of State or the Department of Health. That is why we have provided
under the Bill for the ombudsman&#146;s recommendations to apply only
to the provider. That does not mean that if the ombudsman takes a view
that there are concerns that ought properly to be drawn to the
attention of others, that cannot be done, particularly when it comes to
the Care Quality Commission, local authorities or central
Government.</div><a name="09062579000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill enables the ombudsman&#146;s statements to be sent to a local
authority or to the CQC. Both already have a strong interest in acting
on matters that are brought to their attention in that way. It would
merely add to the ombudsman&#146;s administrative responsibilities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>to require formal recommendation to be made to them and to be responded
to in a formal
way.</div><a name="09062579000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CQC and local authorities have a direct interest in individual cases,
but the Secretary of State also has an interest in the wider picture.
He needs to reach a strategic view about services and he is assisted in
that process by the provision under proposed new section 34R, which
requires the ombudsman to conduct a periodic review of the scheme and
to convey to Departments and the CQC any recommendations or conclusions
that he has reached about how it operates. In the circumstances, we can
leave it to the ombudsman to determine whether he needs to go further
in relation to such
matters.</div><a name="09062579000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to go into the distressing issues in respect of Mid
Staffordshire that the hon. Member for Eddisbury raised. They are of
substantial concern and there have been, as he knows, two important
investigations into the matter. We need to look at how in the future
the ombudsman will deal with individual issues that are drawn to his or
her attention. In the case of Mid Staffordshire, there were issues in
relation to the staff not bringing the matters out early enough. We
want it to be possible for that to happen, but we must also recognise
that, if the ombudsman is to investigate anything, he needs to have
something drawn to his attention. It is only then that the ombudsman
will become
involved.</div><a name="09062579000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a sense, the ombudsman does not deal with the concerns that he
expressed about Mid Staffordshire, but when a complaint has indeed been
made, he then needs to determine how he will deal with it and ensure
that other appropriate organisations respond to their duties. We want
to follow the existing provisions under the 1974 Act, whereby the
ombudsman can, if he feels it appropriate, draw to the attention of the
Government any concerns that he might have in relation to the powers,
so that they can consider whether any appropriate action is necessary.
On that basis, I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09062579000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000176"></a>Mr.

Parliament in whose constituency any person concerned under section
34H(6) lives or
works.&#146;.</div><a name="09062579000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
the ombudsman would have to send a copy of the statement of
recommendations for the provider to the CQC and the local authority.
Obviously, that is not the same as making recommendations about them.
Amendment 75 would see that a copy was sent to relevant local MPs, too.
As we all know from our case loads, such complaints are naturally
within the purview and sometimes the preserve of MPs, and it seems
sensible that local and relevant MPs should be kept in the loop. I hope
that the Minister considers the amendment to be
helpful.</div><a name="09062579000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000178"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The complainant might not wish his MP to see
the complaint if it is a matter of privacy. Under the current scheme,
the ombudsman can supply copies of statements and another information
to Members of Parliament on request. That seems the right approach. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>I believe that it works perfectly well, and we need to be cautious about
interfering with a process that seems to work reasonably well. Hon.
Members can obtain information on cases. They are aware of that, for
example, when they have correspondence on the matter with constituents.
However, intruding an MP into what may be a personally felt case, where
a report is shared between people on a confidential basis, may not be
what the individual wants. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
his
amendment.</div><a name="09062579000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000179"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I am curious about the argument. Listening
carefully, I think the Minister makes an interesting point. Sadly, it
is also the case that some constituents will only go to an MP of one
party. I have had such an experience. I inherited some work from my
late predecessor, Michael Colvin, and people did not want to talk to me
about it. By contrast, there would have been people who would not have
gone to him for his political views either. It is a sad reflection that
people think that we are politicised when we are in Parliament, but
nevertheless, that is the way some constituents seem to prefer to
behave.</div><a name="09062579000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000180"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Lady makes a valid point. It
reinforces my argument that the amendment is not
appropriate.</div><a name="09062579000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000181"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I take the point about privacy
seriously&#151;it is an important point made by the Minister.
Equally, I think that the point that the hon. Member for Romsey made,
regarding the perception that once elected, we serve all our
constituents, irrespective of whether people voted for our
party&#151;or if it turns out that they did not vote at all&#151;is
also important; we should recognise that there is the other side. I
accept the Minister&#146;s response, and I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062579000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

his reasons, in writing, to the Secretary of
State.&#146;.</div><a name="09062579000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks some accountability for the ombudsman when he decides
not to identify individuals. I just hope that the Minister is able to
expand a little on the previous answer and give us some examples as to
when he envisages that privacy should occur. To some degree, he has
already answered it, so maybe there will only be a brief
response.</div><a name="09062579000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000183"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The ombudsman would normally want to name
the provider in a statement because it is in the public
interest&#151;there will be a public statement on the
ombudsman&#146;s conclusion on a complaint. The provision in the Bill
is therefore worded to allow the statement to identify the provider
wherever possible. But it also recognises that there may be human
rights issues in doing so, such as when there are risks to the privacy
of the individual provider. There are providers who may be close to an
individual, and others may have a long-term relationship with the
individual.</div><a name="09062579000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, there are more likely to be circumstances where the
ombudsman will want to ensure that an individual service user cannot be
identified as a result of naming the provider in the statement. In a
small care home with only 100 or so residents, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>identification of the provider may allow others to work out who the
individuals affected in the case are. Of course, the complainant may
actively wish the provider to be named and not be concerned about being
identified.</div><a name="09062579000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not envisage that the discretion available to the ombudsman will
mean that he will decide in every case that it is appropriate for a
provider or another person to be identified as a result. The point of
the provision is that the ombudsman can decide on the basis of the
merits of a particular case. We give him that discretion because it
would be difficult to make provision for all the precise circumstances
where identification is or is not appropriate. Leaving it to the
ombudsman in those cases is the best way
forward.</div><a name="09062579000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000184"></a>Mr.

try to ascertain why the particular time frames have been chosen in the
two cases concerned. In the schedule, the provider will be given a
month to notify the ombudsman of the action it plans to take in
response to his recommendations. Amendment 77 would reduce that to a
week&#151;a month can seem a rather long time in the tough
circumstances, particularly of serious complaints. I hope it will give
the Minister the opportunity to explain the thinking behind the time
frames. It is also important to note that that is the time for a
response, not time for action to be taken. I hope that the Minister
will recognise that there may be a difference between the
two.</div>
<a name="09062579000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 78
relates to the period of warning the Government get that the ombudsman
is about to release previously unpublished Government information. As
currently drafted, the ombudsman can publish after a month, or sooner
with written consent; so the question arises as to why the Department
needs a month&#146;s notice. I would have thought that a week would
be sufficient, particularly given the move to transparency. I hope that
the Minister takes the amendments in the constructive spirit in which
they are
intended.</div><a name="09062579000133"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000188"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Three months is allowed for a local council
under part 3 of the 1974 Act. I do not believe that that long is needed
for a social care provider, which typically will have fewer processes
to go through than a local authority. More importantly, processes of
fairness require that the provider have adequate time but not too much
time. It is about getting the balance right.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div><a name="09062579000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provider
should not be placed under undue time pressure to respond. He will
often need to consult staff, check records and take other action that
it would be impossible to do effectively within, say, a week. Normally
the provider would need to decide what action to take to improve the
service and remedy any inconvenience, suffering or financial injustice
that a complainant has experienced. To ensure that the
ombudsman&#146;s recommendations are met, the provider cannot
reasonably be expected to consider such matters in a
week.</div><a name="09062579000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that this is only a probing amendment. It is certainly not
in the interests of the scheme as a whole if providers cannot respond
properly to recommendations. I hope that explains why we have reduced
the time from three months to one month, and why we felt that reducing
it further would not be
appropriate.</div><a name="09062579000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the period that the ombudsman must give a Government Department if
he proposes to use Government information, this is in essence about
disclosure of information. The relationship between a Government
Department and the ombudsman is important. The ombudsman may wish to
cite Government information in order to offer complete responses to
complainants, and the provision is worded to enable that to
happen.</div><a name="09062579000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that a month is reasonable to allow the Department time to
consult internally and to give adequate consideration to the
implications of the information&#146;s publication. A shorter period
could have a detrimental impact on the quality of response. We want to
ensure that the information that the Government are providing can be
collated, examined and checked for accuracy. If the data are available
in a non-collated form, they need to be collated, brought together,
checked for accuracy, peer reviewed and examined. Trying to squeeze
that into a month could be
difficult.</div><a name="09062579000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
we also want to ensure that if information is provided, it is directly
relevant. Checking the detailed local relevance may be important in
some cases. I hope that we have got the balance right. It was with a
view to doing so that the provisions were put in
place.</div><a name="09062579000099"></a>

Commission&#146;.</div><a name="09062579000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill makes provision for the local government commissioner to consult
with the Parliamentary Commissioner or Health Service Commissioner, or
his equivalents in Wales and Scotland. Our amendment seeks to add the
Care Quality Commission to the list. As it is the registration,
inspection and regulatory body, surely such consultation should be
enabled.</div><a name="09062579000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000191"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The relationship between the ombudsman and
the CQC is important. The Bill allows the ombudsman to send copies of
his statements to the CQC and also to send any information at any date
if it appears relevant to the CQC&#146;s functions. Findings by the
ombudsman are often indicators of poor service and performance, which
impacts on the suitability of a provider to be registered, and the CQC
can then take action to deregister a provider.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div><a name="09062579000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CQC will
need to take account of concerns, complaints and allegations when
determining whether services are being safely provided and are of
appropriate quality. Such intelligence will feed into the risk
assessments that the commission will make when determining the level of
scrutiny that it should apply to a particular provider. The commission
will also have the freedom to investigate a case if it has concerns
that the health, safety or welfare of patients or service users is or
may be at
risk.</div><a name="09062579000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
look to the CQC and the ombudsman to agree arrangements between
themselves as to how best complaints data can be fed from the ombudsman
into the CQC&#146;s registration assurance systems. Those operational
details are, of course, best left to the organisations to work out. I
believe that there is sufficient provision in the Bill to ensure the
appropriate level of interaction and collaboration between the two
bodies. They will have obligations put on them. Let us allow them to
work out the best ways of putting detailed implementation in
place.</div><a name="09062579000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000195"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> These are probing amendments. Amendment 80
removes the need to obtain consent. Why has the ombudsman not been
given the discretion to decide that himself and what would be the
factors involved in making and denying
consent?</div><a name="09062579000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
81 questions why there is an &#147;or&#148; in this schedule. It
seems that if you cannot get something from mum, then you should try
and get it from dad. The views of both parties should be sought and if
they do not agree then they should wait. If there is one thing that my
wife and I made a clear, early decision about when we had children, it
was that we should always back each other, even if we do not agree, so
that the children cannot divide and rule. To a large degree it has
stood us in good stead, so the same principle should apply
here.</div><a name="09062579000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062579000196"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Mike </b><b class="B">O'Brien:</b> What applies as a parent may

Yes, perhaps it should. It is important that the complainant is asked
for their consent before a joint investigation takes place. There may
be reasons that are not obvious to the ombudsman for the complainant
not wanting the investigation to be joint; there are also
considerations of data protection and human rights. To remove the
requirement for consent would be inconsistent with the joint
investigation provisions recently introduced in legislation covering
the parliamentary and health service commissioners. As we already have
it in one area, why should we change it? We should remember that the
ombudsman is acting for the complainant. In effect, it is the
complainant&#146;s right to ascertain their own wishes. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>They should have some control over the process. If the complainant
objects to a joint investigation, it would be illogical to override
that. The right of consent is critical for service users. We are
seeking to make complainants and people affected by complaints feel
more empowered and central to the resolution of these complaints. I
suspect that the hon. Gentleman does not want to take some of that
power away from individuals and give it to the ombudsman, and nor do I.
On that basis, I hope the hon. Gentleman is able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062579000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000197"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000199"></a>The

Commissioner may, in the Part 3A annual report, assess the costs of the

and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) the service

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062579000200"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The amendment seeks to include in the
ombudsman&#146;s review of its own activities a review of the nature
and content of complaints it has dealt with. Taking oral evidence
during the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill last year, Anna
Walker of the Health Commission pointed out the value of the regulator
inspector also having access to complaints data. The amendment would
give the public and policy makers an overview of the complaints being
made, so that similarities can be charted and solutions
explored.</div><a name="09062579000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
139 addresses the contents of the ombudsman&#146;s annual report. It
is worth having it on the record that the Government expect,
according to the regulatory impact assessment, each of the 800 to 1,000
complaints a year to cost the taxpayer &#163;1,500, through the
ombudsman, and the provider &#163;800. The RIA elaborates in
paragraph 21
that</div><a name="09062579000128"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is a possibility that providers will, depending on the state of the
care market, be able to pass on their additional costs to
commissioners&#151;probably mainly to people funding their own
care.&#148;</div><a name="09062579000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would seek to establish the breakdown of these costs every
year, in part to control rises in fees. I ask if the Minister is happy
that this measure would push up care home fees, which is the fear.
Could the Minister also confirm whether the local government ombudsman
has been voted the additional resources he needs&#151;about
&#163;1.5 million in the Department&#146;s estimate? There was a
real concern during the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill that
the Government declined at every point to discuss the extra resource
that the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>parliamentary and health service ombudsmen would need to deliver the
legislative requirements. We have since discussed that and found from
information provided by the ombudsmen that that has now been put in
place; that has been
helpful.</div><a name="09062579000120"></a>
