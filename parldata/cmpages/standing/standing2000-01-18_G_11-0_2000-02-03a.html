<H4><center>Clause 71</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disputed claims</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> At the end of our sitting this morning I was explaining why I believed that the clause should be part of the Bill. I reminded the Committee that it was drawn from section 79 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, and I was trying to reassure the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) that it was an aid rather than a hindrance. The RPA was introduced to safeguard political parties from false claims by political opponents. I was about to address the hon. Gentleman's concern that a loophole in the clause would allow disputed claims to arise, leading to avoidance and evasion. That is a real threat, and the hon. Gentleman is right to press the point.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has reminded the Committee on many occasions of the onerous responsibilities that are placed on the treasurer and deputy treasurer of a political party. He has been at pains to show that it is a difficult job and not one to be taken lightly. Again there are heavy responsibilities on the treasurer under the clause in respect of disputed claims. Clause 76 provides that he must make a return to the Electoral Commission and that it is a criminal offence if a treasurer does not act openly and honestly, but acts illegally. The treasurer must send the return in and state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the best of his knowledge and belief . . . it is a complete and correct return''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A person commits an offence if a false declaration is made.
<P>
That criminal sanction will lead to the avoidance of doubt: treasurers of political parties, whether big or small, will know the responsibilities that are placed on them and the threat of the law behind the Bill. There is, therefore, little possibility that clause 71 will be used as a loophole to avoid the claim. If the Electoral Commission suspects that avoidance and evasion are taking place, it can make inquiries. If its suspicions are confirmed, it is for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to bring the case to court. The Committee can feel safe in the knowledge that those extreme and rigorous sanctions will prevent treasurers and others from trying to use disputed claims as a loophole to avoid the regulations.
<P>
With that, I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause standing part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I shall not take long in replying. The Parliamentary Secretary has made some valid points, but Conservative Members believe that clauses 70 and 71 are linked. Therefore, having nailed our colours to the mast on clause 70, it will not come as a total surprise to him to discover that we shall nail our colours to the mast on clause 71, as otherwise we would be inconsistent in our approach to the problems that it causes.
<P>
I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his comments. Certainly they have clarified the issue and have been helpful.
<P>

<P>
Clause 71 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 72</center></H4>
<H4><center>Limits on campaign expenditure</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 47, leave out line 1.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 95, in page 47, line 2, leave out `or registered party'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The amendments return to the theme of offences. We question the legitimacy of placing the party in the position of being guilty of an offence.
<P>
On reading the clause, I thought that one could take comfort, as the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested in previous debates, from the Representation of the People Act 1983. I therefore referred to section 179 of that Act, but got little comfort from it. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any corrupt or illegal practice or any illegal payment employment or hiring, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any offence under section 110 above,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is committed by any association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated, the members of the association or body who have taken part in the commission of the offence shall be liable to any fine or punishment imposed for that offence by this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we apply that to the clause, the implication would be that the 330,000-odd members of the Conservative party would be guilty—[Interruption.] I hear comments of surprise from Labour Members. The Conservative party does not have 3.3 million affiliated trade union members: they pay their fees to the Labour party and do not come within the scope of the Bill. The 330,000 members of the Conservative party may be considered guilty, if the Electoral Commission decides to alight not on the person but on the registered party because, for instance it had paid an invoice that had not arrived on time.
<P>
However, the matter is not as clear as that, because clause 139 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where any other unincorporated association is guilty of an offence under this Act—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) every officer of the association who is bound to fulfil any duty of which the offence is a breach, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) if there is no such officer, every member of the committee or other similar governing body (other than a member who is proved to have been ignorant of, or to have attempted to prevent the commission of, the offence)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have a vision of the 330,000 Conservative party members queuing up in the Strand to argue that they were ignorant of the offence, or had tried to prevent it. That relates to my point this morning—we do not wish to enact legislation that is later proved to be deficient, so that those who have to implement it can turn round and say, ``The law is an ass!''
<P>
In earlier discussions, we talked about three key officers at the head of a political party—the leader, the nominating officer and the treasurer. We placed the responsibility on them, and especially on the treasurer. The treasurer can appoint a number of deputy treasurers—the Bill allows up to 12. The treasurer and deputy treasurers are the officers responsible for keeping within the limits on campaign expenditure, which is the subject of the clause. We talked at length this morning about some of the difficulties that the treasurer and deputy treasurers will have in trying to enforce some of the time limits imposed by the legislation.
<P>
This morning, I had a list from the Library of all 100 registered political parties, some of which are very small, and many are unknown to me—for example, the Tax-Avoid for the Self-Employed party and the Walked-Over-Women party. Even such small parties would be required to have a treasurer, as the Bill's grandfathering clause requires parties to be registered for six months. I do not want to reiterate this morning's debate, but if such a party embarked on a campaign, incurred expenditure in a remote part of the kingdom, failed to submit the invoice on time, and failed to make the payment on time, the treasurer of the party would have committed the offence. Why, therefore, are we talking about the party being guilty of an offence? The Representation of the People Act 1983 states that, if the party is guilty of the offence, every member of that party is guilty. In this Bill, if the party is guilty of the offence, it is the members of a committee or governing body or, failing that, all members who are guilty of the offence. That brings us back to the Representation of the People Act 1983 provisions. It is nonsense to put the responsibility on the 330,000 members of the Conservative party.
<P>
That might sound partisan. The Parliamentary Secretary might want to tell us the implications for the 3.3 million affiliated Labour party members, who are members of trade unions first and affiliated to the Labour party second.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. The clause that we are discussing is linked to clause 139(1). Any action taken against the party will not be against the three people that he named, or the 330,000 party members, it will be against the named party. His party's members, and the 3.3 million trade union affiliates of the Labour party, can sleep safely and soundly at night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary would provide me with some comfort. I am not sure that he has. I may, in a moment, defer to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, who may be able to interpret the law a little more clearly than I can, as I am not a lawyer. However, my reading of the Representation of the People Act is that if a body unincorporate is deemed guilty of an offence, that body is its members.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): My colleagues and I were pleased to see—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not allowed to refer to anyone in the Public Gallery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> It is clear that the hon. Gentleman will have received the approval of all hon. Members for saying very little, but saying it extremely well and at great length.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful for compliments and support from the other side of the Committee. I was also grateful for the support that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) gave us earlier this week in our deliberations on Northern Ireland. It is unfortunate that he was called away on urgent business when there was a Division on that question.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): Labour Members are enjoying my hon. Friend's speech, in which he seeks to protect the interests of all political parties, especially the smaller ones. If members of those smaller parties read the reports of the Committee proceedings, they will realise that the Conservative party is looking after their interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful suggestion.
<P>
I have referred to a number of smaller parties, several of which I had not heard of before. I shall not go through the whole list, which is in alphabetical order, lest I bore the Committee. However, it starts with the All-party Alliance against Brussels. I leave hon. Members to decide which parties might be in that alliance. The next two alliances are the Alliance party of Northern Ireland of which I have heard—and the Alliance for Democracy UK. The fourth party mentioned is the Alternative Labour List, to which I referred this morning. No one on the Labour Benches has yet provided me with information on the size of that party, although I suspect that it will grow as time progresses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): It is defunct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> It is still on the register, so I assume that it exists and will be grandfathered into the legislation. However, we have digressed.
<P>
I was not reassured by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I want to be clear about who would be guilty of this offence. He says that the party would be guilty. If there were to be a punishment, therefore, perhaps in the form of a fine, the party would suffer. However, the party is its members. As I have said, I am not a lawyer, but parties are not incorporated; they are not companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I invite the hon. Gentleman to read clause 139(1). I understand what he is saying, but he will see that at the end of subsection (1) the association is to be treated as a corporation. That tackles his point directly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Minister for pointing that out. I had already referred to clause 139, and I will let the corporate lawyers loose on its interpretation later. To treat an unincorporated body as if it were an incorporated body is difficult in law. An incorporated body has a separate legal locus, which an unincorporated body does not have. The court may treat it as if it were a corporation, but it is, none the less, the sum total of its members. My fear is that, if that were the interpretation of the courts, the members would become liable. I am not yet convinced that that subsection is a defence. If it were a defence, we would run into another serious problem, to which we referred earlier—political parties coming and going, being on the register and then disappearing from the register.
<P>
The Minister has raised the spectre of small political parties, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Democratic Alliance of Wales, committing offences during an election and, because it is the party that appears in court and can be convicted of whatever misdemeanour it is accused of, the party can then disband and the members can go off and form another party—perhaps the democratic alliance of Wales 2001 party. That provides the opportunity for evasion.
<P>
We have examined the legislation, and the basic thrust of the clauses—some of which we have disagreed with when they relate to offences—has been that the people who commit the offence are the responsible officers. To sidestep that now and to make the party and, by implication, the party's members responsible is like trying to hit a moving target. I prefer consistency in legislation.
<P>
We all have an interest in ensuring that the Bill is clear, transparent, and promotes financial propriety. To suggest now that the responsible of officer can say, ``Not me, guv, it was the party'', is not the way in which to proceed. The responsibility on officers and treasurers will be onerous, particularly when it goes down the line to deputy treasurers in the smaller parties such as the English National party, the Equal Parenting party, the Flaunt It.Net Internet party, the Hackney 1st party, the Green party, the Highlands and Islands Alliance, and so on. Those parties will all have the same responsibilities, and we must be able to identify the responsible person in each party. That person will be the man or woman whose name appears on the register with the Electoral Commission as the treasurer of that party. 
<P>
We have discussed who that person should be and the fact that he is a compliance officer who is responsible for ensuring that the party conducts its affairs correctly and in line with the legislation. It would be wise to remove from the provision reference to the party, whether corporate or unincorporate, committing an offence. I think that all our political parties are unincorporated associations, and it would be difficult to ask a court to treat them as if they were incorporated. A court would maintain that they were unincorporated and, as such, if an action were taken against an association, it could render all its members—be they the 330,000 members of the Conservative party or the 3.3 million affiliated members of the Labour party—liable for offences committed by a single person. Therefore, I commend both amendments to the Committee, and I hope that they will be incorporated in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall not repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) has said, but I want to focus on the issue of a political party being guilty of an offence, which has far-reaching implications. How have such matters been dealt with in the past? Will the clause set a precedent for the criminal liability of an unincorporated association?
<P>
It has been my, at times quite pleasant, lot in life to prosecute unincorporated associations as well as bodies corporate. A feature of the health and safety legislation with which I have tended to deal is that no explicit provision exists in relation to unincorporated associations. On a number of occasions, some rather strange things have occurred. For instance, the trustees of a great landed estate were prosecuted for an industrial injury involving a chain saw that occurred at a wood stall. At a Crown court in the middle of England, a top City solicitor, a Queen's Counsel and a senior partner in a firm of London accountants trotted into the dock and pleaded not guilty to charges relating to the chain saw incident, with which they had no direct connection. It was something of a pantomime.
<P>
To avoid such occurrences, there has been a tendency for mutual agreements to be reached between the prosecution and the defence. In such an agreement, the defence is told that the unincorporated association will be prosecuted in its own name, provided that the defence will not raise the matter as a point of law to try to nullify proceedings. Just before I was elected to Parliament, such a case arose, when a very large entity that registered ships' seaworthiness was prosecuted. It was concluded that, unless it was prosecuted under its own name, 346 members of its presiding committee—which, I believe, included the Duke of Edinburgh—would have to be indicted. That poses some interesting legal convolutions.
<P>
Clause 139—which I apologise mentioning, Mr. Maxton, but it is vital to our understanding of clause 72—makes specific provision for an unincorporated association to be prosecuted under its own name. That appears to be a sensible development. However, can the Minister tell us whether a political party has been singled out in legislation in this fashion before? If the Bill sets a precedent in that respect, the House may want to consider it as an issue of principle. It is the first time that I have encountered an unincorporated association being treated as a body corporate.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The next question that springs to mind relates directly to clause 72: why do we need to do this? Previous clauses place the onus firmly on the treasurer, and I cannot remember any reference being made during our earlier discussions to the culpability of a political party per se. Why does clause 72, which deals with the financial limits on campaign expenditure, shift the onus on to the party, given that previous clauses go to so much trouble to single out the treasurer as the person who is required to keep the entire finances of the party under control?
<P>
The next matter that puzzles me is that although the unincorporated association is treated as if it were the body corporate, clauses 138 and 139 provide that the potential liability of individuals differs from that of either corporate or unincorporated bodies. Clause 72 tells us that not only treasurers, but parties, should be responsible. Clause 139, which relates closely to clause 72, tells us not only that parties are liable, but that a party's officers, committee and—depending on the party's size—entire membership may also be liable. That troubles me, because clauses 138 and 139 clearly take a different view of culpability. One might almost argue as a consequence that it would be worthwhile for a party to become incorporated.
<P>
Clause 138(1) provides for the prosecution of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) any person who was purporting to act in such capacity''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if the offence has been committed with their consent or connivance or is attributable to any neglect on their part. Clause 139(7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where any other unincorporated association is guilty of an offence under this Act—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (a) every officer of the association who is bound to fulfil any duty of which the offence is a breach, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) if there is no such officer, every member of the committee or other similar governing body (other than the member who is proved to have been ignorant of, or to have attempted to prevent the commission of, the offence),<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall also be guilty of that offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those who drafted the Bill, perhaps displaying the ruthlessness that they sometimes apply to their task, apparently want to have it every which way. I do not see the point of criminalising a political party in clause 72 if, under clauses 138 and 139, individuals within that party, other than the treasurer, are to be exposed to draconian penalties that are much more severe—in terms of their chances of getting themselves off the hook—than those that are applied to an incorporated body with directors. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take that point as seriously as it was intended.
<P>
I am troubled by the way in which the Bill has been drafted, and I hope that the Government will explain how the parliamentary draftsmen went about their task. I fully understand that someone has to carry the can, but why not stick to the treasurer? If one believes that it is necessary to criminalise the actions of political parties and of treasurers, why does the proposal involve spreading the net so widely that it could catch officers and, potentially, members? If officers and committee members were prosecuted, it is not clear what the penalties would be. If a treasurer or deputy treasurer is prosecuted, the likely consequences, as we discussed earlier, are that he will not be able to fulfil his office or any office that will be regulated by the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) refrained from reading out the whole list of smaller parties, and I shall be guided by his approach, although it contains some esoteric names. If the committee of such a party were prosecuted, the party could effectively be destroyed because there might be no one in it who could satisfy the criteria that were necessary for it to continue to exist. That might sound unlikely, but it could happen and it is a possible threat to the democratic process.
<P>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will explain the background to this matter and assure us that the proposal is necessary and that it will work in practice.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I acknowledge at the outset that this is a serious issue and that we are in a new situation.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset rightly asked how the proposal linked with a section in the Representation of the People Act 1983. The Bill will put the focus for the first time on political parties. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton), who follows these matters closely, and other Committee members know that the focus was previously on individuals—it was on candidates and agents. There has been an enormous growth in recent years in the power of the political party, and the balance has changed from a local to a national level. Commentators discuss whether real political influence is found at the local or the national level, and at which level campaigns are won. It is clear that today the national—the party—level is the answer.
<P>
The Bill will rectify omissions that currently exist in the law. It is not possible to extend the Representation of the People Act 1983 into this part of the Bill, and new mechanisms will be brought into play. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked whether the situation was unique. I do not have a full answer for him yet, but the first part of my answer is to point out that there are no precedents for treating political parties in such a way.
<P>
I understand that there are similar precedents in other legislation, for which my officials are searching. If I have not received them by the time that I sit down, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on the matter. He is right to say that this is the first time that political parties have been identified and treated in such a way, because, as I have explained, this is a pioneering Bill.
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and we shall consider his points. In fairness to him, this is a difficult new area, and we want to be clear that the provisions will work. He asked detailed questions—lawyer's questions, dare I say whereas his hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset took a wider view. Rightly, he asked why the political party should be liable. Up to now, the Bill has focused on the treasurer and deputy treasurer, on whom the Bill imposes sanctions. The Neill committee considered that carefully, and concluded that, if a political party were to win because of an attempt to break the law and exceed the spending limits, a sanction should be applied against the party. Such a party would have won the campaign and been elected by virtue of having more resources, and illegal resources. If the legislation were to prescribe a spending limit of £20 million, and one political party were to spend £25 million, that party would clearly have had an advantage.
<P>
On the question of individual candidates, it is clear that an individual candidate and his agent would be disqualified for a breach. Criminal sanctions are applied, which we all know about, and with which we are familiar. In the case of national spending campaigns, and national elections, one could not disqualify certain candidates, or take action against certain agents. If a party won a majority by a large margin, and benefited from excess spending of £5 million, one could not disqualify all the candidates. That would lead to a change in Government and a different balance of power in Parliament.
<P>
A new way of tackling the problem must be found; the responsibility must be put on parties. As both hon. Gentlemen recognised, that is achieved by clause 139. I can tell the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the precedent for clause 139 is section 734 of the Companies Act 1985, which I shall have to examine closely later, now that my attention has been drawn to it. On the wider issue, if a party benefits because of illegal excess spending, a sanction must be used against the party. The Bill tends to follow Neill's recommendations closely, and the relevant argument is set out in paragraphs 10, 123 and 124 of the Neill report. This part of the Bill provides, for the first time, a sanction against a political party that breaches the rules. If a party overspends, action may be taken against it. Action may also be taken against the treasurer.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the advantage that parties would derive from massive over-spending, it is only right that they should be liable. That is what clause 72 will provide. The hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for North Dorset have made it clear that amendments Nos. 94 and 95 would remove any responsibility from parties. They want the legislation to impinge and bite only on officers of the party or the association, but if the party breaks the rules and gains an advantage, the party itself should be liable to sanctions or heavy fines, depending on the degree of irregularity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I have just looked up in schedule 19 the fines relating to clause 72(4) in respect of exceeding limits on campaign expenditure. For a summary conviction, the penalty will be the statutory maximum; for an indictment, the penalty will be a fine. Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that, if the Labour party, for example, were to overspend in a national election campaign by £5 million, the election result would stand, the party would be fined perhaps another £1 million or £2 million by the court, and everyone would happy because a price had been paid and a Labour Government had retained power? According to such a provision, a party could buy its way into office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am certainly not saying that everybody would be happy with such a circumstance: all those involved would feel a good deal of grief. However, the principle that the hon. Gentleman identifies is right. If a political party overspends by, say, £5 million, gains a majority and gets into power, the court will have the power of sanction. The degree of sanction would be a matter for the court, but, in serious cases, I would imagine that a heavy penalty would be imposed. Such a provision will sharpen the thinking of not only the treasurer, the leader and the nominating officer of the party, but all party members. If the rules are broken and an illegal advantage is sought, the party must be made to pay a heavy price.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary is confirming what I said. Although it may not be a good analogy, I am reminded of the brothel keeper for whom it is commercially worth while to pay a fine because his returns are such that the fine is just another business expense. A political party that seeks power could likewise regard the fine for over-spending as just another expense. Moreover, it may have friends in the country who are prepared to pay that price.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It may have friends in the country who are prepared to pay that price, but the real price would be not the fine but the headlines. The electorate would know that a political party had cheated substantially and consciously. Faced with that prospect, it would think carefully about any avoidance mechanism. The party may gain a short-term advantage, but in the long term it would be rendered unelectable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary's comments have given us no comfort. He said that there were no precedents for treating political parties in this way, although he suggested that there were precedents elsewhere. I was not sure whether he was referring to precedents among other political parties elsewhere in the world or precedents among other organisations. He then quoted section 734 of the Companies Act 1985. I must admit that I am not entirely familiar with that legislation or the way in which it impinges on other unincorporated bodies. However, I know that unincorporated bodies that occasionally suffered when a court has directed its attention at its members. A number of unincorporated bodies have sought solace in the 1985 Act or other Companies Acts by becoming companies limited by guarantee, whereby the members are liable for a nominal £1. It worries me that we should have to turn all our political parties into companies limited by guarantee in order to protect their members.
<P>
In answer to my two interventions, the Parliamentary Secretary rightly told the Committee that a party which overspent in an election campaign would be fined by the courts. It could be a substantial fine, and there would also be bad publicity. However, some political parties might consider that a price worth paying. I would not want to give them any ideas, but if the United Kingdom Independence party were to spend whatever was necessary to get its candidates elected at a general election by convincing the electorate that we should withdraw from the European Union, by the next general election the damage would have been done and it might be difficult for the country to reverse the position. That would be of no consequence to the UK Independence party, because it would feel that it had been morally justified in convincing the British people of what an awful place Europe was. However, I am not sure that Britain would be a great place with UKIP in charge, because its members are constantly quarrelling among themselves.
<P>
To be serious, it worries me that, under the clause, political parties will be treated as if they were corporations. That is why my hon. Friends and I tabled amendments to delete the provisions under which a political party would be treated as if it were a corporation and become liable for fines either in courts of summary jurisdiction or on indictment in the Crown court.
<P>
We spent a lot of time on earlier clauses discussing the responsibilities of the treasurer and the deputy treasurer, on being able to identify them and ensure that they are beyond reproach—people who have not been convicted of offences. Now we are giving them a let-out by saying that the political party can be the responsible body, although the treasurer will have been responsible for exceeding the campaign expenditure limit. It is wrong to say now that it is not the responsibility of the party members. If a party overspends by, say, £5 million during an election campaign and the court fines it another £5 million, if it does not have the funds, the money is unlikely to come from a bank loan or benefactor. If the party has no assets, its members will have to pay the fine.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps that would persuade the party and its membership to stick to the rules, and perhaps that is why the provision is in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Minister for that guidance, but, given the way in which the Labour party and the Conservative party are organised, I wonder whether individual party members in my constituency feel that they have any direct control over the activities of the party treasurer in Smith square: they believe that others will look after their interests. It stretches the imagination to think that all 330,000 members of the Conservative party are so intimately aware of the party's central accounting systems that they feel some responsibility for whether the party overspends. That is not reality, even if we would wish it to be. In the case of the Labour party, the 3.3 million affiliated members in the trade union movement who are another step removed again, would have little control, if any, over the Labour party's affairs nationally by being able to influence how much money it spent in a general election.
<P>
To conclude, a party treasurer is a responsible individual who must fulfil the qualification that he has not been convicted of an offence. If we are to place that person in a position of responsibility, he, not the members of the party, must ultimately be responsible. Whatever the Parliamentary Secretary may say to reassure us that the party is being treated as if it were a corporation, a political party is not a corporation: at the end of the day it may have very few assets and no cash in the bank. If it is fined, it is a fine on the individual members of the party and not on a corporate body that does not exist because it is not incorporated.

<H4><center>LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 122, line 20, leave out `30,000' and insert `22,500'.
<P>
The amendment may seem to be a detailed amendment to an obscure schedule. It would change £30,000 to £22,500. Similar, inconsequential amendments have been tabled, but this amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. The Committee has made slow progress today, but I believe that this is one of the most important amendments that we shall discuss, so I make no apologies for moving it.
<P>
The amendment would reduce the national campaign spending limit from £20 million, which was the compromise figure suggested by the Neill committee, to the original figure of £15 million, which was suggested by the Labour party. A figure of £30,000 per constituency is equivalent to £20 million for a national campaign. My amendment proposes £22,500 per constituency, and that is equivalent to £15 million for a national campaign.
<P>
You may wonder, Mr. Maxton, why I say that the amendment goes to the heart of Bill when there are hundreds of recommendations in the Neill report. My hon. Friend the Minister was exaggerating when he said that I was an expert on the subject, but I know enough about it to know that there are only four main ways in which to control party spending: disclosure, overseas funding bans, donation limits and spending limits. The Bill includes disclosure, which was in the Labour party's manifesto and was agreed by the Opposition before the Neill committee was even appointed. The same is true of the overseas funding ban, which was a matter of consensus before the Neill committee even met. Sadly, the Neill committee came out against donation limits.
<P>
The spending limit is by far the most important new proposal in the Neill report It is not just the obscure schedule 8. Without detracting from many other useful reforms in the Bill, it is the crux of the Bill. Unlike the other proposals, however, it is not just the fact of the limit, but the level of the limit that is crucial. I was searching for an example and only one that I can think of is a fishing net: one needs a net to catch fish, but not just any net. If the mesh is too wide, one catches nothing. Similarly, when one restrains a prisoner with handcuffs, they need to be the right size. If they are too large, the prisoner can take his hands out. It is the same with the relationship between the principle of a spending limit and the level of that limit. We need not just a spending limit, but one that bites.
<P>
I shall give the Committee four brief reasons why £20 million is too high a figure, and why £15 million would be right. First £20 million does not bite hard enough. Secondly £20 million does not allow for evasion and drift, which there would, undoubtedly, be. Thirdly £20 million does not deal with the problem of millionaire funding and fourthly the majority of hon. Members are members of parties that did not want £20 million, but a lower figure. We do not need to compromise on this issue.
<P>
I shall elaborate briefly on those four points. The Labour party spent £26 million, and the Conservative party £28 million, at the previous general election. However, that election was wholly exceptional. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Why?''] People were prepared to put up a lot of money, either to get a change of Government or to stop one. I am not making a partisan point. The corresponding figures for the election before that were £10 million and £11 million respectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The hon. Gentleman suggested that to change or to retain a Government is a wholly exceptional circumstance at a general election. I wonder whether he would like to reconsider that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> That election was exceptional in two respects: the amount of money that people were prepared to pay and the intensity of the issue.
<P>
As I said, the corresponding figures for the election in 1992 were £10 million and £11 million respectively. At the 1987 election, the Labour party spent £4 million and the Conservatives £9 million. There has been a quantum leap to £26 million and £28 million in 1997—not so much a doubling as a trebling in expenditure. If we write a £20 million limit into the Bill, we shall be accepting that the exponential acceleration of election spending is irreversible, just at the moment when we have a chance to reverse it.
<P>
I do not believe that the Labour party would get £20 million at the next election, let alone need to spend it. I am sure that the Conservatives would not get £20 million. Who would put up £20 million to get them elected next time? However, let us suppose for the sake of argument that both the main parties were able to raise the same amount of money that they raised at the 1997 election—£26 million and £28 million—and that they wanted to spend that amount. The crucial question is: would a £20 million limit stop them? Sadly, I do not believe that it would.
<P>
One has only to look at schedule 7 to see that there is plenty of scope for campaign treasurers to pass off election spending as routine administrative spending. In that schedule, those issues hang on such questions as whether a letter to voters is solicited or unsolicited. We all know ways round these issues. Is market research intended to ascertain voting intentions? If not, it would not be an election expense. Are staff employed specifically in connection with an election? If not, that would come under part II, and part or all of the cost could be put down to administrative expenses.
<P>
I do not wish to encourage campaign treasurers to find loopholes. I merely point out that it is in the nature of legislation of this kind that loopholes will be found and rules will be bent. Canadian parties would regard it as a piece of cake to spend £26 million while limited to £20 million. They do it all the time. My hon. Friends the Members for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) and for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) have considerable experience of by-elections—indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) was elected in one—and I am sure that they are well aware of the resourcefulness of campaign treasurers in those extreme circumstances. They know about such matters in a way that Lord Neill, sadly, may not. He was a warden of All Souls and an eminent High Court judge, but, as far as I know, he has had no practical experience on the campaign trail.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): If the hon. Gentleman is not aware of the amount of political infighting, devious machinations and general ruthlessness that goes on the world of academia, he is not very well informed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The machinations and infighting in the corridors of Al1 Souls have been well chronicled in many books. However, that is not equivalent to experience of the way in which election campaigns work. I do not blame Lord Neill for that. There were not many practising politicians on the Neill committee, and it was probably deficient in that area of experience. Most members of the Committee will agree that if the limit is set at £20 million, parties will find ways of spending £25 million. If one wants a real limit of £20 million, it should be set at £15 million.
<P>
Two good reasons for the amendment would be sufficient, but there is a third. Parties should not have to raise funds from millionaires. While I have nothing against millionaires, seeking £1 million donations from individuals will always make parties susceptible to influence. It is the job of the Bill, if not to make £1 million donations illegal, to make them unnecessary.
<P>
Donations by individual millionaire are a relatively recent innovation in party funding. They were pioneered by Lord McAlpine when he was treasurer of the Tory party. When its corporate donations began to dry up, such individual donations started to become a significant factor in party funding. I do not try to disguise the fact that by the mid-1990s, the Labour party was being forced to try to match some of those large individual donations.
<P>
Why would a limit of £20 million make individual donations necessary, whereas one of £15 million would make them unnecessary? The most recent Labour party finance report may reveal the answer. The party raises about £15 million from subscriptions, affiliations and small donations, and about £5 million from large donations. Those figures were confirmed by Lord Sawyer when he gave evidence, as the Labour party's general secretary, to the Neill committee. He said that the Labour party raises between £20 million and £25 million a year, and that £4 million to £5 million of that comes from high-value donations. When he was cross-examined on that point, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If we are to raise that kind of finance,''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, £20 million to £25 million a year—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we have to be able to seek donations and to do so at a fairly high level.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as you know . . . we have had to seek donations up to £1 million and we would need to continue that sort of fund-raising programme''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I draw particular attention to his point that the Labour party would have to seek £1 million donations in order to raise such large amounts of money. The party's accounts reveal that £15 million is its basic income from its normal sources of finance; raising £20 million forces it into the deeper water of seeking large individual donations.
<P>
If the Conservative party's accounts could be examined in the same way, I am sure that they would reveal it to be in a similar position. In the past—a few years' disclosure of large donations will reveal whether it is still the case—the Conservative party has been able to raise about £15 million from its normal sources of funding, including its members, associations and small donations, but when it has wanted to raise that figure to £20 million or £25 million, it has had to appeal for large individual donations. I do not suggest that that is an immutable law of politics, but it is currently true. If the Bill is to contain a limit that will allow parties to finance elections without having recourse to millionaires, the starting-point should be £15 million, not £20 million.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If those three reasons are not sufficient, there is a fourth reason—in my view, it is the strongest—why at least the majority of Committee members should support the amendment. The sum of £20 million was a compromise figure that the Neill committee proposed. It is not clear why the committee alighted on that figure, which apparently came out of the blue. Paragraph 10.42 of the Neill report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Our judgment is that the new national spending limits should be set substantially below the total amounts spent by those two parties in 1997. We suggest a figure of £20 million. This figure should be index-linked . . . the legislation . . . should require that it not be otherwise raised or lowered except on the specific recommendation of the Election Commission.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, it plucked a figure out of the air and tried to write it into history for good by using a formula that can be changed only by the Electoral Commission.
<P>
The Labour party does not support that recommendation—it supports the £15 million figure. Previous and present general secretaries of the Labour party were questioned on that matter, and both insisted on their party's view that the limit should be no more than £15 million. The Liberal Democrats were also cross-questioned on this matter, and they suggested a limit of between £10 million and £12 million. The Conservative party, of course, does not support a limit at all—the present free-for-all gives it an advantage. It outspent all of the other parties in every election in the previous century, and it will probably do so in this one, unless it can be restrained in some way.
<P>
It is often suggested that the Neill report was unanimous—and it was, on 99 out of 100 recommendations. However, it was not unanimous in relation to national campaign spending limits. There was one Conservative Member on the Neill committee, and he—unlike the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—did not believe that his party spent too much on elections. Paragraph 10.32 of the Neill report states that he—that is, the Conservative Member on the committee—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``disputes the view that election expenditure is excessive''.{**W4**}
<P>
</UL></FONT>He compared what was likely to be spent on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prompting the policies which will decide the future direction of the country''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``what is likely to be spent in any one year on promoting washing powders, butter spreads and toilet rolls''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor)—he was the Conservative Member in question—for that insight. He obviously has a pretty shrewd idea about what we use his party's election material for.
<P>
We should stick to a simple principle, namely, that parties currently spend too much on elections and that they should spend less. To achieve a downward change in the amount that is spent on elections, we need a national campaign spending limit of £15 million, although we have accepted what I believe to be the ludicrously high figure of £20 million.
<P>
Why should Labour Members reach a compromise with a party that does not even accept the need for spending limits? I have often asked that question, but the only answer that I have received is that there is some merit in accepting the Neill report as whole. I can see some merit in that, but we have not accepted the report as a whole. We reached different recommendations in relation to tax relief, overseas voters and the de minimis rule, and we shall clearly differ in relation to Northern Ireland—the Neill committee could not come up with a solution in that context. We also differed from the Neill committee over some aspects of referendum law.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend should reflect on his words. The Neill committee may not have come up with a solution to Northern Ireland, but neither has the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point. Northern Ireland is a difficult problem, and I do not necessarily expect my hon. Friend to come up with a solution. However, my point was that the Committee cannot be said to have accepted all of the Neill report's recommendations in their entirety. If we have been able to differ from the Neill report on those five points, why should we not also differ on spending limits? It is already clear that we have accepted the principles of the Neill report—nobody would dispute that—but that is different from accepting every detail. My point is almost constitutional—the Labour party has a majority in Parliament, and in the Committee, and the Liberal Democrats are also against a £20 million campaign spending limit. Our two parties have 70 per cent. of the seats in Parliament, and 75 per cent. of the seats in the Committee. Labour Members were elected on a clear manifesto to clean up sleaze in politics. We committed ourselves to setting up the Neill inquiry, but not to accepting every dot and comma of its recommendations. If we believe that one proposal out of hundreds in the Neill report is wrong or misguided, we should have the courage to say so. I can understand the Government looking for consensus on this issue. It is far better to proceed by consensus, and, by and large, the Committee has done so; the only Divisions have been today, and in the sitting on Tuesday. However, consensus is not an end in itself.
<P>
Let us look at the history of the subject. The Labour Government of 1974–79 set up a royal commission to recommend legislation on party funding—the Houghton committee. It was established in exactly the same way as this Government set up the Neill committee. When the Houghton committee made its recommendations, the treasurer of the Conservative party, Lord McAlpine—who had just been appointed—said that his party would refuse to accept any of its recommendations. Lord Callaghan, the then Prime Minister, was of the generation who believed that such semi-constitutional issues could be addressed only if there was consensus in Parliament. Therefore, the Houghton committee report was never submitted to Parliament, it was never even debated in Parliament. It was put on the shelf to gather dust. As a consequence, the chance to legislate on party funding was lost for a quarter of a century. Lord McAlpine's refusal to accept any of the recommendations was not based on an inability to reach parliamentary consensus, but on party self-interest. He inherited a deficit of £1.9 million, which seemed high then, but now seems low.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not mind me tweaking his tail for a moment, to speak metaphorically. He talks about self-advantage, but earlier he said that the previous election was exceptional, and required exceptional expenditure. I detected a hint that it was exceptional expenditure by the Labour party to try to achieve the revolution in political affairs that would bring it to power, but that now that the party was in power, there was no need to spend even a comparable amount in future. Is that not also motivated by self-advantage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> On the contrary, the most exceptional aspect of the previous election was the £28 million that the Conservative party spent to try to remain in power. The hon. Gentleman may find it difficult to understand how it could have spent that amount, but, as in all previous elections, it outspent all the other parties. The Labour party tried, as any party would, to close the gap and to match its spending as closely as possible to the richer party.
<P>
The sudden increase in spending between 1992 and 1997 was enormous. Over the previous 30 years, this country's election campaigns have cost between £2 million and £5 million. Suddenly, the two main parties' election campaigns cost £26 million and £28 million. In one election, a tradition of low election expenditure was abandoned, and we adopted the American approach of high expenditure. That is why this Bill is so important—its purpose is to close the chapter on the arms race in excessive election expenditure, which, if left uncontrolled, would lead to all of the problems in American politics. Indeed, the United States is one of the countries that has passed strict legislation on party funding. It has proved ineffective because of Supreme Court rulings, but at least the United States has tried. Until this legislation was introduced, this country had not even tried.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman has said about exceptional expenditure at the previous election. Of course, expenditure was rising. I wonder whether conclusions may be drawn from table 3.11 in the Neill report. It shows that, in real terms, Labour party expenditure rose by 70 per cent. but Conservative party expenditure declined by 8 per cent. during the 1992 election. Nevertheless, the Labour party failed to win the election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I do not pretend that there is a precise correlation between election expenditure and the number of seats won. Clearly, we must consider the message as well as the money spent conveying it. In the election campaigns of the 1980s, the Conservative party regularly spent about twice as much as the Labour party and 10 times as much as the Liberal Democrats, but it did not win 10 times as many, or even twice as many, seats.
<P>
In the 1990s, the Labour party made a deliberate effort to bridge that gap and match Conservative spending. It came close, but that is no reason to take the view that campaign expenditure need not be controlled. On the contrary, now that we have won an election and can pass party funding legislation, we should put a sensible limit on the amount that parties can spend. We should not necessarily worry about achieving consensus with the very party that allowed election campaign expenditure to escalate.
<P>
Lord McAlpine's beggar-my-neighbour policy of refusing to legislate on party funding worked for a number of elections, until he ran out of corporate donors. He became reliant on individual donors, and began to scrape the bottom of the barrel. Eventually, he went too far and—not without merit—the party came a cropper. That is why we should not insist on achieving consensus. If consensus is achieved, all well and good, but we should do what we believe to be right while we have the chance. Our party has recommended a limit of £15 million, and the Liberal Democrats have recommended a limit of £10 million or £12 million. As I said, the Labour party has a substantial majority in the House and this Committee, and our judgment should prevail.
<P>
I am keen to listen to what my colleagues have to say on this issue, particularly the Parliamentary Secretary. However, I shall press the amendment to a vote, either in Committee or on Report, because this is a point of view that needs to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman constantly described his proposal as a reflection of the views of the Labour party. I was intrigued by that, and I am conscious that the Bill is the creation of a Labour Government. I could not but reflect on my winding-up speech on Second Reading, during which reference was made to referendum spending and a referendum on proportional representation. I asked whether the Prime Minister or the National Executive Committee would decide who would receive the £5 million. A Labour Member intervened, saying that they are the same people. I am intrigued that the hon. Member for Battersea should now promote his amendment to the schedule on the basis that the Labour party view and the Government view are different and that the Labour party view should prevail in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> That is not quite the point that I was making. I said that the Labour party's recommendation in evidence was £15 million. The Government believe that we should accept the Neill proposals as a whole. They do not say that they would have suggested £20 million they merely say that, in the interests of—
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that Mr. Linton was making an intervention on Mr. Walter when I called the suspension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I think that I had finished my intervention. I do not know whether the hon. Member for North Dorset wants his memory refreshed. I was making the distinction between the Government view, which is to treat the Neill committee recommendations as a whole, and the Labour party's recommendation in giving evidence. They are not necessarily at odds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Battersea for that clarification. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary, the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping), who was here at the beginning of the debate on amendment No. 35, has now retired to the substitutes' bench and has been replaced on the Front Bench by the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche). I hope that this is not how they will go through the long hours during which the Committee will no doubt sit.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Battersea for his clarification of the differences between the Labour party submission and the Government's view of what the Neill report said. As he rightly said in his original remarks on the amendment, the Neill report has been deviated from in a number of respects, so I acknowledge that the Government should perhaps deviate from Neill.
<P>
A central tenet of our approach to the Bill is that in most respects we should follow Neill's recommendation, and we will make that case most strongly on other parts of the Bill. We made that point on the Floor of the House on Second Reading with regard to Neill's recommendations on referendum spending. The only area where we have deviated from its recommendations was in our earlier discussions on exemptions for Northern Ireland, and that was because we believed that time had moved on.
<P>
I shall deal specifically with the substance of the amendment. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Labour party's submission to the Neill committee was that the limit should be set at approximately—these figures are approximate—£15 million rather than at approximately £20 million. Any figure that we arrive at is fairly subjective. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman made the case for a limit of £15 million, £10 million or any other figure: that was simply the figure that the Labour party had used in its submission.
<P>
The Neill committee examined the spending trends of political parties during recent general elections. At the last general election, the two major political parties spent considerably more than £20 million, based on the figures of Butler and Kavanagh, using information supplied by the parties. The Conservative party spent £28.3 million and the Labour party spent £26 million.
<P>
I am intrigued by the comment immediately below the table on page 43 of the Neill report, from Peter Riddell, political columnist of The Times. He states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There is no serious evidence that differences in levels of national or local spending have any significant impact on results. Labour did not lose elections in the 1980s because it was outspent by the Conservatives. Similarly, the Tories spent a record amount last year for their worst results since the franchise began to be extended''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[HON. MEMBERS: ``Hear, hear. More.''] I shall give the Committee more by repeating what I said during an earlier intervention. At the 1992 general election, the Conservatives spent 8 per cent. less in real terms and Labour increased its spending by 70 per cent., but to no avail. Perhaps that was because it was unelectable, but that is another matter and I do not want to get into partisan point-scoring.
<P>
The Neill committee wanted to set an overall national limit.
<P>
 Recommendation 49 of its report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``On the assumption that a national spending limit is in place for the next general election, the limit for parties that contest more than 600 seats at that election should be set at £20 million. That limit should then be index-linked. It should not be varied in future except on the recommendation of the Election Commission.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Opposition support the basis of that recommendation, which has been translated in the Bill to a multiple of seats contested. The figure in the Bill, which the amendment of the hon. Member for Battersea would change, is £30,000 multiplied by the number of constituencies contested by the party in that part of the United Kingdom. That is an admirable translation of the Neill committee's recommendations. It thereby overcomes or handles recommendation No. 50, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The limits to a general election for parties that contest fewer than 600 seats should be lower and should be based on a formula taking account of the number of seats they are contesting.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Neill committee could have arrived at other formulae based on support at a previous general election and so on.
<P>
There are difficulties with the formula because a party might not know how many seats it will contest a year before a general election when it is planning its national campaign expenditure. None the less, given the circumstances of the legislation, this is probably the fairest way to proceed. The question is whether a cap of approximately £20 million is appropriate, or whether we should consider the figure suggested by the hon. Member for Battersea.
<P>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, who has now left the Room, suggested earlier that the Bill should aim to clean up sleaze. Those thoughts were echoed by the hon. Member for Battersea. That was why the Neill report was commissioned. Conservative Members support the basic principles that it contains.
<P>
However, if we are going to clean up sleaze, we must not create opportunities for other kinds of sleaze to creep in. I fear that if we are not realistic in setting the limits of national expenditure, people will immediately look for ways around those limits. It would be much better to set realistic limits on national campaign expenditure—that is, limits that are lower than the two major parties' expenditure during the previous general election campaign. Such realistic limits would avoid the possibility of people trying to bypass the legislation in order to spend money, or concealing expenditure in surreptitious ways while none the less aiding and abetting the election of a particular party at a general election.
<P>
We discussed earlier what would happen to a party that exceeded such limits. The temptation for a party to find ways of exceeding the limits would be that much greater if the limit were lower. We live in a world where parties are, if not desperate to get their message across, always intent on finding means of communicating their views to the electorate. As our media become more critical and, dare I say it, more cynical, parties feel that in order to get their message across, they must spend money on various means of communication—generally, the printed variety, in the form of billboards and posters.
<P>
My contention, in speaking against the amendment, is that the schedule uses the correct formula. Multiples of £30,000 would bring us approximately to Neill's recommendation of a £20 million overall limit for national campaign expenditure for parties that are contesting seats throughout the country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I support the amendment, because half a loaf is better than—I was about to say none, but should say instead that it is better than a whole loaf, because Liberal Democrat Members want to see a lower cap. As we know, some 100 parties are registered, 15 or 20 of which could make a reasonable claim to fighting a national election campaign. Only two would be above the cap that is in the Bill, and only two would be in the cap that is proposed by the amendment. I would not object to a cap that is slightly more realistic, or, indeed, substantially lower.
<P>
My support for Mr. Linton is qualified—[Interruption.] I apologise for incorrectly referring to the hon. Member for Battersea. The intention of spending all that money is to generate interest among the British electorate in the political process, so that they participate in it. One foreseeable effect of substantially reducing the amount of money spent on national campaigning is that it will reduce the British public's participation in the elections. That may not happen, because, just as there is no guarantee that the expenditure of large sums of money results in a large number of parliamentary seats, the two most highly-funded election campaigns ever resulted in the lowest general election turnout ever. Although my fears on that front may be unfounded, a limiting point is reached if one fails to notify the electorate that there is an election, as not many electors will turn into voters. Therefore, I have a qualification, and that is to make sure that there are still sufficient resources to fight effective campaigns that will motivate voters, which is what it is all about.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
That brings me to a point that the hon. Member for Battersea does not address in his amendment, because it is a narrow amendment referring to a particular part of the Bill. It concerns the other missing element of the Neill report—I did not hear him refer to it directly—which is that there should be state support for the political process, either in a direct form or by making donations tax deductible, at least up to a certain level. That would create two ways of counterbalancing the effect of capping the campaign expenditure and the acquisition of donations from private sources. First, it would allow added value to private sources and donations and, secondly, it would reduce still further the temptation to circumvent the rules or find elaborate avoidance techniques.
<P>
Those issues are of some significance, but the hon. Gentleman's amendment goes in the right direction. It is clearly not good for democracy that, even in principle, an election can be won simply on the basis of the amount of money that a party throws at it. Therefore, we support the move to a sensible cap on expenditure. As the hon. Gentleman has told the Committee on more than one occasion, the Liberal Democrats went into the evidence-taking sessions in the Neill committee without a specific target in mind, but, after questioning suggested that the limit should be £10 million or £12 million. That is a sign that we are so other-worldly that we had not considered this point in detail, and also that we think that a modest level of national campaign spending is sufficient for the British democratic process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): First, I welcome back my hon. Friend the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, who I know has been following our proceedings in spirit if not in body.
<P>
I want to make a couple of points that I did not think I would make at the beginning of this debate. My heart is very much with my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, but recent events should be used to put down a marker, not for my hon. Friend the Minister, but for the Conservative party.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea is right that there is a universal view in the House that we do not want to drift towards US-style fund-raising activities and emulate the absurdity of our friends in Congress, who have to spend half their elected time raising money for the next election. I see the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) nodding. It is unusual to see a Conservative Whip agreeing with me. I think that that point is universally accepted.
<P>
Secondly, we know anecdotally and from our direct involvement in the process that attempts have been made by various means to circumvent some of the regulations. The hon. Member for North Dorset described some of them, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. The spirit of the Bill is that we should collectively clean up our act, and the amendment will help us along the way. The hon. Member for North Dorset tried to defend a subjective figure of £20 million and, at this stage, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt by accepting that the Conservative party does not intend to bypass that figure.
<P>
Yesterday, or the day before, in the context of the Archer fiasco, a headline in the Evening Standard referred to the Conservative ethics committee, which hitherto would have been regarded as an oxymoron. If the Conservative party were to act on the honourable statements of Conservative Front Benchers, credibility would be given to a higher figure than I would have preferred. The majority of Committee members will be with my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea in spirit. However, both sides of the House want a working Bill in place before the next general election, so there is a powerful argument that, if agreements cannot be reached on a lower limit, the draft version should be retained.
<P>
If my hon. Friend the Minister were to say on Report that there is a basis for a lower limit, I would subscribe to that view. In the spirit of our debate, however, I hope that Committee members will agree that any figure is subjective and withstands scrutiny only in the context of the whole of the Bill. I invite my hon. Friend the Minister—who might have been promoted by the time of the next Parliament—to ensure that the Bill is rigorously enforced. That is what the public want, and that is the way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. Member for Battersea and I sympathise with some of his aims. It is clear that we do not want to go down the road of funding elections in the same way as the United States. Although the hon. Gentleman identified the extraordinary circumstances that prevailed during the previous election, we were still a long way from that undesirable consequence. As a participant in that campaign, I thought that we approached the limit of what was tolerable, at least in respect of the electorate's ability to endure the antics and propaganda of political parties. Leaving aside the unpopularity of my party, as the election campaign drew to its close, it became apparent from people's comments on the doorstep that they were sick to death of the campaign. They were sick to death not only of Conservative propaganda but other parties', particularly the Labour party. I suspect that we had gone well beyond what was acceptable to the majority of the non-politicised electorate, which may be a salutary reminder for the future.
<P>
The question is how best to set the ceiling. The hon. Member for Battersea says that it should be set at £15 million, but I have a number of practical queries. It is quite clear that both parties succeeded in spending £25 million-plus without intending to go in the direction of American election campaigns. I suspect that the spending simply piled up. We need to ratchet those levels back down. However, we also need to go further. We are imposing a ceiling on expenditure for the first time, and it would be a foolish political party that decided to tailor its expenditure to the prescribed limit. There will have to be a substantial margin of security within that figure for several reasons.
<P>
First, keeping a close tab on expenditure as an election campaign mounts and money is being distributed right, left and centre to meet various needs cannot be carried out hourly. A political party would, therefore, be unwise to assume that it was close to the £20 million limit, because it may well have gone over it. A wise party will budget for about £17 million or £18 million—if it has the resources—with a sufficient contingency area to ensure that it does not overspend.
<P>
Furthermore, my impression of political campaigning is that a great deal is spent at various stages of the campaign but that something always needs to be done at the last minute. If all the money is already earmarked or spent, one might suddenly find, in the last week of the campaign, that one's propaganda machine falls silent.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): Was not one of the problems of the 1997 campaign the fact that the Conservative party decided to give six weeks' notice of the election, whereas there would normally be a four-week period? It is not surprising that the electorate became fed up with the constant flow of political propaganda during that excessively long campaign period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Lady may be right. As I was selected by my constituency two weeks into that campaign period, I was mercifully spared the major impact of that problem. I found myself on the campaign trail on about 9 April, having been selected by my party to fight the seat that I now represent only three days before.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I had a slightly more conventional selection than that of my hon. Friend. While he was speaking, I was thinking about what the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands had said. Although the election was technically called six weeks beforehand, my fundraising—and, I suspect, that of other hon. Members—had been on the basis of a three or four week campaign, so I did practically nothing for the first two weeks of the campaign. Although the hon. Lady has a point in theory, that was not the explanation in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My hon. Friend is in a much better position to comment on the extended campaigning period, to which I was not privy. I am not certain whether my association incurred any expense before my selection in relation to mounting a campaign that subsequently had to be changed. I have never made any inquiries into that.
<P>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands that the extended campaign may have contributed to the electorate's becoming bored. However, that does not detract from my point that, although we are setting a ceiling, I doubt that parties will spend all their allowance up to that ceiling. They would be mad to do so.
<P>
A further important issue was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset. One of the issues troubling the hon. Member for Battersea is his anxiety that there will be on-top evasion spending. He says that £25 million is a more realistic figure than £20 million, because the parties will find ways to spend the additional money. I confess that I find it hard to follow that argument. In our previous sittings, we have discussed how tight the regulatory mechanisms will be. I am not persuaded by the argument because the amount of money that is earmarked is the amount of money that will be spent. There will be some anticipatory expenditure before a campaign—all parties do that during the six-month run up—but there will not be evasions of extra spending.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Taking those factors together, £20 million appears to be a pretty reasonable sum. It is already a benchmark—the expenditure will have to come down from what it was. Notwithstanding the Chancellor of the Exchequer's self-proclaimed abilities, there will probably be some inflation between the previous election and the next one. In real terms, therefore, the figure may involve an even more substantial reduction.
<P>
We should set a benchmark that is durable. Admittedly, with inflation, that can be a problem. On several occasions, we have discussed the need for the Bill to achieve consensus. A figure that lasted for three or four elections might have the beneficial effect of further reducing expenditure. If so, it would be widely accepted and it would not attract any real complaints. If it were kept for that long, the party treasurers of the two major parties would not pull their hair out and there would be a real prospect of reducing expenditure over the years. Parliament, of course, might decide to raise the figure in line with inflation.
<P>
Mindful as I am of the good intentions of the hon. Member for Battersea, there is much to be said for sticking to the agreed figure. Although we have been divided on the Bill in Committee, there has been wide comment on the fact that there has been substantial agreement on its provisions. In five or 10 years' time, the figure will probably still be in place and it will have had the practical benefits that we all want. Dangers are associated with the £15 million figure and with going down the road that the hon. Gentleman suggested. His approach would impose constraints that the parties would find difficult, and we would have to have further political arguments in the near future about raising it. I should rather avoid such conflicts, and I commend the original figure to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fabian Hamilton </B>(Leeds, North-East): I want to make a few brief observations, to argue that we should cap the amount that will be spent and to support my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea.
<P>
Do we really want to see more of the dreadful hoardings that we witnessed during the previous general election? I refer to the ``New Labour, New Danger'' poster, and to others that went up all over the place. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) said that that might be a way to get people out to vote. However, I am shocked—
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> My recollection of those hoardings is that, undesirable as they were—or were not—there were very few of them. In many cases, a party would put up a single hoarding, have a photo shoot, invite the television cameras and take the hoarding down again. Capping is not relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hamilton:</B> In that case, I wonder where the Conservative party's £28 million went. There were many such hoardings in my constituency, and many of them portrayed my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Perhaps I can explain the situation. My hon. Friend represents what was a marginal seat, but the hon. Member for New Forest, East represents what was—and, to an extent, still is considered to be—a safe seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hamilton:</B> That may well be the explanation.
<P>
Such was the power of the ``New Labour, New Danger'' poster that someone—one of my colleagues, I am glad to say—produced a ``New Hamilton, New Danger'' poster, which, at least, failed to stop me being elected. On my real point, do we really want to be further showered with dreadful plastic macs and awful paper hats? I do not know what Opposition Members managed to flog in their constituencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> Nineteen Labour Members of Parliament came to my constituency on one day. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) was one of them, and visited on the only rainy day during the entire campaign. I can assure my hon. Friend that the red plastic macs were very useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hamilton:</B> I am delighted to hear that. I am glad to say, however, that most of the visitors to my constituency brought their own macs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): To put the record straight, and to establish the correct terminology, they were not plastic macs. The proper title would be ponchos.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hamilton:</B> That is my point exactly. Hon. Members have mentioned the introduction of an American-style campaign. Do we really want American-style ponchos in our general election campaigns?
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> More Mexican than American.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hamilton:</B> I accept my hon. Friend's point. There is some logic in the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands. She referred to the fact that the campaign lasted six weeks. I do not know what Opposition Members did, but Labour Members started when the campaign kicked off, which was six weeks before the general election. Perhaps that explains our success. The argument that hoardings were necessary to bring out the electorate is not valid. As I recall, there was saturation coverage on the television news and in our newspapers. Perhaps that is why people on the doorstep were fed up with the campaign after six weeks. It was not the millions of pounds spent on hoardings—or thousands, in individual constituencies—but the saturation media coverage.
<P>
Reference has been made to the US-style campaign, but it was reported in today's press that George W. Bush has spent $37 million so far, and that has not resulted in great success, although we will wait to see what happens. In America, more and more is spent on elections, but fewer and fewer people turn out to vote. Clearly, there is no link between expenditure and election turnout. I am in favour of at least keeping a cap on spending, and trying to reduce it.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I shall start by saying what a pleasure it is to be present in the Committee. The discussion has been enjoyable. I apologise to Committee members for not having heard many of their speeches. I missed the pleasure of listening to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, who moved the amendment.
<P>
It has been an interesting debate. The issue is fundamental to our system. For the first time, we are considering the imposition of a national cap. I understand completely the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea about the need to make the provisions watertight. The purpose of schedule 7 is to describe what will be included in the limit. The Committee will not be surprised to hear that the Labour party would have wanted a lower figure, if the Neil committee had recommended one, but that was not the case. Clearly, however, it is necessary for the Bill to have consent. We currently believe that the best, and perhaps the only course, is to adopt the figure recommended in the Neill report. If we were presented with a fresh consensus in favour of a lower figure, we would be prepared to consider it. However, that should not be pursued on a unilateral basis, still less on a partisan basis. We will have the opportunity to return to these matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and I have had many discussions about this issue in the past, in different guises. I was an ambitious Back Bencher and he was a journalist on The Guardian. It is amazing how much contact we had in those days on these issues. As my hon. Friend moved the amendment in that spirit, I ask him to seek to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister harks back to a time when she was a member of the Home Affairs Committee and I was a journalist on The Guardian. Now the tables have been not exactly turned, but changed: I am a member of the Home Affairs Committee and she is the Minister dealing with this issue. I well remember her sterling work as a member of that Committee on the inquiry into party funding, and I think that the minority report that she signed is the true parent of the Bill.
<P>
I am heartened by my hon. Friend's statement that she will respond to a new consensus. I shall do my best to demonstrate between now and Report that there is wide support for the Labour party's original proposal of £15 million and to persuade her that it is safe to move in that direction. I only hope that, to have this new consensus, every party representative in the House does not necessarily have to be involved. For the reasons that I have given, to insist that consensus includes everybody is to give the veto to any party. If we can demonstrate sufficient breadth of support for the proposal, I hope that she will then feel able to move forward in a consensual manner. With that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Sutcliffe.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at three minutes to Five o'clock till Tuesday 8 February at half-past Ten o'clock.
