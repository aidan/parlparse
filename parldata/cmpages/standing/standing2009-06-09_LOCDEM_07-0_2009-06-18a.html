<a name="09061854000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000270"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning, on this wonderful summer day. If
hon. Members want to remove their jackets to feel comfortable, they may
do
so.</div><a name="09061854000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000271"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Curry</b> (Skipton and Ripon) (Con): I am delighted that
we have all arrived in good order, at the right time and in the right
place. Some of our constituents would no doubt find that a signal
achievement.</div>
<a name="09061854000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are now
coming to provisions in the Bill that are, on the whole, helpful and
sensible. The measures envisaged are not compulsory for local
authorities, and their design is significantly left to those
authorities, so we are moving away from the very prescriptive elements
of the Bill. I am more comfortable with that. We should, however,
recognise how complex the landscape that we are designing is.</div>
<a name="09061854000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">If people
were to take advantage of the opportunities presented by everything in
the Bill, the landscape of power and authority in the regions would
have the regional strategy at the top. Then there would be the two key
elements&#151;the leaders&#146; board and the regional development
agency; a constellation of subsidiary, advisory so-called stakeholder
bodies serving those; and the multi-area agreements, with or without
statutory powers, or with or without attitude, as one might put it.
Local area agreements would persist as well. There would be the
economic prosperity boards, which might well incorporate transport
bodies; there would be the Leeds and Manchester pilots, which might
eventually lead to a more coherent form of city region; and underneath
there would be the local authorities. Leaving London aside, those
include the unitaries, the metropolitans, the districts and the
counties, so they are quite a constellation. When I look at that
landscape, it isn&#146;t half complicated.</div>
<a name="09061854000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">That gives
rise to two issues. The first, and perhaps the minor one, is that I
suspect what is happening is a bit of a recipe for the empowerment of
officers. Many councillors would find it difficult to find their way
through, and that would put a huge amount of power in the hands of the
officers who will be riding shotgun on the new system.</div>
<a name="09061854000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is a question of accountability. We can see the common sense in
multi-area agreements, but the bodies involved are, to a significant
extent, not accountable. It is easy to see a logic when that is all put

<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>together, but if the question is turned around and things are looked at
through the other end of the telescope, by asking how the citizen
relates, finds a way in, or finds a voice, it is quite difficult. I do
not think we have cracked the central issue of how to build in
accountability to structures that are not accountable at a classical
national or local level, but which sit between those levels. We still
need to deal with that.</div>
<a name="09061854000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot of the
clauses refer to the tutelage of the Secretary of State. That is
inevitable and inescapable, for two reasons: first, because local
government still functions significantly on money that is voted by the
taxpayer at national level&#151;the grants to local authorities are
still a significant part of their funding; and secondly because local
government bodies carry out statutory duties, and, indeed, some of the
proposals will enhance those. Therefore it is inescapable that the
Secretary of State should be the ultimate accounting power in relation
to delivery by those statutory bodies. I hope that we shall not get too
hung up on that, because I venture to doubt whether, if a future
Government&#151;perhaps of a different complexion from the present
one&#151;were to put forward measures in this context, the relevant
part of the architecture would be significantly
different.</div><a name="09061854000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry if I have been giving a sort of Second Reading speech, but, as
we are about to discuss economic prosperity boards, I think they must
be seen in the context of the extraordinarily complex and, in a sense,
quite confusing structures that are likely to be created. We must ask
ourselves who will manage them and how, at the end of the day, Joe or
Jane Citizen will relate to
them.</div><a name="09061854000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000272"></a>The
Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr. Amess. As most of the speakers have indicated, the
economic prosperity boards address some of the points raised earlier in
the debate. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon talked about
local authorities&#146; ability to have a sub-regional economic
structure, and the economic prosperity boards provide for that
approach.</div><a name="09061854000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to stress two things. First, the EPBs and combined authorities
will be completely voluntary for all councils. We believe that they
should be formed only where there is a serious commitment to joint
working at the sub-regional level. There has to be that commitment or
they will not be particularly effective.</div>
<a name="09061854000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000273"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> There is just one point of detail that I would like
clarified. I read carefully the policy document on the options for
sub-regional co-operation, which is pretty clear. The only area about
which I had some doubt was that although the local authorities
concerned have got to apply to join, non-unitary district councils do
not have to subscribe, and I got the impression that they could be
dragooned in. They may be party to the application, but something could
go ahead even without the application of the simplest of district
councils.</div>
<a name="09061854000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000274"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I suspect that that provision was actually
amended in the Lords, and that the original thinking was that if a
county council covered an area, that would do. However, in the Lords it
was pointed out that there could be a problem with that, so an
amendment was made to deal with it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="09061854000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000275"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I merely observe that when their lordships come
from local government, by and large they come almost exclusively from
the upper tier.</div>
<a name="09061854000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000276"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Obviously, on this occasion they have been
addressing the problems of the unitary district councils. The Bill sets
out that no local authority will be able to be part of the scheme for
the establishment of an EPB unless it is involved in the preparation of
the scheme for the new body, or consents to being part of it. Also, the
Secretary of State will have to consult every authority that will be
part of the EPB before it can be set
up.</div><a name="09061854000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EPBs are extremely important bodies. I am glad to see there has been an
element of consensus about the fact that they can play a valuable part
in the sub-regional structure, and I hope the Committee will agree to
the clause standing part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061854000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09061854000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000277"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): It is a pleasure to see you
in the Chair, Mr. Amess. It has been useful to have a brief
Second Reading-type excursion from my right hon. Friend the Member for
Skipton and Ripon this morning. In a less elevated vein, before we rose
on Tuesday evening, I attempted to take the same kind of tour in
relation to the confusion of the architecture that we now see gradually
revealed in the Bill. I shall not attempt to repeat the Second Reading
observations on the clause, but I want to send a signal to the Minister
about most of the remainder of the clauses in this part of the Bill. As
I observed on Tuesday, they give considerable powers to the Secretary
of State.</div>
<a name="09061854000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
under the clause, the Secretary of State will be able to decide
membership, voting powers,  executive arrangements and so
forth. I am fascinated by paragraph (f) of subsection (4), which refers
to the</div>
<a name="09061854000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disapplication
of section 15 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (c. 42)
(duty to allocate seats to political
groups)&#148;.</div><a name="09061854000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
suggests either that the paragraph would disapply a duty to ensure
political balance, or vice versa. I would be grateful if the Minister
enlightened us on that
point.</div><a name="09061854000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, on most of the clauses&#151;I shall have something more to
say about one particular clause&#151;we wish the Minister to persuade
the Committee that the Secretary of State&#146;s powers will be
exercised responsibly and not in an onerous way. Who knows? The
economic prosperity boards might in due course have the opportunity to
take over more powers and become bottom-up bodies with real power and
authority, rather than pieces of a confusing jigsaw, under what we hope
is the forthcoming Conservative Government.</div>
<a name="09061854000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000278"></a><b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): It is a pleasure to see
you back in the Chair, Mr. Amess. As the hon. Member for
Wycombe said, we are effectively discussing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>the principles behind EPBs and how they will interact with the other
arrangements. I agree entirely that although those of us on this side
of the Committee have sought to use Divisions to indicate in detail our
disapproval of certain aspects of the Bill, a key principle is at stake
here. Is the case being made successfully for EPBs alongside the other
arrangements we have discussed? I have explained that my party would
prefer regions that make more sense to people, which might make EPBs
unnecessary. Groups of local authorities coming together to form
regions with RDAs that match those boundaries would be a better
process, although as the Minister kindly pointed out, that would take
some
time.</div><a name="09061854000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that in mind, we tabled a series of amendments, which of course were
unselectable, calling for Divisions on individual clauses. Whether EPBs
will make a useful contribution and whether they will cut across the
work of regional bodies remains to be seen, but we look forward to
hearing more from the Minister about that as we move through this part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061854000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wycombe discussed subsection (4)(f). I must
confess that I had not picked up on that point, and I am glad that he
raised it as it is a serious one that deals with an established
practice that is a strength of local government. Of course, my party
would like a slightly different electoral system, such as the one that
they now have in Scotland, to allow local authorities to reflect the
popular vote even more closely. However, even with our present system,
it is important that all political groups and all views have the option
to be represented in bodies formed. I have concerns about
leaders&#146; boards from that point of view also. We must be careful
in considering the
EPBs.</div><a name="09061854000244"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09061854000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000279"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I will address the issue of the Secretary of
State&#146;s role first. The Opposition document &#147;Control
Shift&#148;, as the hon. Member for Wycombe and the right hon. Member
for Skipton and Ripon said, proposes a similar structure, and it also
says that the Secretary of State would be able to grant it. There are
important reasons for that, because it is about making sure that all
local authorities have been properly involved in drawing up a scheme,
that there is the ability to influence it and, therefore, that they
have in a sense signed up for it&#151;that the structure will work.
That is why there is the ability to refer back to the Secretary of
State, in a sense, for endorsement. It is also clear, as I said before,
that we expect EPBs and combined authorities to be voluntary for local
authorities. It is not about a local authority having to have one; it
is about local authorities coming forward and saying, &#147;We
believe that this would be
beneficial.&#148;</div><a name="09061854000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point made about subsection (4)(f), political balance provisions
that apply to local authorities will apply to EPBs; that is covered in
schedule 6. However, those provisions do not apply to executives of
local authorities, which are designed to be cabinet-type structures, so
we have similarly provided for EPBs to operate with an executive that
they choose. I hope that that is a helpful clarification and that the
Committee will agree to the
clause.</div><a name="09061854000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

amendment is in line with a debate that we had about an earlier
amendment, which I think was tabled by the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle). That sought to strengthen the
Bill&#146;s wording regarding sustainable development. We were
seeking to press a power, or duty, on the responsible regional
authority, the RDA and the leaders&#146; board in their development
of a regional strategy. If we are to have economic prosperity boards
carrying out similar work on economic development in their areas, the
same principle applies and we would feel more comfortable if a more
explicit duty were placed upon them to carry out sustainable economic
development.</div><a name="09061854000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

Minister said in an earlier debate that she felt the point was
covered&#151;that the Secretary of State could issue general guidance
and that that guidance would, no doubt, be in accord with meeting those
aims. However, given that the Bill establishes these bodies, it would
be good if those key duties were imposed from the outset for any such
bodies that come into
existence.</div><a name="09061854000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000283"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman some
reassurance on that point. All members of the Committee will doubtless
agree that it would be entirely counter-productive to the long-term
well-being of the sub-region for &#147;economic development&#148;,
in that context, to mean anything other than sustainable economic
development&#151;in other words, development that is within
environmental limits and that enhances environmental and social welfare
in the area. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that our statutory
guidance will make it clear that that is precisely what we mean. I hope
that reassures him and that he will withdraw his

Rogerson:</b> I thank the Minister for that. Although we are
attempting to make some progress&#151;I will behave myself, as I said
I would, when it comes to not repeating votes on general
principles&#151;this is an important matter. There is a great deal of
feeling outside this place that not enough emphasis is placed on this
issue. As the title 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>of the boards suggests, they are about economic prosperity. That is
important, and I hope they will make a significant contribution to that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000299"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Given that the Minister did not rise to her feet
to introduce the clause, I thought I would raise a point put to the
Committee by the Campaign to Protect Rural England. In a submission
that I and other Members of the Committee have received, it argues that
clause 88 will, as it makes clear, allow functions to be passed to
EPBs. The CPRE
wrote:</div><a name="09061854000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not believe that planning powers should be passed to the EPBs. The
planning system should not, and cannot, be focused solely on delivering
economic
growth.&#148;</div><a name="09061854000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
arguing that the planning system cannot be solely concentrated on
delivering economic growth, I am sure the CPRE is right, but I am not
sure whether the Opposition agree entirely with the CPRE. If local
authorities voluntarily wish to work together on planning, they should
be allowed to do so. I do not entirely follow the CPRE&#146;s
argument in that respect. Having said that, I ask the Minister to say
what functions an EPB can gather to itself, because I think the
Committee would find that
useful.</div><a name="09061854000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000300"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that I can give some assurance to the
hon. Gentleman. It is up to local authorities to set out the functions
that they wish to pass to an EPB across their area. They may decide
that their EPB should play a part in spatial planning, most likely
through co-operation in the production of regional development
frameworks. It is very unlikely that local authorities would propose
ceding power to make particular planning decisions to an EPB, or that
the Secretary of State would agree to such an arrangement. I assure the
hon. Gentleman that the Government are clear about wanting the link
between planning decisions and direct local democratic accountability
to be
maintained.</div><a name="09061854000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

authorities and their

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000301"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> This begins a different section of this part of
the Bill, in that it introduces combined authorities that are not EPBs,
as hon. Members can see from the italic print at the top of clause 100.
I thought it worth briefly sketching out our general view and giving
the Minister notice of any issues that are likely to
arise.</div><a name="09061854000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
see no difficulty with combined authorities dealing with transport in
principle. The concern that arose in the Lords was the prospect of
congestion charges or other such charges being imposed on local
authority areas without the consent of their voters. Looking ahead to a
later clause&#151;I will not go into it in detail&#151;it seems
that that is covered in clause 106, but it would be useful if the
Minister gave some assurances on
that.</div><a name="09061854000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
my reading of clause 100, it seems that a combined authority and an EPB
must be distinct, and perhaps the Minister will say something about
that. Subsection (5)(b) states that no part of the area may form part
of</div>
<a name="09061854000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the area of an
EPB&#148;.</div><a name="09061854000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I am reading the Bill correctly, the Department&#146;s intention is
that a combined transport authority and EPB will be separate entities,
and the Committee will be curious to know
why.</div><a name="09061854000245"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09061854000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000302"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I hope that I can give some reassurance on
congestion charging. The powers and functions of integrated transport
authorities are set out in the Local Transport Act 2008. The Bill will
not alter the functions available to ITAs but merely allow them to be
brought together with local authority economic development functions in
a single combined authority. The Bill will not create any new transport
functions for sub-regional bodies when such functions could not already
be given to
ITAs.</div><a name="09061854000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, combined authorities can act in the
same way as EPBs and can take on the same functions. Therefore, it
would not be appropriate to have two bodies for the same area.
Subsection (5) states:</div>
<a name="09061854000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition
D is that no part of the area forms part of...the area of another
combined
authority&#148;.</div><a name="09061854000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is intended to ensure that the boundaries are fairly clear
and that there are not all kinds of crossovers. I hope that that is
reassuring.</div>

<a name="09061854000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000303"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> We see no difficulty with multi-area agreements,
which are a good thing in principle. In the Lords, my noble Friend Lord
Hanningfield needed to be convinced that this clause and the following
clauses would not simply impose improvement targets on those who signed
up to multi-area agreements. The note that I have in my almost
illegible handwriting says, &#147;See Andrews&#146;
reassurances&#148;, which suggests that Baroness Andrews was able to
give my noble Friend the reassurances that he sought. Again, however,
it would be useful to the Committee if the Minister spelt out some
reassurances.</div>
<a name="09061854000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000304"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship in this lovely weather, Mr.
Amess.</div>
<a name="09061854000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman said, there is genuine agreement that multi-area agreements
are a good thing. Once again, however, we return to the question of
whether it is necessary to make provision for them in primary
legislation. Considerable powers are reserved to the Secretary of State
in subsequent clauses on multi-area agreements, and we should question
whether that is necessary to enable local authorities to work together
to achieve improvements in public services in their areas.</div>
<a name="09061854000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may refer
to this later, but in an interview in yesterday&#146;s
<i class="I">Guardian</i>, the new Secretary of State referred to exploring the
possibility of new powers, with a legally enforceable charter under
which local authorities would have the right to refuse to have the
Secretary of State&#146;s views imposed on them. Most of the Bill
could fall into the category where local authorities might say,
&#147;Actually, we think that this is an imposition of your powers,
which is completely unnecessary.&#148; They would then have the
opportunity to refuse to implement it.</div>
<a name="09061854000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000305"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> It strikes me that we would rather the Secretary
of State had virtually no control over issues that really are for
decision by local government. With regard to the paper that has been
mentioned a few times, it is fair to say that we prefer &#147;control
delete&#148; to &#147;Control
Shift&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061854000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000306"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> That was an amusing intervention from my hon.
Friend. It is clear that, while we have been debating the Bill, there
have been considerable changes&#151;not only to the Secretary of
State responsible for such matters, but to Ministers. I congratulate
the new Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury&#151;I understand that
she has been moved in the past 24 hours. I wonder whether Ministers,
Departments and their policies are moving beyond that paper. Will the
Minister responsible respond to that? More generally, how do the powers
that the Secretary of State mentioned in the newspaper yesterday relate
to multi-area agreements?</div>
<a name="09061854000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000307"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Unfortunately, I have not yet had time to read
the article that the hon. Lady refers to, but I can reassure the
Committee, because there is a recognition that local authorities have
asked for more robust multi-area 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>agreements so that duties are placed on partner authorities. The vivid
illustration that I asked for yesterday when discussing the matter with
officials was raised earlier by the right hon. Member for Skipton and
Ripon. His point was that if there is a desire in North Yorkshire for
the authorities to come together&#151;perhaps in a multi-area
agreement&#151;there may be a need to sign up the regional
development agency. The idea was that, within that multi-area
agreement, duties would need to be fulfilled. Local authorities
consider that that gives more reassurance, when putting together plans
for future economic development, that they have an agreement that needs
to be fulfilled by the various different
bodies.</div>
<a name="09061854000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to offer reassurance to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and
the hon. Member for Wycombe. This is not about imposing
targets&#151;every authority or partner to whom a target relates must
agree to that target for it to apply to them. We are trying to achieve
a consensus about working together, while responding to the points that
local authorities have made about proper backing through duties being
appropriate for them. I hope that I have reassured hon. Members and
that the clause will stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061854000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000308"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Lilley</b> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con): I want to make
a pedantic point. Since I do not understand any of this new jargon, I
have tried to look it up to see what it means and to find out what a
multi-area agreement is. Clause 134 says that
a</div><a name="09061854000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;multi-area
agreement&#146; has the meaning given by section
118(2)&#148;.</div><a name="09061854000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
went back to the first mention of it, to find that the provision says
that a multi-area agreement is a document that &#147;covers an
area&#148; and specifies targets. It does not say who it is an
agreement between. It could be an agreement between you and me,
Mr. Amess. I take it that it is meant to be an agreement
between local authorities, although the Bill does not say
so.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000312"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> No, clause 118(2)(a) says, &#147;covers an
area&#148;. We could make an agreement about Essex or
Hertfordshire&#151;or something like that, but that is the area that
we cover&#151;and we could set targets, although they would not apply
unless the person to whom they should apply agreed, as a later clause
says. The Bill should spell out the sort of people between whom such
agreements should be made. The drafting is
sloppy.</div><a name="09061854000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): It might
help if I provide the Committee with a little background to the
evolution of the local area agreement concept, which preceded
multi-area agreements and had a similar objective. They evolved in
discussions between the Local Government Association and the Department
for Communities and Local Government, which then had a different
name.</div><a name="09061854000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agreements were concerned with providing maximum flexibility to local
authorities and their local partners in developing targets for
improving people&#146;s living standards, whether in economic,
environmental or social well-being terms. The obvious weakness of that
mode, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>nevertheless was welcomed by all concerned, was that it applied only to
one area, and the whole purpose of multi-area agreements is to apply
the same flexibility to a wider area, thus embracing a number of
different authorities.</div>
<a name="09061854000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, I drew attention to the fact that, in my borough of Greenwich,
we are in discussion with the four other neighbouring Olympic
authorities to reach a multi-area agreement with the objective of
delivering&#151;for the people of Greenwich, Newham, Tower Hamlets,
Waltham Forest and Hackney&#151;improved outputs in relation to some
of the great priorities facing those areas. In particular, it would
improve employment prospects, tackle problems of joblessness and
improve housing conditions. It would also bring improvements to the
public
realm.</div><a name="09061854000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are admirable objectives, but they embrace a huge number of possible
options and partners. The negotiations on the local area
agreement&#151;or multi-area agreement, in the case of the five
Olympic boroughs&#151;are progressing, but the process is not easy;
it is complex and involves many potential players. That might explain
why it is not possible to be too prescriptive in legislation about the
precise nature of the agreements and partners. That could prove
restrictive.</div>
<a name="09061854000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much of the
debate in Committee has been about how far local government should
enjoy greater flexibility and freedom to develop objectives that local
authorities think appropriate, and the multi-area agreement concept
will make a major contribution to that. I would therefore counsel the
right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden not to seek too tight a
definition. That might work against the objective of allowing
flexibility for local authorities and their partners to evolve
appropriate multi-area agreements.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000314"></a>Dan

councils&#146;.</div><a name="09061854000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first part of the amendment would delete the reference to economic
prosperity boards, which is in line with other amendments that we
tabled, but they were not selected. As we have discussed already, we
wanted to delete the whole concept from the Bill, but we seem to have
moved on and acknowledged that EPBs might have a role to offer, so we
will not seek to push the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="09061854000246"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09061854000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also insert &#147;parish councils&#148; into the
clause, although the Minister might feel that this is not the
appropriate clause&#151;perhaps they could be dealt with under
partner authorities. Nevertheless, we have debated the evolving nature
of parish councils, particularly in areas that now have unitary
councils. That is a situation with which I am now more familiar. Larger
parish councils in places such as Wiltshire and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>Shropshire are, in consultation with those authorities, considering
taking on further roles and perhaps professionalising what they have
done hitherto. As they have a developing role, I should like to see
somewhere in this concept of multi-area agreements provision for parish
councils to be able to contribute.</div>
<a name="09061854000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many parish
councils may not yet be ready for such a concept, but with the equality
status process moving forward, the aspirations of parish
councils&#151;particularly the larger ones&#151;are changing. The
right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon was right to point out that for
many smaller parish councils, such a suggestion will not be
appropriate.</div><a name="09061854000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000315"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point,
especially given the experiences of preparing for local government
reorganisation in Cornwall, where it is very difficult for the parish
councils to have an input even though they may be taking on a greater
role. Even in the case of smaller parish councils, is it not the case
that if they are considering working together it may be appropriate for
them to be considered? I am talking about another layer of multi-area
agreement.</div><a name="09061854000129"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000318"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I am sure
that that is the process. It may be that some of that is formalised and
we will see smaller parish councils coming together to form larger
parish councils. Such a process is under way in some areas. That can
happen in consultation with the local authority and does not need the
Secretary of State&#146;s involvement. That is an issue that has been
devolved, and that we
welcome.</div><a name="09061854000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about parish councils, which, two reorganisations ago, were
urban districts or boroughs and were building housing and carrying out
all sorts of functions. There is a desire to be flexible and consider
delivering services at the most appropriate local level. What I want
from the Minister is some guidance about how she intends to involve
parish councils in this process&#151;whether it will be listed under
local authorities under clause 119 or under partner authorities next
time. I have a feeling that partner authorities does not quite cover
it, because they tend to be other forms of bodies rather than elected
organisations.</div><a name="09061854000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061854000319"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): I wonder whether the
hon. Gentleman sees any implication for the precepting process in his

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000320"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I served in a borough council that was
part-parished and part-unparished, and there was always conflict. The
parished areas felt that some services were not being provided for them
directly, and they would effectively say, &#147;Well, you can put it
on the precept, can&#146;t you?&#148; Such an attitude would be a
concern. None the less, it would be a shame if there were no method for
the parish councils to be involved in the process. As I said, this is a
probing amendment, and I want some thoughts from the Government about
how these significant local bodies can be
involved.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000321"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that parish
councils play an extremely important role in supporting their local
communities. That is why in December we extended the well-being power
to certain parish and town councils. The real problem is that there is
a large number of parish councils&#151;more than 8,000&#151;and it
is not appropriate to add them to the list of MAAs. It would inevitably
make the process much more complicated. None the less, I want to
reassure the hon. Gentleman that in preparing a draft MAA, the
responsible authority has to consult such other persons as it considers
appropriate. Therefore, if it was appropriate within an area to consult
a parish council, then we would expect the local authorities to do
so.</div><a name="09061854000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000322"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am slightly disappointed by that response. I
accept that it would be inappropriate for all 8,000 parishes&#151;it
is a growing number, because parishes are being formed in urban
areas&#151;automatically to be involved in multi-area agreements. The
whole point of multi-area agreements, as the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich said, is their flexibility. If we are seeking a
process that allows involvement for different bodies, as appropriate, I
think that it is a shame that there is no flexibility. For example, in
my area, Newquay town council covers an area containing about 20,000
people.</div>
<a name="09061854000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000323"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> I do not know whether it is the case in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s part of the world, but in my part of the world a
significant number of the elected members of the bigger parish councils
also sit on the district council or even the county
council.</div>
<a name="09061854000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000324"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> That is sometimes the case, but it is not
universal; it is perhaps an accident, happy or otherwise. If we are
looking to allow flexibility, we could not necessarily count on that,
but the different bodies have different roles. If people are elected to
two authorities they must be careful to deal with the issues
appropriate to each authority.</div>
<a name="09061854000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I saying not
that all parish councils must be involved, but that if they want to be
involved and if the other partners in that multi-area agreement think
it appropriate, there is a facility for them to become involved. They
could take a more direct role, not simply being consultees but
delivering services or providing facilities for services to be
delivered, as many town parish councils have significant property
available to them.</div>
<a name="09061854000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
welcome it if the Minister were prepared to consider the matter again.
It would be useful to know whether the Government were tempted. If not,
it will send the message to parish councils that once again they are
not seen as being sufficiently involved. That would be a shame, as
their role is developing.</div>
<a name="09061854000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000325"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The Liberal Democrats believe that the
provision is too prescriptive and that we are telling everybody what to
do, but in this instance we are saying that is it up to the responsible
authorities to use their judgment and to allow consultation. For the
reasons that I gave earlier, I believe that we have the balance
right.</div><a name="09061854000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000326"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The Minister is seeking to cloud the issue by
talking about being prescriptive. I have said that the amendment would
not compel anyone to be involved, but merely allow them to become

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000329"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> We have had an interesting discussion about
what constitutes a local authority. We now move on to discuss what
constitutes a partner authority. The amendments, in my name and that of
my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall, relate to the role of the
Secretary of State as a partner authority under subsection (4)(j), and
the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to add or remove organisations
that may constitute a partner authority under subsection (5). The
amendments seek to do two things.</div>
<a name="09061854000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) specifies a number of persons or organisations that are defined as
partner authorities under subsection (1), but none of those listed
in  subsection (4) are directly democratically accountable
except the Secretary of State. Subsection (1)(a) clearly states that a
partner authority is</div>
<a name="09061854000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
person...where the whole or any part of the area for which the
person acts or is established coincides with or falls within that
area&#148;.</div><a name="09061854000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
subsection (4)(j) specifies only limited areas in which the Secretary
of State is considered to be a partner authority in relation to
multi-area agreements.</div>
<a name="09061854000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our argument
is that if the Secretary of State is to be a partner authority, he or
she should be a partner authority in other respects, not only in those
limited ones. I realise that it is not the Secretary of State in
person, but anyone who represents that office. It  would be
helpful if the Minister were to clarify the matter, but if the
Secretary of State is to be a partner authority it should not be
confined or limited as set out in subsection
(4).</div><a name="09061854000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
subsection (5), we can see that the list in the previous subsection
might not be exhaustive, and that there might be some justification for
extending it. We are concerned that subsection (5) gives the Secretary
of State the power to include or exclude whoever he or she wants,
whenever he or she wants. Although it might be appropriate to add
bodies, we would not want the Secretary of State to be able to remove
bodies just as easily. The two amendments, therefore, would confine and
restrict the significant power of the Secretary of State. There is a
more level playing field if everyone has equal roles and
responsibilities in working together in a multi-area
agreement.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="09061854000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000330"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Clause 120 lists the partner authorities for
the purposes of MAAs with duties. That list is the same as the list of
partner authorities for local area agreements set out in the Local
Government and Public Involvement in Heath Act 2007. If, as has been
requested by local government, we are going to put MAAs on a similar
statutory footing to LAAs, it is obviously appropriate that the lists
of partners are consistent. Amendment 159 would remove
reference to the functions of the Secretary of State that are carried
out by Jobcentre Plus, the Highways Agency and the probation service.
That would have the effect of making the Secretary of State a partner
authority for all purposes. I think that that relates to some previous
amendments, as perhaps the hon. Lady has said, which were tabled out of
a concern about the statutory role of the Secretary of State in the
approval of MAAs. There is, therefore, a problem with the
amendment.</div><a name="09061854000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
160 would prevent the Secretary of State from removing bodies from the
list of partner authorities. The problem with that is that it would
prevent the Secretary of State from making changes to take account of
changes in the machinery of government, and from keeping the list up to
date. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the
amendments.</div><a name="09061854000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000331"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Although I do not intend to press the
amendments, I am not entirely sure whether  the Minister has
answered all the questions that the amendments raise. She seems
perfectly happy for the responsibilities of all the other authorities
listed in subsection (4) to be covered by the definition in
subsection
(1):</div><a name="09061854000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
whole or any part of the area for which the person acts or is
established coincides with or falls within that
area&#148;.</div><a name="09061854000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that definition of the extent of responsibilities is good enough for
every other body listed in subsection (4), why is it not
good enough for the Secretary of State? Why is it not clear enough? I
do not think that the Minister has answered that
question.</div><a name="09061854000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of the ability to amend the list goes back to the
Minister&#146;s assumption that the Government will always act in the
best interests. Although I can, of course, envisage circumstances in
which bodies are disbanded or new ones are created and the list needs
to be amended, subsection (5) allows the Secretary of State to not only
remove authorities that no longer exist but to remove authorities that
it might not be convenient or expedient to have on the list. I wonder
why the list cannot simply be amended by regulation, so that there is
an opportunity for scrutiny of what is on the list, rather than by
order of the Secretary of State. I remain concerned about those two
issues, but given what we have to get through today it might take too
much time to press the
amendments.</div><a name="09061854000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000332"></a>Ms

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000334"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> The Committee will know that my worries come from
the actions of a group of authorities. They could be operating under a
multi-area agreement, and have predatory intentions outside their area
that will affect another local authority. My two concerns might be
relevant to the clause, but they arise from a lack of clarity under
clause 118, which states that a multi-area
agreement</div><a name="09061854000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specifies
improvement targets for that
area.&#148;</div><a name="09061854000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if the authorities are achieving improvements in, say, Luton, by
building houses in north Hertfordshire, what happens then? Can the
Minister, under the clause, require them to include north Herts in the
multi-area agreement so that the local authority that is being impinged
upon in the pursuit of a target, which does not relate to it but is the
housing target for Luton and south Bedfordshire, will be included in
the multi-area agreement?</div>
<a name="09061854000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the rather
sinister goings on between Luton and south Bedfordshire to specify an
area for building in north Herts, a meeting took place involving Luton
council, South Bedfordshire council, the Minister&#146;s
Department&#151;before she was in office&#151;and a private
developer. A development agency can be a party to a multi-area
agreement, but will the right hon. Lady make it absolutely clear beyond
peradventure that a private developer cannot be part of the agreement
or party to an authority or document seeking to improve Luton by
building in Hertfordshire? All hon. Members can think of parallel
circumstances that might affect their constituencies, and I should be
grateful if the Minister responded to that
point.</div><a name="09061854000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000335"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Private developers would not be part of a
multi-area agreement; which authorities can be part is set out clearly.
The whole concept of a multi-area agreement is that different
authorities sign up and agree to the targets. Local authorities have
said to us that they want a similar process to local area agreements
because that would mean a stronger statutory basis for operating the
multi-area
agreement.</div><a name="09061854000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000336"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, who is endeavouring
to be helpful and positive. Clause 118
states:</div><a name="09061854000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specifies
improvement targets for that
area&#148;,</div><a name="09061854000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather
than &#147;in&#148; that area. Given that the courts take into
account what Ministers say, will she make it clear that this is meant
to apply to targets for and in the area of the local
authorities&#151;not just for an area&#151;but achieved by actions
taking place outside the
area?</div><a name="09061854000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000337"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I would be extremely surprised if the targets
not owned by local authorities in an area could somehow apply outside
an area. I suspect that the drafting was carried out on legal
advice.</div><a name="09061854000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000338"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I rise merely to raise a speculative point that
will create an almost impossible difficulty for the right hon. Member
for Hitchin and Harpenden. If the multi-area agreement was to produce a
target for improving air quality, it would be completely impossible to
define the way to achieve that target so that it related only to the
area of the authorities making the agreement, because the very nature
of the target would have wider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>implications. That is why it is not wise for us to be unduly
prescriptive in seeking to define the role of a multi-area agreement. I
hear exactly the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Multi-area
agreements will not necessarily be concerned solely with housing. They
could be concerned with a number of other provisions, such as air
quality, for which there would be an obvious intellectual difficulty in
coming up with the formulation that he is pressing
towards.</div><a name="09061854000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000339"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> On the north Herts scenario, I re-emphasise
that north Herts would agree to a target only if it was happy with it.
The target that it signs up to must apply to its functions; and it is
not bound to any target if it does not sign up for it. I hope that that
is
helpful.</div><a name="09061854000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000340"></a>Mr.
Lilley:</b> In fact, it undoes some of the good that the
Minister was doing earlier. The point is not that north Herts has
signed up to the Luton housing target&#151;a target imposed on Luton
and south Beds by central Government. They are trying to fulfil their
target, for their area, by building outside the area. The right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich supposed that that could be a problem
in respect of other functions. What if Greenwich were to try to improve
the quality of air in Greenwich&#151;in my experience, of a high
calibre already&#151;by building a waste-disposal plant in someone
else&#146;s constituency, so that all the fumes from the waste
processes in Greenwich were disseminated in Bromley, say? Would that be
within the powers established by the Bill for a multi-area agreement,
in a case where Bromley is not part of that
agreement?</div><a name="09061854000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000343"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Although the amendments have been grouped
with clause 121, they relate right the way through clauses 121 to 129.
Considering them together is logical, because the next part of the Bill
seeks to set out the mechanics of how multi-area agreements work: how
they are initiated, how the proposals move forward, and how they are
prepared, approved, submitted and
revised.</div><a name="09061854000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Minister&#146;s earlier remarks on multi-area agreements, she
spoke of local authorities&#146; demand that multi-area agreements be
put on a statutory footing. However, what concerns we Liberal Democrats
is not only that almost every stage of the progress of multi-area
agreements&#151;their initiation, proposal, preparation, approval,
revision and submission&#151;is dependent on the Secretary of
State&#146;s approval, but that every stage could be initiated by
direction of the Secretary of the State. It is difficult for the
process to be purely bottom-up if, at every stage, the Secretary of
State can direct a multi-area agreement to be revised, initiated or
proposed. That concerns us greatly, because it could undermine what,
according to the Minister, multi-area agreements are there to achieve,
which is to allow local authorities to work together. They are not
there to allow groups of local authorities to work together under the
direction of the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09061854000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
proposals would allow local authorities to notify the Secretary of
State of their intention to put forward a multi-area agreement, rather
saying to the Secretary of State that they would like to do so. The
amendments put all the power firmly in the hands of the local
authorities that will be delivering the multi-area agreements, rather
than in the hands of the Secretary of State. That is the principle we
are seeking to establish. We are trying to establish a clear, bottom-up
process, rather than the top-down one that we fear is being perpetuated
through these
clauses.</div><a name="09061854000188"></a>

terms of aspiration, what the Liberal Democrats are doing is
remarkable. In terms of practicality, I do not think a great deal of
it. Frankly, multi-area agreements are often brokered by Government
offices, which play a huge part in their development. The powers of the
Secretary of State often give a sort of back-stop to the agreements for
local authorities. I suspect that local authorities would not welcome a
provision that cut them loose so dramatically from the Secretary of
State, not least because he is a participator in multi-area agreements.
I admire the optimism behind the proposals, but in the real world local
authorities are not unhappy with such tutelage, and in many respects
need it. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>Secretary of State and his powers are part of multi-area agreements.
Obviously, those agreements that are going to have a statutory
power&#151;multi-area agreements with attitude&#151;need the
Secretary of State to be welded into this process. As always, the key
is how the Secretary of State exercises the
powers.</div><a name="09061854000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
history of multi-area agreements is not bad. A series of them have been
signed in south Yorkshire and in Lancashire, for example. The
representations I have received show that people are happy with the
process and are quite optimistic. As I said, given that there are so
many participants&#151;including a significant number who are not
directly democratically accountable&#151;the big issue is how the
citizen can find a way in and feel that their voice is being heard in
the extraordinarily complex landscape we are
developing.</div><a name="09061854000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000347"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I cannot but observe that the right hon.
Gentleman has said something with which I wholly concur. The hon.
Member for Wycombe may wish to recall our debate last week, in which I
was categorised not quite as a Stalinist, but as someone who advocates
a little helpful hand on the tiller from Government to achieve results
that local authorities might not achieve by themselves. I wholly concur
with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments, in which he advocated
a little helpful hand on the tiller from central Government to assist
local authorities. I hope that the hon. Member for Wycombe will reflect
that, far from there being a major divide on this issue, the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view is almost entirely in agreement with
mine.</div><a name="09061854000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000348"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Let me say just two things. The points made by
my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and the
right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon are exactly
right.</div><a name="09061854000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
confirm that the Secretary of State&#146;s power of direction is just
a formal mechanism that acts as a trigger for the duty for local
authorities and partner authorities to co-operate in determining the
improvement targets to be set out in the draft agreement. The Secretary
of State can issue the direction only if it is requested by the local
authorities for the proposed area. The process is still voluntary at
its inception. Local authorities do not have to go down the route of an
MAA with duties if they do not want to. They can still choose a
non-statutory MAA as an alternative. The process is entirely a response
to local authorities&#146; wish to have this power. As I said, it is
necessary to have a mechanism that involves the Secretary of State to
trigger to the duties. With that, I hope that the hon. Lady will
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061854000248"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000349"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The Minister has just said that the Secretary
of State&#146;s direction can come only following a request from
local authorities, but the powers in these clauses presumably also
allow the Secretary of State not to make a direction following a
request. The Secretary of State says that the process is nothing but a
formality and that these are the words that we need to ensure that what
local authorities want will happen, but that formality perhaps gives an
important and clear statement of who is in control.</div>
<a name="09061854000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had some
interesting contributions from what may described as the worshipful
company of previous Local Government Ministers. That provides an
interesting  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>insight into what we have not had in the debate&#151;a contribution by
former councillors. What we are seeing is the perspective of those who
have been Ministers&#151;they may also have been
councillors&#151;and who have signed the directions.</div>
<a name="09061854000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says that the process is a formality, but the amendments would say that
the Secretary of State must be involved only on an equal footing.
However, the powers that are being reserved are not equal, and there is
ultimately a lot in the gift of the Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="09061854000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that
the hon. Member for Wycombe did not speak perhaps implies that, despite
the language in &#147;Control Shift&#148;, his sympathies lie more
with the contribution made by the former Minister. However,
we are still very much &#147;control-alt-delete&#148;,
rather than &#147;Control Shift&#148;. For that reason,
I will press amendment
161.</div><a name="09061854000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000361"></a>Mr.
Curry:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Amess. I just
wish to point out that neither Whip was present in the room until very

Perhaps the Government Whip might consider withdrawing to facilitate
our continued progress.</div>

Bill.</div><a name="09061854000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000363"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The Committee may know that we tabled an
amendment to clause 135, but, sadly, it was not selected. This and
following clauses will amend the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act
1996&#151;colloquially known as the construction Act&#151;to
overhaul the aspects of the legislation that deal with cash flow,
adjudication and unreasonable delays in payment.</div>
<a name="09061854000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face
of it, clause 135 is quite straightforward, and this issue has had
quite an airing in past years. To give them their due, the Government
have tried to move on from the significant consultation that took place
in respect of the 1996 Act to make the improvements outlined, beginning
some years ago with the Latham review on unreasonable delays in payment
and adjudication and the payment provisions arising from the Act. The
matter has been taken forward by both the former Department of Trade
and Industry and the Welsh Assembly and has been subject to two
separate and exhaustive public consultations and a significant amount
of lobbying&#151;no doubt, for members of the Committee and before
that.</div><a name="09061854000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
our amendment to the clause has not been selected, I shall just make a
simple point that bears repetition. The Construction Confederation has
raised issues relating to the clause and makes this
point:</div><a name="09061854000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
will undermine industry &#145;best practice&#146; of encouraging
contracts to be in
writing.</div><a name="09061854000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">It
will inevitably lead to the examination of who agreed what with whom,
with each party making representations to the
adjudicator.</div><a name="09061854000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">It
raises the question as to how such a procedure (which will inevitably
require oral representation and examination during the course of an
adjudication) can be incorporated within what is already the short
statutory timescale for adjudication (usually two
months).&#148;</div><a name="09061854000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
confederation makes this pertinent
point:</div><a name="09061854000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Swift
adjudication remains the most effective way to tackle non-payment.
Introducing oral or part oral contracts within its scope will increase
costs and delay the
process.&#148;</div><a name="09061854000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause did not have a very significant outing in the other place, but I
would like to ask the Exchequer Secretary about it. Incidentally, I was
remiss in not congratulating her at the outset on her promotion. We are
getting quite giddy at new Communities and Local Government Ministers
on the magic roundabout that is Government reshuffles, but she had not
been long in her
role.</div><a name="09061854000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000364"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> This is a helpful suggestion to the Government
Whips: given the repeated helpful and learned interventions of the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, perhaps he could fill any
temporary vacancy by coming to the Minister&#146;s
place.</div><a name="09061854000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061854000365"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> My hon. Friend makes an astute observation.
