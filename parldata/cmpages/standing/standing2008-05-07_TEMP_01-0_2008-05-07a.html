of hon. Members that if anyone wishes to take off their jacket, please
do so. Will they also ensure that mobile phones are on vibrate or
silent? I remind the Committee that, as a general rule, adequate notice

proceedings on the Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill
are not completed at this day&#146;s sitting, the Committee do meet
on Wednesdays (except for Wednesday 4th June) when the House is sitting
at half-past Nine
o&#146;clock.</div>
					<a name="08050764000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the second time that I have served under your chairmanship,
Mr. Hancock, and the first when I have been leading on a

way.</div>

							<a name="08050764000241"></a>Andrew
Miller:
						</b> Too long, but no doubt we agree wholeheartedly
that any attempt to amend the sittings motion so that the Committee
sits on 17 May should be regarded as out of order, given that there is
an important match on that day.</div>
					<a name="08050764000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
something of an unusual sittings motion for a private Member&#146;s
Bill, given that we are sitting on Wednesday mornings with the
exception of 4 June. The Regulatory Reform Committee of which I am
Chairman is undertaking a small study that will result in the hon.
Member for Solihull and I being out of the country on that day. That is
the reason for the exception.</div>
					<a name="08050764000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
indulgence, Mr. Hancock, and that of your fellow Chairman,
Mr. Martlew, I shall at an appropriate time come back to the
Committee with an amendment to the sittings motion to enable us to
complete our business, but several events make that inappropriate at
present. My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and
Postal Affairs and the hon. Member for Huntingdon referred to such
matters last night in the debate on the money
resolution.</div>
					<a name="08050764000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
discussion is being held outside this place to address a matter that
all members of the Committee believe needs to be resolved at the
earliest date. It concerns a proper mechanism and whether the solution
lies with the Bill or with a different process that no doubt my hon.
Friend the Minister will explain in some detail. It is appropriate that
the Committee is appraised of the progress that has been made in
discussions. That will be particularly helpful because it will set the
tenor of how we progress through the Bill and identify the fundamental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>divisions between the parties. That started to show itself yesterday
evening when we were discussing the money resolution.</div>
					<a name="08050764000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the vote on the
money resolution has yet to take place. If it is negatived or if we get
to clause 4 today&#151;I doubt that we will&#151;we will be in a
slightly difficult position. If the vote on the money resolution is
negatived this afternoon, I propose to come forward with amendments to
remove the necessity for a money resolution. However, that would not
give the kind of flexibility that I think the current Minister and
future Ministers would need to create the right mechanism to address
the problem before
us.</div>
					<a name="08050764000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will chastise
me, Mr. Hancock, if I go into too much detail on the
substance of the Bill, but suffice it to say its core aim is to create
equal treatment for a class of workers who are currently in a
disadvantaged position. I would have thought that in this day and age
there would be no difference of opinion across the political parties on
the need to address such an issue.</div>
					<a name="08050764000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000242"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I have to interrupt you, Mr.
Miller, as you are inviting chastisement if you continue down that
line. We are talking about the sittings motion and you have got as far
as you can on
that.</div>
					<a name="08050764000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000243"></a>Andrew
Miller:
						</b> I spotted where I was going and
was gradually bringing the sentence back round to be in order. The
purpose of the approach that I am adopting with the sittings motion is
to create the maximum opportunity for the discussions that are going on
outside this place to come to a conclusion so that we will, I hope, be
in a position either to invite the Committee to amend the Bill further
or consider a different approach, depending on where the Government get
to in those
discussions.</div>
					<a name="08050764000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
of the constraints of the sittings motion and the need to keep in
order, I will stop my remarks there, but I hope that you will agree
with me, Mr. Hancock, that it would be extremely helpful to
the Committee in facilitating its plans if Her Majesty&#146;s
Government could give us a clear picture on where those discussions
have got
to.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): I apologise for
missing the beginning of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s opening remarks.
He might have covered this point, but could he explain, if for no one
else&#146;s benefit but mine, why he does not want to sit on the 4
June if we do not complete matters
today.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000245"></a>Andrew
Miller:

simply because I will be out of the country on Select Committee
business, as will the Liberal Democrat
spokesman.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000246"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> It is slightly out of the ordinary but to
facilitate the working of the Committee, it would be helpful if the
Minister could make a brief statement. I discussed that with the
Opposition and with the Liberal Democrats and it will be a brief
statement that is open to challenge if Members so
choose.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>
					<a name="08050764000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000247"></a>The
Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr.
Pat McFadden):
						</b> May I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Hancock? I should begin by congratulating my hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston on his success in bringing the
Bill to Committee stage. On Second Reading, I stated that the
Government&#146;s position was that we do not support the Bill, but
share many of the overall aspirations of its promoter and its other
supporters. It is not the best vehicle for achieving such aims, but I
will say something about the Government&#146;s view on these
issues.</div>
					<a name="08050764000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The backdrop
to the measure begins with the draft European directive on temporary
and agency workers, which has been under discussion for some time in
Europe. The Government are engaged with the Commission and other member
states in trying to seek agreement on the directive. That route is the
best mechanism for dealing with the issue of temporary and agency
working. If we legislate through the Bill or something similar, the
danger is that such legislation would be subject to change in the
relatively near future, should the directive become law.</div>
					<a name="08050764000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
impetus behind the Bill has been the view that the directive is
unlikely to become law, and therefore we should legislate domestically.
However, at the meeting of the European Employment Council in December,
the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
made it clear that the UK would continue to work with the European
Commission and other member states to try to reach agreement on the
directive.</div>
					<a name="08050764000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
issues in the directive remain open for discussion with regard to the
extent of equal treatment and where and how it should apply. We have
made it clear that from the Government&#146;s point of view, the
current text on some of those issues is not satisfactory. Our proposal
tries to deal with those issues and to square this circle. The
directive is not only about the equal treatment of agency workers, but
about the liberalisation of the agency sector&#151;something on which
the Bill is silent. That is an important part of the package at
European level.</div>
					<a name="08050764000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s proposal tries to take the issue forward. The
backdrop is a draft directive that allows flexibility for other member
states with different types of labour markets and different traditions
of engagement between unions, business organisations and social
partners on such matters. That includes draft derogations for certain
member states with specific institutions that relate to payment between
assignments, or the fixing of basic working and employment conditions
by collective bargaining for member states who use that labour market
model. The Government proposal is a carefully drawn alternative measure
underpinned by a bottom-line requirement to ensure an adequate level of
protection for workers. We seek to bring social partners together to
consult at a national level and to discuss basic working and employment
conditions to achieve the directive&#146;s goal of fair treatment for
agency workers. That is important because it relates both to UK
conditions and European
measures.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000248"></a>The

to a conclusion, Mr. McFadden, now that you have described
what has gone on. I will then invite members of the Committee to
comment. One or two Members have suggested that this has nothing to do
with the sittings motion, but I was endeavouring to help the Committee
get a feel for where the Government were going on the issue in order to
enable the debate to move forward in what I hope will be a progressive
manner. Mr. McFadden, I invite you to bring your remarks to
an
end.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000253"></a>Mr.
McFadden:
						</b> I appreciate your guidance, Mr.
Hancock. You have been extremely helpful in guiding me and the
Committee. The point I am trying to make is that the Government have
introduced a proposal to consider the issue of agency workers at a UK
level in a way that would fit with the directive and obviate the need
for us to legislate on the issue twice, which is the
danger.</div>
					<a name="08050764000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the sittings motion, I believe that we are meeting in Committee at the
same time as discussions are taking place. A conclusion has not yet
been reached, and our social partners have not yet agreed to take part
in the process. The Government see significant potential in the kind of
process that I have set out. It would involve our social partners and
would have the advantage of our not having to return to legislate on
the same issue after these deliberations have
concluded.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000254"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I shall want to speak later to the sittings
motion, Mr. Hancock, but on this point, if that is the case,
why do the Government not suggest that, or table a motion to the effect
that, the Committee adjourn until such time as the discussions in
Europe have been
completed?</div>
					<a name="08050764000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000255"></a>Mr.
McFadden:
						</b> The sittings motion is in the
hands of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, but I
point out to the Committee that the danger of our reaching a conclusion
on a domestic Bill such as this is that we would have to return to the
issue. That is why the Government believe that a UK proposal that
reflects the directive is the best way to deal with the
matter.</div>
					<a name="08050764000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08050764000256"></a>
							<b class="B">Adam
Price</b> (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr) (PC):
The Minister mentioned the discussions happening at
EU level. Could he say a little about the discussions happening in the
UK between trade unions and the Government? To what extent do they have
a bearing on the
issue?</div>
					<a name="08050764000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000257"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. We must be careful not
to resurrect the Second Reading debate and go back over old ground. I
understand the question, Mr. Price, and I hope that the
Minister will briefly answer it. Then we will move on quickly to other
Members who want to comment on the sittings motion and on what the
Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>has said. To be fair to the Bill, we need to do it in that way. The hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, who is presenting the Bill, has
to think long and hard about what has been said by Members, which might
not be
unhelpful.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000258"></a>Mr.

your guidance. The discussions are ongoing. They are active, but they
have not reached a
conclusion.</div>
					<a name="08050764000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not need to detain the Committee further. I have set out the
Government&#146;s broad proposal, which I reassure the Committee is a
live proposal. We believe that it is the best way to deal with the
issue. I have spoken about it today to inform members of the Committee
about it before we begin consideration of the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000259"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Hancock. I do not think I have ever served on a Bill
Committee where the Minister has been so critical of the sittings
motion. It appears that the Committee has a dilemma. The sittings
motion has been moved, yet the Minister says that it would be better to
delay our deliberations. Moreover, in the light of the fact that the
House has not yet determined the money resolution, would you be
prepared to accept a manuscript amendment to the sittings motion,
Mr. Hancock, to deal with the difficulties that have arisen
during the
debate?</div>
					<a name="08050764000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000260"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> It is up to the Committee to
decide how to deal with the sittings motion. Members should think long
and hard about what has been said and the advice that has been given. I
do not believe that it would be right for the Chairman to accept a
manuscript amendment at this stage; that is the advice that I am
getting.</div>
					<a name="08050764000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must now
discuss the sittings motion and the implications of what the Minister
has said. I urge the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston to think
long and hard about the
matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000261"></a>Mr.

						</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.

negatived the sittings motion and the Bill therefore had before it no
sittings

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000262"></a>The

						</b> Were that to happen today, the Member in charge
would have to facilitate a further meeting of the Committee to enable a
further sittings motion. That is in the hands of the Committee. It is a
bit messy, I am sorry to say, but an inevitability of that would be
that we would have to find another date, set the Committee again, and
the Member would have to come forward with a further sittings
motion.</div>

						</b> Thank you, Mr.

for you because in some ways, we are continuing a conversation that
started rather late last night, as you have probably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>gathered by now. We addressed this issue then&#151;or, more to the
point, I addressed it. I pointed out clearly the dilemma and the
contradictions in the Government&#146;s position on the timing of the
negotiations on the directive in Brussels, the ongoing negotiations
with various parties to the Bill, and the Government&#146;s rather
weak and failing earlier attempt at a compromise&#151;setting up a
commission between the unions and business, which seems to have been
going rather pear-shaped. The net effect is that three different
processes are
running.</div>
					<a name="08050764000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased that the timing implications are now at least being admitted
by the Government, which I do not think they were by the Minister last
night on the Floor of the House. At least this morning he admits that
this process is undermining the Government process that is running in
Brussels, and that we need to address that. I am not entirely sure that
the debate so far has addressed that. In some ways, the situation is
looking even more confusing than ever. The only rational outcome that I
can see of what the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the
Minister had to say is that we defer the Committee until we know what
is going on in Europe, and until the Government have heard from the
committee they set up to take soundings on this issue. Until that
happens, I think that we must oppose the motion. I hope that the
Government see sense on this and support us. Yes, we will discuss this
issue, but we do not want contradictory Bills running through the
House. If anything, that would create a huge headache for the
Government.</div>
					<a name="08050764000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
difference between the positions of various Government Members. The
Minister made a case for what is happening in Europe, and talked about
some key issues for employment in this country. If anything, the
Government should make a statement on the Floor of the House, not an
aside in a sittings motion debate in a Committee. He may therefore wish
to consider whether he should make such a statement on what is a very
important issue for British business. On the other hand, the hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston seems to be using this as leverage
for the union rebels&#146; position, keeping it hanging over the
Government&#146;s head just in case. Given the seriousness of the
issues we are discussing, that is unacceptable and I ask him to
reconsider. Let us face it&#151;all parties are in agreement that the
Bill should not be passed. I therefore ask that he reconsider and that
the Committee be
adjourned.</div>

find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Huntingdon. Given
what we have heard so far, it would be best on all sides if we deferred
the Committee stage. I understand the strength of feeling among Members
on the Labour Benches who have striven for a long time for this Bill,
which they consider would rectify an inequality that exists for agency
workers. It is important that they have their say, even though I and
Conservative members of the Committee will not necessarily subscribe to
the view that it is an inequality. However and as the Minister said,
all three parties, in the main, do not support the Bill. The Government
are engaged on European legislation that duplicates the work of the
Committee, and on Second Reading on 22 February the Minister said that
he would create a commission with the TUC and the CBI to take the issue
forward. We are not trying to ditch the Committee stage, but it would
help if we applied a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>more appropriate time frame to the Bill. That is why deferment of
consideration would be appropriate at this stage, and for the benefit
of
all.</div>

						</b> I join others in welcoming you to the Chair,
Mr. Hancock. I make no criticism of the hon. Member for
Ellesmere Port and Neston for exempting 4 June; I was grateful for his
explanation, and one can understand why he does not want the Committee
to sit on that date. However, I found it bizarre that he went on reveal
that if the House took a negative view of the money resolution, our
deliberations today might be in vain because he would have
substantially to amend the Bill. For that reason alone, we should not
proceed with today&#146;s sitting. The Minister then gave other,
perhaps even more weighty reasons for doing so when he referred to
discussions taking place
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="08050764000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the attitude of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and
Neston&#151;the Bill is his baby and he wants to get on with
it&#151;but it is incumbent on the Committee to take a more objective
view and to ask, &#147;What is the best way to proceed?&#148; I do
not want to deny the hon. Gentleman a Committee stage, but I would
prefer it to take place after we know the view of the House on the
money resolution and after the Minister has concluded at least some of
the negotiations that are taking place, so that he can tell us what the
position is, which hopefully will crystallise in the near future. The
more that I hear the promoter of the Bill and the Minister, the more
there is an overwhelming case for not proceeding
today.</div>

The delay in delivering the necessary change&#151;the Government have
been blamed for some of the reasons for that, and other Governments

It is a perfectly modest Bill, which falls within the scope of private

line 2, leave out &#145;, or employment
agency,&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08050764000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had
wanted to table an amendment to deal with the lack of a definition of
&#147;temporary worker&#148; in the Bill, and thus to leave out any
reference to the term. I have been unable to do so because such a
description is part of the long title, but I will table an amendment of
that nature in the future. A &#147;temporary worker&#148; could be
a synonym for an agency worker, in which case it is not required, but
it could be something else, such as a worker supplied on secondment by
an employer to a client. It could be a temporary worker engaged
directly by the employer, but it is difficult to make progress on a
Bill when we do not know what the reference to &#147;temporary
worker&#148; means. I should therefore be grateful if the hon. Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston would explain what he means by a
temporary worker as that may enable us to make progress on the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08050764000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment would leave out the reference to &#147;employment
agency&#148;. That expression is not appropriate and it is an example
of the confused thinking that unfortunately is found in the Bill.
Employment agencies find employment for employees with employers. They
do not employ workers, so how we can compare whether they have meted
out less favourable treatment in employment when the relationship
between themselves and the worker ceases when the worker has the
job?</div>
					<a name="08050764000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000292"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I am also unsure why employment agencies have
been included in the provision. Under the definition in the Employment
Agencies Act 1973, an employment agency provides services for the
purposes of finding individuals employment or of supplying employers
with employees. When that service is being carried out, the individual
seeking work has no contract with the employment agency. It therefore
makes no sense to compare the treatment of the said individual by the
employment agency with a person who is employed under contract as a
direct
worker.</div>
					<a name="08050764000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 2 is a strike-out provision with which we agree, but we consider
that it should be discussed in the context of the clause as a whole. I
therefore intend to include it in my comments on the clause stand part

							<a name="08050764000293"></a>Andrew
Miller:
						</b> This is an important amendment, and I hope to
explain in a few moments why it should be opposed. It would leave many
unprotected, because only employment businesses would be covered. The
previous Bill on the same subject that the House looked at last year
was confined to employment businesses, but it is not entirely clear
from the record why that was the case. These businesses employ workers
on a temporary basis for an end-user, so it follows that an employment
business is responsible for paying their employees. Colleagues will
remember that on Second Reading I dealt with an example of exactly that
circumstance from Calor Gas, where two people had been employed as
temps for 12 and eight years respectively.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>
					<a name="08050764000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Confusingly,
the employee of an employment business is often referred to as an
agency worker. An employment agency will introduce a work seeker to a
hirer or end-user. The hirer may take the work seeker on with a
permanent contract as an employee at the outset and pay a fee for that
introduction. There is a reputable agency in my constituency that
prides itself in doing just that: seeking to place people into
temporary situations with a view to planning their progression into
permanent employment with that employer. That is a welcome approach by
that agency, and fees will be paid for that
introduction.</div>

						</b> I am trying hard to follow exactly
what the hon. Gentleman is saying. The idea of permatemps is very
welcome, and it is one that many employment agencies use, as he has
just mentioned. However, at the same time, he is encompassing within
the net all employment agencies, whether or not they supply temporary
workers, so I am still concerned that employment agencies who have
nothing to do with temporary workers will fall within the compass of
the
Bill.</div>

gave on Second Reading regarding Calor Gas, when it transpired at the
closure of the depot that two people had been employed through an
agency for 12 years and eight years respectively. I am sure that the
hon. Lady, in tabling her amendment, is not seeking to justify that
kind of employment practice.</div>

should really be that of employees. However, that is not what we are

here.</div>

understand where she is coming from in relation to certain categories,

defining categories of workers through secondary legislation could be
finessed so as to take on board that legitimate concern and to address
some of my observations at the same

ensure that all categories can be encompassed by the Bill, and that any

the needs of vulnerable people in difficult situations is covered
through secondary legislation allowing groups to be
excluded.</div>
					<a name="08050764000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
agency workseeker might be required on a temporary or fixed-term basis,
and the hirer might pay the agency, on an hourly basis, a proportion of
what is passed on to the worker. In addition, a contract between a
worker 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>and an agency often states specifically that the worker is not an
employee of the agency and that the agency does not guarantee work.
There will be no contract between the worker and the hirer in most
cases.</div>
					<a name="08050764000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
circumstances are incredibly unsatisfactory, and while it is feasible
to identify areas, as the hon. Lady has done, in which one might

							<b class="B">Philip
Davies</b> (Shipley) (Con): I am grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I am becoming confused. I
certainly support the points made by the hon. Member for Solihull. Is
not there a distinction between employment businesses that employ
temporary workers and then place them with specific companies, and
employment agencies that simply point people in the right direction of
a post and have no employment for them? I do not understand how on
earth there can be a requirement on employment agencies when they have
nothing to do with the
employment.</div>

						</b> That is because, as I tried to explain earlier,
that simple definition does not hold because not all employment
agencies are like Jobcentre Plus. They are not just placement agencies,
and therein lies the difficulty. I understand what the hon. Gentleman
is saying about people who are appointed to a temporary or permanent
job when the agency no longer has any responsibility for them, other
than perhaps to collect a one-off fee. That category of person is not
the same as the category that is appointed through an agency and
continues to have a daily relationship with the agency. The categories
are different and both can come through employment agencies. There is
confusion about what happens in the
marketplace.</div>

an employee in a temporary or permanent post and no longer had a

that it would have any bearing on them, and it would certainly not be
burdensome. If they were on a nice little earner, however, by
collecting money from their relationship with that employee for a
period of time, they ought to be covered. Some categories of agency
could fall within the scope of the Bill, but others act in the same way

simply remove employment agencies, so it would not reduce or diminish
any responsibility on end users or employment businesses. It would
merely remove the anomaly of including employment agencies that have

either of us will get stamped on for repetition. I thought that I had
just responded to that point. An agency might use part of its business
to provide permanent or temporary work to people with whom it has no
further contractual relationship, and another part to place people with
whom it has a continuing financial relationship. I do not think that I
can be any clearer than that, and that is why I urge the Committee not
to accept the amendment.</div>

and I take the point of the hon. Member for Solihull that we need to be
cautious and ensure that we get the definitions right, but as I
indicated to the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr, my
preferred route is to start with all-encompassing definitions from
which we exclude groups, rather than having to return to Parliament to
build a
list.</div>

							<a name="08050764000308"></a>Mr.
McFadden:
						</b> The debate has highlighted the importance of
definitions. As far as I can see, the debate about fair treatment for
agency workers has been focused on people in temporary placements who
work alongside permanently hired staff. There is perceived injustice
and unfairness. There are some confusing terms because while we talk
about agency workers and employment agencies, we also talk about
employment businesses. The type of business that conducts a three-way
relationship among the supplying organisation, the hiring end user and
the worker in between is often an employment business, whereas
employment agencies can include organisations, usually called
head-hunters, that are engaged in the recruitment business, but in a
different way. This is about having a client group of businesses and a
client group of individuals, and matching up the two for the purposes
of permanent employment.</div>
					<a name="08050764000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand my hon.
Friend&#146;s Bill, its aim is to legislate for equal treatment for
those hired on a temporary basis, which can extend for longer than
would normally be considered a temporary placement, and permatemps, as
described by the hon. Member for Solihull. We are all concerned about
people who have been engaged in placements lasting for years and years.
On any normal understanding of the term, they would be regarded as
permanent, but they do not have the status, protection and rights of
permanent workers. That is somewhat different from someone who might be
filling in on a sort of seasonal basis or to cover for short-term
leave, or perhaps just working for events where there is a build up
over a significant period although the event itself might last only a
few days.</div>
					<a name="08050764000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question that we must ask is what are we trying to legislate for. My
understanding, both of the European directive and my hon.
Friend&#146;s Bill, is that there is an attempt to legislate for
temporary placements and people who are covered by that. We will go on
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>have many discussions about qualifying periods during our consideration

people who are placed on a temporary

						</b> This is the heart of what we
are discussing. If the Bill covered the activities of head-hunters, it
would take us into a new field. It is one thing to try to regulate and
legislate for the pay relationship&#151;essentially we are talking
about the pay relationship&#151;between temporarily placed agency
workers and permanent workers whom they work alongside. That in itself
may be difficult, and sometimes there are no permanent workers working
alongside. There is a difference between those people and those who are
placed in a permanent post. I think it would take this legislation into
a whole new area if we
attempted&#151;</div>

there are agencies that recruit people who are technically
self-employed? They are not employed by the end user or the agency.
They have many of the characteristics of employees&#151;they have set
hours and their tools are provided&#151;but the difference is that
they have lower workplace rights than employees working side by side
with them on the same construction site. That is why employment
agencies should be kept in the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08050764000312"></a>Mr.

						</b> The issue of self-employment
in construction is often raised with the Government. Such people may or
may not be supplied by employment agencies. There are a whole series of
Inland Revenue issues associated with the question the hon. Gentleman
raises, but I am thinking of people who are placed in what we would
normally regard as permanent jobs. The point I am making is that if the
Bill covers&#151;it appears that it does given what my hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, although that is
unclear&#151;the activities of head-hunters who place people in
permanent jobs, that would take us into a whole new field of
legislation, as that is certainly not covered by the directive. I am
not sure whether it is my hon. Friend&#146;s intention to go beyond
the directive, but if it is not, he might need to look again at the
issue so that whatever differences we have, we can at least be clear
that we are talking about people who are placed in temporary posts,
rather than the activities of head-hunters. If he does not wish to
include head-hunters, perhaps he might outline that and suggest how he
will deal with the definitions to ensure that the Bill does not
unintentionally stray into that
area.</div>

head-hunters an ongoing relationship, in terms of equal pay and
treatment, between those that they place and other permanent staff in
the organisation in which they were placed. That has never been the
intention of the European directive, which has always focused on
temporary workers. I do not wish to put words in the mouth of my hon.
Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, but I do not believe
that it is his intention to do so here either. The provision as it is
drafted could stray into that area, and if that is not his intention,
my question to him is how would he deal with
that.</div>

						</b> It seems to me that if the
employment agency has no contractual relationship with the workers in
the first place&#151;that is the sort of agency that the Minister is
talking about&#151;the Bill would not apply. The purpose of including
employment agencies is to pick up those employment agencies that have
some sort of contractual relationship with the worker and to ensure
that employing businesses do not have a loophole whereby they can say,
&#147;Oh, we&#146;re an employment
agency.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08050764000318"></a>Mr.

						</b> I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point, but
elsewhere in the Bill there is talk of joint and several liability
between end-users and employment agencies for infringements of the
Bill. Although he is right to say that our normal understanding would
be that there is no ongoing relationship between the head-hunter and
the person that they place in a permanent post, I am not sure that the
Bill clearly excludes those head-hunters from its reach. Whatever other
differences there are between us, I hope that my hon. Friend agrees
that we should focus the discussion on people who are placed in
temporary posts, however they are defined.</div>
					<a name="08050764000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is surely not our intention
to start legislating for equal pay, perhaps unintentionally, in the
field of head-hunters and permanent placements. Whether the amendment
is the right way to deal with that, or whether my hon. Friend the
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston wishes to table his own amendment
is a matter for him to consider. Both the draft European directive,
which serves as the backdrop to the Bill, and any discussions around it
have always focused on temporary agency workers. It has never been the
intention to legislate in a way that would affect the recruitment
industry as a whole when it places people in permanent posts.</div>
					<a name="08050764000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Definitions are important, but
I am not sure that they are clear at the moment. At the least we should
ensure that the Bill focuses on temporary agency workers, which I
believe is its intent given what it says in its long title. Whether the
definitions do that is at least open to
question.</div>

							<a name="08050764000319"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Member for
Ellesmere Port and Neston when he says that we need to get this right.
This is not a debating society; we are legislating. I share some of the
concerns that the Minister has expressed and the concerns expressed by
my hon. and astute Friend the Member for Shipley. It seems that the
provision that we are now being invited to support goes far wider than
perhaps the hon. Gentleman intended and would indeed include
head-hunters.</div>
					<a name="08050764000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I was studying law, to earn extra money, I undertook part-time work
with an employment agency that dealt exclusively with the entertainment
sector. It provided comedy acts as well as musicians and bands for
venues. Occasionally, bands asked it to supply temporary musicians when
a musician was ill. For example, the late Syd Lawrence had a
large&#151;I think 35-piece&#151;orchestra and, occasionally, if a
trombonist fell ill, an employment agency dealing with musicians would
be asked to send a musician to deputise. Invariably in my experience,
in that scenario, the dep-musician was paid less than the permanent
members of the
band.</div>
					<a name="08050764000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the Bill would go into the entertainment area in a way I am
sure that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston did not intend.
If an employment agency dealing with musicians supplied a dep-musician
to a band on a lower salary, the Bill would enable that deputising
musician to sue the employment agency because the band leader did not
pay him same as a valued and perhaps long-term member of the orchestra.
For those reasons, the hon. Member for Solihull is right to seek to
remove from the Bill the inclusion and encompassing of employment
agencies.</div>

							<a name="08050764000320"></a>Adam
Price:
						</b> If the Bill is passed, it will be
illegal for the end-user to pay the lower salary to the temporary
worker in any case. Therefore, would it not be right to ensure that
employment agencies were aware of that and that they did not enter into
any kind of relationship with an end-user that was seeking to do
something against employment
legislation?</div>

							<a name="08050764000321"></a>Mr.

						</b> That is all very well and it
probably would be reasonable if we were discussing staff who were
employed as cleaners given that cleaning a floor is the same job
whether someone has been there two or three years or two or three
weeks. But applying that same rule where we are dealing with artistic
ability and talent would be oppressive in the extreme. It would be
saying, for example, to a trumpeter of the ability of the late Harry
James or the late Eddie Calvert that they could be paid only the same
as the most mediocre trumpeter in an orchestra. That goes against the
whole history of show business. To win wider support for the Bill, the
hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has to get over the fact that
the clause is too wide. It goes too far.</div>

						</b> I understand where the right
hon. Gentleman is coming from, particularly as we now see the genesis
of MP4. At the time he is talking about, a zero-hours contract
essentially provided for him to slot in to make up the numbers in a
band from time to time when someone was sick. Had he decided to take
the more radical line of some of his colleagues on MP4 and tried to
recruit people to the Musicians Union, or some such organisation, he
could legitimately have been sacked for doing so as he had a zero-hours
contract. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>problem goes back to 1983, which perhaps I will tell the Committee

						</b> That is a totally different point. I am not saying
that temp musicians who work on a temporary basis should have no rights
at all, but there is a justifiable argument for paying some musicians
in a band or orchestra more than others, because of the talent that
they bring to that entertainment unit.</div>

							<b class="B">Jim
Dowd</b> (Lewisham, West) (Lab): There is a contradiction
here. If we were talking about the general hierarchy of an orchestra,
we could understand that point. However, if I have understood the
circumstances outlined by the right hon. Gentleman, we are talking
about circumstances where, if someone was ill or indisposed, and
someone else was needed to take their place at short notice, that
person would be obtained from an agency. Surely, if that person was not
up to the skill or standard required, they would not be an adequate
replacement. The thrust of the Bill is that where people are of similar
skills and abilities, one should not be disadvantaged simply because
they acted in a temporary capacity, compared to those who are there
full time. It is not a question of comparative skill across the
piece.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000325"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> That argument cannot apply when one looks at the
entertainment industry. There will always be situations where someone
is of exceptional talent and is paid, because of that talent, to remain
in a band or orchestra. During a period of illness, the orchestra
leader is willing to carry on engagements, perhaps with a slightly
reduced ability in his band, but all he needs is a replacement musician
who can play in tune and read music. He may still wish to maintain the
higher salary for the permanent member of the band who is ill. What is
wrong with that? Why should he or she not be allowed to do
that?</div>

						</b> I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. Does
he agree that in relation to the amendment, even if one accepts the
arguments given by the promoter of the Bill, the issue is about whether
it is the end-user who should be held responsible for ensuring that
terms and conditions are met, or the employment agency that merely
signposted the person into the job? Even with the amendment, the
end-user would still be included in the clause; it would merely take
away any responsibility from the employment agency that does not
actually employ them.</div>

						</b> That is a very good point. The amendment moved by
the hon. Member for Solihull is not perfect, but it is a step in the
right direction. That is why I indicated my support. My hon. Friend is
right. In the scenario that I have described, the Bill would mean that
the bandleader would be legally responsible, as would the entertainment
agency that supplied the temporary musician. Once his two or three-week
engagement was over, the temporary musician could then sue the
bandleader for discrimination under the Bill, and sue the agency that
provided the job. That is not right, and I would like to think that the
hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston did not intend that scenario
to be covered by the Bill.</div>

these circumstances were the exception that proves the rule, but the
music and entertainment industry is different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>from most other things. However, one thing is
similar. The point is that if somebody was at lower level, the
bandleader might want to carry on with what would probably be a
different format&#151;if there was no Eddie Calvert to do the solos,
it would be a different show. Under those circumstances, if he employed
someone else directly instead of going to a temporary agency and did so
on a lower salary, there would be no conflict. We need to consider if
there will be a difference if someone is employed directly or on a
temporary basis because they should be treated the same. If the
intention of the bandleader was to employ somebody directly on a lower
salary, the right hon. Gentleman could legitimately justify what he
says about someone below standard being paid less on a temporary
basis.</div>

school for many years, and who was on the enhanced salary offered by
the Government to encourage good teachers to stay in the classroom.

entertainment, to which he said sotto 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>voce, &#147;Only entertainment?&#148; The
entertainment industry will have real difficulties with the Bill
because musicians are paid not only in accordance with their merit, but
with the history of where the band, orchestra or group comes from. For
example, I know of cases where an act had minor national success in the
pop charts and then a member left. a new member was
recruited&#151;sometimes through an agency&#151;to take the place
of that person, but because the band was established before that new
member joined, they were put on a salary and received no percentage of
the profits from the sales of the record that was a hit before they
joined. It could therefore be argued that that person was treated
unfavourably, and that they have a right of action under the Bill and
could sue the employment agency for offering them a contract on terms
less favourable than those of any other band member, when their musical
ability may exceed that of other members of the band.</div>

red herrings flying around. I was interested in the approach taken by
the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire, who is himself a musician of
some standing&#151;a rock giant to some of us. He knows the industry
much better than I do, but I am old enough to remember Eddie James and
Eddie Calvert. They were never looking around for work and never used
anything other than their agents to get them prime appointments, not
fill-in appointments in a band. There may be problems with other
aspects of the music

want to talk about my experience in this field, which is mainly as an
employer. Like the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire, I am a former
solicitor. I no longer have a practising certificate, but he is
absolutely right that there could be lucrative work here. Often in my
practice, I had to use agencies. I always used registered employment
agencies, because I knew that there was at least some scrutiny of the
way in which such businesses operated. I always looked for businesses
that I thought were reputable, because I thought that that would give
me the best chance of getting the sort of person whom I
wanted.</div>
					<a name="08050764000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Usually, I
needed people such as secretaries for short fill-in jobs. I do not
think that many solicitors were available from the employment agencies
that I used, but I know that agencies now exist in specialised areas
such as engineering, accountancy and law. All sorts of professions and
skills are now available in the market. The contract was between me and
the agency&#151;I had no say in what the individual was paid. Very
few of them stayed long enough for me to find out what they were paid.
As I understand it, that remains the case.</div>
					<a name="08050764000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not
have been interested in what is described in the Bill as &#147;an
employment business&#148; because I wanted something that had
scrutiny and a registered regulation process attached to it. The Bill
tries to deal with the sorts of agencies that come under less scrutiny,
and such businesses might come into that category. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>However, that does not exclude employment agencies, the requirements on
which seem to have loosened over the past 20 or 30 years. The scrutiny
that used to be available when I was a practising solicitor in the
&#146;70s and &#146;80s seemed to be quite a serious and onerous
requirement. I am not sure whether that is the case
now.</div>
					<a name="08050764000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister was right to raise the point about head-hunters. My only
experience of working with a head-hunter came recently when working in
this place. I was on the interviewing panel for a very senior Official
of the House. Head-hunters were appointed, and as I recall, the House
was responsible for the advertising. The head-hunters&#146; job was
to scrutinise the people who applied, to put tentacles out to find
other people and to encourage people to apply. The result of that
process was selection by interview by a panel of people appointed by
the House, including Officers of the House; myself, representing
Members; and an independent person representing outside industry. The
contract with the head-hunting agency was simply to do the trawl and
the filter. The relationship with the person employed is between the
House and the individual, with a normal employment contract featuring
statutory terms and conditions and so on. I do not see why head-hunters
come into this process at all. The vast majority are employed to find
employees, not to act as an agency in the sense that I understand it.
That is quite a different situation.</div>

							<a name="08050764000345"></a>Philip
Davies:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. I would like to start by
congratulating the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston for
getting his Bill to this stage, which is an achievement in itself,
particularly when opposed by all the main parties&#146; Front-Bench
Members. There will be plenty of time to discuss our fundamental
disagreements over the Bill as a whole, but this debate is to do with
the modest amendment moved by the hon. Member for Solihull, with which
I agree wholeheartedly. There are some fundamental disagreements about
the principles, and some of the comments we heard today were an example
of 1970s socialism of which Arthur Scargill would have been
proud.</div>
					<a name="08050764000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to focus on the point about removing employment agencies
from the clause. We seem to have got ourselves into a bit of a muddle
over definitions and what would and would not apply under the Bill.
Although I oppose the Bill in its entirety, even those who support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>the Bill and its intentions ought to reflect further on the
organisations they would be including. Following on from the speech of
my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire, which I thought
highlighted some of the issues particularly well, the hon. Member for
Aberdeen, North said that, in his experience,
musicians&#151;certainly the top ones&#151;did not have to go to
employment agencies to find work. They found work through their agents.
What struck me as a result of that remark was whether agents themselves
would be included in the definition of employment
agencies.</div>
					<a name="08050764000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we look at the definition of employment agencies, as
specified by the Bill. It states
that</div>
					<a name="08050764000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;employment
agency&#146; means the business (whether or not carried out with a
view to profit and whether or not carried out in conjunction with any
other business) providing services...for the purpose of finding
workers employment with employers or of supplying employers with
workers for employment by
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050764000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what
agents do when representing particular clients. They are finding
employment for workers with employment. Clearly, in the Bill&#146;s
definition, the agents themselves would be included. However, the hon.
Member for Aberdeen, North was saying that that was nonsense, because
people found work through agents, as if they would not be applicable.
None the less, it strikes me that employment agencies would apply under
the clause, if we do not remove them from the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08050764000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition
is helpful, because it makes it clear that it
is</div>
					<a name="08050764000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the purpose of
finding workers employment with employers or of supplying employers
with workers for employment by
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050764000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is perfectly clear. The employment agencies have nothing to do with the
employment of the people concerned, but are merely finding those people
jobs. At that point their relationship with them ends. That is
perfectly clear in the definition. What would strike me as bizarre is a
situation in which an employment agency, having done its
job&#151;having found a worker a job with an employer, or an employer
a worker&#151;would be left with an endless liability into the
future, lest at some point the end-user, the employer, decided not to
honour the terms and conditions for those entitled to them. Why on
earth should the employment agency have an ongoing liability when its
part of the deal has been done satisfactorily on behalf of both the
employee and the employer? The agency might do its bit perfectly well,
yet the Bill would leave it in limbo.</div>

							<a name="08050764000346"></a>Mr.
Heppell:
						</b> In those circumstances, though&#151;if the
employment agency had done its job to the satisfaction of the employer
and the employee&#151;presumably the employee would not take action
against the agency. They would take action against the end-user who
broke the contract with
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000347"></a>Philip
Davies:
						</b> I am grateful for that helpful intervention,
because that is my point entirely. I do not accept the premise of the
Bill, but even if one does, the root of the solution to any particular
problem clearly lies with the end-user. Even with the amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for Solihull, clause 1 would still provide for
people to take the end-user to task.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>
					<a name="08050764000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is whether the employment agency should be included all. Given
that the end-user is included and that redemption can be sought through
that end-user, it serves absolutely no purpose to list employment
agencies in the Bill. It will serve only to create uncertainty for
agencies. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, East said himself, it will
not make any difference for the
employee.</div>
					<a name="08050764000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000348"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> Has the hon. Member for Nottingham, East not
missed the point? If an aggrieved worker went to the hon. Member for
Aberdeen, North&#151;let us say that he resumed his law practice in
Scotland, having lost his seat&#151;the advice that he would get is,
&#147;Your rights, sir, are not only to sue the employer but to sue
the agency. We think the employer may be short of funds or in financial
trouble, so we advise you to go to the agency first.&#148; That is
what the Bill provides
for.</div>
					<a name="08050764000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000349"></a>Philip
Davies:
						</b> My right hon. Friend is entirely
right. He has highlighted astutely the can of worms that we may be
opening. In fact, it may go further than that. The solicitor might say,
&#147;Well, you might not want to upset your employer, because
that&#146;s who you&#146;re employed by. Rather than pursuing your
employer, who you don&#146;t want to get on the wrong side of, why
not go for the employment agency instead? You&#146;ve got no dealings
with them whatsoever. You&#146;ve got nothing to lose at all by
having a go at them.&#148; According to the Bill, the agency will be
just as liable as the end-user. The clause makes no difference between
them. The employment agency may end up being the one left in the firing
line, even though we on the Committee all seem to agree that the
employment agency would not be responsible at all for the situation in
which such employees found
themselves.</div>
					<a name="08050764000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the bureaucracy involved in recruiting people from employment
agencies, we might end up in a difficult situation. At the moment, an
employment agency can find somebody a job under terms and conditions
acceptable to both the employee and the employer. Under the clause, if
it transpires that some people in the firm are paid differently, the
employment agency, even if it had no prior knowledge of that, might
find itself liable for a problem that it could not have anticipated and
for which it was not responsible, even though the employee and employer
were both happy with the terms and conditions of recruitment at the
time.</div>
					<a name="08050764000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it
transpires further down the line that some people are being paid
differently, employment agencies might be held responsible for that
too. That could mean that in order for any employment agency to find
work for an employee, it would have to ask the employer to hand over
all files on the pay, terms and conditions of all the people who
currently work in the firm, to ensure that nobody it places in that
firm is being disadvantaged in any way. I used to work for Asda, which
employs between 120,000 and 130,000 people. It often took on temporary
workers at Christmas and Easter, when there is a bit of a rush on in
the stores. If employment agencies had to go through the rigmarole of
checking up on the pay, terms and conditions of all Asda&#146;s
employees just to ensure that nobody would be disadvantaged by
comparison with anybody else who worked there, who on earth would want
to start up an employment
agency?</div>
					<a name="08050764000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000350"></a>Ms
Butler:
						</b> Is that not in some respects the point of the
Bill, in the sense that the employment agency and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>we, under the Equal Pay Act 1970, should be looking at transparency with
regard to the pay and conditions of employees to ensure that they are
paid a reasonable wage for their job? Is that not part of the premise
of the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="08050764000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000351"></a>Philip
Davies:
						</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point, but
that is where the difference lies. She is saying that people should be
paid a fair wage for their job, but that is not what we are discussing:
we are discussing whether people should be paid an equal rate for their
job. As my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire made clear,
there are many good reasons why people should not be paid equally for
their jobs. Many employers want, for example, to reward people&#146;s
loyalty over long periods of time with higher pay, better terms and
conditions and longer holidays. That seems to be a perfectly reasonable
way to reward people who have been loyal to a firm for a long period.
The hon. Lady seems to be mixing up paying and treating someone fairly
with treating them equally, but there is a huge difference between the
two. Ensuring that people are not treated in a manner that is not equal
would put a massive burden upon employment agencies to find out huge
swathes of information before they could confidently place someone with
an employer, even though the employee was happy with their terms and
conditions at the
time.</div>
					<a name="08050764000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000352"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:
						</b> I very much agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s
argument, and it invites a question about how people could establish
the information that would protect them from any legal suit. They would
have no right to know that
information.</div>
					<a name="08050764000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050764000353"></a>Philip
Davies:
						</b> Indeed, my hon. Friend makes a good point.
Obviously, much of that information might be covered by data protection
in the first place or might be commercially sensitive. For example, an
agency might provide workers for different firms within the same
sector, but a business should not really be expected to give out its
terms and conditions to an agency that might be able to pass that
information on to a competitor. We would open up a huge can of worms
simply by including employment agencies in the scope of the clause. The
hon. Member for Solihull was astute in spotting that potential flaw,
and that is why she is moving her amendment to make them
exempt.</div>
					<a name="08050764000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have many
fundamental disagreements about the principle of the Bill and its
practicalities, but even if one accepts the premise that people should
be given those rights, given the definition of employment agencies in
the Bill, I do not see how on earth any employment agency could end up
with a lasting liability for any unfair treatment when it is clearly
not their responsibility. Furthermore, that group would clearly include
head-hunters, as the Minister made clear, because their sole purpose is
to find workers for employers. That is clearly an unfair burden to put
on them.</div>
					<a name="08050764000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston pointed out that subsection (2)(b)
states that subsection (1) only applies if</div>
					<a name="08050764000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the treatment is not justified on
objective
grounds.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050764000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire made clear, that
could be a lawyer&#146;s gold mine, because there will be differences
of opinion on what constitutes objective grounds. The hon. Member for
Ellesmere Port and Neston, who I know to be a perfectly reasonable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>man, might come up with a definition of objective grounds that is
perfectly reasonable. All of the members of the Committee might well
come up with their own definitions of objective grounds that are
particularly reasonable, but we are supposed to be setting legislation
that is clear cut and will give employers and employment agencies some
kind of certainty that what they are doing is fair. Simply having a
rather vague line that seems to have been thrown in at the last minute
to try to overcome any potential pitfalls by saying that the treatment
is not justified on objective grounds seems to offer no certainty for
employers or employment agencies to go about their legitimate daily
business.</div>
					<a name="08050764000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the clause is not amended in
the way that the hon. Member for Solihull proposes, the provisions
would be worse for employment agencies, who would have long-lasting
liabilities that they would not be able to control. It would be worse
for the employees, because I cannot imagine many people wanting to take
on such a potential liability, and therefore there would be far fewer
employment agencies to find people work with employers. I cannot
imagine many people wanting to take on such a potential
liability.</div>

the sense that the clause would certainly be a lot less objectionable,
which would make the Bill less objectionable. However, the Bill would
still be objectionable, albeit slightly less so. I go some way towards
accepting his point, but I would not want to mislead anybody into
thinking that accepting this rather modest amendment would suddenly
make the Bill all hunky-dory; the Bill would still be fatally flawed,
although slightly less so.</div>
					<a name="08050764000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend does, however, make a valid point. As everyone has said, the
clause should not include head-hunters and those who simply pass others
on for a job and then have no further relationship with them. Everybody
has accepted that point. That is why I thought that the hon. Member for
Ellesmere Port and Neston made a useful distinction between employment
businesses and employment agencies. Even if we accept the amendment,
employment businesses would still be covered by the clause. Those who
still have an ongoing relationship with such businesses would therefore
still be covered, as would the end employer. The amendment would simply
remove from the equation those who do no more than find somebody a job
that they are happy about with an appropriate employer and who then
have no further dealings with that person. The amendment in the name of
the hon. Member for Solihull is modest, but it would improve the clause
considerably. I support it on that
basis.</div>

the amendment has raised some interesting issues, and some of us may
not be as far from each other as we appear to be. I cannot speak on
behalf of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, but those of
us who support the Bill did not intend, for example, recruitment
consultancies working for investment banks in the City of London to be
caught in the net of the Bill. Although the workers they deal with
might now be vulnerable, given the way the economy is, they are not
vulnerable in the sense meant in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08050764000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fear
expressed by several hon. Members&#151;we are not lapsing into a
conspiracy theory&#151;is that if the Bill were passed, some
employment businesses could reinvent themselves as employment agencies
or mask their employment business-related activities so that we ended
up with exactly the same circumstances. For example, there is the
construction industry scheme under which groups of workers are
recruited by employment agencies. They are technically self-employed,
and that allows the end-user to avoid giving them the same set of
rights and conditions that they would enjoy as direct

&#147;No bad thing
either&#148;.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s fear
that employment businesses will become employment agencies is
misplaced. This is not self-definition. It is not the businesses that
define what they are. The definition is in the Bill. The nature of the
service that businesses provide is covered in the Bill, and so the term
&#147;employment agency&#148; can be removed without any fear that
people will define themselves in a different
way.</div>

							<a name="08050764000362"></a>Adam
Price:
						</b> Yes, but what I fear is a much
broader restructuring of the labour market, whereby people who may be
currently employed through employment agencies may be encouraged to
become self-employed on short-term contracts. Contracts would be
constructed to allow that to happen, as in the construction industry.
Some 20 per cent. of workers in the construction industry are
self-employed and recruited through employment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>agencies. They do not work for employment businesses or the end-user.
They are vulnerable workers. In the terms of the Bill, they are
temporary agency workers. The Bill would allow us to protect those
workers, because it includes employment agencies under its
rubric.</div>
					<a name="08050764000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for East Yorkshire raised some fair points in
relation to specific sectors. Concerns have also been raised in other
sectors where there are high net value employees&#151;for example,
engineering and IT consultants. They are concerned that their
circumstances could be disadvantaged by the Bill because they have
secured advantages from flexible labour markets and casualisation. They
are highly skilled&#151;many of them have a unique set of skills and
are in high demand&#151;and it suits them to have flexible short-term
contracts. The situation is perhaps similar in parts of the creative
industries. One could argue that the lower the skill level and the
seniority level&#151;even within the creative industries&#151;there
is exploitation, in particular of younger workers at the
bottom.</div>
					<a name="08050764000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to be mindful that in some sectors and in some circumstances there
perhaps needs to be specific exemptions. We are not talking about
vulnerable workers but about workers with unique sets of skills. The
hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston alluded to that. In economics
we refer to economic rent; even individuals have a unique value in the
marketplace. For example, it is almost impossible to compare
professional footballers like for like. The only way to do that is
through the marketplace, where a price is set for them. In certain
sectors, right at the top of key industries, we are talking about a
wholly different set of circumstances to those of vulnerable workers
who are exploited by disreputable employment agencies and employment
businesses. At this stage, it is better to have an expansive
definition, and if there are sectors and particular circumstances in
which it is clear that exemptions should be made, that can be done at a
later
stage.</div>

Kirkbride:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman points up a difficult aspect
of the Bill, which is that there are many groups in very different
circumstances. There are people at the top of the pile, as well as
people who are undoubtedly exploited. Conservative Members accept that
there is a case in some areas. However, I can think of other groups,
perhaps women who have children, who could be seen as vulnerable
because&#151;</div>
