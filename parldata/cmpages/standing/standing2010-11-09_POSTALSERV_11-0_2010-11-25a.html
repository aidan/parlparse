                           </span> I shall speak briefly about
clause 9, which is helpful in many respects. I am sure that the
intention is to ensure that the protections set out in the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations
2006—commonly known as TUPE, which is much easier to
say—apply to staff affected by the reorganisation of companies
within Royal Mail Holdings plc before the sale to the private sector of
any part of Royal Mail Holdings
plc.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
staff of any organisation are its greatest asset, but they are
particularly important in concerns that have a high public profile and
that are labour-intensive and people-focused. I am talking about
concerns for which interaction with the public and customer
satisfaction are of paramount importance. It is vital whenever we are
discussing this Bill—or, indeed, any other Bill—that
although we want the best possible service for the customer at the best
possible price, we do not seek to achieve that by ignoring the rights
and situations of those whom we ask to provide that service. Whatever
our views on the best way to ensure the future success of the business,
we want to see that the staff are treated fairly and will not lose out
in the upheaval likely to accompany any reorganisation. They will be
living through a period of great uncertainty and anxiety. The next few
months and years will be a difficult time, because change is never
easy.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
9 is important, because it is about the treatment of the staff affected
by the reorganisation of companies within Royal Mail Holdings plc
before the sale to the private sector of any part of Royal Mail
Holdings plc. Many of those staff will have given long years of
service, and it is pleasing that subsection (7) specifies that any
transfer of staff during the reorganisation will not be treated as a
break in service and that any period of employment with their current
company, referred to as “the transferor”, is to be
treated as a period of service with their new company, referred to as
“the transferee”.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 378<a class="bkMark" name="Column378">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">All staff
deserve proper protection for their existing terms and conditions, and
we must ensure that they receive nothing less. That is why we welcome
clause 9, which ensures that the protections set out in TUPE apply to
the staff affected by the reorganisation of companies within Royal Mail
Holdings plc. However, I need reassurance from the Minister that there
will be no attempts to water down the protection offered by TUPE. I
need reassurance from the Government that they really understand the
importance of protecting staff terms and conditions at a time of
transfer or
takeover.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>People
may well ask why on earth I need that reassurance. I need it simply
because just a few weeks ago, the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet
Office, the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd),
who is responsible for civil society, said that the Government would
review restrictions imposed on charities by TUPE as part of their plans
to cut red tape in the voluntary sector. He was telling grass-roots
charities that plans to cut red tape would take in protection of pay,
pensions and sick pay for transferred staff. I do not know what is
civil about that. The Minister with responsibility for civil society,
who tells us that cutting red tape and reforming public service
commissioning are high on the agenda of the Office for Civil Society,
is prepared to do that at the expense of hard-working staff. Let us be
honest, it is not so much about cutting red tape but about cutting
costs.
Reducing TUPE
commitments would make it even easier for employers, be they companies
or charities, to exploit hard-working people. Existing skills,
knowledge, experience and relationships could be lost, as workers were
laid off and replaced by cheaper and normally less experienced
individuals. That would have severe repercussions for service delivery
everywhere.
<p class="tabbed">I wonder
exactly how much homework the Minister has done. We owe TUPE to the EU
and the acquired rights directive, and although that measure allows the
free movement of capital, the human aspect is not ignored. People are
not seen as numbers but as having homes, families and financial
commitments. Given that TUPE is the UK transposition of the EU
directive, it would be difficult to change what it covers except at the
edges, where UK law extends beyond the directive or implements its
optional provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need an
assurance from the Minister that the Government still recognise the
importance of the sort of protection offered by TUPE, or similar
guidelines such as the Cabinet Office statement of practice on staff
transfers in the public sector, and that no attempt will be made to
water down the TUPE commitments through Government amendments or new
clauses. The regulations are designed to protect the rights of
employees in transfer situations, enabling them to enjoy the same terms
and conditions that they had before the transfer took place and with
continuity of employment.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also have
the trade unions. If an independent trade union has been recognised by
the transferor in respect of transferring employees, that recognition
should transfer to the incoming employer to the same extent.
I hope that the Minister will not find it difficult to
confirm that no attempt will be made by anyone during this
reorganisation process to de-recognise the trade unions or to sideline
them. What steps has he taken to talk with trade unions about set-ups
that might emerge?<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 379<a class="bkMark" name="Column379">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The outgoing
employer or transferor must inform staff, consulting them and
appropriate representatives of the affected employees about the
transfer and proposed measures. Specified information must be provided
to employee representatives long enough before the transfer to enable
the outgoing employer to consult them about it. Will the Minister
confirm that such consultation will happen, and that the work force and
their representatives will have a full and proper opportunity to
participate? Any changes or proposals for change following the transfer
will have to be discussed with the representatives of the affected
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is no
set timetable for consultation, but the larger the transaction the more
staff will be affected and the longer the timetable will need to be. Is
the Minister confident that the necessary preparations are being made?

                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Amess. I
welcome the hon. Lady’s speech, and thank her for her positive
comments. She made it clear that the Opposition regard the clause as
helpful and that, in general, they welcome it. Her questions were
extremely reasonable, and I hope that I can give her comfort on those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
delighted that the hon. Lady recognises the protections being
introduced in clause 9. Similar provisions were made in the 2009 Bill.
It is important that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations, commonly known as TUPE, will apply to staff
transfers in this case, but it is important to give some context on how
the staff transfers might operate. Because we are restructuring and
reorganising Royal Mail Group so that Post Office Ltd will no longer be
a subsidiary of Royal Mail Group Ltd, we must ensure that the staff
involved will be protected during the reorganisation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently
about 8,000 personnel who work in the Post Office are formally employed
by Royal Mail Group, but are seconded to the Post Office. It is
important that they should be protected when they are transferred from
secondment to become formal employees of the Post Office. We hope that
the clause will make it clear that their interests will be taken into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I assure hon.
Members—the hon. Lady did not make this point, but it should be
underlined—that although certain occupational pension rights do
not transfer under TUPE it is intended that the historic pensions of
those who work at Post Office Ltd will be protected in the same way as
those of people who work for Royal Mail under part 2 of the Bill. I am
sure that we shall reach those provisions this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first step in the process of reorganisation will be agreement between
Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group Ltd on the transfer arrangements.
That would be normal way of things, as they reorganise themselves. The
Secretary of State will then designate certain contracts of employment
or employees covered by that agreement. The effect of that designation
is to confirm that once the agreement comes into force, TUPE will apply
in respect of the arrangements so designated, so that the legal
protections that come from the EU, as the hon. Lady has mentioned, will
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The TUPE
regulations require the employer to inform staff representatives of the
affected staff about the prospective transfer and consult them on any
measures affecting them that the employer envisages taking in
connection with the transfer. That is the consultation point to which
the hon. Lady rightly referred. TUPE makes it clear that there should
be both information and proper consultation, which is one reason for
our wanting the Bill to contain crystal clear confirmation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
worried about whether there were plans to de-recognise the trade union
or somehow sideline it. I assure her that that will not happen; it is
not our intention to do that. I am not often given the credit for it,
but I, and other Ministers and officials, engage regularly with the
Communication Workers Union and the National Federation of
SubPostmasters. If it is of interest to the Committee, I will detail
the meetings that have taken place with the CWU and talk about other
meetings that have taken place. I want to reassure the hon. Lady that
we are engaged with the trade union and want to continue to be so. Of
course, it is not just the CWU that is involved, but Unite, which we
have also met.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By way of
examples, on 7 June there was a meeting between the CWU and the
Secretary of State. On 3 August I met the key officials of
the CWU. On 31 August there was a meeting of officials and the
CWU about pensions. It should be borne in mind that many of the pension
regulations are a throwback to the 2009 Bill, on which there was
consultation. Those provisions are not new but have been developed with
the trade union.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On 9
September I had a meeting with the trade union. Then there was a wider
stakeholder briefing session, which the CWU attended on 20 October
and 3 November, and on 8 November there was another meeting of
officials, covering post offices, pensions, employee shares and
regulation. There are planned future meetings. On 29 November, there
will be a meeting at the request of the CWU to discuss post offices,
pensions and regulation, and a meeting with me is scheduled for 16
December.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the hon. Lady will see that that is quite a list of
engagements. I have made it clear to the general secretary of the CWU,
Mr Billy Hayes, that I am keen to meet him and his deputy, Dave Ward,
almost as often as he would like. It is often difficult to get
diaries—mine and theirs—sorted out, so that can sometimes
get in the way. I should probably tell the Committee that Mr Dave Ward
is a constituent of mine, living in Chessington. We hope to meet up for
a drink before Christmas in the North Star in Hook. We try to ensure
that we can meet in all the different
forums.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000032">&#160;</a>

reassure the Minister that my intervention is intended to be
constructive. How will the management of the modernisation process knit
in with the discussions about TUPE? Clearly, as the organisation
changes up to any potential transfer, it is important that we get our
ducks in a row on the style and nature of the modernisation programme
and on what actually ends up being transferred in terms of contracts
and the related structure.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Clearly, such issues are part of
modernisation, but let us be clear that the modernisation programme is
separate from the process that underlines the clause, which deals with
the reorganisation required as we move the transaction forward and
separate Post Office Ltd from the Royal Mail Group. That process could
continue while modernisation is under
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
trade union, the CWU, has played a constructive role in the
modernisation agreement—I have said that on a number of
occasions and am keen to underline it. If that constructive approach is
seen, which I am sure it will be, as the consultations under TUPE
happen, I am certain that there will be no problem. If there are
concerns, I am sure that CWU officials will raise them with me or my
officials.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Llanelli was kind enough to welcome subsection (7),
making it clear that a break in service length would not count against
an individual. That is clear in the text and shows that there is no
attempt to water down the protection in TUPE. She suggested that she
has worries about that, given what the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet
Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner,
said in a completely different context. I am happy to reassure her on
that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also wanted to know whether I am confident that preparations
are under way. One has to be careful, because preparations are
undertaken by the Royal Mail Group but the Bill has not passed this
place and received Royal Assent. I am sure that people in Royal Mail
Group are thinking about the implications and making plans, but it
would be wrong for me to second-guess or to say what they should be
doing, given that the House and the other place have not yet consented
to the clause and the Bill. Nevertheless, a number of processes go on
in such a complicated transaction and, as the hon. Lady will
understand, it is a complicated process even after Royal Assent, so I
am sure that people are thinking about
implementation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that I have covered all the points made by the hon. Lady. It
remains for me to say that the clause is about ensuring that staff
whose formal employment arrangements will be transferred to Post Office
Ltd retain the same rights as they had under employment contract with
the Royal Mail Group. That has brought the Committee together, so I
recommend the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
3 is fairly minor, but is necessary to avoid confusion. As a former
lawyer, I have spent many happy hours arguing about the exact meanings
of words and phrases in documents, and about the consequences of
misplaced or wrongly used words. The wording of the clause means that
the company must give, as part of its report to Parliament, details of
“the company’s post offices.” I do not ascribe any
evil intent to the Minister in using those words, and I am sure that
the intention behind the clause is simply that the company will be
obliged to list all the post offices and sub-post offices in operation
when the report is drawn up. However, that is not necessarily what the
clause
says.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the evidence sessions, we heard about the different structures within
the post office network. Crown post offices are run directly by Post
Office Ltd, many independent businesses contain a post office as part
of the business and, as I have mentioned, in the last round of post
office closures many stand-alone post offices were closed and
amalgamated with other businesses, such as WH Smith, the
Co-op and small, local businesses. The main post office in Arbroath, in
my constituency, was a large premises in a covered shopping centre. It
was closed and transferred to a small part of a newsagent in the high 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 383<a class="bkMark" name="Column383">&#160;</a>
                           </div>street. A similar process happened some years ago in Montrose, where the
post office was transferred from a stand-alone building to part of the
Co-op supermarket. The supermarket has since downsized severely and is
now a convenience store. That has left the main post office only a
small part of its floor
space.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
point I am trying to tease out is whether such post offices are
“the company’s” or whether, as franchises, they
might be regarded as not the company’s property, because they
are not directly operated by the company. One reading of the phrase
“the company’s post offices” would restrict the
meaning to stand-alone post offices that are operated directly by Post
Office Ltd. I am sure that the Minister, in his inimitable style, will
dismiss that
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I draw the Committee’s attention to the evidence of Moya Greene,
the chief executive of Royal Mail, from our first
sitting:<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
me it is unthinkable that we would not have a very long-term
relationship with the Post Office. Here is a group of people—the
best and strongest network in the country, by any yardstick, with
11,900 outlets—who are committed to and want to sell our
products…To me it is unthinkable that we would ever have
anything but the very strong relationship that we have now with the
Post Office. I admire our other partners like WHSmith; of course I do.
But that is not the Post
Office.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Postal

                        </p>
                        <p>That is
a significant statement. In many communities, operations such as WH
Smith are the post office. On Tuesday, the hon. Member for Folkestone
and Hythe said that his local post office in his constituency
was in WH Smith. In Aberdeen, the main post office is in WH
Smith. As I have said, in my constituency there are post offices in the
Co-op and in a local newsagent. It is interesting that Ms Greene makes
that distinction. It appears that she sees the Post Office as those
branches that are run directly by Post Office Ltd. The clause might
therefore be read to mean only those branches. We need to know from the
report to Parliament how many post offices and sub-post offices there
are in total, whoever runs them and wherever they may
be.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
emphasise my point, I direct Committee members to the memorandum that
we received yesterday from Royal Mail Group. Paragraph 14, under the
heading “The Role of the Post Office,”
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Post
Office Ltd is a separate company within the Group. It derives
substantial revenues from financial services and Government services as
well as retailing postal products. A third of Post Office revenues
relate to postal products. Its structure is different—with 97%
of post offices operated and owned by local business people, working
through agency agreements with Post Office
Ltd.”<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000149">&#160;</a>

I said at the outset, I am not saying that there is a Machiavellian
plot by the Minister to avoid telling Parliament the true state of the
post office network and I am sure that his intention was not what I
have described, but I ask him to consider the provision in more detail,
because there is an opportunity for confusion in it and Parliament may
not get the full information that we will require, if the Bill is
passed, to ensure the future of our post offices, which are so
important to our communities. Before the Minister rejects the amendment
out of hand, I ask him to consider accepting it, because it could avoid
an embarrassing situation arising later
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000063">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 384<a class="bkMark" name="Column384">&#160;</a>
                           </div>post offices are now stand-alone businesses; they almost always form
part of a larger business, but often form an important part of that
business. In many of those set-ups, neither the post office business
nor the other part of the business would succeed on its own, but
together they form a reasonable, if often hardly very profitable,
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard a great deal in Committee about the need for local post
offices to diversify to enable them to have a greater business base. It
should be borne in mind that many of the remaining sub-post offices are
not stand-alone sub-post offices but are coupled with a
shop—often the only shop left in the community. Indeed, I can
think of only two post offices in my constituency that are not part of
another
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Efforts
have been made to make post offices more viable. I have referred in
previous debates to the Scottish Government schemes. The business bonus
scheme provides rates relief to businesses with properties in Scotland
that have a combined rateable value of £18,000 or less. The
rural business rate scheme offers further relief. As a result of the
scheme, all properties with a rateable value of up to £10,000
pay no business rates; those between £10,000 and £12,000
get relief of 50%; and between £12,000 and £18,000 the
relief is 25%. Those with more than one property can get cumulative
relief; if cumulative values go up to £25,000, they can get 25%.
The scheme has been a huge boost to small businesses in constituencies
such as mine and has also helped many of the surviving post offices by
substantially cutting one of their major
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, the Scottish Government, like the Welsh Assembly, have
launched a post office diversification fund, which has recently made
awards totalling £1 million to help post offices to
diversify and launch new business activities to strengthen the vital
role that they play in our local communities. In Scotland the fund
opened in July, with 49 post offices in 22 areas bidding successfully
and receiving awards of up to £25,000. Examples of the
diversification schemes approved include the setting up of an internet
café and the selling of local
produce.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000067">&#160;</a>

ensure that Parliament gets a full and accurate picture of the health
of our post office network, we must have the information on the nature
and extent of any business being run in parallel with the post office
business. We may not be dealing with a post office standing alone. It
could be a post office that is part of a village shop. It could be the
only shop in the village. Perhaps it is part of a pub or even the local
fish and chip shop. Those are all important aspects. I am not
suggesting that we need to know, for example, the financial health of
the businesses. Much of that information will be confidential to
whoever runs the business. However, we need to know exactly what we are
dealing with in respect of post offices and the impact that those post
offices have on local communities throughout the United
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000069">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman’s point. When I receive this report, as a
Member of Parliament or a member of the public, how can I interpret
whether or not a post office is running parallel businesses? Is the
fact that it is a sign of its strength or a sign of its weakness,
because it cannot operate as a stand-alone? How am I supposed to
interpret the fact that it works as a small shop rather than as a
restaurant? How will I interpret this information that will obviously
have a cost to

                           </strong> I am not sure that it will have a cost to collect,
because Post Office Ltd will know the information anyway. If Post
Office Ltd operates franchises up and down the country, it will know
the nature of them. I hope that a properly run company would
be in regular contact with its franchisees and know what sort of
businesses they are running. I return to my point—it is a point
that I have made often in these debates—that the Royal Mail and
the Post Office are not just another business. The Post Office, in
particular, has an important social function in many of our
communities. Effectively, it is part of the building block that helps
to make businesses viable. We must understand the impact that Post
Office Ltd, which will hopefully continue to be a Government-owned
business, has in our local community. How the Member uses that
information is up to him, but I suggest that many of us would like
regularly to contact the post offices to see how they are getting on
with their business. We need to know the overall picture throughout the
United Kingdom of how Post Office Ltd is operating in concert with
those other
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have not specifically spoken to the NFSP. As
parliamentarians, I feel strongly that if the calamity of the
privatisation of Royal Mail is to happen, we need to know how the
network is operating. After this Bill is passed, Post Office Ltd will
have a completely new structure. The amendment is not particularly
onerous. I am asking not for businesses to divulge their financial
circumstances but for Parliament to have an overall picture of our post
office network: how it operates in concert with other parts of the
businesses; how it impacts on communities; and how it operates
throughout the country. The amendment is reasonable, and I ask the
Minister to consider
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
final amendment in my name is fairly minor. It seeks to ensure that
once a report is laid before Parliament, there will be a chance for
Members to debate it fairly quickly. It may well be that that is the
Government’s intention, but that is not what the clause says.
The phrase “laid before Parliament” can mean many things,
from putting a report in the Vote Office and issuing a written
ministerial statement through to having a debate. If this Bill goes
through Parliament and the disaster of a privatised postal delivery
service comes to pass, the 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>only part of the existing Royal Mail Group that Parliament will have any
real say in is Post Office Ltd. It is vital that Members have the
opportunity regularly to debate the report that is laid before
Parliament on the health and well-being of that group and ensure that
the Government have kept their promise that there will no post office
closures. Such a debate will also include the information that I have
already sought in respect of amendment 4.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">None of these
amendments is earth-shattering, but they would improve the Bill. They
would allow a regular debate in Parliament on the health of our post
office network. Too often in past years, the only time that we have
debated the Post Office is when there has been a disaster, when there
are closure programmes and when we are all trying desperately to defend
the services in our communities. If we are truly to go forward with a
new set-up, there should be a regular debate in Parliament on those
aspects of Post Office Ltd, which, as it stands, will remain a
Government-owned company—a taxpayer-owned company, I
suppose—until such time as it is mutualised, if it ever is.
Those are important issues, and, rather than dismissing them, I ask the
Minister to consider these amendments and accept that, particularly in
the case of amendment 3, they will be helpful in tidying up a
potentially difficult drafting
error.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
11, which covers the requirement for an annual report on the post
office network, is important for checking on the health of the post
office network. Although it has always been important to know exactly
what is happening, it assumes even greater importance when we know the
significant sums of taxpayers’ money that are being invested in
the network. I support amendment 5, because, given such
significant investment, we want to see strengthened accountability. The
amendment requires the Secretary of State to name, within five days of
the report being laid, a date on which the report may be debated on the
Floor of the House. That, of course, will raise the report’s
profile. It will make people aware that the report has not just been
shoved on the top shelf to be left to gather dust, but has instead been
brought to the attention of hon. Members and that an opportunity has
been made available for debate. We hope, in light of more
favourable news than has sometimes been the case, that there
will be progress towards making the Post Office a successful and viable
network—as the hon. Member for Angus has pointed out, it is
often a crisis situation that sparks
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000077">&#160;</a>

it is particularly pertinent at a time of great change that we know
what progress has been made towards making the Post Office financially
viable. We heard on Tuesday how the Minister hopes that, by 2015, the
post office network will be in a healthy enough state to be mutualised.
It is vital, therefore, that we see the progress that is being made
towards that goal. I am interested in outcomes, and we need that debate
to focus on them. What return are we getting from that investment? We
discussed that a little on Tuesday, and we know that about half the
allocated money will provide a subsidy for running the network. So what

                           </div>progress is being made towards reducing the need for that subsidy? That
is why we want to know the number and location of post offices, and
that is why we want to know whether there are any vacancies where one
sub-postmaster has shut up shop and no one has yet been found to take
over.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000078">&#160;</a>

George Thomson told the all-party group on post offices that there are
currently 900 vacancies in which former post offices were kept as post
office locations by Post Office Ltd—they were not down for
closure—and yet no one can be found to run them. That is the
reason why it so important to have such a report detailing the number
of post office locations in the network, so that we can find out
whether that figure is diminishing. We know that that is not just a
figure, because each of those 900 cases represents a community that has
lost its heart. We will want to know whether that figure is being
reduced and whether we shall have the pleasure of seeing more post
offices reopen, as the hon. Member for Witham described the other

                           </strong> As the hon. Member for Angus has explained, it
is not necessarily about having the detailed business information of
each business, but about looking at the network to see whether there
are 900 vacancies or whether they have been reduced to 400. We very
much hope that they will be reduced and agree with the hon. Member for
Folkestone and Hythe that the more partnerships that can be set up, the
better. What we want to know is whether that progress is being made.

the attention of the House so that, if we think that certain trends and
directions of travel need to be questioned, that information will
inform the decision making and the debate about where we go next. We
hope that it will be a good news story and that positives will be
reported back. The bulk of that work will be done anyway. The amendment

whether a post office would exist without a parallel business. Can it
only exist if it is in that sort of partnership, and which is the
stronger partner? Is it the business or the post office? We have
examples of both situations across the country. There are varying
degrees of dependence on each of the components—a little shop, a
garage, a post office, a newsagent or everything rolled into
one—and the post office proportion of the business will
vary.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000090">&#160;</a>

example from my constituency of a post office business that is
effectively just a post office. An enormous number of residents live
close to the post office, and they all use it for their transactions.

down the road in a different area is the complete reverse: that post

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and one that
is made frequently by the hon. Member for Bedford. The taxpayer
deserves value for money, and people want to know what return we are
getting on that substantial investment. It may be a popular investment,
but nevertheless the money must be accounted for. It is right to debate
that issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are
interested in outcomes. How will post offices be made more viable? That
is what we want to evaluate; it would be nice if the Post Office were
eventually viable enough to need less Government subsidy.
Subsection (2)(b) will be key to the report and debate,
because we will want to know what exactly is happening with postal
services. Will volumes decline? What percentage of Post Office’s
income will still come from postal services? What will happen in
respect of the inter-business agreement?<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the Bill
comes into force by 2012 and the proposed mutualisation of the Post
Office occurs in 2015, the period when the reports are collated will be
key for the Post Office. We will want the chance to debate them,
because we will want to know what plans are afoot to renew the
inter-business agreement with Royal Mail. The few years after the Bill
passes will be critical in determining the direction of the Post
Office, because we will see during that time what real commitment a
privatised Royal Mail is making to honour the remaining period of the
existing inter-business agreement, assuming that it is transferred
over, and to lay plans for a new one.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000097">&#160;</a>

will ensure that the report is brought promptly to the House’s
attention and that a date is set for debate. In that debate, we shall
be able to scrutinise what services are being provided not only because
of Royal Mail volumes but because of arrangements with Departments. We
read much in the glossy document, “Securing the Post Office
Network in the Digital Age,” about the intention and ambition
that the network would become an important counter for a wider range

			Column number: 390<a class="bkMark" name="Column390">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of Government services. As yet, however, there has been little sign of
any of those fine words becoming bankable contracts, so we will
certainly debate with interest the report on those Government services.
We will want to know whether any increased provision of Government
services has increased footfall, whether that has led to increased use
of other services provided by the Post Office and whether that in turn
has increased turnover and profitability. We are talking about a
crucial period during which the Post Office might be preparing for
mutualisation, and we understand that it needs to be profitable by that
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
shall also be particularly interested to debate what the Bill refers to
as the “other services” provided at post offices. As has
been said, we are disappointed not to have seen any fruition of the
post bank plans—something that contrasts rather sharply with the
commitments we made before the election, and with those that the
Liberal Democrats outlined in their manifesto. The truth of the matter
is that it is not always easy to set up a business or entice customers
to a new stream of business. The Government will have to do some
serious thinking on what they can realistically suggest for new
business streams.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It seems to
me that some of the money that is to be invested in the Post Office
will need to be set aside for entrepreneurial activity, namely the
development of those new business streams, if the network is to become
more profitable. At the moment, it is not clear from those spending
plans whether they will focus simply on subsidy and physical and
technological refurbishment, nice though that might be. Of course, that
might include things that do extend to providing new business, which I
hope will happen. The hon. Member for Angus, for example, mentioned the
idea of a cyber-café, which was also cited in the Welsh Assembly
documentation as a potential use of the funding that it has been
provided with, and there is the possible use of things such as photo
booths. We know that the inclusion of cash machines in many post
offices has helped them. Those are examples of how a refurbishment
could also bring new forms of business, and we would hope to see such
developments as part of a much more viable network, building on the
good examples of the work that has already been done by schemes such as
that of the Welsh Assembly
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
shall also be supporting amendment 4, tabled by the hon. Member for
Angus, which would require the report to include details on the nature
and extent of any business running in parallel with the post office. We
have discussed that at some length, and I hope that the Government will
consider supporting the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously, it
is important that we get that picture so that we know where we are
going. We frequently find post offices that are also village shops, but
because we are now such a car-centred society, the local garage is
replacing the newsagent, so post offices are moving into garages.
Things move on and do not remain static. There are new developments all
the time. Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence, it would be nice
to have the facts and figures for those parallel businesses, and a
proper analysis. We need to know the nature of the diversification
strategies and partnerships that are developing, which is why amendment
4 is important. We could then debate the report, according to the
requirements set out in amendment 5. As we have

                           </div>mentioned, the development money, now called the diversification fund,
provided by the Welsh Assembly Government has helped considerably, and
they are trying to be creative and to think of new and different ways
that another business stream might be included within a post
office.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2)(c) relates to the accessibility of post offices. In the report that
we hope will have to be debated in Parliament, we would want
information on how the access criteria are working out. Those access
criteria were developed to ensure that communities would continue to be
fairly served by a national post office network. I am pleased that the
coalition Government saw fit to include those criteria in their recent
document, and that they have been transferred en bloc. They provide
that 99% of the population will be within three miles of their nearest
outlet and 90% within one mile; that in deprived urban areas, 99% will
be within one mile; that in urban areas, 95% will be within one mile;
and that in rural areas, 95% will be within three miles.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The criteria
are most important, but that simple statement of intent has to be made
into reality. I refer to the IBA. It would really help to have a signed
and sealed inter-business agreement for a minimum of 10
years—or, preferably, a measure in the Bill that would establish
a greater number of access points. An IBA with the post office network
combined with a definition in the Bill of a greater number of access
points would be significant. Again, it is something on which we would
like to receive a report. The clause is extremely important not only in
providing a report, but in allowing us to debate it.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000104">&#160;</a>

Parliament, and others to pursue the Post Office on the activities that
it is undertaking to restore services. For example, I have asked for
the extension of the mobile service from elsewhere in my constituency
into that area, but to date have not been
successful.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000110">&#160;</a>

is nothing in the Bill that will cause the more than 900 Bankfoots to
regain their post offices, but the provision of the information will
allow for a level of focus and engagement that might—just
might—lead to a better, and possibly quicker, solution for
villages just like Bankfoot. I cannot see the amendment being
particularly onerous for the Post Office, as I imagine that the
information could be easily abstracted from that which the company
already holds on file. None of the amendments on gathering additional
information places a particular burden on
anyone.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000111">&#160;</a>

36, which is similar to amendment 33, calls for the inclusion of the
number of post office services that have ceased to be delivered since
the last report, and a list of their locations, and also the reasons
for that service reduction. It would give us information not only on
the numbers, which I acknowledge might already be available in some
form, but the locations. That would be more easily done by Post Office
Ltd, and would complete a level of information that should be
forthcoming to ensure transparency. It is different from amendment 33
in that it deals with the change between one year’s report and
the next, and not with locations that have a historical delivery
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000114">&#160;</a>

of reasons, as I have already mentioned, but whatever those reasons it
would be appropriate and beneficial, particularly to communities and

Post Office Ltd already holds the information, and therefore there is
little or no burden

constituency, Post Office Ltd has been able to tell me why. Recently
information arrived on my desk telling me very soon after the event
that structural damage caused by some potentially criminal activity
meant that the postal services in Coalsnaughton would not be available
for a time. That is proof that Post Office Ltd already has the data,

37 would create an obligation on the Post Office to include in its
annual report the number and identities of locations receiving mobile
provision. Those of us in rural constituencies have experience of
mobile provision, and the amendment would be useful as it would make it
possible to monitor the growth, or the demise, of mobile provision, and
individuals and Members of Parliament would be empowered by that
information.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000116">&#160;</a>

Members of Parliament we work in silos, known as constituencies, and we
should not—and do not—expect Post Office Ltd to do the
same. I have in the past requested that Bankfoot—referring back
to it—be serviced by a mobile provision, extending the provision
into three locations in my constituency. I have been told that that is
not possible due to the resources of the provision facility. What I am
not aware of, because Post Office does not work in silos, is exactly
where the mobile provision that serves my constituency also serves
someone else’s constituency or other people’s
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000117">&#160;</a>

of the fact that there does not seem to be enough of such mobile
services available? Unfortunately, two categories do not seem to
qualify. The first is where there simply is no provision, and the
second is a busy post office in a relatively deprived urban area, where
I am told that the volume of customers is too high to provide a mobile
service. We have an irony: neither the remote rural area nor the
high-volume post office in an urban area can access the mobile service.
It would be nice to see a substantial increase in the number of those
services available.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000118">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I wholeheartedly agree. There have been examples in
my constituency where the mobile provision has not been available
because the van—“the van”—has broken down,
and there was no replacement van; I think the hon. Member for Angus may
be able to confirm that. That problem has now been addressed, and there
is some degree of stand-by and back-up facility service now. However,
that is not to undervalue the possibility of a couple of knock-on
issues occurring where services could be reduced because there is still
a lack of facility, availability and volume of such
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli also made the point about locations
that are too busy for a post office van. A post office van works to a
timetable. It goes from one place to another, and it has to be there at
11.30. If that time becomes 12.15 because it was busy somewhere else,
that would drive down the usage of post office services. The general
thrust of the argument is that it would be hugely important and
empowering to us as Members of Parliament, and to the wider public, to
know the extent and spread of mobile service provision.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
mentioned the reasons why the mobile network could not be extended to
Bankfoot. I am not for a minute doubting the accuracy of what I have
been told, but it would be very useful and empowering for me to be
furnished with the accurate data in the form of an annual report that
reinforced the decisions that have been made in this case. That allows
a level of transparency and scrutiny that Post Office Ltd and the
Minister should not be too worried about. It will allow us to monitor
whether the level of provision through such means is growing or
shrinking. That is important. While the mobile service is better than
no service, if we gave communities and MPs an opportunity, they would
say that they would much rather have a full-time, fixed and static
service. However, we recognise the challenges that face the network,
and we recognise that once a lot of our constituents have crossed the
threshold into a mobile service, they embrace it in a positive way. It
may not necessarily be what we are used to, and there may be change,
but not all change is bad. As long as it keeps delivering services into
areas, I am sure that the people of Bankfoot will be happy to have a
post office van turn up on Tuesdays and Thursdays so they can do their
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The longer we
have locations, such as the 900 that have been mentioned, that are
without services, the easier it is for people to do their business
elsewhere. They will have to do their post office business in another
post office, but they can buy stamps and whatever else they might have
bought from the post office, such as envelopes, from Tesco. They can
get into the habit of not visiting the post office. The amendments are
important for us to understand the changes to the network, and do
everything that we can to keep those communities that do not have a
post office interested in having one.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 38
sits perfectly with other amendments in the group, particularly
amendment 36 which, among other things, focuses on the reasons for the
service demise. Amendment 38 would add information on those locations
identified in amendment 36, by informing through the report the steps
that Post Office Ltd was undertaking to address any service
reduction.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
information is undoubtedly available to Post Office Ltd. I alluded to
an example in Coalsnaughton in my constituency, where a letter arrived
on my desk telling me why there was a break in service provision. There
was another instance last year in Tillicoultry where Post Office Ltd
provided me with the reasons for the service break. Such information is
well known to Post Office Ltd, and it will know what it is doing to
address the break in the service provision. If it is aware of that, it
is appropriate for us as Members of Parliament to know what is being
done to address service provision, without having to chase the matter
up and ask for an answer.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must be
totally aware of the processes used by Post Office Ltd. For example, if
I call our local retail office to ask what is being done to improve
services in Tillicoultry or Bankfoot, it will tell me there and then
what is being done. Next week that might be different; option 1 moves
to option 2, 3 or 4, and it would be good for us to fully understand
what Post Office Ltd does to replace those services. That is the level
of information that could come out through the report.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000125">&#160;</a>

establish the level of utilisation from the universal service provider,

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Information
has been bandied about concerning the value of the footfall and the
revenue that Post Office Ltd receives through Royal Mail
business. Post Office Ltd must have that information on record, and it
would be appropriate for it to be included annually in the Post Office
report. That would allow us to see the level of change, and whether a
third becomes a quarter or 40%. As we move forward into a possibly
uncertain time in universal service provision, it would be a valuable
measure or barometer to see the impact of the legislation, and measure
that against the business that Post Office Ltd is enjoying in the
future as a result of universal service provision or
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000127">&#160;</a>

amendment 49 would change subsection (3)(c) from “small
businesses” to “small and medium businesses.” It
should probably say “small and medium-sized businesses”,
but it does not. We argue that that would be a useful extension to the
report to ensure that accessibility of medium-sized businesses to the
post office network becomes a requirement of the annual
report.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that we focus on medium-sized businesses as they will have
a responsibility and an opportunity to access many of the services that
Post Office Ltd currently offers and, possibly more importantly, the
whole range of services that it and perhaps the Minister hope it will
be able to offer in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will leave the definition of “medium-sized business” to
Ministers in BIS; I would be happy to accept their definition. However,
there are many medium-sized businesses. By the nature of their business
or the products that they may be marketing or manufacturing, a
medium-sized business might look very much like a small business. The
categorisation depends on the measure used—turnover or the
number of people employed. Therefore, it is important that we
understand that businesses of all sizes have the potential to use post
office services. We should be trying to encourage and monitor that. I
will not place the burden on the Minister or Post Office Ltd to apply
that to all businesses. We will leave large businesses out of the
amendment, but it would be valuable to include the impact of
medium-sized businesses in the report, as the amendment
states.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli and I believe that our amendments
and those tabled by the hon. Member for Angus would provide
significantly better information in a readily accessible and
understandable format—a format that already basically exists. I
would argue that, if not all, the lion’s share of the
information that we want to be included in this section already
exists—it is already known within Post Office Ltd—and
that the Minister and Post Office Ltd may well find this batch of
amendments helpful as they go forward. I genuinely hope that
the Minister can accept them in the constructive and informative spirit
in which they are offered. They are offered to allow Members of
Parliament and the public to have a better understanding of the post
office network, and what Post Office Ltd is doing to reinstate services
in their area. Also, members of the public may engage in a relationship
with Post Office Ltd which possibly does not exist at this
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
we are including clause stand part in this debate, I want to ask the
Minister about a couple of issues that have been touched on but in
slightly different ways. The first question is about the reference in
the clause to “the company’s post offices”. We
assumed in our amendment that the report would not include mobile
services. Perhaps the Minister might specify when looking at the
amendment whether the report that is required by the Bill would include
mobile services. If it did, that would be as good as accepting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
on the publication of the report and whether it gathers dust or we are
able to do something constructive with it, I would support calls for an
annual debate on the issue. I was going to be a little bit more
conciliatory—<em>[Interruption.]</em> The Minister sniggers, but I
was. I was going to suggest a Westminster Hall debate, if that would
have been appropriate. <em>[Interruption.]</em> It would be better if
that debate was held in the main Chamber, but I can understand that,
possibly due to pressures of time and so on, such a debate may not
always be available. Westminster Hall is a vehicle that is used for
Government responses to reports, so the Minister might be able to
accept a debate there, whereas he may not be able to accept the thrust
of the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli and
the hon. Member for
Angus.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000133">&#160;</a>

amendments are reasonable. They are intended to allow the gathering of
information and to allow transparency and scrutiny into the post office
network. As we move into an uncharted time in relation to Royal Mail
and Post Office Ltd, the level of information asked for is not
unreasonable. It would be empowering to us as Members of Parliament and
to Post Office Ltd, eventually, if we were able to see the engagement
that we would be able to have and, I hope, the benefits that the
information would deliver to post office service delivery in our
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000134">&#160;</a>

easily accessible, comprehensive and relevant.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000140">&#160;</a>

includes the number and location of post offices, postal services,
services provided under arrangements with a Government Department and
other services that are provided at those post offices, and the
accessibility of those post offices to users. The report would also
provide specific accessibility information regarding individuals in
rural areas, urban areas, small businesses, and individuals who are
disadvantaged, are on low incomes, have disabilities or are elderly.
That is welcome. However, given that the Government are intent on full
privatisation, the clause must ensure more robust and targeted
transparency. The report must highlight and examine more in-depth
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10112527000141">&#160;</a>

affecting the post office network, thereby providing more effective
