<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000250"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
once again, Mr. Hood. Clause 65 has provoked an enormous
degree of concern from outside bodies. Pretty well every outside body
that has examined this Bill has objected to it. The clause enables the
Treasury by order to amend the law contained in this Bill. It allows
secondary legislation to amend primary legislation, which is in itself
objectionable. There must be at least a presumption that a clause such
as this&#151;often described as a Henry VIII clause&#151;should be
scrutinised heavily and, ideally, removed, unless there is a very, very
strong case for its retention.</div>
<a name="08111388000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before going
into the detail of clause 65 and the amendments that we have proposed
to ameliorate some of the difficulties, it is worth highlighting again
one of the broader problems&#151;perhaps the most
important&#151;contained within this Bill, which is the degree of
uncertainty it creates with regard to some transactions. We discussed
at some length the safeguards regarding partial transfers when we
debated clauses 42 and 43. As I commented on Tuesday, those safeguards
are not necessarily well developed. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>There is a concern in capital markets that the UK could be left with a
regulatory regime that will enable the authorities to interfere in
transactions, leaving some creditors worse off than they would be
otherwise.</div>
<a name="08111388000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may help
if I inform the Committee that since our debate on Tuesday I have had
discussions with two lawyers from leading international firms, one of
whom told me he was aware of a transaction that was not completed
because one party was concerned that the provisions in the Bill created
too much uncertainty. The other lawyer told me that she was aware of a
transaction that nearly fell through for the same reason. Those cases
related specifically to issues of partial transfer but with clause 65,
on top of the uncertainty in the Bill as a whole regarding partial
transfer, there is uncertainty surrounding the power to change the law
by order without proper parliamentary scrutiny. As a practical example
of the difficulties this may impose, the lawyers I spoke to have the
view that they may need to qualify legal opinion to a client
considering a transaction with a UK bank by referring to clause 65.
Notwithstanding everything else they may have said about the legal
position, there is a risk that the law could be changed very easily by
an order. That further complicates the matter. For that practical
reason, many outside bodies are concerned about clause 65, as well as
for the constitutional reason that Parliament appears to be
surrendering its ability to properly scrutinise legislation in that
field. Those are strong objections, and I suspect that the Minister
will not be able to persuade us that clause 65 is acceptable.</div>
<a name="08111388000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
various attempts to improve the Bill and to provide some
comfort and certainty to those outside bodies. Amendment No. 119
relates to subsection (1), which is at the heart of the
clause. It states that the Treasury has to have regard to the special
resolution objectives. That test is insufficiently strong. We propose
that in using the exceptional powers the Treasury should, at the very
least, be satisfied that not to do so threatens the stability of, or
confidence in, the UK financial systems. I dare say that the Minister
will point out that the objectives of the special resolution regime
touch upon that, but the Treasury merely &#147;having regard&#148;
is not reasonable. The wording is so weak that it seems to attempt to
avoid any kind of judicial review of decisions made under the clause.
It needs to be toughened up, so that the Treasury is at the very least
&#147;satisfied&#148; that there is systemic risk before using the
powers. I would usually say &#147;reasonably satisfied&#148;, but
we have debated that it is not normal to insert
&#147;reasonable&#148; in a provision that applies to a public
body. The Treasury should not be able to use the powers as a routine
way of trying to improve the legislation. It is the purpose of the
Committee to examine and improve the Bill, and it is not appropriate
for the Government subsequently to be able to do so, by producing an
unamendable
order.</div><a name="08111388000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 155 relates to subsection (3)&#151;yet another objectionable
element of the Bill. As the clause stands, an order may make provision
that has retrospective effect. Therefore, not only will it be possible
to change the law with an order, but that law can be retrospective. I
do not need to go into enormous detail to highlight the uncertainty
produced by the ability to create retrospective law. Transactions that
have been entered into in good faith based on the law as it stands, can
be disrupted as a consequence of subsection (3).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div><a name="08111388000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 120 to subsection (9) is similar to amendment No. 119. Generally,
orders under clause 65 will be made by affirmative resolution. It
should, of course, be by such resolution, to the extent that it is
acceptable for orders to be made in that way. The subsection allows the
Treasury to make orders other than by affirmative resolution, but there
is no higher test as to when those orders can be made; it is not
necessary that there be a need to protect the stability of, or
confidence in, the UK financial systems or that there is systemic risk.
The amendment seeks to address
that.</div><a name="08111388000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government also propose that they should be able to make an order in
such circumstances during a parliamentary recess. The order would not
need to be ratified for 28 days, not counting the period during the
parliamentary recess, so it is perfectly possible that the Government
could change primary legislation in August by an order that would not
be ratified until the House returned in
October.</div><a name="08111388000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111388000251"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): How does the hon.
Gentleman propose that special measures should be taken? An awful lot
of the problems with Northern Rock, and other problems this year,
unfolded while Parliament was in recess, and we had to kick our heels
because the Government did not have the powers set out in the Bill. How
does he propose to deal with crises that occur during our long
recess?</div><a name="08111388000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000252"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The powers do not necessarily require a crisis in
order to be used. If it is a genuine crisis&#151;in which
circumstances there may, at a push, be a case for such
provisions&#151;Parliament should be recalled, and we should
scrutinise the measures properly. What we cannot have is a period of
several months every year when there is no parliamentary
input.</div>
<a name="08111388000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000253"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the recall,
but does he propose that primary legislation should be used? As we have
seen, that takes a long time.
</div><a name="08111388000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000254"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I do think that primary legislation should be
amended by primary legislation. I disapprove of Henry VIII clauses. We
are talking about the ability to amend primary legislation by an order
that may occur while Parliament is in recess, with no opportunity for
Parliament to take a view at the time, and the subsequent retrospective
ratification of that decision, possibly some months later. If we are
talking about a genuine crisis, Parliament should be recalled. Indeed,
one could argue that Parliament should be recalled much more frequently
than it is. If we need to change primary legislation because we face a
systemic risk, of course Parliament should be there to debate it. I am
grateful to the hon. Lady for agreeing with that in her
comments.</div>
<a name="08111388000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111388000255"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): Reluctant as I am to agree
with the Government on almost anything these days, there is a serious
point about the legislation. The hon. Gentleman will recall that in the
Northern Rock shambles, one of the difficulties that it faced was the
argument that it could not achieve a weekend takeover when it was
alleged that there was an early bid from Lloyds TSB. Surely the
measures are meant precisely to facilitate immediate action in such
circumstances, notwithstanding the difficulties of our being in recess
for a prolonged period. Surely that is part of the process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div><a name="08111388000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000256"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> But the purpose of the Bill is to create the
framework for the authorities to act quickly. If the primary
legislation is produced properly, we should be in a position to give
the authorities the flexibility to deal with crises, yet what we have
here is essentially a suggestion that maybe we have not got the Bill
right at all, that we might need to make changes as we go along and
that every time we face a new crisis we will just make a quick change
by way of an order. I fear that that suggests that the Government are
not entirely confident with the legislation as it
stands.</div>
<a name="08111388000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111388000257"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): Is it not really
an admission of the potential failure of all that we have been doing
here? Frankly, clause 65 would obviate almost everything else that we
have been discussing for the past few weeks, because it would allow it
to be changed. Unless we can tighten the clause up considerably to
apply to very specific circumstances, leaving it as it is would be
wholly
inappropriate.</div><a name="08111388000219"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08111388000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000258"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> What is proposed is far too broad, even if we
recognise that not every piece of legislation is perfect. To accept
these provisions, as they currently stand, will create uncertainty. So
there is a practical effect. As the hon. Gentleman says, the purpose of
these Committee proceedings is to ensure that the Bill is right and not
to enable legislation to be easily changed
subsequently.</div><a name="08111388000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111388000259"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I have some sympathy
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, but it would be
extraordinary arrogance on the part of the Government and members of
the Committee if they thought that they had produced conclusive answers
to a problem that had not been foreseen 12 months ago, and for
which&#151;this deserves a lot of criticism&#151;virtually no
planning had taken place. Some realism on the need for flexibility and
the opportunity to think afresh would be
welcome.</div><a name="08111388000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000260"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As always, the hon. Gentleman makes a thoughtful
point. If there is something wrong with the primary legislation, let
Parliament look at it again properly. Clause 65 essentially enables the
Treasury to make orders that come into effect potentially long before
Parliament has the opportunity to address them. Amendment No. 121
highlights the issue of the recess and the long period of time that may
elapse between the passing of the order and an opportunity for
Parliament to scrutinise
it.</div><a name="08111388000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me also highlight one of the issues contained within subsection (9)(c),
which amendment No. 156 seeks to delete. Even if Parliament eventually
gets a chance to scrutinise this change in legislation and to debate an
order that has been passed before it has had an opportunity to debate
and vote on it, the lapse of such an order</div>
<a name="08111388000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does not
invalidate anything done under or in reliance on the order before the
lapse and at a time when neither House has declined to approve the
order&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems a very curious state of affairs. Not only can the Government
change primary legislation by an order, but they can change it by an
order that has not been debated by the Committee. Furthermore that
order can have had effect for two or three months, even though, when
Parliament does have an opportunity to vote on it, it defeats it. That
is an extraordinary situation to be
in.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000261"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman is pulling out one paragraph of
a subsection when, as I understand the drafting, all the subsections
apply. It is and, and, and. It is not this one, or this one or this
one. To take out one paragraph and say that it is the be-all and
end-all is quite wrong. It is a misunderstanding of the way that the
legislation is drafted and of all the caveats that have been put in to
safeguard against the misuse of order-making
powers.</div><a name="08111388000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000262"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Lady&#146;s comment,
although I do not agree with her. On the question of safeguards, if she
believes in safeguards in subsection (9), I hope that she
will support amendment No. 120, which inserts a safeguard that the
measures should apply only in the event of a systemic risk. Subsection
(9)
begins:</div><a name="08111388000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But
if the Treasury think it
necessary&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;which
is not too great a safeguard, I would suggest&#151;it may make an
order without complying with the affirmative resolution. The order can
be made, but will lapse after 28 days, ignoring recesses. Even if it
does lapse, however, nothing done under it is invalidated. Furthermore,
under subsection (9)(d), nothing is to prevent the making of a new
order, so, conceivably, the Treasury could happily continue making
orders every 28 days&#151;it could get defeated, introduce another
one and so on ad infinitum.</div>
<a name="08111388000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point to
the hon. Lady is that that is not a set of different conditions, but
the order in which things will happen. First, an order will be made
without affirmative resolution. Secondly, if it lapses after 28 days,
it will be deemed to have been effective before lapsing. That is my
objection: in that period, an order changing primary legislation, which
Parliament will not have considered, will remain law. If she disagrees
with that interpretation, I will happily accept a further
intervention.</div><a name="08111388000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have proposed a new subsection (10)
stating:</div><a name="08111388000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
Order under this section may amend subsections (8) or
(9).&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment&#146;s purpose is merely to highlight the fact that if
clause 65 can enable the Bill to be amended, it could presumably amend
the safeguard in clause 65(8), which does at least say that
any amendment should be made by affirmative resolution. Presumably,
however, the Government could use the affirmative resolution to scrap
subsection (8), and from then on the negative resolution only would be
used. That does not provide much of a
safeguard.</div><a name="08111388000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause creates great constitutional difficulties, and we in Parliament
take such matters very seriously. Some in the outside world are
enormously concerned about the way in which the clause injects
uncertainty into the system. We already criticise the Bill for causing
concerns about partial transfers. That is not a theoretical concern:
already transactions are not happening as a consequence. We debated
that on Tuesday, and I think that the Government recognise this issue
and have made some movement on the safeguards contained in the
order-making powers in clauses 42 and 43. However, we have pressed them
for more movement, but we are seeing none on clause 65, which
undermines the certainty that the capital markets require. Clearly,
anything that we can do to try to address that has to be of benefit. It
is a practical issue, and the Government do not appear to be moving.
Depending on what the Minister says, we will be inclined to press some
of our amendments. Unless there is movement, the uncertainty will only 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>increase. I am afraid that clause 65 is already having a damaging impact
on the competitiveness of the UK capital
markets.</div><a name="08111388000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000263"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I do not want to repeat what the hon. Gentleman
said, but I wish to be associated entirely with his comments on the
clause. He and his colleagues probably went through the same exercise
as we did in attempting to make the clause acceptable by dispelling
some of the obvious problems that it causes owing to lack of
confidence. The amendment is similar to others that we have tabled, in
the sense that we have tried to create some hurdles so as to get an
idea of when those powers will be used. The amendment, as drafted, is
an excellent attempt to do that, and if the hon. Gentleman presses it I
will certainly support
him.</div><a name="08111388000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members will know, we tabled an amendment to delete the entire
clause, because I find the first few words wholly
unacceptable:</div><a name="08111388000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may by order amend the
law&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury might well be the fount of all knowledge and wisdom, although
that has perhaps not been so clearly displayed in recent times, but
frankly it is not here to amend the law&#151;we are. I am in
principle against that and so will vote against the clause en bloc if
given the opportunity to do so on stand
part.</div><a name="08111388000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that to a certain extent the clause is written in what we
might call a wartime situation. These are extremely uncertain and
difficult moments, and almost daily we are regaled with even more
horrors of the impending doom and gloom of the next year or two. The
banking industry is still in a state of flux, and I accept that we do
not know that things will settle down to such an extent that those
powers will not have to be used. However, the Bill and those powers are
intended to be enduring, so it is intended to address not only wartime
situations, but peacetime situations. In a future peacetime situation,
such a provision will be wholly unacceptable and have enormous
unintended consequences in the capital markets.</div>
<a name="08111388000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
minimum, we should be looking for such provisions to endure for a
limited period, and a two or three-year sunset clause would at least
give us the opportunity to review how those powers have operated, and
to look, hopefully in a more measured way, at the financial landscape
at the time to see whether those rather draconian powers continue to be
necessary. I accept that there has been a valiant attempt to establish
a clearer sense of when those powers will be used, but as it stands I
still find the concept of the Treasury amending the law by order
unacceptable, so I will support the amendment if it is pressed and vote
for the removal of the clause on stand
part.</div><a name="08111388000220"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000264"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I shall be brief. Aside from some of the
specifics, there is an important general point to be made. As the scale
and nature of the crisis has unfolded over the past year, one of the
things that we have seen is how very fast-moving and innovative the
industry is. The legislation attempts to give a statutory framework for
dealing with the problems in an orderly way, but there might be a
slight culture clash with a fast-moving and innovative industry
because, despite the best will in the world, drawing up legislation is
by nature a slow and cumbersome process. Unless we have such a
provision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>to enable the Treasury to adapt to changing and perhaps unforeseen
circumstances, we will be passing legislation that might be fit for
purpose for the last crisis but which will not enable the Treasury to
deal with the next one. Although I have many reservations about
governmental order-making powers, I think that something of that kind
is needed in the circumstances.</div>
<a name="08111388000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 119
would add to subsection (1) the
words</div><a name="08111388000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
the Treasury is satisfied that not to do so threatens the stability of,
or confidence in, the UK financial
system&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the subsection already includes that proviso, because it refers back to
the special resolution objectives set out in clause 4(4) to clause
4(8), which we have already discussed at some length, and agreed on.
They cover exactly the kind of points that, I think, the hon. Member
for South-West Hertfordshire intends amendment No. 119 to
cover.</div>
<a name="08111388000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a restriction on the powers. There are not unfettered powers for anyone
in the Treasury to do whatever they feel like. There is a discussion of
the general purpose of the exercise of the powers, and which powers can
be used. Of course there will always be a need for close scrutiny, and
perhaps a suspicion that the Government are using powers to do what
they want, without having thought things through clearly in the
legislation. However, the clause starts with the general objective,
which is more or less what the hon. Gentleman has set out in his
amendment, then it defines the powers that can be used and the general
purposes. It narrows things down to provide the democratic and
parliamentary scrutiny, then it narrows them down further to set out
some of the process that should be
used.</div><a name="08111388000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue that must, of course, be dealt with is that the industry will
say, &#147;This creates uncertainty. We need more reassurances that
the powers will not be used perversely.&#148; Governments are not
supposed to do that anyway. That applies to any order-making powers,
and there are legal processes for challenging perverse decisions.
However, it may be helpful if my hon. Friend the Minister can further
explain the thinking about the circumstances that are relevant, or the
assurances that the industry might need to make it clear that the
powers, which are necessary, would be used only in realistic
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08111388000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a general
point, it was appalling that hon. Members were in recess and nothing
could happen while economic circumstances changed, and that events that
would most affect our constituents unfolded while we were not here. We
could not engage in any scrutiny. Also, we knew that if anything were
to be done, it would need primary legislation. We all know how
cumbersome that is. I welcome the fact that the Government would have a
range of powers at their disposal. We have had the chance to discuss
that, and there is provision for accountability to Parliament, and for
proper scrutiny. Such powers are never particularly welcome, but the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments are covered, and his concerns dealt
with, and what remains is for my hon. Friend to give the industry some
assurances about some of the
circumstances.</div><a name="08111388000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000265"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> I hope,
indeed, to give assurances to the industry and to others who follow
such matters closely, and to clarify the situation for hon.
Members.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div><a name="08111388000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want first to explain why clause 65 is needed, and then I shall discuss
the amendments. Banks often comprise complex, multi-jurisdictional
corporate entities. As financial markets continue to develop, the trend
is set to increase. Furthermore, many of the provisions of the special
resolution regime interact and sit alongside complex financial
services, banking, company and insolvency law. The special resolution
regime, which, I remind members of the Committee, is a new legislative
device, provides the authorities with powers to act with respect to
failing banks.</div>
<a name="08111388000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are not
banks that are functioning successfully and in normal conditions. They
are banks that are sufficiently failing to meet the general conditions
for intervention and which it is in the public interest to resolve. It
is inevitable that there will be conflicts between the public interest
objectives and resolving a bank in severe financial distress. Moreover,
the provisions of legislation are designed to work in relation to a
normally functioning business.</div>
<a name="08111388000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
absence of a power to amend legislation, as set out in clause 65, there
is a material risk that the authorities may not be able to fully effect
a transfer, which could impact on the effectiveness of the powers taken
in the Bill. That could have adverse implications for financial
stability or public funds, which would not be in the public
interest.</div><a name="08111388000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the power is to provide the Treasury with the means to
modify legislation to enable the powers of the SRR to be used more
effectively. That is set out in subsection (1). However, it is not a
general power to amend legislation; it is targeted and limited. In
particular, the power may be used only to facilitate the use of one of
the stabilisation options. Therefore, the scope of the power is
severely constrained to amending legislation, which affects the
resolution of banks under the SRR.</div>
<a name="08111388000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In broad
terms, there are two ways in which this power can be used. The first
way would be for the Treasury to make a specific amendment to a piece
of legislation for the purposes of making effective the resolution of a
specific bank. The amendment would apply only to the specific bank. It
would be localised to the particular resolution. It would not apply to
any other bank, or any other banks in respect of which the powers of
the special resolution regime were
used.</div><a name="08111388000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second way would be for the Treasury to make an amendment to
legislation that applied to all resolutions or a class of resolutions
carried out under the SRR. For example, the power could be used to
disapply a particular provision of the Companies Acts in relation to
bridge banks. That would then apply in each resolution in which the
Bank of England used the bridge bank tool. It will not apply to other
banks.</div><a name="08111388000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is envisaged that that form of modification will be made in the light
of resolution experience. For example, it might become clear that a
certain provision of legislation is an impediment to resolution in
general, and so it is beneficial to disapply it for all subsequent
resolutions. The ability to make such amendments limits the need for
resolution-specific amendments, and ensures that the tools of the
special resolution regime may be future-proofed as the financial
markets and banks develop over time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div><a name="08111388000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regardless of
how the power is used, the modification may apply only to a bank
subject to the stabilisation option. Modifications do not apply to any
other bank. So, for example, the power could not be used to take action
with respect to banks participating in any aspect of the
recapitalisation process. As no stabilisation power has been used or is
proposed to be used on those banks, clause 65 is not
applicable.</div><a name="08111388000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny of the use of
the power, which is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
However, in situations of urgency, the Treasury may make the order
subject to the 28-day procedure. That is because there may be
circumstances in which a transfer needs to be made at extremely short
notice, and it is necessary to modify aspects of legislation to make it
effective. Any prior requirement for each House to approve a draft
order in such circumstances before it may come into force would cause
delay, during which time the Treasury would be unable to take the
necessary steps to address the failing bank. That could potentially
lead to severe disruption in the financial markets, place public funds
at unacceptable risk, and exacerbate financial
instability.</div><a name="08111388000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000266"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Can my hon. Friend confirm that if the power goes
through the affirmative procedure, because of the way in which the days
are counted and our recesses fall, it could take some months to get an
order through? That would be completely counter-productive in light of
the speed needed for many of these
processes.</div><a name="08111388000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000267"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised it in relation to amendment
No. 121. He suggested that the 28-day clock would start ticking only
when Parliament returns after the recess. That is not the case.
Parliament can call a debate immediately after the recess, or a
decision could be taken to recall
Parliament.</div>
<a name="08111388000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000268"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I take the point that the debate could happen
straight after the recess&#151;as the Minister said, there is a
28-day clock&#151;but the measure ignores</div>
<a name="08111388000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;periods of
dissolution, prorogation or adjournment of either House for more than 4
days&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would ignore the recess. The 28-day limit imposed by subsection (9)
runs only when the House is sitting, does it
not?</div><a name="08111388000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000269"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That could be the case, but it is equally true
that the clock does not have to start ticking then, and the debate does
not have to be within 28 days. My understanding is that it is perfectly
possible for Parliament to debate it immediately after a recess, and I
think that that is what would happen in normal
circumstances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000270"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is not what the clause
says.</div>
<a name="08111388000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000271"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b><b class="B"> </b>If I may move on, hon. Members may be
aware that it is not unprecedented for such powers to be taken to
ensure that Bills are fully effective, especially where an entirely new
regime is introduced in an area already populated by a complex and
interrelated body of primary and secondary legislation and common
law.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div><a name="08111388000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 provides the
Secretary of State with a power to make further provision to give full
effect to the Act. That power may be used to amend, revoke or otherwise
modify enactments. Another example is section 148 of the Criminal
Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which includes a power to make
consequential amendments to legislation, including primary legislation,
to ensure that the Act is fully
effective.</div><a name="08111388000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have informed the Committee of the general circumstances in which the
power might be used, but it might help if I provided some specific
examples. Of course, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list,
because it is not possible to foresee every circumstance surrounding
the failure of any particular bank or which pieces of legislation might
be relevant to the resolution. If that were possible, there would be no
grounds for taking the power, as we could just put all the relevant
changes into the Bill. The following examples are intended to give a
flavour of how the Treasury might use the
power.</div><a name="08111388000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppose
the business of a failing deposit taker is transferred to a private
sector purchaser. In some circumstances, it would be appropriate to
modify the provisions of part 16 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000, which deals with the financial ombudsman scheme, to ensure
that consumers could make complaints to the scheme relating to the
failing bank and obtain a remedy from the private sector
purchaser.</div><a name="08111388000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example is that it might be necessary to disapply section 169 of the
Companies Act 2006, which provides company directors with the right to
protest against their removal, with respect to a bank entering the
special resolution regime. Although clause 19 provides a power to
remove directors, the power under clause 65 could be used to remove a
director&#146;s right to protest against that
removal.</div><a name="08111388000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111388000272"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): That is an
extraordinary change in the law that is not mentioned anywhere in the
Bill. If that is the Government&#146;s intention, why on earth is it
not in the
Bill?</div><a name="08111388000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000273"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The power to remove directors is certainly in the
Bill. In such extreme circumstances, we believe that that is absolutely
right and appropriate, and we have debated
it.</div><a name="08111388000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111388000274"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): The Minister said in his
remarks that the Government were looking for the power to remove
directors&#146; right to protest their removal. If he believes that
it is important for the Government to deny directors that right, why is
it not in clause 19? When we debated the removal of directors under
clause 19 in the context of renegotiating their remuneration, he made
it clear that directors would retain their normal legal rights in those
circumstances.</div><a name="08111388000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000275"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I remember talking about directors maintaining
their legal rights, and I will undertake to discuss with officials
whether that should be put in
legislation.</div><a name="08111388000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further example relates to shadow directorship. It may be necessary in
certain circumstances for the Bank of England or the Treasury to give
directions to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>board to ensure that the public interest objectives of the resolution
are met. That applies in particular to the initial stages of the
resolution, when stabilising banking business is paramount and public
funds might be at greatest risk. In some circumstances, therefore, it
might be appropriate to disapply various provisions of the Companies
Acts in relation to the authorities&#146; conduct during the
resolution, such as shadow
directorship.</div><a name="08111388000221"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000277"></a>Ian

some real-life examples of shadow

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000278"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000280"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My recollection is that provisions are in place
already, in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, to
ensure that the Treasury and the Bank of England do not act as shadow
directors. If the Minister&#146;s concern is genuine, why not
replicate that Act&#146;s provisions in the
Bill?</div><a name="08111388000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000281"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> That is probably why I should not have given
way&#151;I was going to explain some of that. Hon. Members might be
interested to hear that powers to modify legislation were used in many
of the recent resolutions under powers provided by the Banking (Special
Provisions) Act. For the transfers of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp;
Bingley to the Treasury, the shadow directorship provisions of the
Companies Acts were disapplied. For the Bradford &amp; Bingley onward
transfer, merger law was disapplied, and for the transfer of the
Kaupthing accounts, the powers were used to modify insolvency law to
create a simplified version of the bank administration
procedure.</div><a name="08111388000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stakeholders
have made representations arguing that the power undermines the
safeguards that we are putting in place for partial
transfers.</div>
<a name="08111388000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000282"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Will my hon. Friend give
way?</div><a name="08111388000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000283"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me make this crucial point
first.</div><a name="08111388000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power will not be used by the Treasury or others to modify provisions
or safeguards in the Bill. That would not be appropriate, and the
Government have no intention of using the power in that
way.</div><a name="08111388000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000284"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I can see why my hon. Friend hesitated to give way.
He makes a persuasive case for the principle of providing for
substantial flexibility in the Bill in order to respond to unforeseen
events. However, he was not so persuasive on the wording of the clause.
Although I shall vote for the clause, if necessary, because I agree
with it in principle, we have an opportunity, based on the important
qualifications he made in his speech, to sharpen the wording to
reassure those concerned about parliamentary accountability and those
in the industry about the security of some of the decisions that they
might
make.</div><a name="08111388000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000285"></a>Ian

contribution.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div><a name="08111388000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
about the position of directors, Members will be aware that clause 19
provides powers to vary service contracts or to remove directors.
Clause 65 enables consequential changes to be made to facilitate the
resolution. I hope that makes the matter clear but, as I have said, I
shall talk further with officials about that matter.</div>
<a name="08111388000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
about 28 sitting days, nothing prevents Parliament from holding a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000287"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall now address the amendments, on which I
hope that I can reassure the Committee. The issues raised have been
dealt with appropriately already in the Bill, but I want to make clear
why I do not believe that we should amend the provisions in the manner
proposed.</div>
<a name="08111388000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire proposes, through amendments Nos.
119 and 120, that an additional test be required before the power may
be exercised&#151;that there must be a threat to the</div>
<a name="08111388000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;stability of,
or confidence in, the UK financial
system&#148;.</div><a name="08111388000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that the initial transfer will have met the
general and specific conditions for action as provided by clauses 7, 8
and 9. Those are high hurdles. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, North pointed out they have to be within the terms of the
objectives in clause 4. The fact that the conditions are met for the
initial intervention gives the authorities warrant to take the
necessary steps to resolve the bank. Given those points, I believe the
amendments are unnecessary and, indeed, otiose, as the matter is
already covered as part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08111388000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 121, 156 and 157 relate to the procedural provisions of the
clause. Amendment No. 157 proposes that the powers provided
by the clause may not be used to amend the procedure for making an
order under the clause. As I have already said, it is not the
Government&#146;s intention to amend the provisions of the Banking
Bill using that power. It would not be appropriate, nor would the power
be construed to have that effect. In particular, secondary legislation
cannot be exercised to expand the scope of its enabling powers, and so
lift itself up by its bootstraps. I hope I have provided reassurance to
Members that this amendment is unnecessary too, as the power cannot be
used in the manner about which they are
concerned.</div><a name="08111388000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 156 suggests that if an order should lapse, the provisions of the
order should be invalidated. The amendment removes a standard provision
that provides that things done under orders not later affirmed by
parliamentary resolution remain valid. The amendment would introduce a
high element of risk to using the power. That particularly applies if
an order was made under the clause in relation to a transfer of
property or securities to a private sector purchaser. In such a
situation, a potential acquirer would in all likelihood not be willing
to take part in the transaction, given the risk that provisions of the
order&#151;which could, for example, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>grant them certain protections&#151;might not stand. Therefore, I
cannot accept the amendment. The hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire has been stressing the importance of legal certainty but
the amendment would introduce a lot of uncertainty in the process, so I
hope he will consider withdrawing
it.</div><a name="08111388000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 121 makes a technical change to the nature of the 28-day procedure.

No. 155 proposes that the order made under clause 65 may not take
retrospective effect. Although the Government recognise that this is a
broad power, we consider it an important part of the clause.
Retrospective provision may be required in circumstances where a
transfer has occurred with particular swiftness, which, as recent
events have shown, is perfectly possible. Given the incredibly complex
affairs of banks, it may not be possible to identify each and every
precise statutory barrier in any given circumstance before making a
transfer. For example, if it were necessary to amend a statutory
provision that threatened to impede a property transfer, an
unacceptable level of legal uncertainty would be likely to arise if the
change did not have effect simultaneously with the property transfer.
In a fast-burn situation, the due diligence to identify the impediment
may not be completed until after the transfer has taken place. For
those reasons, it is considered necessary to make retrospective
provision from the date of the transfer. I hope my explanations have
provided Members with sufficient assurances as to why clause 65 is
necessary and should not be amended in the ways they propose.</div>
<a name="08111388000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
other points I should like to make. The first is to stress that the
Treasury can only amend the law through a statutory instrument that can
be struck down by Parliament. Therefore, it is only with
Parliament&#146;s agreement that we can exercise this power. The
Treasury may only amend the law in circumstances when the special
resolution regime powers need to be used more effectively&#151;to
stress again the limited nature of the use of the
power.</div><a name="08111388000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
reflected on the debate, I want there to be certainty, and for banks to
obtain unqualified legal opinions from advisers on their legal rights
under contracts across the piece, as the British Bankers Association
said in its submission. We are consulting on the partial transfer
safeguards, and I hope that my explanations today on the limited nature
of clause 65 will be helpful in making clear to the Committee how the
clause might be applied. I will, however, ask the expert liaison group
whether any changes could be made to this needed clause, to strengthen
legal certainty, and if judged necessary I will bring forward
amendments on
Report.</div><a name="08111388000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000288"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> First, I address the comments made by the hon.
Member for Northampton, North on the test in subsection (1). The
Minister also touched on the matter. Both he and the hon. Lady referred
to clause 4&#151;the special resolution objectives. My
concern has not been assuaged; the current wording does not address it
and therefore my amendment is not otiose. The test for a change to the
law is merely that there is regard to the special resolution
objectives. I accept that the various tests in clause 4 and elsewhere
need to apply to the use 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>of the stabilisation powers, but those tests are not the same as that
which applies to whether there is a change in the law under clause 65.
The test there is much weaker:</div>
<a name="08111388000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having regard
to the special resolution objectives&#148;.</div>
<a name="08111388000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that narrows
the scope of the test if it has to apply to the use of stabilisation
powers, and that the safeguard is also in subsection (2). The Minister
elaborated on that, and I accept that it is somewhat helpful. However,
it is nothing like as strong a test as that which we propose in
amendment No. 119, or for that matter amendment No. 120. That test is
specifically to focus on systemic risk, which is the most important
objective. The change in the law has to meet that test. I am therefore
not persuaded by the Government&#146;s
arguments.</div><a name="08111388000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northampton, North pointed out that primary legislation
is cumbersome. It is, up to a point, but let us not forget that we put
the Banking (Special Provisions) Act through both Houses in two days.
Primary legislation can move more rapidly when it needs
to.</div><a name="08111388000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now turn to the Minister&#146;s comments. His examples were not
persuasive for two reasons. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Fareham pointed out, if the Minister has specific examples in mind, why
are they not in the Bill? The Minister may say that they are not
exhaustive, but even if they are not, and even if the Minister is
convinced that clause 65 has to remain in the Bill&#151;although we
are not persuaded that it should&#151;if there are areas where the
Government think they will need flexibility, let us debate them now,
and make provision in the Bill. The Minister&#146;s examples were not
particularly helpful to his
case.</div><a name="08111388000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason why the Minister&#146;s examples were not helpful is
that they highlighted the significant matters that we could be talking
about. If we are talking about the withdrawal of the usual protections
available to directors&#146; employment rights, that matter, or at
least the framework for it, is sufficiently serious to be dealt with in
primary legislation. I do not think that I was present for the
Committee&#146;s debate on directors&#146; employment, but if the
Minister was arguing that those protections will still exist&#151;the
point alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham&#151;yet at
a subsequent stage of proceedings he was arguing that the Government
are retaining the flexibility to remove those protections by order, it
seems quite a serious
point.</div><a name="08111388000222"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000289"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My recollection was that the Minister also argued
that if we did not do that, the European convention on human rights and
the rights of the directors under contract law would be infringed. I
agreed with the Minister then and did not press the point, but the
Government now appear to have a hidden
agenda.</div><a name="08111388000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000290"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that
point. Are we to end up with a situation where the only protection
available for directors is the ECHR or will there be a place for
Parliament to debate those matters
too?</div><a name="08111388000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000291"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I must admit that I did not interpret the
Minister&#146;s remarks as meaning that contract law would be set
aside by the executive action of the Bank. I, too, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>would be alarmed if it was suggested that the normal protections offered
by a contract should be dispensed with at the fiat of government. I
particularly welcomed the Minister&#146;s suggestion that the clause
required further scrutiny by those who wished to provide greater
certainty in the matter. I am not persuaded by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument that we should dispense with the clause and
its principles in its entirety. The Minister made a persuasive case
that there were areas of doubt and uncertainty to which we might need
to respond, and that it would be more efficient to do so in that way.
However, I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point on the narrow
issue.</div>
<a name="08111388000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000292"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> On the narrow issue, perhaps we will all need to
reread precisely what the Minister said.</div>
<a name="08111388000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000293"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I hope
not.</div><a name="08111388000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000294"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Indeed. Let us put it this way: there is no reason,
as far as I can see, why clause 65 could not be used to dispense with
those contractual rights. The Minister&#146;s remarks merely
highlight why we are concerned about the clause. The hon. Member for
South Derbyshire is clearly uncomfortable with the way in which the
clause could be used. We will read <i class="I">Hansard </i>to see whether the
Minister said that it is one possibility that the Government are
already considering<i class="I">.</i></div>
<a name="08111388000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000295"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman talked about clause
4. Could he comment on the substantial protections provided under
clauses 7, 8 and 9 in terms of the exercise of powers? There are the
objectives, the exercise of powers and the further assurances that my
hon. Friend the Minister gave about going back and looking at some
important qualifications. That would seem to provide the assurances
that are needed. He also said that he will come back with amendments at
a later stage, which would seem to deal with the one area of doubt
that was left.</div>
<a name="08111388000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000296"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point about
clauses 7, 8 and 9, but this is overall a Bill that retains
a reasonable degree of flexibility for the Government. My point is that
regardless of clauses 7, 8 or 9, the test as to whether the law can be
changed is still a very weak one. That is the objection to subsection
(1).</div>
<a name="08111388000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
Minister&#146;s statement that the clause will not be used to amend
the Bill and so I certainly will not press for a Division on amendment
No. 157 because it does not go nearly far enough. Given that statement,
however, why cannot we see that carve-out in the Bill? I hope that the
Minister will consider tabling an amendment to that effect. If he does
not, I suspect that we might, because it is an important
point.</div>
<a name="08111388000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment No. 121 and the ticking clock, I am touched by the
Minister&#146;s faith in business managers&#146; ability to ensure
that controversial matters are debated and voted on as promptly and
prominently as possible. I take his point that such debate need not
always happen at the end of the 28 days, but the fact is that that is
what the legislation says. It could happen so it is a weak argument to
say, &#147;Well, maybe it won&#146;t.&#148; It does not say it
must happen 28 days after the order has been made; it says up to 28
days. For those reasons, I am inclined to press amendment No. 121 to a
vote.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div><a name="08111388000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
remarks, to which the hon. Member for South Derbyshire alluded, about
the fact that the expert liaison group will be consulted and so on, but
overall I did not feel that much comfort was provided to outside bodies
or that the issue of uncertainty was addressed. It remains a concern.
If one speaks to any lawyer or outside body in the field, they are
worried about the breadth of the provisions. That is why we have
attempted to amend the clause to narrow it down. Even those who, like
the hon. Member for South Derbyshire, are persuaded that clause 65 is
necessary might agree that we can at least try to restrict it to
provide a little more comfort.</div>
<a name="08111388000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, I intend to press amendments Nos. 119, 155, 120 and
121 to a Division. Members on the Conservative Benches remain deeply
concerned about clause 65, and we will be voting against it at stand
part.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000327"></a>Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000328"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000329"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This is a technical amendment. The group
comprises one new clause and several consequential amendments to
clauses 65, 109, 122, 143 and 154. The technical amendments extend the
meaning of &#147;enactment&#148;, where referred to in the Bill, to
include Acts of the Scottish Parliament and instruments made under
them, Northern Ireland legislation and subordinate legislation. Without
express provision for the inclusion of Acts of the Scottish Parliament
or instruments made under those Acts, any reference to an enactment in
the Bill would not include them, which would restrict the effect of the
legislative provisions of the Bill in Scotland and could limit the
authorities&#146; ability to deal with Scottish
banks.</div><a name="08111388000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses
65, 109, 122, 143 and 154, as drafted, contain wording to extend the
meaning of &#147;enactment&#148; for those specific clauses.
However, new clause 5 will apply to the entire Bill, so the various
subsections defining a reference to an enactment will be redundant.
Therefore, amendments Nos. 12 to 16 make consequential amendments to
remove those references. The amendments are straightforwardly technical
and I commend them to the
Committee.</div><a name="08111388000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000330"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I have a quick question for the Minister.
Obviously, in general terms, it is unsatisfactory for the UK Government
to be able, almost by fiat, to overturn or change the decisions taken
in another legislature. However, in the emergency situations of a
failing bank and for the delivery of the special regime for a failing
bank, particularly in a short period, it is probably important. I am
conscious, having taken advice, that there is no particular opposition
in principle, so long as the Minister can confirm that any primary or
secondary legislation in Scotland that would be changed would be solely
for the purposes of, or in consequence of, the Bill and in
the delivery of the special regime for a failed bank. If I
can have that guarantee, I would have no difficulties at all with the
new clause and the
amendments.</div><a name="08111388000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000346"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have a quick question about clause
66(1), which
states:</div><a name="08111388000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank of England may not exercise a stabilisation power in respect of a
bank if the Treasury notify the Bank that the exercise would be likely
to contravene an international obligation of the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="08111388000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Minister explained the purpose of the
subsection. What interests me is that it is perfectly possible that the
Bank of England and the Treasury will have conflicting views about
international obligations. Indeed, there may be evidence to suggest
that such a tension existed over actions taken with regard to Northern
Rock last year. I put this question to the Bank of England at an
earlier stage of proceedings in Committee&#151;does the Treasury
anticipate that it will make decisions about international obligations?
Will it be possible for the Bank of England to take a view not to
exercise a stabilisation power because it believes that to do so would
contravene an international obligation, even though the Treasury does
not hold that view? In other words, will the test of international
obligations be assessed by the Treasury alone, and if the Treasury is
satisfied, the Bank may exercise its stabilisation powers? Or will both
the Bank and the Treasury take a view, and if either institution is of
the view that international obligations will preclude the use of
stabilisation powers, will those powers not be
used?</div><a name="08111388000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000347"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> On a number of occasions, we have discussed the
right balance of responsibilities between the authorities: the Bank of
England, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority. That
division of responsibilities has been supported by stakeholders. The
authorities have worked and will continue to work closely together in
all those circumstances. We believe that Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury
should have the leading role when it comes to international
obligations. The role of each authority in the SRR is clear: the FSA
will assess whether a firm should enter the SRR, the Bank of England
will operate the SRR and the Treasury will deal with public finances
and the overall public interest and exercise the stabilisation option
to take a bank into temporary public ownership, taking into account
international obligations. One would expect Government to do that. That
is not to say that we will not have close dialogue with the Bank of
England on matters that relate to areas in which it has an interest,
but it is right and proper that the Treasury takes the lead in those
circumstances.</div><a name="08111388000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000348"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. I
do not disagree with him on whether the Treasury should take a leading
role. The question is whether it takes the sole role. I should like to
press him on this matter. Is the origin of the clause a degree of
tension that exists as a consequence of the Northern Rock issue and the
view that the Bank of England took 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 479</div>on the restrictions that applied to any covert action that it
could take? There is a feeling that it took a more
prescriptive view than was generally deemed 
necessary.</div><a name="08111388000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000349"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The origin of the clause lies in the consultation
and the fact that we think it a necessary part of the Bill. Of course,
the Treasury will talk to the Bank of England, and they will work
together on all these matters. It is entirely right and proper that
someone should lead and take final decisions. When it comes
to international obligations, that has to be the
Treasury.</div><a name="08111388000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000350"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> If the Bank of England took a different view and
said that international obligations prevented it from doing something
and the Treasury said that they did not, would the Treasury view
prevail?</div><a name="08111388000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000351"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want to get into hypothetical
circumstances, but let me make it clear that the Treasury has the lead
responsibility in this regard. It will be the Treasury&#146;s views
that count when considering what our international obligations are and
how they should be
interpreted.</div><a name="08111388000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Hoban:</b> I have a quick question for the Minister. In what
circumstances does he envisage introducing orders to apply the SRR to
credit
unions?</div><a name="08111388000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111388000353"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause creates a power to extend the SRR to
credit unions. We will keep the position under review, but we have no
immediate plans to extend stabilisation powers such as bridge bank,
temporary public ownership and private sector purchasing powers to
credit unions at this time. Credit unions have a relatively small
number of depositors, and their failure does not pose the same threat
to financial stability that the failure of banks and building societies
might. Moreover, credit unions are dealt with effectively under
existing insolvency procedures. However, it is important to keep the
matter under review. We have talked about future-proofing legislation,
and that is what this provision does.</div>
