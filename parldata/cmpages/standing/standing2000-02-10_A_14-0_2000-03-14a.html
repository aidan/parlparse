</P>


<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Although the clause prohibits the unlicensed distribution of electricity, its real purpose is to separate the licensing of electricity from the licensing of its distribution and supply. It does that by amending section 4 of the Electricity Act 1989, adding a fourth type of electricity industry licence—that of distribution—to the three sorts of licence for generation, transmission and supply. The clause redefines supply in a narrow sense, and defines distribution as solely the conveyance of electricity through low voltage lines. The Opposition supported that change on Second Reading, and we continue to support it. It is a tribute to the growth of competition in the supply of electricity since privatisation.

<P>
According to the Government's consultation document on the modification by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority of the standard conditions of gas and electricity licences, which was published last week, there are now 50 licensees supplying electricity, of which 27 supply designated customers—that is Office of Gas and Electricity Markets jargon for domestic customers. The number of suppliers is huge and, by any assessment, constitutes a competitive market, which is why Ofgem has implemented its final round of price caps. However, to remove the price cap from supply, it is necessary to separate supply from distribution, which is not subject to such competition. Distribution comprises the wires from the national grid to people's homes in the local network; it is, in effect, a natural monopoly. By separating it from the highly competitive supply of electricity, the price setting of electricity supply can ultimately be removed. I would argue also that most of the remaining regulatory framework could be removed—but that, alas, is not the Government's view.

<P>
It is interesting to look back. I managed to dig out a copy of a pamphlet written by a chap whose name has featured before in our debates—Dan Corry, who is now a special adviser to the Secretary of State. Mr. Corry wrote a pamphlet, ``Regulating in the Public Interest'', in 1994, in which he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At one level is the debate amongs the experts  on the minutiae of the regulation process—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
legal rulings and so on. He said that such debate tinkered with the regulation of the utilities. He then said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the other level are the general, swingeing statements, often associated with commentators of the Left, that privatisation and the regulation process has allowed thousands of fat-cat executives to clean up, for the customer to be ripped off by the privatised utility companies charging extortionate prices and that we need to boot out all the regulators and start all over again.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe might have said that. Mr. Corry said that his pamphlet
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>tries to escape from these two byways to take us back to the reasons that we have regulation in order to see whether this leads us towards a different vision for the way forward.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That pamphlet is a blueprint for the Bill. I suspect that when the Government came to office, Mr. Corry handed it to the civil servants and asked them to draft a Bill. Therein lies the problem.

<P>
The pamphlet is revealing. Mr. Corry says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is very important to reject this idea of competition as the only objective and vital to understand the significance of so doing for the future organisation of regulation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He dismisses the debate between left and right, arguing against the importance of competition. Revealingly, he goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Once we accept that regulation is here to stay, we are into the world of how we should use it. This is a classic issue of interventionism in the workings of the economy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The pamphlet illustrates the concept behind the Government's approach. They accept that regulators will be needed for some time in natural monopolies such as electricity distribution. Indeed, they accept that, if the utilities remain as natural monopolies, regulators will probablly be needed forever. Therefore, they want to use regulation to implement their broader agenda. The pamphlet reveals that the Bill is not about improving the energy sector or increasing competition in it, but about how the Government can use the regulatory mechanism to implement their social and environmental agenda. That approach will lead to higher costs for consumers, which is why the industry and other parties have difficulties with the Bill.

<P>
It is fascinating to consider how privatised electricity has reached its current state. Electricity is highly competitive: prices have decreased by 30 per cent. in real terms since privatisation, 27 firms are supplying domestic customers, there are 50 new independent power producers and the number of long-term one-year electricity contracts has fallen by a further 15 per cent. none of that would have happened if Labour Members' views had prevailed in 1988 and 1989, when the Bill that became the Electricity Act 1989 passed through the House.

<P>
 At that time, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), then shadow Secretary of State for Energy, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Outside the Conservative party ... it is barely an issue that prices will rise because of privatisation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would have thought that it was ... virtually impossible that anyone would build a power station and invest hundreds of 
<P>
millions of pounds, unless they received a guarantee covering the capital costs, the fuel cost and, probably ... the operating costs, too ... the idea that we will have an influx of power stations, all competing on the grid, is nonsense.—[Official Report, 12 December 1988; Vol. 143, c. 683-84.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
In fact, 27 new power stations have been built, and they produce 18,500 MW. Electricity prices have fallen and are set to fall further because of competition, competition, competition and not because of regulation or even the £500 million new trading arrangements, which we support, but which are not responsible for the reduction in prices. The merger of gas and electricity regulation is not responsible for the savings either. Competition is delivering them to consumers.

<P>
Privatisation of the utilities was a huge leap in the dark. We trusted out philosophy and believed that putting monolithic state industries into the private sector would make them a degree or two more efficient. We hugely underestimated how much more efficient they would become. When I visited a Kent power station recently, I was staggered to hear that it and a nearby power station used to emply 1,200 people. Now they employ 300 people but produce the same amount of power—privatisation achieved not a 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. improvement in efficiency, but a 300 per cent. improvement. Labour politicians denied that power stations could become more efficient and even Conservative Members did not anticipate that competition in generation and supply would reach its current level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully, but I found it rather more difficult to follow his mathematics. A reduction from 900 to 300 is a 66 per cent. decrease.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is probably right. We did not anticipate the current level of effiency, which explains my difficulties with the mathematics. Nobody—not the City, the Conservative party or even the Institute of Economic Affairs—anticipated the success achieved by the industry since privatisation.

<P>
The clause speaks volumes, as it separates the concept of public electricity supply into supply and distribution. It had been assumed that the regional electricity companies would always retain their regional monopolies. However, we were wrong. Supply, purchase and sale of electricity to consumers took off as a new business and rapidly became highly competitive as the laws were relaxed. Most of industry believes, as the Opposition certainly do, that the new, narrower natural monopoly—distribution—is likely ultimately to remain for the vast majority of consumers, but we should never underestimate the ingenuity of the private sector. Clause 35 provides for further alteration to the requirement by statutory instrument, as the scope for narrowing, refining and redefining the natural monopoly develops further.

<P>
We commend the Government for their decision to separate the licensing of supply and distribution. That is the ultimate accolade to the success of privatisation of the industry and, consequently, we shall not oppose it. However, we wish that the approach was taken elsewhere in the Bill. The over-regulatory and interventionist approach is potentially enormously damaging to the electricity industry. Mike Hughes, president of the Electricity Association, has warned that the Bill threatens the industry's long-term stability and will draw investment out of the sector. He said that the industry was concerned about the wide-ranging powers to be given to the regulator to change licence conditions and impose unlimited penalties, for example. He went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am concerned that all the forces in operation are very short term in their nature in an industry that needs long-term stability and considerable investment.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government have already withdrawn such clauses in respect of telecoms and water; I wish that they would do so for gas and electricity. Will the Minister inform the Committee of the outcome of the meeting on Thursday between the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe and the Electricity Association? Might interventionist and highly regulatory clauses be withdrawn?

<P>
We support the separation of distribution and supply for licensing powers and shall not oppose clause 25.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): On the granting of licences, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) rightly said that the Conservative party has accepted the good sense in separating questions of the wires that carry electricity from questions of distribution—for good legal reasons. However, by going down what seems a commonsense route, the introduction of a new class of licence might cause us problems.

<P>
As I understand it, the Government are saying that there is a monopoly of wires—just one wire goes into everybody's home—and that they therefore want to separate the wire from the distribution of electricity across it, even if the same set of shareholders own both. I am worried that that would automatically prevent a company building a housing estate from deciding to have a renewable energy system on site and to wire the system up themselves, possibly with separate wires for a mains supply from an electricity company, for example. Would the company be required to have a licence? It would be one thing if it were possible to ring somebody up and say that, having read all the rules, one was about to build such a system and would like a licence by return of post, even if it had to be paid for. However, the big problem that we find whenever we consider licences is the time that bureaucrats take to grant a licence.

<P>
I lectured a little in the former Soviet Union, where, although people are attempting to run a democratic market economy, they will not leave licences alone. It is impossible to do anything—start a business, open a kiosk—without obtaining licences from bureaucrats. Doing so is another way of bribing bureaucrats and ensuring that there is food on the table. That does not happen in the United Kingdom, but the time that it takes to get permission to do something can often strangle enterprise. It always worries me that a new class of licence might be a new form of strangulation for a future enterprise.
<P>

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
Let me give a simple example. When I started to run an employment agency, there was no requirement for a licence. I was redundant and it was hard to get everything together to open the business quickly, but licensing was not an issue. When the requirement was introduced a few years later, I applied for my licence, but it took the bureaucrats about six months to deliver it. The delay was in getting the local authority to provide copies of the planning permission for my office, which was in an office block in the middle of a town.

<P>
Paying the yearly licence fee led to an interesting discovery. When another redundant person decided to start an employment agency, which happened about once a year, he would place newspaper advertisements asking candidates to apply, and look into taking on premises. All that I needed to do was ring the local employment department and say, ``There's a company starting an employment agency. Is it licensed?'', for the nice bureaucrat to visit it and stop it operating for the next six months. That is an example of using new licensing facilities in restraint of trade.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is making excellent points. Do they not show the danger of piling on to licence conditions the paraphernalia of delivering the Government's programme? They tried to do that with the working families tax credit by using the pay-as-you-earn code to deliver benefits to employees. It is dangerous to use mechanisms that were devised for other purposes, such as income tax or to ensure that a business is fit and safe to trade, because that can clog up our entrepreneurial spirit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend made his point clearly, but I may get into trouble if I expand on it.

<P>
The Government want to require an organisation to have a licence. An enterprise would have to tell the authority, ``Here I am. I'm over here and I'm doing this.'' A simple letter to the regulator should be enough for the regulator to say, ``That's fine. I've ticked the box. Here's your bit of paper by return of post.'' Perhaps we could allow a week for that—certainly not the 20 days that the Government give themselves to reply to a written answer or the 430 days that I have been waiting for a reply from the Ministry of Defence. The regulator should be able to give a reply by return of post. That would make me less unhappy about the new class of licence.

<P>
My amendments to clause 26 are a direct attempt to reduce the time that regulations and similar instruments take to apply. I am worried that the Government have not thought through their actions. Before people start enterprises, they might be told by their lawyers, ``Hang on a minute. To do that you must have a licence from the regulatory authority.'' We need to know that the Government have considered the matter and that the process of gaining a licence will be rapid.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I do not know about regulation taking time, but if the Opposition continue to take this much time discussing a clause that they support, we shall not get very far today. The image of a licensee being strangled by bureaucracy is an interesting one, but hard to picture; a brave new company could be smothered by a licence, I suppose. Perhaps it is still very early in the morning for the hon. Member for South Dorset.

<P>
Two questions were raised. First, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked how the meeting had gone between by right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe and the Electricity Association. I was not present at the meeting, but I believe that the Electricity Association described it as ``useful and constructive''; that is original. In its press release of 10 March, it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We welcome the Government's offer to discuss specific issues in more detail, while ensuring the legislative timetable remains on course. We want to help deliver a workable piece of legislation that will ultimately enable all our customers to benefit.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is about as constructive as it gets; enough has been said on that.

<P>
Secondly, we were also asked about wires already owned by developers. It is not necessarily true that such wires will have to be licensed. The test will be the extent to which the owner of the wires is prepared to allow those at the end of them to receive the benefits of competition. We envisage that many such systems will benefit from exemptions, as we said in the consultation document, which, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows, we published on Friday.

<P>
The separation of the activities of supply and distribution of electricity is a central feature of the Bill's reform of energy regulation. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton stated, the clause amends section 4 of the Electricity Act 1989, paving the way for that separation. I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I take issue with the Minister over his complaint about a 20-year minute debate on an important clause. It is the role of the Opposition to explain their position regardless of whether they support or oppose a clause. I would like to hear further details of the meeting with the Electricity Association, if and when they become available. The phrase ``useful and constructive'' hides a multitude of sins. From my understanding of the industry's concerns, it is not as positive towards the Bill as the Minister suggests. There are huge concerns about the Bill's over-regulatory and interventionist nature, albeit that the industry wants the new electricity trading arrangements on the statute book as soon as possible. I have already told the Minister that we will work with him to rush through the clause—if only they will withdraw the remainder of the Bill. Having said that, we shall be constructive in opposition and try to ensure that, regardless of our concerns, the Bill meets its timetable.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemptions from electricity licensing</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 522, in page 21, line 9, leave out ``Secretary of State'' and insert ``Authority''

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 523, in page 21, line 10, leave out ``Authority'' and insert ``Secretary of State''

<P>
No. 535, in page 21, line 21, leave out ``Secretary of State'' and insert ``Authority''

No. 545, in page 22, line 39, leave out ``Secretary of State'' and insert ``Authority''

<P>
No. 546, in page 22, line 45, leave out ``Secretary of State'' and insert ``Authority''

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The list of amendments is long, but it is a simple change that I suggest to clause 26. At the moment, the clause refers to the Secretary of State making exemptions following consultation with the regulatory authority. The amendment would change that around; it would give the regulatory authority the power to decide on exemptions and consult with the Secretary of State.

<P>
It seems strange that electricity companies will have a working relationship—I hope a good working relationship—with the authority. I am concerned that there will be delays in granting licences or exemptions from licences because someone who wants to sort out an issue will have to go to the DTI, and that the DTI will then have to tell the Secretary of State, who will then have to consult the authority. The amendments are wholly in line with many DTI policies. On several occasions, the Secretary of State has said at the Dispatch Box that he is stepping back from the role of regulator and leaving the independent regulator to decide how things should be done. However, perhaps it is necessary for the authority to consult the Secretary of State because that will link its decisions to parliamentary accountability.

<P>
For the most part, I should have thought that, when the authority says, ``We have conducted all the negotiations with this organisation and this is what we intend to do'', the civil servants at the DTI and the Secretary of State would be able to say, ``That is fine. We have no concerns about that.'' I imagine that, shortly after the Bill becomes an Act, the Secretary of State will agree the way in which such provisions should operate. It is not good sense to assume that, every time someone wants to obtain an exemption from a licence, they must first go to the DTI. The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority should deal with the issues, and the Secretary of State and officials at the DTI, who are busy people, should be left out of the loop.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Government will resist the amendments, which would remove the Secretary of State's power to grant, revoke or withdraw exemptions and transfer that power to the authority. I have considerable sympathy with the wish of the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) to cut bureaucratic delays, but I hope that they will not occur.

<P>
Clause 27 will remove the Secretary of State's power to grant electricity licences and provides for the authority to do so, which will bring electricity into line with gas in that respect. That move is also consistent with the principle of arm's length economic regulation. In addition, licensing has been, and will remian, the main instrument for regulating the bulk of electricity generation, supply, distribution and transmission. However, different considerations apply to the power to grant exemptions, which are a derogation from the requirement to hold a licence. They are a benefit and privilege mostly conferred on smaller operators who nevertheless serve many thousands of customers, some of whom include the less well off and other vulnerable groups, for example, those in blocks of flats.

<P>
In effect, the decision relates to the coverage of the Bill. although it will be possible to impose conditions on exempt persons, it is expected that the conditions will be much more limited than those imposed on licence holders. It is right that decisions about the scope of the regulatory regime should rest with Ministers, not with the authority, We recognise that the authority, industry and the public have an important contribution to make. We are currently consulting widely on the development of the exemptions regime. The authority has an important role to play in decision making and, as clause 26 provides, the Secretary of State must act in consultation with the authority. However, decisions about the limits of the exemptions regime involve matters of policy and have wider implications. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I follow what the Minister says and am partially persuaded. Will the exemptions relate to classes of people or will individual companies have to go to the DTI and say, ``Please may I be exempted, Secretary of State?''?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Both will go the DTI in some shape or form. The great majority will not need exemptions nor to make applications afresh. That is partly why we are consulting. The truth is that we do not know what is expected, and we certainly need to find out as quickly as possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> In the spirit of the Minister's response, I shall certainly withdraw the amendment. I am glad to hear that he is still consulting, because it seems strange that the Department of Trade and Industry should be dealing with licences if it has to consult the authority. I hope that, in the fullness of time, he will table amendments to exclude those individuals and prevent them from having to go through that long loop. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 505, in page 21, line 23, after ``may'', insert ``be''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 579, in page 21, line 29, after ``may'', insert ``be''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I rise to move a Liberal Democrat amendment. Yet again, the Liberal Democrat Members have disappeared. It is a highly important group of amendments, and the Government are beholden to accept them. They are drafting amendments, which the Government appear to have missed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> For the record, my hon. Friend should have noted that one Liberal Democrat Member has left his jacket on the Bench, as though he were still here. I understand that that is normal practice for people who are moonlighting; they pretend to be here when they are not. It is virtual opposition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that incisive and perceptive comment. Between us, Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members have tabled two amendments to improve the drafting of the Bill. The amendments would insert the word ``be'' after ``may'' in subsections 26(2)(b) and 26(3)(b). At the moment it states ``persons who may affected''; I imagine it does not mean people who have affectations but people who ``may be affected''. I look forward to the Government accepting these pertinent amendments.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was so excited that I almost rose to speak too early. I congratulate Opposition Members on their proof-reading skills. For some weeks, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has been urging me to accept Opposition amendments, and today I am happy to do so.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 579, in page 21, line 29, after `may', insert `be'.—[Mr. Gibb.]

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 595, in page 21, leave out line 33 and insert `the exemption'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 580.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> These amendments remedy another minor drafting defect in clauses 26 and 66. At present, the Bill provides that certain important conditions of an exemption should be included in the order making the exemption rather than in the exemption itself. The amendment will make it clear that the conditions relating to the duration of an exemption are included in the exemption rather than in the order that makes the exemption. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) returns to his seat moments too late.

<P>
It is a sensible approach that will enable those covered by exemptions to look to the exemption itself for conditions relating to an important point rather than to the order.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 547, in page 22, leave out lines 12 and 13.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 524, in page 22, line 13, at end insert

<P>
No. 552, in clause 66, page 66, leave out lines 33 to 35.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I rise to speak to the amendment fresh from a combined Opposition victory on amendment No. 505. We paid tribute to the absent Liberal Democrats during the short debate on that amendment.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 547 to 549 would remove the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if it appears to the Secretary of State inappropriate that the exemption should continue to have effect<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from each of the powers conferred on the Secretary of State to revoke an exemption from the requirement for an activity to be licensed. Those reserved powers are unnecessary. An exemption should be revoked only in respect of a specific rule or condition in the exemption order, so such matters should be dealt with in the order itself. It cannot be right for the Secretary of State to have power to revoke an order simply because he or she considers it inappropriate for an exemption to continue.

<P>
Such powers were not included in the broadly similar provisions contained in the Electricity Act 1989 or in the Gas Act 1986, even after it was amended by the Gas Act 1995. They merely add a layer of uncertainty to the exemption and therefore increase risks in the businesses and activities that it covers. As the Secretary of State can attach conditions to any exemption, it seems unnecessary and unreasonable for him to have the additional and arbitrary powers proposed.

<P>
The accretion of such arbitrary powers is the problem with the Bill, as they increase regulatory risk. Although the clause does not directly concern utilities and deals with exemptions from the requirement to obtain licences, it is another example of the sort of regulatory risk that the Bill increases. The consequence of that increase is manifold. Perhaps the most important effect is that it raises the cost of capital demanded by those investing in the industry. It is important in the light of competing demands for investors to invest in lastminute.com and other internet stocks and of pressures on them to move out of the utilities that we do not increase incentives to remove capital from these industries, which are important for the country and for its infrastructure. Everything possible should be done to minimise the regulatory risk caused by the Bill. I hope that the Minister will remove the unnecessary power proposed by the clause, which is not included in the existing regulatory framework.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and to speak to the amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). When I read this long clause, I saw lurking dangers in providing the Secretary of State with an ability to give exemptions and also to cancel them. Amendments Nos. 524 and 525 propose a year's notice of cancellation. A person could invest in providing a particular service, but the Secretary of State might then decide that he does not wish to provide that person with an exemption and that the activity in question is becoming more than a de minimis activity. The Secretary of State can say, ``Hang on a minute, you cannot do that any more and you must have a licence'' almost overnight. The person affected should have recourse to a cushioning provision that enables him to appeal or to obtain the licence quickly—we all know how long it can take to deal with licences.

<P>
The amendment would give companies a year's notice of when the Secretary of State intends to revoke an order, but I have plucked that time scale out of the air. The Minister might tell me that he accepts the principle but that six months is more appropriate, or that he is feeling terribly generous and that two years is a proper period. He might say that the proposed arrangements give people enough time, or that conditions are written into the original exemptions to ensure that revocation cannot occur until notice is given. It is important that we have that assurance.

<P>
The other amendment in my name is amendment No. 526. It provides that the Secretary of State would give
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not less than three months'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
notice. That would allow people the appropriate time in which to respond to the plans of the Government or the authority. The amendments are meant to be helpful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am delighted that the Minister is in the mood to accept sensible amendments—I am only sorry that I was not here when it happened.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Only when the hon. Gentleman is not present.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was wondering whether the acceptance of an amendment depended on my presence or absence, because I could arrange myself accordingly.

<P>
I am not persuaded that the amendments would add value. It was clear from the comments of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in the clause stand part debate on clause 25 that there is a fundamental difference of opinion between us on the purpose and operation of regulation and licensing. That difference has been underlined in this debate. I do not support the amendments.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> A future order to grant exemptions is expected to contain a provision to enable the Secretary of State to revoke or withdraw the benefit of exemptions in certain circumstances, including the breach of conditions that are attached to an exemption. The hon. Member for South Dorset was worried that that might involve convoluted investigations, difficulties and bureaucratic delay.

<P>
The new principal objective obliges the Secretary of State and the authority to protect the interests of the customers of exempt persons. Unforeseen circumstances could arise which, in the interests of all customers, would lead the Secretary of State to consider the justification of revoking or withdrawing an exemption. For example, changes in market conditions or structure might mean that it is no longer right for a particular group to be exempted and that licensing is more appropriate. We cannot foresee all developments, but we must give the Secretary of State the flexibility to address them effectively.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> But is that not unfair? Businesses that have raised capital on the assumption that a particular regime is in place and there is no requirement to apply for a licence could experience enormous difficulty. For example, a caravan site owner who supplies electricity to the caravans may suddenly and arbitrarily, as a result of a change in market conditions or for whatever reason the Secretary of State wishes to give, find that his business faces huge regulatory paraphernalia, which will increase his marginal costs and could render the business unviable. That could happen with no notice and almost retrospectively, although he might have had in place a five-year business plan with funding from banks and other investors. The rug would suddenly be pulled from beneath his feet by the arbitrary effect of the clause.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point and shall try to explain. The decision will not be arbitrary; the decision to proceed will be subject to consultation. It is prudent to maintain such a contingency. His point is repeated in amendments Nos. 524 and 526, which would ensure that persons covered by exemption orders would not be given unreasonable notice of a decision by the Secretary of State to make an order to terminate an exemption.

<P>
The Secretary of State should give reasonable notice of an intention to revoke or to withdraw an exemption. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton informed us, such an action could have serious implications for the parties affected, whether they are the exempted persons or those who rely on them. However, the Secretary of State should have the discretion to determine the periods of notice and of representation to suit the circumstances. It is only good administrative practice to afford people reasonable opportunity to comment and general administrative law requires no less. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.
<P>

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I would like the Under-Secretary to respond to a final point before I withdraw the amendment. Why was it previously felt unnecessary to have the power reserved for the Secretary of State? All issues that the Under-Secretary has raised would have applied in 1989 and in 1995, when the Gas Act 1986 was amended. Nothing has changed in the way in which caravan sites are run or in combined heat and power associations' supply to housing estates that would warrant the Secretary of State having the power. The only reason why the Under-Secretary might want him to have the power is because it is part and parcel of Labours' philosophy of over-egging the regulator's pudding. If in doubt, the Government grab a new power or reserve for the Secretary of the State an arbitrary power to remove citizen's rights to run their business as they had been.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can ony ask the party that passed previous laws to comment on them; I cannot answer for the previous Government. The answer is simple if one considers the ends of the spectrum of exempted groups. All public electricity suppliers will have to have distribution licences because the public interest remains strong and systems to be regulated are large natural monopolies, as we have discussed. Access is vital if supply competition is to work. All small and medium-sized systems will be exempted because there would be no advantage in requiring them to be licensed. It would only be a cost to them and to the regulator because they pay no licence fee.

<P>
The difficult area lies just below the level of the public electricity suppliers and concerns large privately owned distribution systems attached to many businesses and/or private consumers. A key issue is whether those customers have a choice of suppliers. They often do not because their electricity is sold to them by the distribution system owner, who is usually also an exempt supplier, that has bought it. The Government are keen to ensure that supply competition reaches as many consumers as possible—that aim is at the heart of the Bill. Some systems might have to be licensed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We are getting to grips with the subject, but I am more troubled, rather than less so, by what the Under-Secretary says. Several large ex-MOD sites with many buildings of different sizes in my constituency lend themselves to being turned into industrial estates to be sub-let to small businesses. I know that each site owner has had to renew much of the electrical supply and, I suspect, gas and water too. The method of charging for distribution on such a complicated site is to stick a meter on the end, but the Minister is right to suggest that a price could be negoitiated without any savings being passed on to others.

<P>
An exemption for a site might be obtained from the Government and £1 million invested — I have been stunned at the sums of money that people have invested in a site. All the paperwork might have been completed and as soon as a return on the investment is made, someone from one of the offices might complain that he is not receiving the benefit and does not like the price, so he asks the Secretary of State to revoke a permission not to have a licence—

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The exemption.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Yes, the exemption. The Secretary of State might be right to revoke the exemption, but it would have no time limit. Either we give people exemptions or we do not. The clause is defective without the amendments. The Minister gave a sympathetic answer but did not explain why no time limit is stated. I should be grateful if he would explain that.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I believe that I did answer that question. As I said, administrative law requires that reasonable time should be given for discussions and investigations. The hon. Gentleman makes a good case for the former MOD sites in his constituency, and I am sure that there are similar sites throughout the country. However, there are sufficient safeguards, so I shall continue to resist the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The more that the debate has developed, the more concerned I have become about the issue. The Minister's first response to the Oppositions comments was to argue that he was not responsible for the previous regime or for the 1989 and 1996 Acts. That is true, but Ministers must have a reason for wanting to amend the law. Whether the law was passed by the Administration led by my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), Lady Thatcher, Lloyd George or Gladstone, the Government must give proper reasons for changing the regime. The Minister has not given proper reasons for wanting to give the Secretary of State such a wide power, nor for why he could not accept other amendments tabled by my hon. Friends.

<P>
The Minister said that it is important that the customers of large, privately owned distribution networks, which are smaller than RECs but larger than a caravan site, are also able to benefit from competition and privatisation. That is true, which is why the clause and the previous regime that it amends enable the Director of Gas and Electricity Markets and now the authority to issue exemptions—or not to do so. If the Minister is concerned about a smaller, but still quite large, distribution network, and does not believe that the network benefits consumers, an exemption should not be granted. We should include in the exemption a condition that benefits must be passed on to the consumer.

<P>
We object to the Secretary of State's wide-ranging power to withdraw exemptions just because he or she considers it appropriate to do so. That is what is wrong. We do not object to exemptions being withdrawn if the distribution company does not meet its conditions. That was how the previous Act was drafted. The proposed power is unnecessary. All it does is increase business men's worries about what could happen, without warning, because of an arbitrary decision made by the Secretary of State.

<P>
Businesses have to be prepared for, and wary of, the Government's decision to change the tax regime under which they operate—for example, the rate of corporation tax in the Finance Bill—but at least that decision is debated in the House of Commons. We should not be creating a plethora of new uncertainties, yet the clause delivers just that. A business that runs slightly smaller but potentially large distribution networks might have an exemption. Although it complies with the exemption's sometimes stringent conditions and despite the fact that it has invested vast sums in the distribution network, suddenly, for political reasons—perhaps because a left wing group has campaigned against the exemption—it finds that the exemption has been withdrawn because the Secretary of State has decided that it is appropriate to do so. That is an arbitrary and capricious way for the Government to behave.

<P>
The Committee should not pass laws to enable such things to happen. It is not how a free democracy should function. Businesses should have confidence in the regime under which they operate. It is hard enough for them to operate in the competitive world without the imposition of arbitrary decisions. There is enough arbitrariness in society and life without the Government adding another layer. A further response from the Minister would help us to decide how to proceed.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was not going to respond, but a good note has been passed to me.

<P>
There is uncertainty in the law about whether, and in what circumstances, a licence could be revoked. The Bill makes that clearer, which is especially important as the exemption regime becomes more relevant. The primary objective, which relates to the interests of users of exempt businesses, makes it a crucial power. That is why we resist the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am not sure that that was such a good note. It has not added anything to the debate. The power is arbitrary and unnecessary—it was not in the 1986 or 1989 Acts—and it creates added uncertainty for businesses that operate in a difficult and competitive environment. The Minister has given an inadequate response in his attempt to defend an unacceptable proposal.

<P>

<P>
</FONT><H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr.Gibb:</B> Although not originally controversial, the clause contains subsections on the powers of the Secretary of State—and it is clear from the previous debate that they are controversial and unnecessary. However, aside from that issue, the clause as a whole exemplifies the problem of over-egging the regulatory pudding.

<P>
The exemption provisions of the Electricity Act 1989 are to be found in section 5. They comprise 17 lines and just four subsections. The new exemption clause will add a new section 5 to the Act, comprising 10 subsections that take up 90 lines over two pages. The purpose of those extra provisions is, according to the explanatory notes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In order to protect the interests of consumers and to allow the Authority to perform its duties, the Secretary of State may attach conditions to any exemption, and may withdraw the exemption and require the person or persons to obtain a licence if such a condition is breached.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that we are discussing exemptions from licensing requirements that apply to, for example, the owner of a caravan site who re-supplies power to each caravan on site, all these extra provisions over and above the safeguards already in the 1989 Act seem excessive. It is indicative of the general problem with the Bill: if in doubt, regulate; if there is concern, take a new power; and if there is a problem with drafting, then draft twice as much as the previous regime.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister has not risen to speak, but we require, for the Committee's proper understanding, to hear why the clause has been written into the Bill. We have had some discussion on technical issues and the Minister is worried about the time, but I assure him that Opposition Members are perfectly prepared to stay here for as long as necessary in order to ensure a proper reply and debate on the clause. The clause constitutes a good lump of the Bill—it is two pages long—and we need to know what the Government intend to do with it. The Minister is not yet indicating that he wants to jump to his feet, so I shall speak a little more.

<P>
If the Government are intending to exempt a class of people from the requirement to have licences, the Committee needs to know what conditions would be imposed on those exemptions and what reasons the Minister would have for using the provision and therefore intervening in the market. I suspect that those tenants of the former MOD sites that I described would be interested in knowing form the Minister what controls are going to be put on those who are, in effect, re-distributing electricity. We would want to know also about small operators who might distribute excess electricity, from a windmill, for instance, or an incinerator.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows, because he has a bag full of information on this subject, that we will deal with those points under subsequent clauses. He should accept that we have had a good debate on the clause; let us press on with very important clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for trying to keep to the timetable, but I want him to explain why have the new rules on exemptions been written into the Bill? The electricity and gas industries have had the same problems in the past and have seemed to cope without such powers, which can be implemented at a moment's notice. I suspect that, as this is a belt-and-braces operation, Ministers—having made the decision—are not going to jump in and out to remove exemptions, but we have ot heard that from the Minister. We do not know how the power will be used. It should not take the Minister more than a couple of minutes to give us a flavour of how the Secretary of State and the authority might use those powers.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall try to bring the debate to a close. I shall go through this carefully. In electricity supply, there will be three groups of exempt supplier: those who supply not more than 500 kW, those who resell electricity purchased from a licensed supplier—which includes, subject to certain conditions, a caravan site owner, and other exempt suppliers such as on-site industrial suppliers—and those supplying to customers from a generator on the same site and other customers on the site within certain lmits. We shall be dealing with that in subsequent clauses.

<P>
In generation, exemption applies mostly to small generators, which are defined as those with a capacity of less than 100 MW, exporting up to 50MW, and those with more than 100 MW capacity, exporting no more than 10 MW. In both cases, the power supplied to a single customer or group of customers on the same site as the generating station is disregarded. The exemption extends also to those who generate or supply offshore. The 1989 Act does not provide for exemptions in transmission. The clause will allow for that possibility, although there are no likely candidates in the market. None the less, we believe that the system should be sufficiently flexible to allow such changes in the market to be accommodated.

<P>
Question put and agreed to

<P>
Clause 26, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
 
<H4><center>Clause 63</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exceptions from section 5 of 1986 Act</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is important that the Minister should explain the reason for the clause and tell us why the Government wish to remove the second method of exemption from the Gas Act 1986.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Clause 63 repeals section 5(2) and Schedule 2A of the Gas Act 1986. Section 5(1) of the Act makes it a criminal offence to carry out certain activities—gas transportation, supply and shipping—unless authorised to do so by licence, except when an exemption is granted by the Secretary of State under section 6A or if the activity is excepted under schedule 2A.

<P>
The provision on exceptions is now redundant, as it will be swallowed up in the revised provisions for granting exemptions from the need to hold a licence. Schedule 2A means that the following activities may be carried out without the need for a licence or an exemption: the conveyance or supply of gas by a landlord in a building or part of a building in which he has an interest in gas consumption; the conveyance or supply from one company to any premises occupied by a related company; the conveyance or supply of butane or propane, subject to certain safety provisions; the conveyance of gas in order to supply customers using more than 75,000 therms a year; and the supply of gas to customers using more than 2 million therms a year, subject to procedural requirements such as providing information to the regulator for verification purposes. In addition to those exceptions, section 6A of the 1986 Act provides for the power to grant exemptions from the need to hold a licence, with or without conditions attached.

<P>
We consider it artificial and unncessary, and contrary to the interests of better regulation, to maintain an exceptions and exemptions regime for gas. No provisions are made for exceptions in the supply of electricity, and we see no strong case for continuing with the status quo. It makes more sense to provide for a power of exemption that will align the gas and electricity regulatory regimes. We intend to replicate the precise terms of the gas exceptions in a subsequent exemptions order. Those terms include the empowerment of authorised personnel to enter premises for safety purposes related to the supply of butane or propane. We are maintaining the regulatory control necessary to ensure that gas customers of exempt persons are given the same protection, while removing an unnecessary layer from the statute book. In addition to the removal of schedule 2A, consequential amendment is necessary to remove references to it from section 5 of the Gas Act.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 63 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 66</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemptions from gas licensing</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment made: No. 580, in page 66, line 8, leave out from ``the'' to end of line 9 and insert ``exemption''.—[Dr. Howells.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a point of order, Mrs Roe. Will the Minister briefly explain the clause? We have fully debated similar provisions on electricity, and some introductory remarks would be helpful.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The clause amends section 6A of the Gas Act, which provides for exemptions from the requirement to hold a licence to carry out activities covered by section 5 of the Act. By virtue of those changes and provisions contained in clause 26, the powers to grant exemptions in relation to gas and electricity will be substantially identical. The clause replaces specific subsections of section 6A of the 1986 Act, but the essence of the power for which it provides remains unchanged. The Secretary of State may grant exemption from the requirement to hold a licence to carry out activities covered by section 5(1) of the Act. I shall cite three of those activities: transporting gas through pipes to premises or to a pipeline system operated by a public gas transporter; supplying to any premises gas that has been conveyed through pipes; and shipping gas into, through or out of a pipeline system by arrangement with a public gas transporter.

<P>
The changes made by the clause are designed to clarify specific aspects of the exemption-granting power. In particular, the revised provisions will be clearer and more specific about the process of giving notice of exemptions and their revocation and withdrawal. The clause also makes it clear that exemptions may be made for an indefinite period, which is ambiguous in the existing provision.

Clause 66, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 27</center></H4>
<H4><center>Licences authorising supply etc. of electricity</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 527, in page 23, line 19, leave out subsection (2).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 506, in page 23, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Distribution licences should be held by separate subsidiaries.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 529, in page 23, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if they have more than 50 per cent. of the local electricity market'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We have touched in previous debates on the Government's decision to create two legal persons: a distribution licence holder and a supply licence holder. Anyone reading the Bill will be confused by that provision. Most people would assume that the owners of the electricity wires would not be able to own a distribution licence.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The owners of the wire would remain as the distribution company, but a supply company would also exist.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful; the people supplying electricity cannot also be distributing it. The Government have said in previous debates that the local regional electricity companies would still own wires and supply electricity through them but would do so through two separate companies. However, the Bill does not say that—it merely separates holders of supply and distribution licences. One of the reasons why I tabled the amendment, which would delete that provision, was to ensure a full debate on what the Government are attempting to do, so it is also partly a probing amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 529 represents a different view. If a company owned the distribution system—the wires—and generated less than 50 per cent. of the electricity going down those wires, it could be said to have already proved that there was proper competition. The requirement for two separate companies would therefore be unnecessary.

<P>
The amendment is intended to get the Under-Secretary to clarify the Government's direction. A small operator might enter the marketplace to provide the wires and to generate the electricity. It might provide an alternative means of distribution in competition with a company that already owned wires and supplied electricity. An operator might have to own the wires and the supply because the oepration was too small to have two entities.
<P>

<P>

</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I understood my hon. Friend's amendment to mean that he opposes the separation of distribution and supply licences; that is clearly not the case. He makes a good point about the word ``person''. Most people would interpret that as referring to a 100 per cent. shareholder in a company with two subsidiaries, one owning a distribution network and the other owing an electricity supply company. The immediate interpretation of subsection (2) is that such a person would be committing an offence because, as a 100 per cent. shareholder in the holding company he owned the distribution and the supply networks. However, the Government's consultation documents and the explanatory notes make it clear that that is not the purpose of the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Indeed. I am sure that we shall have a contribution from our colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Bench, who have suggested that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Distribution licences should be held by separate subsidiaries.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is problematic because we are considering distribution and supply licences. The wording of that amendment is not satisfactory, but Liberal Democrat Members are right to ponder the important question of separate subsidiaries.

<P>
The Government might agree that, while the lawyers might like the wording, it does not express their intentions. I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that they should go and burn more midnight oil, if that is acceptable environmentally, and come up with a better wording.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> As the hon. Member for South Dorset says, the amendments attempt to tackle the same point. We are all struggling with the language of transmission, distribution and supply, and with ensuring that we are clear about which word we mean to use. That is not always easy to achieve.

<P>
Amendment No. 506, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) and me, would ensure that we kept competition in distribution and supply as wide as possible. I experienced the same difficulty as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton when reading the lead amendment because I thought that it would permit a reduction in competition, which is not in keeping with the intentions behind the amendment that we tabled, but perhaps there is more synergy between the amendments than I first thought.

<P>
The issue is to ensure that distribution does not become a monopoly activity. We believe that distribution licences should be held by separate subsidiaries. One might say the same about supply licences. I do not pretend that the wording of our amendment is absolutely perfect. We want to have a properly regulated industry with plenty of competition and we belive that there is scope to ensure a plurality of licence holders who are able to achieve that. Clearly, there are other issues, such as ensuring that transparency and reporting lines remain in place, all of which are covered by the clause but probed further in the amendments. Will the Minister say precisely how he thinks subsection (2) will operate and say what limitations, if any, he thinks there should be to ensure that there are separate licence holders for the supply and distribution of electricity in a particular area? All those issues are left open ended in the Bill. Amendment No. 506 seeks to stretch the Minister's interpretation in one direction; the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Dorset might pull in two other directions. Taken together, the three amendments open up the debate.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for South Dorset does not oppose the separation of supply and distribution. I too, found the amendment confusing, but I shall try to answer the points that he made.

<P>
The three amendments all relate to the policy of separating supply and distribution. Unfortunately, each would seriously weaken the provisions of clauses 25 and 27, which give effect to that policy.

<P>
Amendment No. 527 would remove the statutory prohibition that we propose should prevent any single legal person from holding both a supply and a distribution licence. The Government regard that as a key component of their policy of separating those businesses. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the definition of ``person''. The legal person who holds the licence will be the company that operates the distribution or supply business, as the case may be. Any company with separate supply and distribution subsidiaries will not hold either licence and will not, therefore, fall foul of the prohibition because the subsidiaries would be separate legal persons. Without such provisions, proper competition in supply would be difficult to establish. Where a distributor and supplier were in the same company, it would be difficult to ensure that the monopoly distributor was not cross-subsidising its supply business. It would be difficult to tell whether the distribution business was giving system access to its own supplier on the same terms as other suppliers. Furthermore, it would be difficult to prevent confidential information about other suppliers and customers from being passed between the two in a way that could damage the competitive position of those suppliers.

<P>
In short, without that statutory prohibition, we do not believe that we can achieve the separation of businesses, and we would do little for customers by way of encouraging competition. Indeed, quite the reverse.

<P>
The same arguments apply to amendment No. 529.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister uses the term ``legal person''. Limited companies commonly use that terminology. Why does not the word ``legal'' appear in the Bill? Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The same person may not be the holder.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Should not it refer to ``The same legal person''?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall check to ensure that there is no ambiguity. The hon. Gentleman's point about subsection (2) might be correct.

<P>
Amendment No. 529 would water down the prohibition to such an extent that it would be fatally undermined and may as well not remain in the Bill. To that extent, the amendments would have the same effect—to drive a cart and horses through our policy of separating supply and distribution and through our efforts to further encourage the development of supply competition. I am happy to concede that the idea of supply competition was developed by the Conservative party when it was in power, but I am at a loss to understand why Conservative Members want to stop in its tracks our attempt to enlarge competition—that approach is beginning to bring real benefits to consumers. I hope that they recognise that we must move on and that they have not adopted a proprietorial attitude towards an industry that they privatised.

<P>
Amendment No. 506 suggests that when distribution and supply businesses are separated, they should be placed in specific parts of corporate groups. I applaud the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) for the amendment's implicit support of the policy of separation, but I do not understand what benefits the amendment would bring. Our view is that the appropriate legal relationship between the two businesses should recognise the fact that they are separate legal entities.

<P>
Ownership should be left to the markets to determine—subject, of course, to the relevant competition considerations—and the supplier and the distributor should be treated as separate legal entities. The statutory prohibition on supply and distribution licences that are held by the same company forces those businesses into an arm's length relationship—legally, it involves the same relationship that the distributor has with other suppliers in the system. That is the effect that we wish to achieve. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Opposition Members support the separation of distribution and supply licences, which is an eminently sensible next step in the evolution of competition in the electricity industry. The Minister said that unless ownership was separate, it would be difficult to ensure that there was no cross subsidy from the natural monopoly distribution segment of the industry to the supply sector, which is subject to open and fierce competition.

<P>
There are also problems about passing confidential information to the monopoly distributor, who will know about the other suppliers who feed into the distribution network, and to a supplier in the same group. How will splitting the sector into two subsidiaries prevent the passage of confidential information? If the subsidiaries are owned by the same group, it will be simple to pass across such information. Cross-subsidisation is also relevant in that regard. Presumably, Ofgem has already issued guidance on the conditions that it will insert in the various licences to ensure that confidential information is not passed on, and on the measures that it intends to take to prevent cross-subsidisation. For example, if we insisted that any supplies that transfer between the two subsidiaries involved arm's length prices, we could avoid cross-subsidisation difficulties.

<P>
How will the Government prevent confidential information from being passed from one subsidiary to another, and what conditions will they impose on the licences to prevent cross-subsidisation? How will those approaches be enforced?

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is a very important point. It goes to the heart of all business transactions in which companies interrelate, which is when competition law comes into effect. The development of supply competition makes it vital that all suppliers get fair and open access to the monopoly distribution system of the current public electricity suppliers. That is the most important element of the exercise.

<P>
Central to that is the consideration that the supply businesses of public electricity suppliers should not be put at a competitive advantage because of their association with a distribution business. If supply and distribution licensing are not separated, people will continue to be worried about public electricity suppliers giving preferential treatment to their supply businesses, passing on commercially sensitive information about competitors to their in-house supply businesses or using the monopoly distribution business to cross-subsidise their supply businesses.

<P>
As a former business consultant, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows that those are the most important practices for competition law to control. Unfair seepages of information across companies raise the barriers to new entrants. That is why we have provided the regulators with sanctions. When they detect unfair practices, they can come down on companies like a ton of bricks. That power was missing from competition law before we introduced the Competition Act 1998. There are severe sanctions, which some Opposition Members opposed. The point of legal separation is to require two businesses to deal with each other on a contractual basis that can be checked and regulated if necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am afraid that is not helpful. The 1998 Act will not have an impact on subsidiaries. There is nothing to stop them colluding. Many large groups are made up of several companies. They work closely together and the management is usually the same.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman is not saying that business is crooked because contractual arrangements are always rigged and too difficult for regulators to understand and separate. Ian Byatt, the water regulator, was keen for the separate functions of businesses to have benchmarks and clarity so that he could judge whether customers were getting value for money.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister misunderstands the point. Where will the rules that are to be applied to different distribution and supply licences be made? If they are, as I suspect, to be part of the conditions of the supply and distribution licences, we should be given examples of the detail. For example, will payments between a distribution company and a supply company that are owned by the same group be kept at arm's length? That is not the same as putting them on a contractual basis. Company and case law requires subsidiaries within a group to have contracts. They cannot give something away to a fellow subsidiary; it has to be sold, but there is no requirement for that transaction to be at market value.

<P>
I am sure that there is an answer to the problem, probably when the right bits of paper are passed to the Minister. I am trying to elicit through which mechanism the rules will be applied. It is not the case, as the Minister suggested, that because the functions are in separate subsidiaries, they will necessarily deal with one another on an arm's-length basis, nor will that prevent confidential information from being transferred between subsidiaries. It is not crooked, as the Minister implied, for two subsidiaries that are owned by the same group to supply information to each other. That is perfectly legal. It is commendable that companies work together.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> On the contrary, I did not imply that they were crooked. Instead, I asked the hon. Gentleman whether he thought that such actions were crooked. The regulator has special powers to investigate the precise relationships within the sector that he or she regulates. For the first time, there are sanctions to prevent abuses from occurring when they are detected.

<P>
<B>Mr.Gibb:</B> The Minister is right, but I am trying to elicit what those rules are going to be. It is all very well to say that the regulator can investigate what is happening and impose huge, limitless fines on activity with which he does not agree, but there will be rules on passing confidential information from one subsidiary to another and on subsidiaries dealing with each other at arm's length. The Minister has failed to tell me where those rules will be set down. I suspect that they will be part of the licence conditions. It would help us to have examples of the most important of those conditions. For instance, will there be a condition to ensure that two subsidiaries operate at arm's length? Will the conditions stipulate that one subsidiary cannot pass confidential information to another?

<P>
 I wanted to raise the issue of call centres. Would a distribution company's call centre remain in the ownership of the distribution subsidiary and be unavailable for use by the supplier, or would it be owned by the supplier subsidiary, which would allow it to use the group's information in the competitive market? But I cannot get on to those questions until we overcome what I thought was a minor hurdle. We need to know where in the regulatory regime the rules will he—what mechanism will be used to impose them—and how they will relate to cross-subsidisation and confidential information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend is on a good point. Consumers need to know about their electricity supply and distribution. When electricity does not come down the wire, it would be logical for them to go to the electricity supplier, but a break in the wire would be the fault of the company with the distribution licence. Would the electricity supplier deal with the distributor, or would consumers have to make two telephone calls to determine whether the problem is the responsibility of the distributor or the supplier?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend raises a pertinent point that I was hoping to cover. A logistics company recently discussed that problem with me. I thought that the answer was clear: if a consumer fails to receive electricity, he should complain to the supplier with which he has a contract in the same way that I will complain to the John Lewis Partnership if it does not deliver the washing machine that I ordered at the weekend. I do not care whether it is delivered by TNT or another distributor, as long as the supplier gets it to me. The same should apply to electricity. I would expect the supplier to contact the distribution company to investigate the problem with the wires. It should not be for me to telephone the distribution company.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman is fantasising. A distributor would not say, ``We better watch ourselves here. Let's get the retaliation in first.'' It will be for the supplier to sort out problems with the distributor. The consumer—the customer—needs to contact only the supplier. Let us put that to bed now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that, but I return to the fundamental point. Where are the rules that will require the subsidiaries to deal with each other?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We have published eight volumes of standard licence conditions for consultation. I do not intend to read them out to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Oh, go on!

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would not notice the difference. The licence conditions will include provisions on arm's length trading and confidentiality. The directors of each subsidiary company will be under the normal fiduciary duty to that company; it would not be consistent with the Bill's provisions for them to collude with directors of a separate subsidiary company to subvert the licence conditions to which that company was subject.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful; we are getting to the truth. I do not want to embarrass the Minister, but I assumed that those routine matters would be considered by the Minister dealing with the Bill—and, indeed, that he would be involved in drafting it. I assume that the conditions would be included in the licences. It is wrong to say that matters between two subsidiaries are dealt with under company law. The Minister said that the conditions will be those set out in the eight volumes—published by Ofgem rather than the Government.

<P>
It is important that the Committee understands those rules. So far as I understand the Minister's brief response, the conditions of which Ofgem is consulting will include a rule that the distribution company will not be allowed to supply confidential information to a supply company of the same trading group. Nor will distribution and supply companies be able to deal with each other except at arm's length, so all the transactions between the two companies will be at market value.

<P>
The Minister said in answer to a previous question that a supplier could contact the customer. I understood that the customer's contract would be with the supplier, not the distributor, so that customer will call the supplier's call centre. Do I take it that the call centres are those currently owned by the public electricity suppliers—the regional electricity companies—which will be divided under the transfer schemes listed in schedule 3? Presumably, all those assets and liabilities, which are mostly still jointly owned, will be split under the transfer schemes. To which of the two subsidiaries—supplier or distributor—will the call centres be transferred?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I would assume—I may be wrong; the short answer is that I am not certain—that the company that undertakes to supply electricity under the new regulations would need the call centre far more than the distribution company. Customers would use the supply company call centre if something went wrong or if they wanted to make different contractual arrangements. They would have no reason to call the distribution company. The supply company would probably take the call centres with it when it forms that new legal entity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister's answer is helpful, but it raises the question of whether the supplier would gain a huge competitive advantage from acquiring that vast network of confidential information. Assuming that that is okay, which it probably is, what will happen when the distribution company requires information about the customer network? The distributor will need that information even if it does not need to call the customer.

<P>
The heart of the matter is whether the distributor will be able to share that call centre information if it and the supply company is jointly owned by the same group. The supply company already owns the call centre, and it is subject to fierce competition, so there will be no unfair advantage in it sharing its information with the monopolist distribution company, provided that it receives a fee. Is it envisaged, in those eight volumes, that the distribution and supply companies could share that call centre network and therefore obtain synergy and efficiency, or do the Government expect the distribution company to set up its own call centre network?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I must admit that I did not spend the glorious weather on Saturday reading the eight volumes of Ofgem's guidance—I was digging in my allotment. I know of many call centres, some run by energy companies, that do a range of business. The same call facilities are sub-contracted to firms in different sectors. I cannot imagine, except in extremely special circumstances, that a call centre could not be so available.

<P>
I do not want to give that as a definite answer to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. My short answer is that I do not know, but I shall try to find out the position regarding such a transfer. I should have thought that it was for the commercial entity concerned to decide whether it wished to use a call centre that it had helped to establish, to establish a new centre or to sub-contract the work to a centre in another sector.
<P>

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's candour; it would be helpful if he wrote to members of the Committee with the answer to that important question. Subsection (2) says that the same person, by which is meant the same subsidiary company, might not own the distribution and supply licences. That is because there should be no transfer of confidential information—that would give a monopolist's in-house supplier an unfair advantage—and there should not be cross-subsidies from the monopolist to such a supplier. I am trying to elicit what that would mean in practice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister will not want to jump up too many more times, but he might like to address that point. When the electricity companies were established, the National Grid Company was owned equally by the regional electricity companies, which decided that it would be good to sell their shares in it, thus separating it off. Almost all of them are public limited companies. Most of us think that such companies constitute legal persons; they will own both supply and distribution licences. Will the Government allow them to own both licences, or do they envisage the creation of public limited companies with distribution licences to equal the current number of companies with supply licences?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I hope that the Minister will deal with those points. We have elicited why the separation is necessary and the way in which the rules preventing cross-subsidisation and the supply of confidential information from the monopolist to the competitor will be put in place through the licence conditions. Ofgem is consulting on the conditions, which have been set out in the eight ring-bound volumes issued. It is important to understand what will happen to the call centres. I must admit to being disappointed that the Minister could not answer the question and that the answer is not coming from elsewhere.

<P>
That situation reveals why there are problems with the Bill. The policy makers are not getting to grips with the detail. What would happen to the call centres was a major issue debated in the Green Paper and consultation documents. It was not a minor detail hidden in volume 8 or volume 7 of the Ofgem consultation documents—it was pertinent to the purpose behind the clause and the splitting of the ownership of distribution and supply. The debate discussed whether the same legal person could own them and whether there could be two subsidiaries in a group. A strong body of opinion felt that public limited companies, to which my hon. Friend has referred, could not own both and that distribution should be separately owned by a different legal person and another set of shareholders. The Government decided that it was right to enable joint ownership, albeit in different subsidiaries. The Opposition agree with that view, but the detail of whether the distributor must set up a new infrastructure when the supplier owns a call centre or whether it can be shared is pertinent not only to the clause but to the Bill as a whole. I hope that there has been time for paper to transfer to the Minister. If not, will he undertake to write to Committee members? If he responds in writing, I shall be disappointed that he and his team are not up to speed on these crucial issues, which go to the heart of the split between distribution and supply.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I do not want the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to be disappointed about anything that we do. Suppliers need call centres and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that distributors need them as well. Contractual arrangements between suppliers and distributors mean that information on losses of supply can be exchanged. Call centres that are shared—as they are by current electricity suppliers—will be separated. I said about half an hour ago that the Government view the legal relationship between the two businesses and not the ownership relationship as being most important. We would rather leave ownership for the market to determine. I understand the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton agrees with that view, and, although the hon. Member for Hazel Grove does not necessarily do so, I suspect that we have got it right. Suppliers and distributors will always be subject to competition considerations.

<P>
I hope that I have answered hon. Members' questions. If they have further difficulties relating to call centres, I shall write to the Members. I shall answer in my letter any further questions that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wishes to ask, perhaps also in writing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall raise the issues in Committee; that is why we are here. I understand the Minister's point about ownership. The purpose of separating distribution and supply into two subsidiaries of a group is to facilitate arm's length transactions between them. Each subsidiary will be required to keep separate accounts, and it is easier to enforce such provision in respect of separate legal entities than of two divisions within one subsidiary. That is the purpose of the separation. I was trying to elicit some key facts about call centres. The Minister told us that they would be separated when they were owned by a company that distributed and supplied electricity. That explanation went some way towards answering my question but not all the way. I do not understand what separation of call centres means.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Businesses and parts of businesses break up, are farmed out and become different entities every day of the week. I suspect that if Microsoft had been British, we would have boasted ``We have the best software in the world and it gives you a free browser.'' In America, competition law instead identifies a monopoly that is unfair to competitors and separation is pursued. That is not rocket science. It can be complicated within specific companies, but I do not see why it cannot be achieved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> But what will the call centre be separated from? Will it be separated from the distribution company and made part of the supply company, or the other way round? Will it be separated—or split, in other words—so it will deal only with information relating to the supplier? Call centres tend to be a physical asset, or something that one can kick—they are phones, seats and headphones.
 
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I do not want to prolong this discussion. It will be up to the company in question to achieve a proper working relationship after separation. That relationship will be approved by the regulatory authority; it is as simple as that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am not sure whether that is the right answer. I invite the Minister to write to Committee members, providing a full and definitive answer. I am disappointed that neither he nor his back-up have been able to provide such an answer. The Government might still be considering what to do on the issue, in which case that would have been an adequate answer. However, the answers that we have been given are inadequate, so a letter would be helpful. It is a pity that that letter cannot appear in the Official Report, but I will endeavour to rectify that in future sittings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> These are probing amendments and, obviously, I will withdraw them. We have had an extremely useful debate. Subsection (2) does not adequately express the Government's intentions. The Government need to propose a better form of words on Report so that people can understand the issue. Following the separation made by previous Governments, a company must have a licence to generate electricity and it cannot send it anywhere without a transmission licence; and if it is transmitting electricity, it needs a distribution licence to distribute it to the end consumers, and it must have a separate supply licence if it is charging them for it. We appear to be creating a muddle for what should be a fairly simple procedure.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> May I reiterate the point that I made earlier? I told the hon. Gentleman that the ownership of the call centres will be for the companies to determine. The rules about sharing information will be set by the authority in the licence conditions. I cannot add to that. We can go round the houses over this, but that is the situation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was delighted to give way to the Minister so that he could make that point. However, it was not the point that I was trying to make. Anyone reading the Bill will not understand what we are legislating for, so it is defective.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was wondering—

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to catch my eye, I must ask him to stand in his place so that I can ensure a balanced debate. I do not know that the hon. Gentleman wishes to be called unless he stands in his place. I will call him before the hon. Member for South Dorset formally withdraws the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I appreciate your indulgence, Mrs Roe. I will try to improve my performance, as, no doubt, will the various participants in the electricity industry when clause is enacted.

<P>
I was wondering whether there was any analogy with AT&T in the United States or Virgin and Railtrack in this country that would help us on this matter. I am not sure that there is. The issues are the possibility of vertical integration, the plurality of ownership—or, in the eyes of the Minister at least, plurality of legal entities—and the degree of transparency between the different levels.

<P>
I found the debate fascinating. It uncovered arguments of which I was not aware and, judging by his body language neither was the Minister. The debate uncovered a number of points that need some further exposition—perhaps by Opposition Members reading the eight volumes, or perhaps by the Minister clarifying in a letter precisely what the Government's intentions are because there are some ambiguities. Our approach to separate subsidiaries would have ensured wider competition and achieved more in relation to the direction in which the Minister was driving the argument and less in the direction in which Conservative Members were driving the argument. I am content to let it rest at that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 581, in page 23, leave out lines 21 to 23.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 528, in page 23, line 22, leave out ``within Great Britain''.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As hon. Members will know, the Government recently published draft standard conditions of licences. I am sure that those who have had time to read them in detail—[Interruption] Those who have not been on the allotment with me will have noticed that the standard conditions of generation licences include a few that apply specifically to persons who generate electricity in Scotland. They refer in the main to the electricity trading arrangements in Scotland, which differ from those south of the border.

<P>
Supply, distribution and transmission are distributed activities. That is, they are not specific to particular locations. Therefore, it makes sense to talk about areas in which those activities take place. By contrast, generation takes place in specific locations. The precise locations are a matter for the Secretary of State under the powers conferred on him by section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to grant consents for the construction of power stations, which are also subject to planning law. We see no need to duplicate regulation of the location of generation by specifying in a licence where it may or may not take place. Therefore, proposed new section 6(3) should be removed from the Bill to eliminate any doubt that the provision might conflict with the requirement that additional standard licence conditions should operate in the licences of those who generate electricity in Scotland, largely to reflect the different electricity trading arrangements north and south of the border.
<P>

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am slightly baffled by the Minister's comments. Clause 27 proposes a new section 6 to the Electricity Act 1989 and section 6(3), which the Government amendment would remove from the Bill, provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The terms of a generation licence may not restrict the areas or places within Great Britain in or at which the holder is authorised by the licence to generate electricity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Apart from the Minister's remarks about Scotland, he said that he did not want to specify in licence conditions any details regarding the location of the generator because such matters are dealt with by planning law and by section 36 of the 1989 Act, which is a quasi planning law statute. I do not understand why the Minister wants to remove the provision because it makes clear that the terms of the generation licences should not specify the location of a generating plant, which is what the Minister said he wanted to achieve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 528, which would delete the words ``within Great Britain.'' The Government amendment will delete the whole clause, but the reason for doing that seems to be completely different from the purpose of the clause. How will overseas generators fit into the regime? That is not a fanciful question because France generates a considerable amount of electricity, which passes along the interconnector into Kent, for our grid. Therefore, it seems that companies in certain countries close to the United Kingdom, such as France and Belgium, might decide to generate electricity wholly for the UK market and deliver it directly to people's homes. Amendment No. 528 is a probing amendment; to ask the Government whether they have thought about the position of European generators which generate directly into the UK market, because that will have implications for EU law.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not absolutely certain whether the hon. Gentleman is saying that Her Majesty's Government should have a say in the location of generating plant in France. All of us in the European Union have failed miserably to influence the location of generating plant in France, because it is usually located where the prevailing winds take any pollution away from France and into another country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Indeed; the hon. Gentleman is referring to Cap de la Hague, the nuclear facilities in France, which are on a direct line with my constituency along the path of the prevailling wind. Hon. Members are keen to ensure that nuclear plants in their constituencies are in areas where the prevailing wind blows on to the constituents of other hon. Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): Mine.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I should have been more careful in making those remarks. My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that the nuclear facility in my constituency has been closed down.

<P>
The inclusion of the words ``Great Britain'' in subsection (3) sparked the thought that it was important. The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority will be the licensing generation. The licensing arrangements may ensure a cross-subsidy for social and environmental reasons. Amendment No. 528 is intended to find out whether the Minister has considered how the Bill applies to electricity generated in another jurisdiction and whether the licensing arrangements provide an even playing field.

<P>
The argument can be taken to a ridiculous level. If every company generating electricity in the south-east and south-west had to add 50 per cent. to its cost because of licence conditions, it could become economic to build power stations along the northern coast of France and Belgium and to supply electricity from there. When I saw the words ``within Great Britain'' in the clause, I asked why they were there and felt that the Government's intentions should be probed. The relationship with Northern Ireland was a part of my concern, as was the question whether the people of Northern Ireland should be able to benefit from Great Britain's supply. Those are the points that sparked my thoughts and cased me to table amendment No. 528.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The question of overseas generators is intriguing. I was not thinking of Cap de la Hague, although it is relatively close to the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I was thinking of the ring of nuclear generators in north-western France, where the prevailing wind comes from the south-west. If anything went wrong, Belgium, Holland and Germany would cop it rather than Paris. However, I have probably been reading too many novels. We cannot license overseas generators, but there are ways in which electricity traded in the United Kingdom can be regulated under the pooling and settlement agreement and soon under the new electricity trading arrangements.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton detected that the Government have second thoughts on the need to introduce licence conditions that apply only Scotland. We want to avoid the possibility that section 6(3) of the 1989 Act could be interpreted as prohibiting that—a worry that is reasonable enough to cause us to reconsider the provision.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 530, in page 23, line 38, leave out ``in any area, or''.

<P>
I am tempted not to move the amendment. It is my birthday and even amendments that I think are no good should be passed over. If it were the Government Whip's birthday, I am sure that I would not have spoken to it. It seeks to deal with what appeared to be a tautology, but it is hardly worth detaining the Committee unless the Minister has decided that it is worth considering. It should have sought to remove the word ``only'' as well as those which it would delete in its current form. It might have dealt with a tautology in respect of the licence and would have reduced the amount of paper used in the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to withdraw the amendment?

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 532, in page 25, line 2, leave out ``the consolidated fund'' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a trust fund out of which the authority's expenses shall be paid and the remainder returned to licence holders.'<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment covers a more important point, which is why I wanted to get to the meat of the matter before we got to the meat of our lunch. Subsection (7) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any sums received by the Authority under this section shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Anything that the authority receives will go into the Chancellor's pocket or war chest. Whatever is collected via licence fees and other measures is part of general taxation. That seems ridiculous, especially since Ministers clearly suggested that licence and subsidy costs were to go to deal with matters in the electricity and gas industry; the intention was not to collect yet another tax for the Chancellor.

<P>
My amendment proposes a trust fund. The authority should use money collected for its purposes under the Bill and any left over should be returned to licence holders, from whom it was collected. They would not get a divvie at the end of the year, but licence fees should cover the costs of activities and should not add to moneys raised by the Government through general taxation. Without the amendment, we would be providing for more stealth taxes by the Government. No Labour Member would want to be accused of doing that at the next general election; I am sure that the Minister will want to support the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I understand and share the hon. Gentleman's desire to ensure that the licence is used only for the authority's activities. We do not intend the licence fee to accrue to general Government expenditure—that would be wrong.

<P>
The amendment is not necessary to secure that end. The normal convention in such Bills is to provide that receipts are surrendered to the Consolidated Fund, but that does not preclude the Treasury agreeing to such receipts being appropriated in aid of a vote. It would be retained by the organisation to defray expenses. The sectoral regulators are currently funded in that way. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am disappointed with the Minister—this was a chance for him to strike out in a new way, regardless of the way in which we did things in the past. We are now new and modern, but the Minister is not willing to do something sensible. The road fund licence was collected from motorists specifically to ensure that roads were built and repaired. What is collected from the licence is put into general taxation because no Committee resisted putting the money into the Consolidated Fund. When Labour Members ask why pensions are not rising by more than 75p, they can look at the national insurance fund—one of the few that is supposed to be a real fund—and say that the money is there and that it should be used appropriately.

<P>
Moneys will be collected from licence fees for purposes decided by Parliament. Nothing guarantees that, once it has been collected and put into the Consolidated Fund, every penny will be placed at the authority's disposal for those purposes. The Minister should strike out and tell the Treasury that he will not be its puppet and that the amendment is an appropriate way of ensuring that the money is held within the industry for the benefit of the consumer and industry bodies.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sure that the Chancellor would join me in wishing the hon. Gentleman a happy birthday.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> A present was not even attached. The usual channels have delightfully decided that, as it is my birthday, we shall break 15 minutes early for lunch. Having been bribed sufficiently, I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): On a point of order, Mrs Roe. I am sure that the whole Committee wishes the hon. Member for South Dorset a happy birthday. So that he might celebrate properly, I beg to move that further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Adjourned accordingly at fourteen minutes to One o'clock till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
