Coaker</strong> (Gedling) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000265">&#160;</a>
                           </span> Good afternoon, Mr
Chope. I welcome you back to the Chair and members of the Committee
back to our last sitting. Unfortunately, judging by the Home Office
programme, it seems that we will have more Bills, but I do not know
whether we will all be members of the Committees that consider
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
I remember that when the Government were in opposition they said that
it was ridiculous for the House to consider so many Home Office Bills
in one year. I know that this is their first year in government and
they are flushed with enthusiasm and excitement, but I remember being
lectured at great length about being unable to scrutinise and plan such
Bills properly—but that was in a different era.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clause is extremely important. Our debate on the Bill has been
interesting—we have agreed with much of it in principle, but
have sometimes disagreed, or required clarification, on its detail.
That has not been the case with the provision for a single individual
to be responsible for a police force, and the establishment of the
police and crime commissioners. We will return, on Report, to the
matter of one person being responsible for a huge geographical area,
about which various concerns have been expressed by a range of
stakeholders. It would be interesting if the Minister published all the
responses that the Home Office received to that consultation, rather
than only a summary. Publishing such a summary is usually a good way of
hiding the fact that there has not been much support for a
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000033">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> Perhaps the Minister will demonstrate that I am
wrong by publishing all the responses.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The flaw at
the heart of the Bill is that there is no proper check and balance on
the work of the police and crime commissioner. I hear that concern
everywhere I go. The Minister, people who surround the Prime Minister,
and one or two others do not agree, but that does not alter the fact
that the vast majority of people recognise that failure and its huge
bearing on operational independence. Such concern is shared by the hon.
Members for Edinburgh West and for Cambridge, judging by the number of
amendments that they tabled to strengthen the power of the police and
crime panel over the commissioner. The police and crime panel is a
toothless watchdog. We have no draft of the memorandum of understanding
between the commissioner and the constable on operational independence,
which makes the concern even more acute.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People talk
about operational dependence. I remind the Committee that the
Metropolitan police have
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Accountability
is essential to securing an efficient and effective police service, as
is the operational independence of Chief
Officers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Minister will say that he agrees, but those concerns are real. It has
also
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“New
governance structures must have operational independence as their
overriding principle… Chief Officers must have the
‘space’ to do the job they were employed to
do”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Under
the new clause, the Minister could say that he understands those fears
and concerns, and knows what people are saying, but that they have no
need to worry. He could say, “Don’t worry about it. I
know there’s a problem, but the Bill sets up the new model in
such a way that it won’t cause the problem people
think”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister regards the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives
as a dinosaur and its members as people who will not vote for their own
demise at Christmas, people who are out of touch and standing in the
way of the progressive nature of the new Government determined to bring
democratic accountability to policing that has never existed before. I
know all about the idealistic out-of-touch vision of where policing
should go. Let us consider APACE, a body that the Minister listens to
and agrees has greater validity than the Association of Police
Authorities, although the hon. Member for Edinburgh West is a great fan
of APA and often quotes it in support of his amendments. APACE says
that<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“There
will be issues which the commissioner will consider legitimate in their
governance but which chief constables will argue are a matter of
operational independence. Examples include a promise to increase
visibility of police officers in neighbourhoods or the use of sensitive
counter-terrorism powers. Strong governance, together with the
minimisation of potential conflict and confusion, will only be ensured
by high quality and carefully crafted
legislation.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

carefully crafted legislation wanted by

should not be allowed to impinge on that operational side of policing.

point about PCCs elected on a particular mandate to pursue a particular
style of policing and to encourage chief constables to change how areas
are policed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What are we
proposing? The new clause is meant in the spirit of helpful
co-operation to the Minister. I shall put it on the record again that
it is absolutely essential that the draft or even a draft of a draft of
the code of practice defines the responsibilities of the police and
crime commissioner, vis-à-vis the chief constable under the new
model of governance, and that the Minister has confirmed that he is
taking that
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Discussions
are going on at the Home Office and, presumably, with ACPO and others
to develop the draft. I accept that it is not an easy process, none the
less it is an essential process. How much easier it would be for the
House of Commons to debate whether the Minister has found a way of
resolving the tension between the police and crime commissioner and the
chief constable if we had the draft in front of us and understood some
of the principles that he expects to operate under the new model. Will
he give us some idea of the things that will be included in the draft
and tell us about some initial thinking?<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister not just say that he expects the draft as soon as possible,
but say when we can expect the draft of the draft? Notwithstanding our
difference on the issue, I honestly believe that each member of the
Committee is now interested in seeing a copy of the draft. When it
comes to the Bill being debated on Report and beyond, people will want
more information and certainly a copy of the draft of the code of
practice. I understand the problems, but the chief constable of the
West Midlands police authority said that it would help the
Committee’s deliberations and the understanding of those outside
Parliament if the code of practice were
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
code of practice is of such importance, as is people’s concern
about the politicisation of policing. They are worried across the board
that the model will lead to politicisation. Under the new clause, when
the Minister has moved beyond the draft code of practice identifying
the operational independence of chief constables when dealing with
police and crime commissioners, it should be laid before Parliament, so
that hon. Members and Members of the House of Lords have the
opportunity to discuss the draft, with its approval being subject to
the affirmative resolution procedure. That would give some reassurance
to those who have articulated concerns about
politicisation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to be too long, so I will finish with this thought. Surely,
if every police authority, the Association of Chief Police Officers,
the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives, local authorities
and individual Members of Parliament— virtually
everyone—are united in their concerns and worries about the new
model, the Minister should try to deal with that by adopting the new
clause. The alternative is that the code of practice is agreed
somewhere, but what scrutiny will Parliament or any Member have over
it? Parliament should scrutinise it, because it is of such importance
and is such a fundamental part of the new model that the Minister
wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister rejects the new clause, it is incumbent on him to explain
how the draft code of practice will be arrived at, who will agree it
and what process will be followed to bring it about. I say again that I
have 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>respectfully and politely asked the Minister to
accelerate the production of the draft, so that we can consider it. I
cannot say how strongly I feel. I am opposed to the principle of the
Bill, but I feel extremely strongly that the draft should be made
available to us, certainly before Report, because Parliament is
entitled to have it when considering something so fundamental. I
respectfully ask the Minister again to tell us when we can expect the
draft to be put before us, so that we can see exactly what the new code
of practice will
encompass.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Good afternoon, Mr Chope. I accept that that
issue is important, and I understand why the hon. Gentleman has raised
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
on the hon. Gentleman’s point about the number of criminal
justice Bills, it is worth noting that the last Government presided
over 50 such Bills, which was equivalent to creating a new crime every
day between 1997 and 2010. There is, of course, a difference
in approach, because the Protection of Freedoms Bill that my right hon.
Friend the Home Secretary will be piloting through this House is
seeking to do the opposite; to look at where we can deal
with unnecessary legislation and burdens and protect
liberties. It is a fundamentally different approach. This police and
crime Bill does not create new criminal offences; it seeks
to secure greater accountability of policing. We are not introducing
criminal justice Bills in the same way that the previous Government
did.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

pm<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000235">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not let the hon. Gentleman’s description of police and
crime panels as “toothless” go. He is repeating this, but
we had an extensive debate about police and crime panels during which I
noted that the panels now have powers of veto in two key areas, as well
as a lot of other powers. It is not possible to say that a body is
toothless when it has the power of veto over a proposal made by a
democratically elected figure, which the police and crime commissioner
is. That is simply an inappropriate description. It is valid to argue
that it should have more powers, but to say that it is toothless
actually takes a rhetorical attack on police and crime panels rather
too
far.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman raised the issue of what he has called a code of
practice on the operational independence of chief constables, and that
has been an important debate in the Committee. I will not rehearse our
discussion, but I will respond to what he is trying to secure through
this new clause. First, I reiterate my commitment on Second Reading to
introduce what I then called a protocol to govern this relationship. I
said on 13
December:<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Chairman of the Committee suggested that a memorandum of understanding
might be the means by which
that”—<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>in
other words, operational independence—<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“could be
achieved. That is a good idea and the Government have already said that
we will sit down with ACPO once the Bill is enacted and agree an
extra-statutory protocol—I am sure that we can discuss these
issues as the Bill makes progress--that will set out the terms of
agreement to ensure that operational independence is protected. There
is agreement between us and ACPO--it is important that the Opposition
understand this—that we should not seek to define operational
independence in the Bill. That is a matter for case
law.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 13 December 2010;
Vol. 520, c.
769.]<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
although the terms “memorandum of understanding”,
suggested by the Select Committee on Home Affairs, and
“protocol”, which I proposed, having 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 705<a class="bkMark" name="Column705">&#160;</a>
                           </div>discussed the matter with ACPO, have been used
interchangeably—I may, myself, have used the term
“memorandum of understanding”—it is the proposal
for an extra-statutory protocol to which I committed myself on Second
Reading. I was clear then that what I envisaged was that we should
negotiate that with ACPO once the Bill was enacted. I see no reason why
we should not begin work on this protocol. Indeed, I have already
invited ACPO to do so. It is important that we make progress with
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept the force of the hon. Gentleman’s argument that this is
something in which Parliament will take an interest during the progress
of the Bill. I also understand the force of his argument that this is
something that Parliament will wish to debate when it is agreed. I take
both of those points. I cannot commit now to an absolute
deadline for when this document will be agreed. I cannot commit to
that, because it requires us to sit down with ACPO and others. I just
draw to his attention the fact that the memorandum of understanding
in Northern Ireland—governing the new policing
arrangements—has been under discussion for 11 years. I
appreciate that that is Northern Ireland and there are particular
sensitivities, but it is still not agreed. I do not want to be
unrealistic and set an artificial timetable that cannot be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept the
spirit in which the hon. Gentleman tabled the new clause—that it
would help the Government to make progress. It would be helpful to
everyone if we could make progress with the protocol and that is what I
am saying to ACPO as well. I made the concession to have such a
protocol precisely because I wished to reassure ACPO, and others
considering the proposals, that we were serious about ensuring
operational
independence.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to be careful about the content of the protocol and giving further
clarification. I hold to what I said, which is that we are not seeking
to define operational independence in the document. It is right that we
maintain the basic architecture, as we do in the Bill, that chief
constables have control and direction of their forces. That is restated
in the Bill and we do not seek to define operational independence. The
hon. Gentleman mentioned Chris Sims, the chief constable of the West
Midlands force. In his evidence to us, he confirmed that he did not
wish to see operational independence defined. I believe that that is
still the view of
ACPO.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
we need to be careful about how much detail such a protocol should
have. The protocol should clearly define, for the benefit of the
parties concerned, their roles and responsibilities in a way that makes
it easier to understand—rather than having to simply read the
legislation—and which also draws on historical precedent. For
example, such a document might use the words “operational
independence”, which are not actually used in any legislation
about control and direction. As to whether the protocol should go into
any greater detail, that is highly questionable. We would then trespass
into the area of seeking to define a relationship and a mode of
operation that has been debated for many years in the courts.
Ultimately, should there be a breakdown, that would have to be settled
in the courts and I do not think we would get anywhere by
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The various
different parties would like clarity—as much clarity as we are
able to give them. Those parties are not just the chief constable or
the police and crime 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 706<a class="bkMark" name="Column706">&#160;</a>
                           </div>commissioner. There are others in this new
relationship too. The police and crime panels should have clarity about
what their role is and what it is not. There are some who still believe
that a police and crime panel should be about scrutinising a force. The
protocol would have to remind police and crime panels that their job,
as set out in the Bill, is to scrutinise the police and crime
commissioner and his actions. The protocol, therefore, is intended to
be a clarification of the responsibilities and working arrangements of
the new bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another party
to that relationship is the Home Office, and central Government. What
is the role of the Home Office in the new landscape and of other
agencies that form a part of the new national landscape; for example,
the national crime agency? Once we start to consider that they too will
be involved—the national crime agency is not involved yet as we
have not introduced the legislation to create it, though we have
announced that we wish to create it—I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will see that this is not a document that will be drafted
overnight. Equally, it is clearly a document that we need to have in
place before 2012, because that is when those offices will take over
and the elections will be held. That is in well over a year’s
time, of course. I am not suggesting that it should take that length of
time to agree, but it would be unwise of us to be pushed into an
artificial timetable to draw up this document.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
the question of the extent to which the document is affected by debate
in this place and in the other place. I want the hon.
Gentleman to understand that I am not dismissing what he is saying. It
is desirable that Parliament should debate this and that something
should be available for further stages of consideration of
the Bill. I am realistic about not committing to an
artificial timetable that I might not be able to deliver on, because it
does not involve only the Government. That is the
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
we could further consider whether the protocol should be a statutory
code of practice. This is not statutory guidance that then becomes part
of the definition of operational independence itself. That would be a
real problem. We need to be clear on what this is not. We can come to
whether there should be statutory approval of the protocol in due
course, but we are not yet at a place where we can decide that. I am
trying to recognise the force of the points that the hon. Gentleman
makes; I am not dismissing them and I accept that he is making them in
good faith. I want to make rapid progress with ACPO in drawing up this
protocol. I recognise that it wants the protocol, too, and that it
would be helpful to further consideration if we had a draft, but I
cannot commit to a firm timetable at this point. Also, this should not
be a statutory document subject to statutory approval before we have
discussed the nature of the document further with the various parties.
This is an ongoing debate, not the end of the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000064">&#160;</a>

that it is a toothless watchdog, he gets up and explains why it is not.
I did note that he said that it was a valid to comment to make, if
someone thinks that the PCP should have more power, which is exactly my
point—I think it should have more power, so it is obviously a
valid point. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that the protocol
should not define operational independence. That is a generally
accepted point. I also accept his point on not having an artificial
timetable.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000065">&#160;</a>

return to the new clause, I understand that it will take a while to
negotiate and come up with something that is not just a draft, but a
proposal for discussion and adoption. However, in discussions in
Committee, on Report, and when the Bill goes to the other place, we
need to see what it will look like. I am not asking for a document to
be put before Parliament for agreement; I am asking for a document that
will give us some idea of what it will look like and some of the things
that it will contain. That would be helpful for the Minister, rather
than his talking about this nebulous idea of a protocol, without our
being sure of what it is. I know that that will be difficult, and that
it will take time to put together and that there will be disagreement
and debate. If such a proposal can be drafted, however, it would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000066">&#160;</a>

Minister recognises the force of what is being said in the new clause,
which goes to the heart of the Bill—he will know that from his
meetings and discussions with lots of different people. Notwithstanding
the model that he is setting up, if he does not get it right, there
will be problems. He has agreed that Parliament should be involved in a
process—he did not commit himself to what that is—of
discussions on the protocol when it is finally put together. I look
forward to that, because I think it is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I had the
great pleasure of being able to do drugs with the Under-Secretary on
three consecutive days. Two days ago, we discussed the details of the
membership of the Committee, and yesterday we discussed the details of
specific drugs. Today, I would like to talk about some of the
principles underlying the Misuse of Drugs Act
1971.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There have
been a number of discussions over many decades about how successful has
the approach in the 1971 Act been. Has prohibition worked? Opposition
Members raised concerns about that in yesterday’s Delegated
Legislation Committee. The original idea of the 1971 Act was that it
would not take long until the drugs were not around, and that the
supply of such classified drugs would simply stop. That has definitely
been a failure: there is no doubt that there are illegal drugs and
large black markets around. I therefore believe it is time to start
thinking about whether we are going in the right
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
lot of work has been done. One of the previous incarnations of the
Select Committee on Home Affairs produced an extremely good and
detailed report, which suggested that more work should be done to look
at alternatives. Someone called Cameron even sat on that Committee and
supported its conclusions. <em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> He was
younger at the time. There is a time to start looking at what is
happening. I accept that there will be many different opinions in
Committee and outside on what a better solution could be and on how
well the 1971 Act is
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause aims not to push the debate in one way or another, but to
say that there should be an independent assessment. We regularly assess
and review all sorts of aspects of legislation. I think the Minister
referred earlier today to the fact that all legislation is kept under
review, and that should apply to this matter as well. An independent
assessment of the issue might be helpful to understand some of what is
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am pleased
and delighted that, during the debates in the previous couple of days,
the Government made it clear that they are committed to an
evidence-based drugs policy. That has to be an extremely good way to
go. The new clause would reaffirm and strengthen that commitment. It
would put regular reviews on a statutory footing and ensure that they
happen independently. It would also reflect the speed of change in this
policy area. Two days ago, there were comments on the fact that the
Misuse of Drugs Act dates back to 1971, and that various other
provisions are simply outdated. An independent assessment would enable
us to find out and check that the legislation is fit for purpose and
that we have learned from what has happened in the years since
1971.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An
independent assessment would give the Secretary of State a firmer basis
on which to base policy judgments, which would be helpful. We have had
a commitment to evidence-based policy in, for example, advice from the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, but it is harder to do that on
a wider spectrum without large-scale measures. As a result of the
assessment, I hope that we might be able to come up with something that
works better. We might come up with something that would be cheaper in
terms of police and medical support time, and hopefully something that
may further reduce harm. We might not, but it would be worth at least
starting to think about how we could assess the Act to find out

alternative that would help more people around the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Much
as I would love to hear the Minister agree so that we nod the new
clause through, I am not expecting that and I do not plan to press the
measure to a vote. I hope that in somewhat slower time the Minister
will be able to think through the options and think about whether there
is a way for Parliament to start such a review process that would apply
to this and future Governments. We could have rational discussion on
what is the best way, rather than being tied in to a decision that was
made in 1971, which seemed very sensible and appropriate at the time.
It has simply not worked as well as people thought it would at the
time. I look forward to hearing the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000096">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The hon. Member for Cambridge has
raised an important point. I, too, will be interested to hear the
Minister’s response. The hon. Gentleman is asking for an
opportunity to air concerns about drug regulation, which, as he has
pointed out, is rapidly changing and developing. Professor Iversen
referred to 40 legal highs that are out there and being advertised on
the internet, which is a cause for concern. He is not expecting 40
temporary drugs orders to be implemented to try to tackle them, but
that demonstrates the need for us to keep the policy under
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had differences in the past. Under the previous Government, there
was some controversy in relation to Professor Nutt, who published
opinions that went beyond his remit as chair of the council. More
recently, there was the controversy involving Dr Hans-Christian Raabe,
who similarly had some strange opinions that were not entirely in
keeping with his role on the council. Such controversies indicate that
it is right for Parliament to have an opportunity to review the
position on drugs regulations and legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Professor
Iversen asked for certain measures to be included in the Bill,
particularly on the need to consult before a temporary drugs order was
imposed, but that is not what the Government intend. They intend to
deal with the matter through the protocol. But how can Parliament
police the protocol if we do not have an opportunity to discuss how
drugs regulation and legislation are operating? A review reported back
to Parliament would provide that opportunity. After all, there are
areas of public service that we regularly debate in Parliament, and we
get an opportunity to review what is taking
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Cambridge has also highlighted how the 1971 Act was
intended to bring abuse of drugs to an end. Clearly, that has not
happened. There is a difference of opinion about whether we should
legislate at all. The Under-Secretary was present yesterday for the
debate in which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)
expressed some strident views about drugs regulation, and the futility
of it, and how it is not had any implications. In Parliament there is a
wide range of views on how we should approach drugs regulation and
monitor how effective it has been. In his evidence to us, Professor
Iversen suggested that, regarding the classification of drugs under
categories A, B or C and the recategorisation of cannabis
from B to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 710<a class="bkMark" name="Column710">&#160;</a>
                           </div>C, then back from C to B, there was a constant decline in the use of
cannabis from 2000, and the change of classification had no impact at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are areas that we need to keep under review and it is right for
Parliament to do so. Professor Iversen pointed out that drugs are being
manufactured out there that are going straight from the chemistry
laboratory to being advertised on the web for people to use. That is a
concern, so a review of how the legislation is operating with a report
to Parliament would be
beneficial.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
should all be grateful to the hon. Member for Cambridge for proposing
this probing new clause. It is important that Parliament should have
oversight of how things are going with regard both to regulating drugs
and how the legislation is being applied, and to the activities of the
ACMD and its relationship with the Government. That can be strained at
times, as both this Government and the previous Government have
experienced, so I will be interested to hear the Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000102">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have a good relationship with the ACMD.
As a Minister, I have attended two of their council meetings, which is
probably two more than many Ministers have visited the ACMD in years
gone by, although I know that some Ministers have done so. It is an
important relationship, and I value the advice that the council
provides to Government, as reflected in the working protocol that hon.
Members have received as part of the Committee’s considerations.
The way in which we look at that advice underlines the evidence-based
approach. I would stress the importance that is placed on such advice
and the statements that have been made in the Government’s new
drug strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000104">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It might be
helpful if I clarified the purpose of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. For
four decades, that Act has provided the UK with a coherent legislative
framework to meet its international obligations for effective measures
to restrict the availability of drugs and their misuse, to protect
public health and welfare. In our judgment, it is not in the interests
of the UK to challenge its international obligations or to signal its
intentions to depart from them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the UK,
the Misuse of Drugs Act has established a drug classification system
based on drug harm, which is well recognised and which provides the
criminal justice system with a stable and enduring system that
continues to serve its purpose. There is no system of control, or even
a system of structuring drug-harm classifications, that is obviously
better than the current one. The Misuse of Drugs Act also provides for
the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, whose
independent expert advisory role to successive UK Governments in
shaping the UK’s drug policy is widely acknowledged. Its
statutory duty is to keep the situation in the UK under examination in
respect to drugs, and it advises on measures which ought to be taken to
prevent the misuse of drugs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The impact of
domestic and international prohibition policy on levels of consumption
and production globally is key in any meaningful assessment and
analysis of the 1971 Act. We do not accept that meaningful figures can
be ascribed to the likely public and individual health cost or that it
is possible to properly assess the impact of drugs on productivity and
industry or on industrial or

of whether the task is an appropriate use of research funding. In our
judgment, it would not be a proper use of public money. The UK’s
successive drugs strategies have already provided the opportunity to
review periodically and develop our approach to drugs issues on key
aspects of this policy area, such as prevention, reducing supply and
effective recovery from
dependency.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">While
the legislation is important, it is only one part of a broad social
policy area. To make a comparison with some of the issues that we
discussed yesterday, I have to admit that we had slightly more focused
discussions on tapentadol and amineptine, but there was still an
interesting debate on broader social issues, such as education and
public health. Matters need to be viewed in that context, which is why
we are developing an evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness
and value for money of the current drugs
strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000108">&#160;</a>

also recognise the multiple aspects of drugs issues and are examining
the community reintegration of drug-using offenders, for example, as
part of the sentencing review. Proposals to amend the Misuse of Drugs
Act focus matters in a slightly narrow way. I accept the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge, but the underlying issue is
that the area is complex with a number of different factors, and
focusing resource attention on a three-yearly review of the Act is
perhaps going in the wrong
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000109">&#160;</a>

prefer to consider the effectiveness of the new drugs strategy and to
have a proper framework. In so doing, I hope to promote a debate on
drugs policy by looking at the evidence and taking advice from the
advisory council. We want to drive the issue forward and deal with the
three matters highlighted in the drugs strategy of reducing demand,
restricting supply and promoting recovery. I am not seeking to make a
direct partisan point, because the mistake has been happening for
several years. For too long, we have not focused enough on how we can
take people down the path to recovery to lead meaningful lives and be
reintegrated into society so that we do not have the revolving door of
offending, and all the pressures that that puts on communities and the
Government as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000110">&#160;</a>

Christmas on the legalisation of drugs. While I did not agree with the
approach that was taken, it is important that we continue to debate
such matters, continue to challenge and continue to look at the

issues. I agree that the matter is complex, and I very much welcome the
Minister’s helpful focus on recovery and treatment. Several
countries in Europe treat drugs policy principally as a matter for
public health rather than principally a matter for the criminal justice
system. That is an interesting balance, and I am delighted that the
Government are moving more towards the health-based approach rather
than criminalisation. That is excellent.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000112">&#160;</a>

the Minister has such a good relationship with the ACMD and takes its

The ACMD is not completely free. It has certain tasks, and its role is
to issue advice in that direction. Similarly, the strategy is a wider
document. It covers a range of issues, but the approach in the strategy
is underpinned by the legislation around it. I hope, at some stage,
that that will be looked at, and the Minister will be aware of the
serious interest in such matters by Members from all parts of both
Houses. Obviously, I shall not press the new clause to a Division. I am

clause 4 would require police forces, in areas where the late night
levy applies, to provide details of how it has been spent and the
amount of additional policing that has been made available in that
area, and to report that to the local authority. The report would be a
written record that had to be produced each year, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 713<a class="bkMark" name="Column713">&#160;</a>
                           </div>within 12 weeks of the end of the levy period. It
would have to include details of the amounts received through the levy
and spent by the police in providing policing, and details on the
impact of the levy on crime and disorder in the area covered. That is
the purpose of both new clauses. New clause 5 deals with the
responsibility that would be placed on the licensing authority, and it
is almost a mirror to new clause 4 in that the requirements are
identical. The licensing authority would also need to provide a report
within the same time
scale.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clauses are meant to be helpful to the Government, because we know
that the coalition is committed to transparency. It wants to open up
spending and to ensure that everyone is aware of where every penny is
spent. The new clauses fit well with the Government’s intended
aims. They also fit well with the localism agenda, which we have also
referred to at various times in the Committee, and the need for local
areas to be clear about what is spent. The Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government might find the new clauses very
attractive, given his comments about
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
key issue is accountability. As we know from the previous debate, at
the moment a licensing authority has an opportunity to decide whether
it wants to have a late night levy in its area. We have discussed how
it would cover the whole geographical area of that local authority.
Under the proposals set out in the Bill as it is drafted, if a late
night levy is taken out by the licensing authority, there is no
obligation to ensure that the money raised is spent in that area, or is
specifically used to fund additional policing or resources for that
area. It almost seems as if the late night levy will go into the
general pot of expenditure for the police, the local authorities and
other bodies that might be able to access that
funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clauses attempt to achieve transparency, so that people can see how
much money is raised by the late night levy. The impact assessment
mentions that between £9 million and £15 million might be
raised by it. If the new clauses are accepted, a clear figure for that
would be identified, as would specific details on how much policing is
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can see the Minister of State looking at me over the top of his
glasses. He will recall that we had an interesting discussion about how
much additional policing will be provided from the late night levy. In
that earlier debate, I requested information about how the 70:30 split
specified in the Bill for the distribution of the levy had been arrived
at, and what the evidence base was for the decision. We had a rather
heated exchange about that, and I am still unclear how the Government
reached that formula. It would be helpful if the Minister enlightened
us today on that 70:30 split.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clauses would allow us to be clear about what the late night levy will
deliver for businesses and organisations that will have it imposed on
them. How much will the levy deliver for them? How many additional
police officers will they see in the area of the levy? How many
additional cleaning services, for example, will be provided by the
local authority with the money that is allocated to it? Those are the
key reasons why the new clauses would be helpful to the Government and
to the late night levy. They will provide the transparency that I am
sure the coalition wants to see in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000124">&#160;</a>

consideration of the Bill, I will try to be helpful to the hon. Lady
and positive towards her approach. Although I absolutely agree with the
need for transparency, I hope that I can explain how transparency
already operates in this case. Her approach strikes me as bureaucratic,
given the measurements, the mechanisms, the reporting and the factors
that she has outlined. There is a risk that a chunk of a late night
levy would be spent just complying with all the new reporting
requirements. I take her principal point on transparency, and I will
set out why her approach to the administration of the late night levy
is not
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have discussed police and crime commissioners at great length in
Committee. The money given to the police from the late night
levy will go into the police fund for the force area, held by the local
PCC. The police and crime panel will be able to request any documents
of the PCC, such as details of the police fund, that are not
operationally sensitive and do not compromise national security. They
may be scrutinised publicly, and may include any documents on spending
money earned through the late night levy. The ultimate accountability
of the PCC will be at the ballot box, where the public will cast
judgment on how effective they have been in delivering effective
policing. The transparency processes already in place will provide an
important check and
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000126">&#160;</a>

adopting the

the services that the licensing authority intends to provide with the

consulted on as part of the process. After the consultation, the
authority will write to all affected premises to inform them of its
final decision. As part of the process of even establishing the levy,
the local authority will set out, in quite a lot of detail, the
relevant aspects that will sit alongside. Therefore, having a further
mechanism would be bureaucratic in a way that the levy was not intended
to be; it is intended to be quite speedy and efficient. The
consultation process will draw out a lot of the important transparency

                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clause relates to fees that local authorities levy on people who make
licensing applications. It is drafted to allow licensing authorities to
determine the amount of fee to be paid at a local level. Under the new
clause, authorities would be required to publish the amounts of such
fees and would need to have regard to any guidance produced by the
Secretary of State. The proposal also relates to temporary event
notices, on which we have debated amendments at length.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The licensing
authority would deal with a licensing application, and the proposal
attempts to ensure that the full cost of such applications is recovered
by the fees that are charged. The new clause takes account of instances
in which local authorities and local licensing committees decide to
waive fees in specific circumstances, so it would provide
discretion.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000140">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposal
is all about the localism agenda and the approach, which I understand
the coalition Government are taking, to ensure that local authority
areas make decisions that best fit their particular needs. When I was
thinking about proposing the new clause, I was conscious that local
authorities in the country are different, with different experiences of
the late-night economy and licensing. Areas such as Camden or
Westminster are very different from ones such as Scunthorpe, and they
have very different needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Returning to
the issue, this is about reflecting that and allowing flexibility. I
understand that the Government have stated that they are committed to
enabling licensing authorities to set licensing fees based on full cost
recovery. As the Bill stands, however, there are no new fee structures
included in any of the clauses setting out further regulations. That is
particularly disappointing given that some of the Bill’s
proposals will add new burdens on councils. Including a new fees
framework in the Bill would be a quick and simple way to bring about
the implementation of the localism agenda and of full cost
recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the current economic climate, there is a real imperative to make this
important change as soon as possible, bearing in mind the major cuts we
are seeing to local authority budgets, with some local authorities
facing 28% cuts. A new fees framework would also simplify the need for
the late night levy that we have just been discussing and that we
debated earlier, as money could be recovered specifically by a local
licensing authority in relation to the late night situation in its
area. The new clause would provide flexibility and a framework for
giving licensing authorities a discretion to set appropriate fees for
their area, and to reduce or waive fees for individual premises or
events, such as charities or those benefiting from small business rate
relief.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister consider the precedent on fees at the cost-recovery level,
which is set out in the Gambling Act 2005? We have referred to that Act
before—it is very helpful, because it is in force and we can see
how it is operating. Under the Gambling Act, there is a discretion to
set the fee level within nationally set bands. I know that the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport have in the past undertaken a
high-level review of the premises and licence fees set by licensing
authorities in 2007-08. The Department’s overall conclusion from
that review was that there is no justifiable concern, from either an
industry or licensing authority perspective, about the level of the fee
maximum set by DCMS. It sounds as though local authorities were acting
reasonably within the bands; they were not all rushing to get to the
highest possible
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the introduction of the new system appeared to be working well around
the country and has produced a good spread of premises-licensing fees
among licensing authorities with no obvious systematic setting of fees
at the maximum. On that basis and with the experience of the Gambling
Act, it is worth considering how the new clause could help the localism
agenda that the Government want to promote. It would also help deal
with the varying and very difficult circumstances around the country.
The new clause is worthy of consideration in relation to the
Government’s approach to licensing.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I broadly agree with the intentions behind
the hon. Lady’s new clause. As she may know, in my response to
the consultation I said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
intend to enable licensing authorities to set licensing fees based on
full cost recovery”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since then I have been
working closely with colleagues across Government to be sure that we
achieve that aim in a way that is fair to all sides. There is
widespread agreement that the current fees do not cover the legitimate
costs of licensing authorities in discharging their functions under the
Licensing Act 2003. Licensing fees have not been increased since the
Act came into force. I also agree that setting a fee nationally that
meets full cost recovery for authorities throughout the country,
despite different costs and circumstances, would be a difficult task
that certainly does not fit with the Government’s approach to
localism. However, at a later stage, I intend to table an amendment
introducing locally set fees based on full cost
recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the new clause has a similar aim to our proposals, it contains some
features that we would not wish to pursue. I will explain. First, the
new clause enables only some of the fees under the Licensing
Act 2003 to be set locally—those relating to
premises, licences and temporary event notices. However, fees relating
to personal licences and club premises certificates should be set
locally as well, because costs for such processes are also subject to
local variation and potential deficits against income. To omit them
would be
inconsistent.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the new clause contains no provision to enable constraints to be
imposed by the Secretary of State on a licensing authority’s
ability to set fees. A nationally set cap on fee levels is needed,
albeit I acknowledge the hon. Lady’s point, and fee payers would
be reassured that licensing fees are not a blank cheque. I intend the
cap to be set in regulations, after consultation on the appropriate
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
the new clause contains provision for the licensing authorities to
waive any fee. Such an unconstrained power would, potentially, not be
fair if fees were to be based on cost recovery. That is because the
waiver by an authority of one or more fees would mean that it was
choosing to incur a cost and recouping it from other fee payers. To
illustrate the point, if the authority waived 25% of its fees,
hypothetically, it would be clearly inequitable for other fee payers to
fund the
deficit.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured that we intend to
follow through on our commitments. I recognise the spirit in which she
moved the new clause but, given my reassurances and the issues I have
raised about it, I ask her to consider withdrawing it, in the knowledge
that we are dealing directly with the issue and hope to introduce
changes to the Bill
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Local authorities often seem to cross-subsidise

discussed the issue of health and the current view that we ought to
have more regard to the health of people in this country, and to the
effects that alcohol can have on it. At the moment, our licensing
objectives are silent on public health and its
promotion.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would allow a fifth objective within the Licensing Act: to
protect and improve public health. That fits well with clause 104,
which we discussed right at the beginning of the licensing section,
which added primary care trusts and local health boards as responsible
authorities, so that they could make their views clear to licensing
authorities when deciding on licence applications, renewals and
reviews. We debated how difficult that would be, because health was not
one of the objectives that must be considered by licensing authorities,
yet the PCT and the health board can comment on the other
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000159">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clause ties up nicely with clause 104. It makes some sense of the
important role that PCTs and local health boards could play. The
coalition Government are devolving public health responsibilities to
local authorities, so a lot of attention will be paid to this area.
People are very concerned about health and alcohol. We only have to
look at <em>The Guardian</em>
                           <em> </em>to see the headline, “Alcohol
policy in tatters as health experts revolt”. We all have an
interest in ensuring that we have the best possible policy on alcohol
and that we give information and support to people who drink. We also
need to take steps to encourage sensible drinking.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s current position on alcohol is rather confused and
muddled. Putting this new clause into the Licensing Act 2003 would send
a clear message that the Government are serious about ensuring that
licensing authorities take health into consideration when making
decisions on applications. That is why we tabled this clause. The
Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 makes health one of the objectives that
licensing authorities have to look at. It is interesting to note that
Scotland has looked at other issues relating to alcohol and the
policies that we ought to pursue. It would send a clear message if the
Government were minded to accept the new clause and make health one of
the considerations that must be taken into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000161">&#160;</a>

not agree in any way, shape or form with her characterisation of the
Government’s approach to alcohol and how we are seeking to bear
down on the harms caused by it. Those were, in large measure, caused by
the manner in which the previous Government took to this. Our accident
and emergency departments and police have to respond to the problems of
alcohol. That is why changes to licensing are proposed in this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
that note of discord, I will seek to strike a note of accord on the
importance of public health. We see merit in making health a material
consideration under the Licensing Act. I know that it has been
customary in other sittings to refer the hon. Lady to the reply I gave
her some moments ago, but in this case, it was some days ago. This
point came up last Thursday. I
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
see some merit in adding prevention of harm to health as a licensing
objective, but we want to do it in a considered way, alongside wider
work to address the harms of alcohol to health, which is why
we indicated in our consultation response that we did not intend to
legislate at this stage but would consider the best way to do so in the
future.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Police

                        <p>I repeat
those words because they directly relate to this new clause. It needs
careful consideration because, if it was introduced without that care,
it might not be applied in a focused manner. One might seek to argue,
for example, that because a particular part of a local authority area
suffered from high levels of deprivation or health harm, one could
apply licensing policy differently there. Is that an appropriate way of
doing things? Such issues need to be examined carefully when applying
an approach, which we broadly accept and acknowledge. The Government
consider the issue to be important, but it needs to be examined more
closely in the context of developing public health policy within local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000164">&#160;</a>

I agree with the sentiment behind the new clause—continuing the
discussion that we started last Thursday—the Government believe
that the issue requires further consideration and work, which we will
do. I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw her new clause in the knowledge
that the Government are focused on it and seized of it. We are
considering it further in the context of promoting public health and
addressing the underlying issues and health and social harms that are
caused by

responsible officer is of the opinion that the offender has failed
without reasonable excuse to comply with an alcohol monitoring
requirement the officer may arrest the offender and must cause an
information to be laid before a justice of the peace in respect of that
failure.(4) In paragraph 21(1)

“or under paragraph
4A”.’.<p class="tabbed">

                           </strong> I tabled the new clauses and new schedules to
introduce a pilot compulsory sobriety scheme in London. They would
introduce a new sentencing power through an alcohol monitoring
requirement—AMR. The new power would allow courts to impose a
requirement on an offender to abstain from alcohol and be regularly
tested to ensure compliance as part of any community or custodial
sentence. If the offender failed the test, there would be a quick and
coherent process of apprehension—immediate arrest, a night in a
police cell and reappearance at a magistrates court.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clauses and new schedules are compatible with the scope of the Bill, as
they would provide the courts with additional powers on alcohol-related
behaviour to complement those of police and licensing authorities. They
are also consistent with the objectives of the Bill.

                           </div>The AMR would ensure that alcohol-related violence
was tackled not only at the point of sale and supply, but by changing
behaviour through clearer punishments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">London
experiences disproportionate levels of alcohol-related crime compared
with the rest of the country. That poses a huge threat not only to the
safety of Londoners but to their general well-being, especially for
those who live and work in boroughs with prominent town centres. It
also has huge cost implications for the Metropolitan Police Service,
the NHS and borough budgets, diverting increasingly scarce resources
away from those with genuine need. Although several sentencing powers
and penalties are currently available, alcohol-related crimes remain a
huge problem and the number of alcohol-related hospital admissions is
increasing. The alcohol monitoring requirement could result
in rehabilitation for the individual, reductions in repeat offending
and the use of custodial sanctions and, most important, a wider impact
on society as it would reaffirm that alcohol is not an excuse for
criminal
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
consumption of alcohol aggravates and perpetuates many forms of crime.
The proposal could be taken further and used to address town centre
violence. A compulsory sobriety scheme could offer support in many
cases of violence against women and girls, especially domestic
violence. Based on keeping the offender at home with a family and in
employment, such a scheme could work in relevant cases, and might go
some way to improve conviction rates, where victims are concerned about
their partner or the father of their child going to prison. It would
also be beneficial on the release of an
offender.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
sum up, the three objectives of the alcohol monitoring requirement are
to reduce the number of alcohol-related incidents, especially violent
incidents; to reduce the cost of alcohol-related crime to statutory
services, including police, health and local authorities; and to
support a long-term shift in public attitudes to the use of alcohol by
making a clear statement about the acceptability of behaviour
surrounding alcohol consumption, supported by clear
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000181">&#160;</a>

processes?<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that the legislation makes it clear that
the test would not be foisted on any individual. An individual would
have to accept the requirement to undertake the sobriety test. It would
not be compatible with someone who had alcohol problems; that would
simply be a waste of time. But it would be enforceable on an individual
for whom alcohol played a significant part in their behaviour,
especially in domestic violence and other alcohol-related
crimes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000183">&#160;</a>

associated with applying a South Dakota-type scheme under our law.
Officials from my Department and the Ministry of Justice will continue
to meet him to explore his suggestion, because we want to encourage
local initiatives and to work with local agencies and the

will be important to develop a clear business case for the proposal,

then consider how the aims of such a scheme might be accommodated into
sentencing legislation, ensuring it is proportionate and fits with
British structures. So we will continue to discuss with the
Mayor’s office the benefits and best practice of the scheme
which has operated in South Dakota, recognising that there are
differences between the American and British legal systems. We will
therefore consider how a sobriety regime could be instituted here and
what benefits it might

you and Mr Benton for your chairmanship of the Committee. I thank those
who have worked so hard behind the scenes to ensure the smooth
operation of the Committee. I thank the Clerk, of course, and the
people who have been painstakingly and patiently transcribing our
proceedings and keeping abreast of things, even when the Opposition
spokesman and I were not. We are very grateful for their help. I thank
the Doorkeepers, who did not have too difficult a job to do. For very
obvious reasons, Government Members were present at all times to ensure
that we were able to carry the day. I would particularly like to thank
the Home Office officials who have been here to support the Government.
They have worked very hard to ensure that we have been in a good state
with the Bill, which is a priority in government legislation. They have
been a great support to Ministers. I thank them very much for their
work. It is hard work for officials to keep up with the pace of
amendments that are tabled. They often have to work very hard and very
late, and I am grateful to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to thank all members of the Committee for the way in which we have
discussed the legislation. I know it is a commonplace at the end of
Committee proceedings to say, “We have had a good debate and we
have considered the matters well,” but I genuinely think that we
have had a good debate. We have got to the heart of the issues in the
legislation in relation both to policing and to the alcohol provisions.
The Government are pleased that the integrity of our proposals has
remained intact. Nevertheless, we have been able to make a number of
improvements to the legislation. Ministers have conceded that important
points have been raised, including by the Opposition, and we have
undertaken to go away and give further consideration to them. Having
said that, we have had full consideration of the issues. We have not
been constrained by time, nor have we had to curtail debate. Its
constructive nature will be helpful to those outside this place who are
concerned about the issues and want to ensure that we are addressing
them fully, so I thank Committee members for the way in which we have
debated them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would
particularly like to thank the lawyers. Where would we have been in
consideration of the Bill without the depth, expertise and, indeed,
quality of the free advice that we so regularly received? Even though
some of the advice was not legible, it was nevertheless immensely
gratefully
received.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
meet here in this Committee room—I just noticed towards the end
of our proceedings—under the portrait of Sir Robert Peel, a
great Conservative Prime Minister before the idea of Liberals was
invented. He was a social reformer, a repealer of criminal law and also
a Home Secretary and founder of modern policing. Sir Robert
Peel’s
dictum,<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the

                        <p>and the principles that
he established, by which we have policing by consent and a professional
modern police force, are ones to which we and the police force continue
to subscribe today. I regularly evoke Peel’s principles as we
find our way into describing how modern policing should operate. It
seems fitting and timely that we should conclude our Committee
proceedings under Sir Robert’s watchful
gaze.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000212">&#160;</a>

the Minister has just said. I particularly thank you, Mr Chope, and the
other two Chairs, Mr Streeter and Mr Howarth, who chaired a
couple of sittings when you were away on other business, for the way in
which you have chaired the meetings. I join the Minister in thanking
all the staff who have helped proceedings of the Committee, including
the Doorkeepers and <em>Hansard</em>. I also mention Mr Rhys, who has
been very helpful with the amendments that we have tabled and with
giving professional advice on ensuring that they at least conform to
the rules and regulations of the House. I also thank

been extremely helpful at times to have two minutes to find where I am
while they make a contribution. I also thank them for the validity and
rigour of their contributions. I am grateful for the help of all my
hon.
Friends.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with the Minister on the quality and standard of our debate.
There is a big difference between us, but I have always thought that we
can get angry about the principles of Bills, without getting angry with
each other. That usually makes a huge difference. When I first started
teaching, I once called a pupil, “You stupid kid,” and it
caused a bit of a row with the parents. I was told by an older teacher,
“Don’t call the kid stupid, call what they did
stupid.” The point I was going to make was exactly the same, but
not with the word
“stupid”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
all sincerity, I have appreciated the way in which the Minister has
conducted the debate and discussions with me, and I hope that we have
improved the Bill. This is slightly tongue in cheek, but I thank the
Liberals for demonstrating something that I had never seen before. They
moved amendments, and then voted against them. That was amusing to us.
The hon. Members for Edinburgh West and for Cambridge are new Members
of Parliament, but have contributed significantly to the deliberations
of the Committee. Having slightly taken the mick, I should say that
their contribution was important and interesting. I also thank the hon.
Member for Northampton North for his advice all through the proceedings
of the Committee. He must be good at it, because at the end the
Minister started to try to steal my legal brief.<a class="bkMark" name="11021789000215">&#160;</a>

scrutinised the Bill and the two Whips have worked extremely well to
ensure that we had time to discuss it. Hopefully, the scrutiny that the
Committee has given it, whether we agree with all the Bill or not, at
least helps to improve some of the detail. We look forward to
continuing the debate and discussion on
