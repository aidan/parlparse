                           </span> It is a
pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr Gale. I have a few brief questions
on clause 21. I would appreciate clarification of the
Government’s thinking on using vehicle excise duty as an
environmental tax rather than as a revenue-raising measure. What
consideration has been given to using VED as a way of changing
behaviour, perhaps encouraging people to use cars that are more
environmentally friendly? Will the Minister explain why more was not
done in the Budget to favour fuel-efficient family cars? Does she hope
that more work will be done on that front in future?<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In November
2010, the Institute for Fiscal Studies published the long-running
Mirrlees review of tax reform. As part of its work on motoring taxes,
the review questioned whether a tax on vehicle purchase might be more
targeted than the annual vehicle excise duty payment. Have the
Government given any consideration to that suggestion, and does the
Minister agree that it might better achieve the aim of encouraging
people to buy cars that are more environmentally friendly?<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I turn to the
question of evasion. In its 2009 report on VED evasion, the Department
for Transport estimated that it cost about £34 million in
2009-10. The overall rate of unlicensed vehicles in stock in Great
Britain was estimated at 0.7% in 2009, which is equivalent to about
244,000 vehicles; that was down from 1% in 2008. The evasion rate for
motorcycles was estimated to be 3.2%, which was up on the previous year
but down on the year before that. Has the Treasury assessed the impact
of those rises in evasion, and what steps are the Government taking to
prevent it?<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The freeze on
VED for heavy goods vehicles will be a welcome boost for many hauliers.
However, some will not benefit; I shall deal with that when we come to
clause 22. If the measure was intended to help industry by reducing
distribution costs, is there not a case for freezing VED for light
goods vehicles or vehicles used by smaller businesses? Many small
businesses increasingly suffer the same pressures as the haulage
industry, particularly as a result of fuel costs, as we have heard in
previous sittings. Has the Treasury explored the possibility

                           </div>of freezing duty on light goods vehicles or other business vehicles, to
help small businesses and traders not in the haulage industry whose
vehicles are integral to their livelihoods?<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000023">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It
is a pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Mr Gale. First, I shall
explain what the clause does. I shall then respond to the questions
posed by the shadow Minister. The clause makes changes to vehicle
excise duty rates for cars, vans, and motorcycles, with effect from 1
April 2011. Motoring is an essential part of everyday life for families
and businesses. The Government recognise the real difficulties being
created by record pump prices. As part of a package to ease the burden
on motorists, we announced in the Budget that vehicle excise duty rates
for 2011-12 would increase only in line with inflation; and to support
hauliers, duty rates for heavy goods vehicles will be frozen for the
10th successive
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause changes standard rates for cars purchased after 2001 in line
with inflation, and by up to £25 more for higher-carbon emitting
cars. Rates remain unchanged for the cleanest cars that emit less than
120 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre. More than 80% of cars
purchased after 2001 will pay up to £10 more, and of these
almost half will pay only up to £5
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about vehicle excise duty being used as an
environmental tax. The way in which it is structured can bring about
positive behaviour change. She is right to point out that technology
does change; the Government therefore need to keep a watching eye on
VED to ensure that it can continue to be successful, in relation to its
potential to have an environmental impact. However, we also need to
learn the lessons of recent years. The previous Government attempted to
environmentalise VED for pre-2001 cars in 2008. Of course, that was
incredibly controversial because the change would have been
retrospective, and the people who owned those vehicles could not go
back and change their behaviour. We are clear that ensuring that a tax
is structured to drive positive environmental behaviour is one thing;
ensuring that that can happen on the ground, and that people can change
their decisions of the future is
another.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
brings me to another point that the hon. Lady made, about the Mirrlees
review. This is an interesting issue. We have talked about switching
taxation away from economic goods, such as people working, to economic
bads. Clause 21 changes first-year rates, chargeable on the first
vehicle licence taken out on a new car, in line with inflation.
First-year rates are intended to influence up front the purchasing
choices of drivers buying brand-new cars by acting as a signal at the
point of purchase that people can save money by choosing lower-carbon
cars. In line with the EU emissions target for new cars, the rates
remain zero for cars emitting less than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per
kilometre, and the highest-emitting new cars pay the top rate of
£1,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady is right to point out that that could have a positive
environmental effect, but there are two caveats to that. One relates to
the level of the first-year rate in relation to the overall purchase
price of a car. Although we can send some signals and encourage
behaviour, there is also a need to understand that consumer choices
about cars will be driven largely by the overall 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 243<a class="bkMark" name="Column243">&#160;</a>
                           </div>price of a car. The second point is that it is important to consider
other areas. For example, we have made changes to the company car tax
regime to encourage a more environmentally minded decision by people
who are getting a company car. That is important because many company
cars feed into the second-hand car market. I can reassure the hon. Lady
that we do see the potential in this area for driving positive
environmental
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
higher rate of duty for cars and vans registered before 1 March 2001
increases by £10, and the lower rate by £5. Low-income
households are less likely to own a car, and those that do are more
likely to own cars registered before 2001. The owners of about 40% of
those cars will pay only £5 more. Furthermore, clause 21
increases the standard rate of duty for vans first registered from 1
March 2001 onwards by £10. The reduced rate for vans achieving
early compliance with European air quality emissions standards
increases by £5. Rates for motorcycles will also increase in
line with inflation. Those motorists will see an increase of no more
than £4. The hon. Lady has asked what we are doing to support
people with smaller vehicles that they may use for their business. I
think that I am right in saying that we have frozen van fuel benefit
charges, for example, so we are working to support people who need
their vehicles for their
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are easing the burden on motorists at this time of record
pump prices. We are providing support worth £1.9 billion, which
includes a cut in fuel duty, the abolition of the fuel duty escalator,
and its replacement with a fair fuel stabiliser. As part of that
package, we are maintaining rates of VED in real terms to support
motorists and the sustainability of the public finances, while
incentivising and promoting the development and purchase of low-carbon
vehicles. Hauliers have been benefiting from frozen duty rates since
2001. In 2011-12, heavy goods vehicle rates will be approximately 30%
lower in real terms compared with 2001. We will continue to support
hauliers in this
climate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000030">&#160;</a>

attract a different rate of vehicle tax, which takes effect from 1
April 2011. That means that not all HGVs will enjoy the freeze in
vehicle excise duty that was confirmed in clause 21. I accept that the
rate for HGVs without road-friendly suspension has to increase to meet
the EU’s minimum rates of taxation, but there is concern in the
haulage industry that such an increase comes at a time when it faces
pressures as a result of high fuel prices. Has the Treasury held any
discussions with haulage companies on the increase in duty for HGVs
without road-friendly suspension? Does the Minister know the number of
HGVs that will be affected by that rate of duty, and how much revenue
is the change likely to generate? Finally, what impact will the new
rate of

Given that drivers are being made redundant, that companies are
struggling to compete and that the industry is not in a position to
reinvest its shrinking profits in more eco-friendly HGVs, is this
really the right time to introduce such a
change?<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000034">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause ensures that UK vehicle excise duty
rates for lorries are consistent with European Union minimum tax rates
for lorries. The background to this clause is that the EU minimum tax
rates for lorries are based on the understanding that there is a cost
to making good the wear and tear caused to European road infrastructure
by goods vehicles weighing more than 12
tonnes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">European
Union member states, including the UK, agree and accept minimums below
which tax rates for lorries should not fall. The agreed tax minimums
have been set in euros. As the hon. Lady mentioned, some of the
UK’s vehicle excise duty rates for lorries have fallen below the
agreed tax minimums due to exchange rate fluctuations; those rates are
based on pound sterling to euro exchange rates on the first working day
of October 2010, in line with our obligations under European law. Our
aim is to ensure consistency with European rules on minimum rates of
taxation while causing the least impact to lorry owners.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
introduces new exceptional rates of vehicle excise duty for 10
categories of lorry for which VED has fallen below the agreed European
Union tax minimums. The rate increases for those categories of lorry
are no greater than is required to ensure consistency with European
rules on minimum rates of taxation. The affected categories are limited
to lorries that do not have road-friendly suspension fitted. The
majority of the affected categories are lorries that have been awarded
a vehicle excise duty reduction because they met reduced pollution
requirements early. In most instances, lorry owners will continue to
receive a reduction from the standard rate, even after the application
of the exceptional rates, as exceptional rates are set as low as
permitted by European law.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked about the impact. No more than 12,000 lorries will be affected by
the change, but the number could be fewer than that, as lorries fitted
with road-friendly suspension will not be affected. Based on the 12,000
ceiling on the numbers of lorries affected and the minimal level of
rate increase, the anticipated financial impact on the industry is no
more than £500,000. The clause is designed to satisfy the
requirements of European law. A failure to observe European law can
lead to European Union member states being fined, and we wish to avoid
that
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about consultation. Representatives from the leading
industry associations were consulted while we were developing the
measure. In fact, informal discussions began in early 2010. They
contributed to the design of the draft legislation, which was published
in late 2010. We had input from the Freight Transport Association and
the Road Haulage Association, which represent large fleet and smaller
independent lorry operators. Both organisations agreed that the
industry would accept a transparent solution that enabled us to meet EU
tax minimums. Their input was useful in allowing the
Government to develop such a solution, and allowed us to provide
certainty that existing rates will be maintained for the vast majority
of lorry owners.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000039">&#160;</a>

want to make some broad points about what the Government have said
about their tax policy-making framework, including improving the
predictability and stability of the tax regime. To further those aims,
in November last year the Government released a road map for
corporation tax, which aims to set out the principles that will guide
reforms to the corporation tax regime, a timetable for those reforms
and the details of how the Government will consult business in
introducing those reforms. The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury has
said that a reason for the road map is to signal that Britain is open
for
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
key objective of the Government is, as the Prime Minister said a year
ago, to be the greenest Government ever. We do not, however, have the
same clarity or predictability in the area of green taxation as we do
on corporation tax. For example, the coalition agreement states that
the Government will increase the proportion of tax revenue accounted
for by environmental taxes, and, according to the 2011 Budget report,
there will be a small cut in environmental taxes this year, but
increases in future years. In evidence submitted to the Environmental
Audit Committee, however, the Chartered Institute of Taxation said that
there was a need for greater consistency from the Government in how
they defined environmental
taxes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000046">&#160;</a>

year, in response to a written question from the hon. Member for Denton
and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne), the Economic Secretary appeared to imply
that environmental taxes covered the climate change levy, aggregates
levy and the landfill tax only, as well as revenues from the EU
emissions trading scheme. However, the Chartered Institute of Taxation
points out that the Office for National Statistics said in a report
last year that, in addition to those taxes, environmental taxes also
covered fuel duty, VAT on duty, renewable energy obligations, vehicle
excise duty and air passenger duty. We have already had some debate
about whether those are environmental taxes that are designed to alter
behaviour towards more environmentally friendly
practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000047">&#160;</a>

Government want to be the greenest Government ever, it is important
that green thinking pervades all the work that they do. It is
important, therefore, that, when looking at issues such as air
passenger duty and fuel duty, at least consideration is given to the
impact not only on individual behaviour but on how, as a country, we
can help meet our targets for reducing
emissions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, the Chartered Institute of Taxation says that there should be a
broader definition of environmental taxes than that apparently implied
by the Economic Secretary when she responded to the written question
from the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. In the Budget report, air
passenger duty is included under the environmental taxes
heading—it was not mentioned in the Economic Secretary’s
answer—but fuel duty is not. I would appreciate some clarity on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
institute says that if changes to fuel duty are included in the
definition of environmental taxes, they are in fact being cut every
year to the end of the forecast period. Does the Minister agree that a
key aim of fuel duty is to encourage more efficient use of fuel, and
the use of public transport for environmental reasons? Does that not
qualify it as an environmental
tax?<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
a separate paper in February this year, the Chartered Institute of
Taxation also called for greater clarity on the principles that would
guide the Government on green taxation. It does not believe that an
entirely new set of principles needs to be developed, but it would like
the general principles of good taxation, such as fairness, certainty
and minimising the compliance burden, to be modified and applied to
environmental taxes. The institute has called for a statement of those
principles to be included in tax legislation, and has said that it
would welcome a document from the Government along the same lines as
the document on corporation
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to put the clause into the context of the Government’s
wider programme on green taxation and the environment. In February, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs published its vision
for sustainable development. According to the
document—“Mainstreaming Sustainable Development”
—the Government want sustainable development to become central
to the policy of all Departments, and not to be seen as a niche issue
for one Department. However, a report for Friends of the Earth has
recently pointed out that the Treasury is by far the most important
Department in terms of delivering green goals, and at the moment it
does not seem to have taken that vision on board. The report charted
the Government’s progress

                           </div>on its green objectives, and found that on most of
them it had stalled, or little progress had been made. It agreed with
the Chartered Institute of Taxation that there was no clarity on how
the Government would deliver their coalition agreement promise of
increasing green taxation as a proportion of overall tax take. It also
said that if fuel duty was considered to be an environmental tax, it
would be difficult for the Government to achieve that
promise.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000055">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change set out the carbon
emissions targets for industry, but without concrete measures from the
Treasury those targets will not be reached. Have the Government
considered producing a road-map document for environmental taxes, given
their coalition agreement objective? Are they committed to providing
clarity and predictability for businesses on green taxation, given the
aims set out in their new tax policy-making framework last year? What
is their assessment of progress towards the coalition

are absolutely committed to being the greenest Government ever. In
fact, one of the first decisions that we implemented was to cancel the

of my time as first-term MP in opposition had been spent campaigning
against it. I recall vividly a conversation with the now Leader of the
Opposition when he was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate
Change, and waved through the plan to increase the number of runways at
Heathrow. That would have had a hugely detrimental effect on carbon
emissions. I have no doubt that he recalls our conversation, when I
begged him to see sense. He did not, but fortunately the electorate
did, and we now have a Government who realise that a third runway would
have been a green

                        <p class="tabbed">In response
to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Bristol East about what
the green agenda means to the Treasury, she is right that we want to
see environmental tax form a bigger part of the tax base. I was before
the Environmental Audit Committee yesterday talking about how we plan
to approach the matter. We held workshops with a variety of
stakeholders earlier this year, to get their views on the principles
from which we should work. We will wait to see what the Environmental
Audit Committee report proposes for how it should be approached. My
sense is that we need three principles. First, that the Government make
it explicit that the tax is intended to address environmental issues.
Secondly, that the tax should be obviously structured in order to
achieve a behaviour change. Finally, that it should be about achieving
a change in company or personal behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
interesting to go back to the measure on road tax in 2008. That
included a change to pre-2001 cars that the Chancellor said was about
the environment, so technically that first principle was met. It was
structured to bring those cars into the banded system, so technically
the second principle was met. However, it had no ability to change
behaviour, because it was about taxing a retrospective decision. My
argument at the time was that it was not actually an environmental
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Bristol East asked, interestingly, about our limited list of
environmental taxes. I decided to look at how other people had defined
environmental tax. The hon. Lady is right that the Office for National
Statistics has a definition and the OECD has one. I wondered what my
definition would be from that starting point. Interestingly, I took
exactly the same view as the hon. Lady’s colleague, the right
hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms), in his response to my right
hon. Friend the Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), when he asked
for a list of what the previous Government saw as environmental
taxation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I recognise
that the next step we need to take is to set out the baseline. The hon.
Lady will be aware that the current basic list of absolutely agreed
environmental taxes was increased by two in the Budget. One is the
carbon price floor and the other the carbon reduction commitment. The
proportion of the tax base that shifts from non-environment to
environment under that initial definition will go up from about 0.6%
this year to 1% by 2015-16, when the carbon reduction commitment and
the carbon price floor start to kick in more. We are moving in the
right direction, but we will continue to work on this agenda. We will
make a statement on how we plan to approach the issue. I hope that that
addresses some of the hon. Lady’s concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000066">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
debate about fuel duty, and I challenged the Environmental Audit
Committee for its views. There are environmental aspects, because as
fuel duty and the price of fuel rise, people are more likely to think
that they cannot afford to use their cars, but it is certainly

mind. Fuel duty has been in place for years; it started long before
carbon emission and road pollution went to the top of the agenda. To my
mind, it is an environment-related tax, but it is not, per se, a purely
environmental tax. The Environmental Audit Committee will doubtless
have something interesting to say about it, and I look forward to its

including noise, dust and visual intrusion, as well as having an impact
on biodiversity. The levy is designed to ensure that the price of
aggregate reflects those environmental costs. At the same time, we

Government were seeking approval from the European Commission to extend
the scheme under state aid rules, but I understand that the current
state aid approval has been annulled by a European Court judgment,
which has led to the scheme being suspended. Would the Minister update

in our debate on clause 23, the coalition agreement sets out the
Government’s objective of green taxes rising as a proportion of
total taxation. I appreciate that the decision on the aggregates levy
may have been unavoidable, but it will have an impact on the
Government’s attempts to achieve that objective. What assessment
has the Treasury made of the effect of that setback? Should we expect a
rebalancing of green taxation towards other environmental taxes, or
have the Government suspended that aim while the matter is being

                        <p class="tabbed">Alongside
the aggregates levy, the previous Government introduced the aggregates
levy sustainability fund, which aimed to reduce the environmental
impact of aggregate extraction. It provided funding for projects that
research ecosystems affected by aggregates extraction; repair and
conserve sites of historic importance; and improve the land and
environment impacted by extraction. As a result of the
Government’s spending review last year, which hit the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs particularly hard, the
Department has discontinued that
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000078">&#160;</a>

the previous Conservative Government introduced landfill tax in 1996,
they also created the landfill tax credit scheme, which the Labour
Government later reformed into the landfill communities fund. That
allowed landfill operators to divert the proceeds of landfill tax
directly towards environmental projects, and it was considered a key
part of achieving the stated objectives of landfill tax, which included
encouraging more sustainable waste management practices. Although the
aggregates levy sustainability fund was not funded in the same way, it
had the same purpose of reinforcing the objectives and benefits of the
aggregates levy. It ensured that a proportion of the revenue from the
aggregates levy—around 10% since 2003—was spent directly
on restoring and improving the environment in areas that were affected
by aggregates extraction.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000079">&#160;</a>

agree that the aggregates levy sustainability fund was an important way
of reinforcing the declared objectives of the aggregates levy? Have the
Government made any assessment of how the levy’s objectives will
be impacted by the loss of the fund? Did the Government consider any
alternative ways of providing at least some of the funding for the

lorries as a result of the extraction of aggregates, but the community
is not reimbursed for that with road schemes. We see a precedent in
Northern Ireland for allowing local areas some sort of compensation.
From a revenue perspective, we can also see greater scope for the
Treasury in the proposed increase to the levy. I fully appreciate that
Treasury Ministers will never be willing to give up revenue in a
Committee in this way, but will the Minister at least ask her officials
to write to me, setting out how much revenue has been raised in
Cambridgeshire from the aggregate levy over the past three years, and
what the forecast is, given the proposed expansion? Will she also ask

September 2010, the European General Court annulled state aid approval
for the aggregates levy credit scheme in Northern Ireland,
which the previous Government put in place. The Government accordingly
had to suspend the scheme with effect from 1 December 2010. That scheme
provided an 80% relief from the levy to quarries in Northern Ireland
that committed to making environmental improvements to their
operations. Following the scheme’s suspension, those quarries
became liable for the full levy rate of £2 per tonne, instead of
the relieved rate of 40p per tonne.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000085">&#160;</a>

Ireland Government to do exactly that. In the Finance Act last year,
the previous Government announced and legislated for an increase in the
rate of aggregates levy to £2.10 per tonne from 1 April 2011.
However, given the suspension of the credit scheme, it would be
inappropriate to go ahead with an increase in the rate of the levy,
because it would place further pressure on quarries in Northern
Ireland.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000086">&#160;</a>

would freeze the rate of the aggregates levy at £2 per tonne.
That would affect 786 traders registered for the aggregates
levy—mainly quarry owners—and would result in a loss to
the Exchequer of £15 million in 2011-12. Freezing the
rate in such a manner is an extraordinary step taken in extraordinary
circumstances. To ensure that the levy continues to achieve its
long-term environmental objectives, the rate needs to increase in line
with inflation. It is our intention, therefore, to go ahead with the
rate increase to £2.10 on 1 April 2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000087">&#160;</a>

while evasion must be stopped. What assessment has the Treasury made of

mentioned, the landfill communities fund is an essential part of the
landfill tax. It ensures that, in effect, a proportion of the revenues
raised from the tax are diverted directly into environmental projects,
which strengthens the ability of the landfill tax to achieve its
environmental goals. In 2010, the previous Government increased the
value of the landfill communities fund in line with inflation, and the
current Government have done the same in this year’s Budget.
However, they have said that future decisions on the fund’s
value will be dependent on the level of unspent funds held by
environmental bodies. What assessment have the Government made of the
level of unspent funds held by such bodies? What representations has
the Minister had from them since the announcement of her decision?
Finally, does she not agree that if the Government increase landfill
tax according to the previous Government’s plans, but then
increase the landfill communities fund by a lesser amount, the tax
risks being seen as merely revenue raising, rather than as a tax with

reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill. Since 1996, when the tax
was introduced, the amount of waste sent to landfill has more than
halved; it has gone from 95.8 million tonnes to 43.9 million
tonnes. The benefits of that reduction are twofold. First, the economy
benefits from our making better use of valuable resources, rather than
simply tipping them into a hole in the ground. Secondly, greenhouse gas
emissions from decomposing waste are reduced. Due to the reduction in
waste sent to landfill, direct emissions from waste in 2011 are
projected to be 2.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent lower
than they would have been if there had been no change. Furthermore, the
UK is within the targets for the reduction of municipal waste sent to
landfill set out in the landfill directive, meaning that there is
little risk of incurring the substantial penalties that would be

issue is important, because if waste is not sent to landfill, it must
go somewhere else. To provide certainty for the waste management
industry, so that it can invest in infrastructure for alternative means
of waste disposal, the Government announced in the Budget last year
that the standard rate of landfill tax would increase by £8 a
tonne each year until 2014. That landfill tax escalator will help the
Government in their goal to reduce the amount of waste sent to
landfill, and in working towards a zero-waste economy where all
resources are fully valued, both financially and
environmentally.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government also confirmed that the standard rate of landfill tax would
not fall below £80 per tonne between 2014 and 2020, so
businesses can have the confidence to invest in new waste treatment
facilities, safe in the knowledge that it will not suddenly become
cheaper in the future for waste to be sent to landfill
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000103">&#160;</a>

works, and where they do not. We had a debate last week about using
taxation of high-strength alcohol to tackle problem drinking. My hon.

of us have about fly-tipping in our constituencies, yet I note the

                           </strong> The Government are extremely interested in
understanding how tax can affect behaviour—far more interested,
dare I say, than the previous Government were. I understand that the
hon. Lady was not in Parliament then, but I was. One of the problems
under the previous Government, particularly in relation to green tax,
was their highly controversial plans on road tax. People who had bought
a car before 2001 suddenly faced huge rises in their vehicle excise
duty, apparently to make them change their behaviour when it was
impossible for them do so because they already had the car. That sort
of approach really damaged people’s trust in green taxation. I
think what the hon. Lady is saying is that we probably need to learn
from those issues and, as I would see it, huge mistakes, and realise
that if we are to change behaviour, it has to be behaviour that people
have not exhibited yet. We cannot change past behaviour. That is a
philosophical debate that she may want to have, but for most people
that would seem like common
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000105">&#160;</a>

vague as to be impossible to answer. I have no doubt that my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Education has his own interesting
views on the use of the tax system to change behaviour. We have already
debated some important clauses on alcohol, which I hope the Committee
welcomed, that do just that. We continue to learn, as many Governments
across the world do, about the best way to use taxation, among other
policy measures, to get the right sort of behaviour and to achieve the
right policy objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
complication is that everywhere is different. One of our debates within
the EU—I do not want to stray too far from the amendment
paper—is that different countries and different communities have
a different sense of what is fair and a different propensity to change
their behaviour. One of the added complexities is that there may be no
consistent approach across countries that we can adopt. It will be up
to individual countries to understand their electorate and how they can
work with the grain of their electorate’s human nature, using
policy to change behaviour. The Conservative party has always
understood that, because we have understood that freeing the lowest
earners from income tax, for example, means that the link between
effort, reward and work is strengthened. Perhaps I should now make some
progress on the clause after that interesting
interlude.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000108">&#160;</a>

to expand on what the Minister has been saying about the effect on

is so far that the measure is having an effect on the closure of

                           </strong> I have outlined to the Committee just what an
impact the landfill tax has had. Clearly, we have not got rid of
landfill—there is still landfill—but since the measure
was introduced in 1996, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the amount
of waste going to landfill. There is a broader debate, which we
probably should not have now, about people’s carbon footprint
and general amounts of waste, as well as what proportion of that waste
can be landfilled.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000113">&#160;</a>

allocation reflecting the costs of waste disposal for local
authorities. I am pleased to report that as the shadow Minister, the
hon. Member for Bristol East, mentioned, we have increased the value of
the landfill communities fund, in line with inflation, to £78
million. That means that communities in the vicinity of landfill sites,
such as that of the hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts, will continue
to benefit from spending on projects that improve the environment in
their

secondary objective, similarly vital, of stimulating growth—and
we still want to make progress on our ambition of being the greenest

different objectives; they are all ultimately related. We have
increased the value of the landfill communities fund in line with

changes to the landfill tax are taking place at the moment, and I will
update the Committee on those. The Government are in the process of
devolving the landfill tax in Scotland and, following the conclusion of
proceedings on the Scotland Bill, the landfill tax will be disapplied
in Scotland from 2014. The Scottish Government will be given a power to
introduce their own tax on waste disposed to landfill and will be able
to set the rate or rates of that tax as they wish. I am sure that that

                           </strong> As the Committee knows, before my hon. Friend came
to the House, he ran a number of successful businesses and knows only
too well the difficulties that red tape causes. Once again, I genuinely
want to offer the hand of friendship to the Minister on this particular
clause. I want him to come back on Report with a well-thought-out and
detailed proposal that meets the Minister’s objectives and that
we can support, subject to discussions. If, as he says, he wants a
simpler and more stable tax system, let me refer him to amendment 105.

not. We support a number of anti-avoidance measures, and this is one of
them, but the representations to which I shall refer and which the

the clause in the past week alone, show that the clause is not simple

support. Let me clarify my point for Members on the Government Benches,
because it is them and the Minister whom I must convince. I do not
disagree with the Minister’s objectives in clause 26 or schedule
2, but I worry about the lack of simplicity and practicality, and about
whether he is starting from the wrong end of the telescope in trying to
achieve his objectives. My offer to him is simple. We have tabled an
amendment to delete the clause, and it would be welcome if he would
withdraw the clause and schedule 2, and introduce on Report, which is a
maximum of seven or eight weeks away—it will be at the end of
June or in early July—a redrafted clause and a simplified
schedule that provide clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Skipton and Ripon made some good points. We can have
discussions outside the Committee, as we always do if we can, as I did
when I was a Minister, and as I am sure the Exchequer Secretary will,
now that he is a Minister. We can come to an agreement not to oppose
the clause or the schedule on Report, and we will have clarified them
for the many outside agencies that have made representations to me and
to other Committee Members, and addressed their
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000141">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, the provision is a
dog’s breakfast. If it were not, the Minister would not have
tabled 88 amendments to the clause. We are all busy people, and I defy
anyone in the Committee who is scrutinising the Bill to be able to read
all 88 amendments, to cross-reference them to the 59 pages
of the schedule and to the clause, and to put them into context for the
people we represent and the businesses that will have to deal with the
Bill when it achieves Royal Assent in a few months. I defy anyone to
tell me what those 88 amendments mean
downstream.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">All
I am saying to the Minister is that if there is a need for 88
amendments after a consultation, which ran from December until the
Bill’s publication on 29 March, can he give me a guarantee that
he will not table any more amendments to the provisions? This Committee
is about scrutiny and deciding whether to implement a policy that
impacts on people’s businesses and lives; the approach that he
has taken is not a good way to make policy and
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000143">&#160;</a>

amendments are a new development in the civil service or, from his

Also, one of the difficulties that I am sure officials face is that
they are starting not with a blank sheet, but a complex tapestry

it might be 35 or 37. During my 12 years as a Minister, I probably took
through 21 or 22 Bills, and I can genuinely say to the hon.
Gentleman that I never once tabled 88 amendments to a single clause. I
cannot speak for other Ministers in other Departments, because
ministerial life tends to mean that an individual focuses on what they
are doing themselves. However, I cannot recall ever tabling
88 amendments to a single clause after a period of
consultation and, indeed, after trumpeting the fact that the
consultation was
positive.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000145">&#160;</a>

why that is absolutely not true. His erudition is very well known to
the Committee, Mr Gale, as I am sure you are aware. I should also say
that it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. Having
done a law degree many years ago, which I accept was a complete waste
of time for myself and the educational institution involved, I feel it
is my duty to point out that, from memory—as a former law
student, one retains things in one’s mind—in 2008 alone,
the Government tabled 226 amendments to the Finance Bill. I cannot
quite remember; it may have been 227 or
225.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000148">&#160;</a>

does, it allows one to read a note passed by someone else. My arts

the dilemma that we face in scrutinising legislation in an appropriate
way when so many amendments have been tabled, the situation is
eminently preferable to having 234 amendments tabled to a Bill on

suppose that this is the best time for scrutiny. However, from a
drafting perspective, I wonder whether we should not just scrap the
whole schedule and bring it back amended in the ways proposed by the
amendments. Otherwise, it is difficult for us to try to scrutinise it
properly, line by line, amendment by
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000150">&#160;</a>

The hon. Member for Watford and I have had some fun. There may have
been 225 or 226 amendments to the Finance Bill in 2008. I do not know;
I was doing something else at the time. I expect that if the hon.
Gentleman looks at the <em>Hansard </em>for that day, he will find that
the Minister or one of his colleagues made a point on the subject at
the time.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Proposing 88
amendments to the schedule indicates that the Minister is not confident
that what he published on 29 March meets the objectives he set. I have
had representations—I shall read them out in a moment—to
say that even post-amendment, the schedule and the clause will not do
what the Minister wants. The provisions will still be excessively
complex for the people who wish to interpret them. That is a real issue
that we need to
explore.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000152">&#160;</a>

clauses were published for comment on 9 December 2010. At that stage,
the draft clauses were only 20 pages long. Although we appreciate that
HMRC have listened to the concerns raised and made extensive changes to
the draft clauses, the fact remains that the legislation in the
original Bill has grown to 59
pages.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000191">&#160;</a>

10 May 2011 the Government tabled 15 pages of amendments to the Finance
Bill provisions. These were published the following day and we have not
had time to review them in detail, but our initial reading is that
although they make various improvements they will add significantly to
the length and complexity of the Finance Bill legislation….We
doubt these latest amendments will be the end of the changes, and
believe that further amendments will be required as further problems
emerge. We appreciate that power is given under s 554X to make further
exclusions by way of statutory instrument but this is a wholly
unsatisfactory way of drafting tax

                        <p>Our
discussion is about clause 26 and the schedule as published—59
pages of legislation. That has to be interpreted by small businesses
and others across the country to ensure that they do not contravene the
legislation, either deliberately or accidentally. It is complex, and it
will grow with the inclusion of the amendments that were tabled last
week. The institute
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has a duty to answer those criticisms in light of the
amendments he has tabled; the institute has expressed its concerns.
When the dust has settled and the schedule and the clause are approved,
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will have to monitor and
ensure compliance. I worry about the complexity of those issues for
HMRC staff across the country and in the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East. They will
have to look at whether the rules are being monitored in an effective
way. When the Bill is given Royal Assent, small businesses will have to
agree to the regulations, understand them, implement them and make sure
that they are not contravening them. The Bill is currently nothing like
simple enough to achieve those objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11051951000167">&#160;</a>
