Prentice:
						</b> The list of amendments is daunting, but they
have been drafted in response to amendments tabled in the other place
on behalf of the Law Society. They create new powers over sole
practitioners similar to existing powers over regulated recognised
bodies. They require solicitors who want to run a sole practice to
apply for endorsement to do so and to be subject to specific regulatory
requirements. They also ensure effective powers over sole
solicitors&#146;
employees.</div>
					<a name="07062765000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendments is to provide the Law Society with enhanced powers to
regulate sole practitioners and their employees. They bring many of the
Law Society&#146;s powers in relation to sole practitioner firms into
line with its powers over partnerships and LLPs, and sole practitioner
firms are often as large and as complex as recognised bodies. Overall,
the amendments will ensure that all legal services practices are
regulated according to the same principles. The consumers of such
services will receive the same level 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>of regulatory protection, regardless of whether they obtain legal
services from a sole solicitor or a recognised
body.</div>

							<a name="07062765000461"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> Schedule 16 rewrites the Solicitors Act 1974.
It contains a great deal, including measures about practising
certificates and the registration of holders. The issues include fees
payable for practising certificates, measures about the roll or
register as evidence and unqualified persons acting as solicitors. In
fact, the schedule is a complete rewrite of the 1974 Act. When it comes
to such large schedules, we have to take the Government at their word
and give them the benefit of the doubt. We must also consult outside
organisations, which is exactly what we have
done.</div>
					<a name="07062765000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have responded satisfactorily to all the probing amendments tabled in
the other place. Sarah Rivers of the Solicitors Regulation Authority
has said:</div>
					<a name="07062765000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
SRA is broadly pleased with the substantial number of amendments that
have been made to modernise our regulatory powers throughout the course
of the Legal Services Bill&#146;s passage in Parliament. We are
especially grateful to the Conservative Front Bench, in tabling these
technical amendments, for their help to achieve this.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062765000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SRA is particularly grateful to Lord
Kingsland and Lord Hunt. There is only one outstanding issue. I am
grateful that the Government have listened, because these are very
technical and complicated amendments. As I have mentioned, we are
effectively rewriting an earlier piece of legislation&#151;I would
not recommend doing that on a regular basis. We could almost have had a
completely new solicitors Bill, but the Government decided to do it a
different way by virtue of this
schedule.</div>
					<a name="07062765000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 307 seeks to provide for a longer period in which a solicitor can
be suspended pending referral to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.
The Government have made it clear that there are problems with the
amendment. It is the only amendment that we have tabled that the
Government have not been able to act on positively. Will the Minister
tell us why that
is?</div>
					<a name="07062765000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is really a
congratulatory effort on my part. I would like to thank the Minister
for listening to organisations such as the Law Society, the SRA and
other bodies, which have had a constructive and imaginative input into
the debate. As a consequence, we have a better and more effective
schedule.</div>
					<a name="07062765000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that I was only going to talk for four minutes, I have now spoken for
three minutes and 45 seconds. I will sit down, but once again, I want
to thank the Minister and her team for listening very carefully and
responding in a positive and helpful way&#151;I wish that Ministers
would do that the whole time. Fortunately, they do it from time to
time, and when they do, we must congratulate and thank
them.</div>

							<a name="07062765000462"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I would like to reassure the hon.
Gentleman about amendment No. 307. We felt that it was not appropriate
to extend the suspension from 12 to 18 months. Obviously, the SRA needs
to be equipped to protect consumers from solicitors who have been
convicted of fraud or serious crime. The amendment, however, might have
had the undesirable effect of reducing incentives for the Law Society
and the tribunal to deal with disciplinary cases swiftly. The SRA
accepts that our concerns about long delays are important, and it has
asked that the amendment is not pressed.</div>

							<a name="07062765000463"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has
said, this group and later groups of amendments concern the substantive
law that governs the professions. The Law Society has promoted some of
the changes, which the Minister picked up on. Have other people who
might have an interest been consulted? We must be satisfied that there
is broader confirmation that the Government are going in the right
direction and that there are not any objections. I have understood the
main objections, but I do not pretend to have my head round every
single implication of all the changes to all the other Acts.</div>
					<a name="07062765000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department has consulted
people other than just the Law Society; it is satisfied this group of
amendments and the other groups contain nothing that will cause anybody
difficulty; and the amendments are all improvements to put the relevant
houses in good
order.</div>

						</b> Again, I hope to speak briefly to the
amendments, which are technical. They would provide the scope of the
Law Society&#146;s powers, so that they were properly applied to the
correct persons. The power to rebuke and to fine is an important one,
and the approved regulators must be able to take appropriate action
against those whom they regulate. The powers in the amendments would
allow the society to act quickly and effectively when its rules are
breached and when there is a finding of professional misconduct against
a solicitor.</div>
					<a name="07062765000408"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The intention is that
more minor rule breaches and professional misconduct would be dealt
with by the Law Society, while the solicitors disciplinary tribunal
would determine the more serious cases. The SDT would have an unlimited
power to fine, but the maximum penalty for the Law Society would be
&#163;2,000.</div>

					<a name="07062765000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment (a) would make a
technical change to Government amendment No. 78. It would change the
obligation to publish from one that would need a positive step to be
taken to an obligation to consider that it would not be in the public
interest to publish. It is a subtle but important change and would
result in an automatic presumption that things would be put in the
public domain rather than it having to be proven in each case. It would
assist good working to ensure that, unless there was good reason not to
do so, everything would be put in the public domain. I am sure that the
Minister will be fully convinced by the logic of my argument.</div>
					<a name="07062765000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment (b) would allow the
variation by a tribunal of decisions of the Law Society. That is
important, because if the tribunal has to decide yea or nay&#151;all
or nothing&#151;there would be more danger of a clever solicitor
making a defence that was partially convincing. There would thus be
more likelihood of the tribunal saying no, even on a technicality,
because it would have no option. In such instances, the tribunal ought
to be able to make a halfway determination. It strikes me that the
balance would otherwise always be with the clever or technical
argument, which could dominate tribunal decisions, whereas allowing a
variation would mean that the tribunal could determine whatever it
chose, based on all the facts.</div>

						</b> I imagine that we agree that there ought to be
transparency in the Law Society&#146;s decision making process. In
many circumstances, it will clearly be in the public interest to
publish once a fine or rebuke has been issued. However, I am not sure
that it should be the default position for disciplinary action of that
type to be published automatically. As it happens, I am not convinced
that amendment (a) would achieve automatic publication unless it was
not in the public interest, because it states that the Law Society
&#147;may&#148; publish.</div>

hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, I shall explain our view. We believe
that due consideration should be given in each case. However, it is
more appropriate and probably more proportionate to take action as set
out in Government amendments Nos. 78 and 94, in which it is anticipated
that the Law Society would at the time of the determination consider
whether or not it was in the public interest to publish. That leads to
the idea that it may not necessarily be appropriate to publish
determinations.</div>

					<a name="07062765000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely
agree with that position, but Government amendments Nos. 78 and 94
already provide the tribunal with a large number of powers, which can
be exercised on appeal. They amount to the ability to vary or replace
every aspect of a decision that has been appealed. That includes the
power to vary the penalty and to make such an order as it sees fit.
That gives the tribunal the scope to</div>

					<a name="07062765000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 94 also contains a range of powers that is sufficient to
consider an appeal, including the power to vary the amount of the

scope, cover the proper concerns that my hon. Friend raised. I

							<a name="07062765000478"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The amendments ensure that the provisions in the
Bill and in five other statutory provisions are consistent with the
common law on legal professional privilege. The Bill already provides
that the clients of ABS firms should have the same degree of LPP
protection as the clients of any other type of legal service provider.
That was set out in what used to be subsections (3) to (7) of clause
182.</div>
					<a name="07062765000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
both the Bar Council and the Law Society raised the possibility that
certain terms in that provision might not reflect fully the current
state of the common law of LPP. The wording reflected similar wording
used in other statutory provisions that ensure LPP protection for
clients of certain legal services providers, such as recognised bodies
and licensed conveyancers. We have looked carefully at that and have
decided to modify what is now clause 191, as well as the other relevant
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07062765000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments essentially do two things. First, they remove the reference
to legal proceedings in the relevant provisions, because the law
provides clients with LPP protection in certain circumstances outside
of legal proceedings. Secondly, they expand the reference to
communication, because again the law provides clients with LPP
protection in certain circumstances, regarding not only communications
but documents, material or other
information.</div>
					<a name="07062765000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore
the amendments ensure LPP protection for the clients of ABS firms, so
that firms do not operate at a competitive disadvantage compared with
other types of provider. They essentially modify five earlier
provisions about LPP. Those provisions ensure protection for the
clients of other legal service providers, licensed conveyancers, bodies
recognised by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers, bodies recognised
by the Law Society, patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys and certain
authorised practitioners under the Courts and Legal Services Act
1990.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>
					<a name="07062765000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Together the amendments ensure
that clients of all of those providers have the LPP protection
equivalent to the clients of solicitors. That means that both types of
clients are equally protected, no matter where they go for legal
services, and no type of provider will get a competitive advantage over
other providers as a result.
</div>
					<a name="07062765000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey asked about consultation. We have
consulted not only the legal professions but the consumer
organisations, too. I express particular thanks to both the Bar Council
and the Law Society. I suspect that most people would say that that
would be an unusual thing for me to do, but in this instance they have
been extremely helpful. The Bar Council even went so far as to provide
opinion from a legal expert on the subject, which was shared with us,
and that opinion informed our reconsideration of the amendments. The
Law Society has also provided valuable input. It is a good example of
how a co-operative approach can achieve the desired result, for which I
am grateful to them
all.</div>

						</b> The Minister kindly said earlier that she would
consider the issue of people not giving information about their

it an offence for an unqualified person to pretend to be a barrister.

the moment? I think that everybody assumes that it is.</div>
					<a name="07062765000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding is that it is
an anomaly that we have never legislated to make it an offence for
somebody to present themselves as a barrister. We have such legislation
for solicitors, doctors and other professions, so the clause is a
welcome addition. This is one of those rare occasions when creating a
new offence is a good idea. There are many Government new offences that
some of us find OTT, but this might be a useful little addition to the
legislation.</div>

achieved only once the LSB and the OLC are fully established. If it is
too early to make a decision about the claims management regulation

Although it is working incredibly efficiently, we should give the

							<a name="07062765000491"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> This clause gives rights of audience to employees
of housing management bodies. Like the Minister, my hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Yardley, and others, I represent large numbers
of council tenants and the tenants of housing associations and trusts.
As we know, housing officers go to the county court on a regular basis
to act as if they were a lawyer on behalf of the landlord, to deal with
rent arrears, breaches of tenancy, possession actions and other
matters.</div>
					<a name="07062765000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
spotted something in the clause that I had assumed was covered, but it
is not abundantly clear, as there are lots of different arrangements
between housing authorities and other housing providers. There are
arm&#146;s length management organisations and other such part-tenant
management co-operatives, estate management boards, tenant management
boards and others, and the council may have an arrangement with a
housing association or housing trust that uses the premises on a
short-term basis for homeless people or in cases of domestic
violence.</div>
					<a name="07062765000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
definition in new section 60A(7) of the County Courts Act 1984 cover
all those bodies? It does not look as if it will, if one considers the
definition of a housing management body. However, I am happy that the
Minister has agreed to consider that technical matter, which could be
clarified on Report. I am conscious that there has been a huge
expansion in those sorts of bodies, and I guess that the proposal is
intended to give authority for those issues to be taken up in the
county court.</div>
					<a name="07062765000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
should know what authority a person has when they go to court. I have
had cases in which people are not sure how far down a management tree
the responsibility rests, which has led to some fairly junior people,
who did not appear to have the authority to deal with those matters,
pitching up at county courts. If there is to be fair but effective
disposal of matters in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>county courts, they should not be dealt with by someone who, to put it
bluntly, does not have any more authority than doing what they were
told when they left the office. I am keen that we should not go so far
down the management tree that we are authorising people who do not
understand how the county courts and the profession work. There is a
practical concern in dealing with all the cases. I would be grateful
for a response on whether we should authorise such junior people and
whether all eventualities are
covered.</div>

Gentleman. The rights that are outlined in this clause will be
exercisable only by those employees of housing management bodies that
have an agreement with the local housing authority under section 27 of
the Housing Act 1985. They might be former employees of the local
authority or housing officers who lost their rights under the local
authority when they were transferred over. We have worked with the
Department for Communities and Local Government on this, and it has
confirmed that the measure covers the huge variety of people mentioned
by the hon. Gentleman, but I will double-check to be
sure.</div>

							<a name="07062765000494"></a>Simon

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 243, in
clause 194, page 106, line 41, leave
out subsection
(2).</div>
					<a name="07062765000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleagues will
no doubt be glad to know that this is our last amendment. However, it
is a slightly heavy and serious point that does not have the levity of
some of the other issues. The clause as it stands means that solicitors
who are employed in the Government service are not required to comply
with the same regulatory system as other solicitors. In the interests
of fairness and equity, I want to put the case made by the Law Society,
which is that that exemption is no longer justified. The amendment
would take away the exemption that allows solicitors in the Government
service to operate without a practising certificate, which is a strange
anomaly.</div>
					<a name="07062765000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a core
principle that all those who are subject to regulation should
contribute to the cost of regulation. Ministers have said that before.
In response to the Joint Committee, the Government said that the basic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>principle is that those being regulated should bear the cost. As far as
the cost of regulating solicitors is concerned, the present position is
that all solicitors providing legal services in private practice in
England and Wales are required to hold and pay for a practising
certificate and thus contribute towards the cost. Solicitors also have
to qualify to get that certificate.</div>
					<a name="07062765000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Solicitors in commerce and in
industry and in local government are required to have practising
certificates if they undertake reserved activities, or if they are held
out as solicitors. For example, if Southwark council&#146;s legal
department sent someone to negotiate a contract with a private
developer as a solicitor, they would require a practising certificate.
Government solicitors, however, are wholly exempt from the need to hold
a practising certificate in England and Wales, even if they do the same
job as local government solicitors. Scottish solicitors must comply
with the same rules as those in private practice or local government.
The anomaly applies to England and Wales and dates from the 19th
century.</div>
					<a name="07062765000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
unclear why the exemption was originally provided. No logical and
persuasive reason has been given, either in the other place or earlier,
why the exemption should continue to exist. Given that we are
performing a portmanteau tidying-up of the professions&#151;we have
just agreed to a schedule dealing with such things&#151;and putting
the legal services into a new structure, it seems entirely anomalous
that one little reserved, rather self-interested pocket of people in
Government will be protected from the same modernisation and
streamlining affecting everyone
else.</div>

						<a name="07062765000495"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I support the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s view. Does he share my concern that it is
important for the Government to take an appropriate lead in tidying up
old anomalies? Is he aware of the rebuttal that the Government may well
give&#151;that Government lawyers do not hold client money? There is
a way to deal with that&#151;by having an amount proportionate to the
amount for a practising certificate. It could be less, as in other
sectors, rather than being completely thrown away on
principle.</div>

							<a name="07062765000496"></a>Simon

						</b> I am grateful. As the Committee knows, the hon.
Gentleman is a solicitor. That is the only argument that has been
advanced&#151;that Government lawyers do not take client money as
private practice solicitors do. He is absolutely right. Nobody is
saying that there should be one flat fee for every solicitor doing
every job in England and Wales. There is absolutely an argument for a
differential
charge.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062765000498"></a>
								Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Yes. There is a sliding scale, and Government
solicitors could be incorporated within it. I understand that the
Government have already recognised implicitly in other contexts the
indefensibility of the present exemption. When the CPS was created in
the 1980s, prosecuting solicitors who had worked in local government
and held a practising certificate there transferred to the CPS, a
central Department. The Government recognised that it was unjustifiable
that that change of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>employer should mean that those solicitors did not have to hold
practising certificates, so the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985
specifically required CPS solicitors to hold a practising certificate.
That remains unaltered
today.</div>
					<a name="07062765000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, when
the Bar Council&#146;s practising certificate fees came into force as
a result of the Access to Justice Act 1999, no provision was made to
exclude Government barristers from the need to hold a practising
certificate. Both recent changes have integrated practitioners working
in the Government service, so there is a discriminatory anomaly
relating to solicitors in the general Government service, who are
clearly benefiting from something unjustifiable that involves other
anomalies, too. Barristers who work for the Government must pay;
solicitors who work for Government need not.</div>
					<a name="07062765000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be regarded as
justifiable, I suppose, if the Government claimed&#151;they would
have a mini-riot on their hands if they did&#151;that the solicitors
who work for them are second-class solicitors. However, those people
are not employed as second-class solicitors. They are employed as
solicitors, and if one speaks to them or inquires who is in the
Department, one is told that they are Government
solicitors&#151;solicitors for the Department. They are subject to
the same professional discipline as others and to the same rules in
other respects.</div>
					<a name="07062765000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will know that the matter arose in the House of Lords. She
replied to the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate by
saying, &#147;They don&#146;t hold client money; therefore, there
isn&#146;t a regulatory risk.&#148; However, we are not arguing
about the risk factor. We are arguing about the fairness factor and the
need for equal treatment of everybody who contributes to the great new
edifice of this regulatory regime. The issue is about ensuring that
people pay in to fund the process of qualifying to be a solicitor and
continue their professional education, which all solicitors are
expected to do to advance their careers. It is also about ensuring that
the people who administer and enforce the rules of conduct are paid
fairly and covering the cost of monitoring and enforcing compliance
with the rules of conduct, which is a service that all other solicitors
pay for. Government solicitors are governed by those rules, so they are
getting the service and paying nothing, which cannot be
right.</div>
					<a name="07062765000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
solicitors have regularly to advise on the lawfulness of particular
actions, when they want to achieve the objectives of their political
masters, which is entirely understandable. To all those to whom I have
spoken, to the Law Society and to me, it seems important that those
solicitors are subject to the same professional duties&#151;including
duties to the court, because they could appear in court&#151;to help
to ensure that they give independent legal advice, rather than just the
advice that their bosses wish them to give. That is to say that the
courts would expect a Government solicitor to be just as honest as any
other solicitor when it comes to matters such as duties to the court or
conflicts of interest. The courts would not give them any special
dispensation because they are in the Government service.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>
					<a name="07062765000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the other place, the
Attorney-General argued that there would be no public benefit from
removing the exemption for Government solicitors and that it would only
put up the Government&#146;s costs. If Government solicitors are
effectively regulated, as they should be, and are subject to the same
professional responsibilities as their colleagues in private practice
and in commerce and industry, the fact that the Government provide
proper training does not negate the point that the basis of employment
should be the same. Most firms provide in-house training for their
solicitors during their employment. The blunt truth is that the
Government are getting solicitors on the cheap, or solicitors in
Government service are getting their opportunity to be solicitors on
the cheap ahead of everybody else, which cannot be good or fair. The
rest of the profession thinks that some protectionism is going on,
which is not good. Let us bear in mind also that people from other
walks of life come in to and go out of Government
service.</div>
					<a name="07062765000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
address the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point. The Law Society has
said to the Government that it is inappropriate for the same practising
fees to be applied to all sectors, given that there are significant
differences between the ways in which different sectors regard the use
of regulatory resources. In the case of Government lawyers, the cost of
practising certificate fees arguably should be less, for the reasons
given by the hon. Gentleman. There are certain activities in which
there is no risk at all, but that does not mean that they should be
wholly exempt.</div>
					<a name="07062765000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
present law does not allow the Law Society to charge differential fees,
so the Law Society cannot charge Government lawyers less. The
amendments to the Solicitors Act 1974 that we have been discussing
would give the Law Society that power. The requirement to hold a
practising certificate would not lead to an unfair burden being put on
Government lawyers of the future or on Departments, which in practice
pay for that certificate. That would mean that there would be no
anomalous, unfair exemption.</div>
					<a name="07062765000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry that this is a heavy
point for the last evening of the Blair Government, but it is
important, because there is a sense of injustice. I am grateful for the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s support and hope that I can bring other members
of the Committee with me. I also hope that the Minister understands
that this is not a matter that I, or others, feel can be left to lie.
This is the Bill in which we need to correct this
problem.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> Nevertheless, the argument is that the
solicitors do not deal directly with the public. They are subject to
the employment conditions applicable to their individual Departments. I
am not aware of evidence of any serious failure in the
Government&#146;s legal services, although no doubt some hon. Members
could think of some. The head of that service is diligent in performing
his duty to ensure that a strong and proportionate system of regulation
is in place to ensure that high standards are met at all
times.</div>
					<a name="07062765000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
earlier the annual turnover of some &#163;20-plus billion in the
legal sector. I know that, despite what some newspapers would have us
believe, not every lawyer is a fat cat, but many of them are fairly
comfortable cats&#151;I do not see many signs of poverty in Chancery
lane&#151;so I do not see the justification for paying something in
the region of &#163;850,000 of public money to the Law Society to
cover a charge for issuing practising certificates.</div>

						</b> The Minister is as charming as ever, but on this
occasion her arguments do not rise to the level of her charm. I have
not tried to hide the fact that there would be a cost. The Government
have two ways to deal with that. They either meet the cost of the
things that are needed for an employee, as an employer normally does,
or they say, &#147;You can only be employed if you have a practising
certificate.&#148; That could, therefore, not put the burden on the
taxpayer but be like saying, &#147;We will employ you, put in the
adverts, have a word with the Government, but you have to come with a
practising certificate.&#148; Many people do their jobs and pay their
annual fee to remain qualified&#151;whether that is tax deductible is
a different matter.</div>
					<a name="07062765000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister knows that there is an anomaly and I think that
the very estimable Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General&#151;for the
time being&#151;knows that, too. He will not have to defend that
anomaly after tomorrow, but the Minster
will&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Laughter.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Well, I hope that she
will. The Attorney-General has said that he is going and the Minister
has not said that she is. If we report faithfully what she has said
tonight and feed it into the system, no doubt that will boost her
chances of promotion, which my hon. Friend and I both want her to
benefit from.</div>

							<a name="07062765000520"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 323, in
clause 195, page 108, line 11, leave
out &#145;under section 3&#146; and insert &#145;in accordance
with section
3A&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07062765000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows the court to make an order for costs in cases where the
successful party has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>represented pro bono. Although the work might have been done free of
charge, the court could order a sum to be paid in respect of that work
to a registered charity prescribed by the Lord Chancellor, and that
charity will then be able to administer and distribute those funds to
provide legal advice and help where it is needed most.</div>
					<a name="07062765000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause applies in civil
proceedings where the party in whose favour the cost order is given was
represented on a pro bono basis by a lawyer, and will overcome an
anomaly in cost law by allowing such cases to be treated in a similar
way to normal fee-paying cases. The result will be a more level playing
field in which both parties to the litigation are potentially liable
for costs. I hope that that might encourage the earlier settlement of
cases that are currently being pursued through the courts, as the
opponent of a party who is represented pro bono will know from the
outset that, if he loses, he may still have to pay something for the
other parties&#146; representations in addition to his own
costs.</div>
					<a name="07062765000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
clause was first drafted we have made changes regarding registration in
the Charities Act 1993, and to reflect that, the amendment is a
technical one. I shall now look at the clause in more detail.
Subsections (5) and (6) will prevent an order from being made against a
person who is funded entirely by civil legal aid or is represented pro
bono. It was felt that to expose those groups of people to one of these
orders might put undue pressure on the civil legal aid fund or
discourage people from offering pro bono assistance. Subsection (7)
allows the rules of court to be made about making those orders. It is
envisaged that those rules will be set out alongside the procedural
matters&#151;the factors that the court should have regard to, in
addition to those in subsection (4).</div>
					<a name="07062765000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under subsections (3), (8) and
(9) the sums generated by the cost orders will be directed to the
charity prescribed by the Lord Chancellor, which will be registered in
accordance with the Charities Act 1993. The charity will administer the
payments that it receives for the benefit of the pro bono community
generally, and recognised pro bono organisations and projects in
particular. There is a small technical change that it is appropriate to
look at. Under the 1993 Act, registration is in section 3; once that
Act is amended by the Charities Act 2006, it will appear under section
3A. The amendment to subsection (9)(a) reflects that change, which I
hope will be acceptable.</div>
					<a name="07062765000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the prescribed charity was
discussed in the other place, amendments were tabled. The first of
those would have allowed those undertaking pro bono work to nominate
any charity to receive individual awards, and the second would have
obliged the prescribed charity to consider the lawyer&#146;s wishes
in distributing awards. The Attorney-General, whose national pro bono
co-ordinating committee has been a driver behind the current proposal,
resisted those amendments. He explained that the fact that the
prescribed charity would be a national body, able to effect strategic
distribution of funds to the whole pro bono community, was one of its
most valuable assets. It would be regrettable to bind the charity to a
statutory obligation to take a particular lawyer&#146;s expression of

<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>preference into account, when none of the other factors that may be
considered in distributing the moneys would be expressed in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062765000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General offered the reassurance that one of the factors that
the prescribed charity would have regard to when making
decisions&#151;probably through guiding principles rather than as a
constitutional fetter&#151;would be any preference expressed by the
legal representatives acting in a particular case. However, those
preferences would not be determinative. If there was much of an
advantage to the strategic perspective offered by the national charity,
that would be lost. On that basis, the amendments were
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="07062765000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 16
April, we issued a consultation paper setting out our proposals for
secondary legislation provided for by the clause, including any
possible changes to procedural rules needed to help the courts deliver
the provision. It has been made widely available to, among others,
those who will benefit from the legislation, and to Members of this
House, so that they have an opportunity to comment if they so
wish.</div>

out from &#145;Chancellor&#146; to end of line
24.</div>
					<a name="07062765000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment
reverses one that was made in the other place. The Lords amendment
imposed two conditions on the commencement of part 5 of the Bill, which
deals with ABS. The first condition was that more research needed to be
conducted into the possible effects of ABS and then the results of that
research would have to be considered by Parliament before part 5 could
be commenced. The second condition was that, unlike the rest of the
Bill, part 5 could only be commenced with the approval of both Houses
under the affirmative resolution procedure.</div>
					<a name="07062765000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Frankly, I
cannot see that further research would add anything constructive to the
Bill. Baroness Ashton took pains to explain in the other place that
such research could achieve only two things: either it would compare
our reforms with other jurisdictions, in which case we would learn very
little that is relevant, or it would try to estimate the effects of the
ABS in the absence of any firms actually being operational, in which
case we would get a lot of theory but there would be little chance of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>discovering anything based on hard evidence. Neither type of information
would be much help to Parliament in approving a commencement
order.</div>
					<a name="07062765000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already
commissioned research and used it to inform the Bill. Between the
Clementi report and our White Paper, well-respected academics examined
the benefits of multi-ownership models and law services&#146;
multi-disciplinary practices, as well as the organisational structure
of legal firms. They all concluded that the ABS proposals were sensible
and did not present unacceptable
risks.</div>
					<a name="07062765000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not
deal with clause 212, there is also a risk of delay. It will be some
time before part 5 is commenced, which will happen in 2010 or 2011. It
may seem as if there is plenty of time to do research, but, of course,
there could be other developments before then. Consequently, we would
risk the results of such research becoming even less relevant. To defer
the commencement of part 5 to take account of the most up-to-date
developments would mean risking part 5 not being ready in time or
having little
relevance.</div>
					<a name="07062765000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
do not want to delay the benefits that part 5 offers consumers. I
believe that the timetable is sensible. It ensures that the board will
begin approving licensing authorities only when it and the authorities
are ready, which will necessarily take some time. There is no
justification for delay beyond that time, other than the reasonable
caution that I would expect licensing authorities to exercise when they
start their work. There is even less justification for imposing a
requirement to carry out further research when there is little point
behind the research and little chance of producing anything useful
beyond what we already
know.</div>
					<a name="07062765000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
other troublesome element in clause 212 is the requirement for an
affirmative resolution for any commencement order, which is a kind of
sunrise clause. I do not agree that that measure is necessary, and it
was not proposed by the Delegated Powers Committee. Commencement orders
are not normally subject to parliamentary procedure, particularly
affirmative procedure, and I see no reason to change things here. If
anything, this requirement for affirmative procedure is a crude, clumsy
attempt to put obstacles in the way of part 5 and specifically to give
a veto to those in the House of Lords who oppose the concept of ABS,
but whose arguments have failed to win the debate on the principle.
Taken with the requirement for more research, hon. Members could be
forgiven for thinking that this was a wrecking amendment, or a wrecking
clause.</div>
					<a name="07062765000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing all
that in mind, I urge the Committee to support my amendment to remove
that clause from the
Bill.</div>

								Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I have listened to what the Minister has said
and I can tell her that, although we are not particularly happy with
the Government amendment, which will overturn what was inserted in the
House of Lords, we will not vote against it, as she has made some good
points. We are very disappointed indeed that the Government have
decided to overturn a number of other Lords amendments, but we have had
those debates already. I think that the Government have been
curmudgeonly and ungenerous, but on this occasion the debate has rolled
on and some greater understanding and realisation have been achieved.
That particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>Lords amendment was not completely spot on, which it should have been,
so we will not force a
vote.</div>
					
					<a name="07062765000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062765000540"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> This is the last controversial amendment. I am
willing to do the Government a deal, but I do not think that the
Minister will buy it: the terms are that she withdraws the amendment
and we give her no trouble on the remaining two Government amendments
to be debated before our consideration of the Bill is completed. I
merely give her a chance to reflect, but it does not look like she is
likely to buy it.</div>
					<a name="07062765000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second thing to say before dealing with the substance of the matter is
that there are two pressures on those of us who are considering what to
do on this amendment: pressure from the Minister and her desire to move
on to introduce alternative business structures, and pressure from my
colleagues and independents in the other place, who voted to secure a
majority of 68 for the amendment, which she is seeking to undo. I would
rather face the wrath of the Minister on a temporary basis than that of
all 78 colleagues, which is how many there were before the Government
started making overtures to them earlier in the
week.</div>
					<a name="07062765000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
the substance of my main point, like the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk, I reflected seriously on the matter. I did not say, &#147;We
must absolutely hold the line just because that was the view that my
colleagues took in the other place.&#148; I reflected on whether we
should change our position. On balance, I decided that we should not do
so, that we should support the Bill as it is and that we should oppose
the Government amendment. There are three reasons for
that.</div>
					<a name="07062765000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there is
still huge concern among many interested people about the introduction
of ABS, and an independent report at this stage&#151;after all the
debate on the Bill&#151;would produce a new ability to assess the
benefits and disbenefits. Yes, such a report might draw on other
jurisdictions and other assessments, and it would not be based on
practice, but given that there is nothing else that one can use for
assessment, one has to use the best evidence available, which would be
up to date.</div>
					<a name="07062765000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we must address the access to justice concerns, which we have already
discussed. Thirdly, there must be the ability to have a sunrise clause.
As the Minister knows, other Bills have included sunrise clauses. A
sunrise clause would mean that there would have to be parliamentary
agreement to press the button on the new business structures, which is,
on balance, the right side of the
line.</div>
					<a name="07062765000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate has
moved on, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has said, but I am
still persuaded that there are sufficient concerns for us to believe
that the House of Lords was right on this issue, that we need to
proceed with caution, and that that reflects the view reached by the
Joint Committee and during earlier consideration. The Government are
pushing too hard and too fast in that
direction.</div>
					<a name="07062765000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any
event, if the Government&#146;s proposals are winning arguments and
can win people around to their way of thought, they will also win the
vote. I hope, for the time being, that colleagues will accept that it
is better to proceed carefully and cautiously, and that this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>is such an approach to what could be a harmful, as well as potentially
beneficial,
option.</div>
					
					<a name="07062765000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062765000541"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way
in which he has put his concerns. Sir David Clementi was on a number of
occasions, not least quite recently in a meeting organised by the Bar
Council, very supportive of our ABS proposals, in which I believe
absolutely. I do not think that ABS will happen overnight anyway, which
is why I do not think that the amendment needs to stand, even if I
agreed with it in the first place. It is much more likely that local
development plans will be up and running before multidisciplinary
practices come into being. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are looking
at one aspect of that to see whether other areas can be
accommodated.</div>
					
					<a name="07062765000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07062765000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
believe that the motive in the other place was to scupper this part of
the Bill. Despite what hon. Members have said, nothing that I have
heard has dissuaded me from that view. I believe that a cautious
approach will be taken when the board, the regulators and the licensing
authorities begin, and that the world will not turn into an ABS
overnight. It is still a little way off, so we have time to ensure that
we get the right rules and regulations in place for the licensing
authorities to do their work properly. The Consumer Panel is of the
view that the Lords amendment was a wrecking amendment, and all
consumer groups are keen to for us to go ahead with the Bill as
originally drafted.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062765000542"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> A range of views was expressed in the other place,
as elsewhere. Some people are implacably opposed to part 5 of the Bill
and have heard nothing to change their minds, but others take a more
cautious and incremental view. I share the Minister&#146;s opinion
that some hold that view, but I thought it better to hold on to my
position because it accommodates a broader range of opinion than
proceeding in the way suggested by the
Minister.</div>
					
					<a name="07062765000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062765000543"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but
it is important that we move on. We are trying in part 5 to give the
opportunity for ABS to happen within the framework that I have
described. Certainly, there will be caution at the beginning in order
to ensure that everyone is satisfied and that the new system works
properly. Those not motivated by principled objections who want to
ensure that we get it right should be reassured that everything else
that builds into part 5 will ensure that a proper approach is
taken.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. It is a
pleasure to make the final statement in Committee. I shall shortly be
thanking the huge variety of people who have so greatly contributed in
bringing the Bill to Committee and in improving it in the course of the
Committee debates.</div>
					<a name="07062765000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, however, let me state my
belief that, when the Bill receives Royal Assent&#151;as I am sure
that it will&#151;it will be among the most significant statutes
produced by any Government in improving legislation for consumers. I do
not say that lightly&#151;I am convinced that it is the
case&#151;and I am particularly pleased and proud to have been
involved in making it happen. No matter what happens later this week, I
know that through the passage of the Bill I have at least played a part
in making consumers&#146; lives a great deal
better.</div>
					<a name="07062765000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
thank the Bill team, which, not surprisingly&#151;given that the Bill
has 215 clauses and 24 schedules&#151;is quite large. They have been
magnificent in providing advice and amendments, and in giving advice
and support to the Opposition, when they have asked for it, in
clarifying issues. I am grateful to Nigel Reeder and his team for the
work that they have done. I am also grateful to the Clerks to the
Committee, who have been extremely helpful, always courteous and always
ready to offer excellent advice. The new system of
explanatory
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>memorandums at the end of amendments has been a marvellous improvement,
for which we have been the pilot, and I hope that it will be adopted
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07062765000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
colleagues on both sides of the House for their courteous, humorous and
always gracious conduct in the debate. I am particularly grateful for
the contributions of my hon. Friends. I feel as if I now know virtually
everybody who lives in Bassetlaw, and I certainly think that people in
North Durham visit their solicitors far too often.
Nevertheless, those contributions were important and focused us on some
critical issues. I am grateful also to the Opposition for the way in
which they have conducted
themselves.</div>
					<a name="07062765000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
thank my Parliamentary Private Secretary, and those who have at
intervals acted as PPS, for making sure that I have all the relevant
information, and my hon. Friend the Whip for glaring at us when we went
on too long. I thank all the organisations that have been involved on
both sides&#151;the consumer side and the legal profession.
Particular thanks also go to you, Sir Nicholas, and to your colleague,
Frank Cook, for your wonderful supervision of our proceedings and for
the charming way in which you have kept us in line. That has ensured
that the Bill is better than when we began.</div>

							<a name="07062765000572"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas.
There is not time to go into detail but, on behalf of the official
Opposition, I endorse everything that the Minister has
said.</div>

						</b>
						Likewise, I offer my thanks to
you, Sir Nicholas, to Mr. Cook and to the Clerks who have
done a sterling job. Above all, I pay tribute to the Minister who has
single-handedly led for the Government in Committee and who deserves
our thanks. The Committee has been happy and
successful.</div>

							<a name="07062765000574"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I congratulate the whole Committee. From my
point of view, it has been a very agreeable and constructive Committee.
I congratulate the Front-Bench spokesmen, and I particularly
congratulate the Minister on handling a Bill entirely on her own,
although no doubt with good back-up from the civil service. I thank my
Clerk, the Doorkeepers, the police and the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers. If
every Committee ran as smoothly, this place would perhaps run more
smoothly as a whole. Thank you all for your complimentary remarks, and
I shall pass on your thanks to Mr.
Cook.</div>
