</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell (North-East Bedfordshire):</B> I was speaking to the amendments when we adjourned. I had dealt with my points on amendments Nos. 42 and 43, but I was about to speak to amendment No. 44. I hope that amendment No. 44 will be accepted in some form, but will the Economic Secretary clarify whether the FSA, the Treasury and the Government see the identification of crime as one of the FSA's functions? It should be.
<P>
This morning, I explained that, prior to City regulation, the system in place was criticised as being based on the old boy network and the old school tie network and issues were dealt with by the great and the good. We then had Professor Gower's report and the Financial Services Act 1986. We are now updating that.
<P>
Under the 1986 dispensation, which has almost gone, many regulators operated under the Securities and Investment Board. This Bill will give effect and statutory authority to a new dispensation. However, whatever the dispensation, it is crucial that a proper organisation is able to monitor the financial system to identify possible financial crime. Therefore, I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept that that should be one of the FSA's functions
<P>
My argument does not rely just on common sense. I noticed from my background reading one of the points made by Mr. Alastair Ross Goobey. Few people have more knowledge of pensions and the pensions industry than he does. The regulator should be carefully attuned to the risk of financial crime, but I was horrified by what I read in his evidence on page 50 of volume II of the Joint Committee's report. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In February 1993 pension funds came under the occupational pension scheme regime of IMRO. This was a response to the Maxwell scandal, one in which IMRO had proved completely unwilling to intervene when warned, as I know personally.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If someone of Mr. Ross Goobey's standing can say that the then self-„regulatory organisations were specifically warned of what became one of the biggest financial crimes and scandals of the past 20 years and did nothing about it, that is a very serious matter. Normally one successfully fights the last war and the problem is to be sufficiently ready to fight the next one. I want to be clear that the FSA recognises that it must be able to fight the last war more successfully than this one was fought. How does it intend to deal with it?
<P>
We shall return to the position of the chairman and chief executive, which are apparently to be rolled into one, but which is to be reviewed. I have been looking at the recent annual report of the FSA, which we were helpfully sent the other day, to see where the FSA's antennae stretch. The chairman has great experience as a public servant in McKinsey's, in the Audit Commission, in the Confederation of British Industry, and at the Treasury where he was temporarily a political adviser to the Chancellor. It is no criticism of him to say that he has never personally been at the sharp end of the City, although he was at the Bank of England, which will have attuned his antennae significantly. He will know a great many people, and it is important that his network and that of the FSA reaches out. They should be easily accessible to those working in the City who can give the kind of warning--tip-off is not the right expression--to enable the authority, alone or with the Serious Fraud Office--I had a close connection with the SFO for 10 years--and others in City regulatory and investigative agencies, to find out what is going on and nip it in the bud.
<P>
Other members of the board have great City experience: Mr. David Clementi at Kleinwort Benson--he was deputy governor of the Bank of England--Mr. Christoper Rodrigues at Thomas Cook; Sir Robert Smith at Morgan Grenfell has a long background in the City; Mr. Stephen Thieke has experience in the United States and with J.P. Morgan; Mr. Keith Whitson has been with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long period and he is now group chief executive. They will bring a great deal of nous to the authority, although that underplays their experience. Other members of the board, too, have a significant amount to offer.
<P>
Will the Minister please say how the network will stretch out, as five people is not very many? We know that gathered under the FSA are all those who worked in the previous regulatory authorities who used to be connected to outside independents. How and in what context will the system work? Is it accepted that what the amendment proposes should be one of its functions?
<P>
I note that there is a body called the financial fraud information network about which I do not know as much as I hope to by the end of the Committee stage. I should be grateful if the Minister would list the regulatory investigative enforcement agencies which are connected with that body--she probably has them at her fingertips, or some fingertips will swiftly pass them to her. If it is a long list that is more easily stated in answer to a parliamentary question, I shall be happy to table such a question, but I hope that that will not be necessary.
<P>
May we be told about the financial fraud liaison unit? I anticipate that it liaises between specific bodies--such as the Serious Fraud Office--that deal with financial fraud. May we also be told about the role of the authority's non-executive committee? I am feeling my way. I did some background reading and noted that paragraph (4) to schedule 1 refers to a non-executive committee. Will it be involved? The question that the amendments seek to flush out is how the authority will fulfil this particular and important function. I do not wish to labour the issue. Questions have been raised and I have tried to provide some pointers as to the direction from which they might be answered. At the Minister's convenience, I look forward to hearing her answers.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> I am also looking forward to hearing my answers to the questions on this immensely important subject. However, before I turn to the interesting questions raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), I would like to deal with the Opposition's amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 would extend the financial crime objectives to businesses other than those run by regulated persons. The broad effect of the amendment would be inappropriate. The FSA's remit clearly covers regulated activities and its powers apply to regulated persons. It would go beyond the proper remit of a financial services regulator to extend the objectives to cover other types of business--not necessarily within the financial system--run by non-regulated persons. That should be the job of other agencies tackling financial crime--the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) as well as the right hon. and learned Gentleman made the point that the clause might inadvertently exclude the activities of people who ought to be, but are not, regulated under the Bill. I readily undertake to look at that drafting problem again, although I have to say that it is not easy to get the boundaries right. We shall, as I said, attempt to deal with that problem, but we also need to limit the objective in some way to the FSA's natural sphere of activity.
<P>
I have more sympathy with the thinking behind amendment No. 43, but it is also unnecessary. The clause does not impose obligations on anyone other than the FSA. It does not impose a responsibility on regulated persons to prevent crime. It is all about the responsibilities of the FSA. The right hon. and learned Gentleman himself pointed out that clause 6(2)(b) requires the authority, in considering the objective of preventing financial crime, to have regard to the desirability of regulated persons taking appropriate measures. That defines what the authority has to do, but does not impose responsibilities on regulated persons.
<P>
We are all agreed that the reduction of financial crime is important and that the regulatory community has a key role to play. However, we also appreciate that we cannot ask business to take on tasks that it cannot reasonably be expected to perform. I understand concerns on that score, but I hope to reassure the industry--and right hon. and hon. Gentlemen- that those concerns have been met. Taking
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appropriate measures . . . to prevent financial crime''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not mean that financial services companies should have to spend enormous sums on reducing financial crime to zero. That is not possible.
<P>
We have already made changes to this part of the Bill to respond to that concern. Following consultation, we replaced the original reference to ``adequate measures'' in the objectives with ``appropriate measures''. The amendment would have no effect beyond that.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Like the other objectives, the objective does not exist in isolation, When the FSA makes rules in pursuit of it, it must take account of the principles in clause 2. As part of that, it must have regard to the principle that a burden should be proportionate to the benefits, Indeed, we shall discuss that later in the Bill in relation to the cost-benefit analysis that will help to ensure that that balance is maintained.
<P>
Clearly, the FSA will not require all banks to model themselves on Fort Knox. As drafted, the objective will not give rise to the difficulties for authorised persons and regulated businesses which are of concern to Opposition Members.
<P>
I understand the aim of amendment No. 44. However, it is not helpful or necessary, and I shall explain why in detail.
<P>
 There is a whole range of functions that the FSA will be able to exercise in relation to the reduction of financial crime, including giving guidance, mounting prosecutions, co-operating with other agencies and so on. We have specified in the Bill's early clauses the objectives to which the FSA must pay attention in exercising its functions. We have not tied any particular aspects of the FSA's statutory duties--including the objectives--to its functions as that would reduce flexibility. For instance, the rule-making power will be used in pursuit of all or any of the objectives; it will not be confined to one.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister has just referred to the rule-making power. Does she not accept that the authority's activities must go beyond rule-making? We are concerned with what the authority does, not the rules that it makes for other people.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I completely accept the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point.
<P>
I was simply illustrating the fact that the FSA's powers, which we will deal with as we consider the Bill, are not tied to the fulfilment of any one objective. Therefore, in relation to the objective of reducing the risk of financial crime, the authority will be able to draw on its rule-making powers; its power to prosecute for money laundered; its general supervisory role over systems to ensure that authorised persons are fit and proper and its power to prosecute for market manipulation. The authority will also have the power to draw on the information gateways established in part XXI to allow information to be shared with other authorities and the power to investigate and gather information in part X, enabling it to fulfil the important function of monitoring what is happening in financial services, as referred to in amendment No. 44.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman appears to be about to make an intervention. However, let me stress that the powers in part X to investigate and gather information and the more general function of monitoring what is going on in the industry may well be required in pursuit of the market-confidence objective, in clause 3, which we have already agreed. It would not be appropriate to specify those powers in relation to the objective in clause 6 of reducing financial crime.
<P>
Therefore, in no sense are we suggesting that the FSA should not monitor the financial system to identify possible financial crime, as that may be an important part of how it meets the objective. However, it would be wrong for the clause to specify that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Which part of the Bill prescribes that the FSA should set up a fraud monitoring unit and what that unit should do? We know that that is what it has done. That seems very much part of what society expects it to do. It would be strange if the enabling Bill contained no prescription for what is expected of the FSA in the area of the reduction of financial crime. Therefore, if it is not here, where is it?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Paragraph (6) to schedule 1, which we have already dealt with means that the FSA must monitor compliance with its rules and the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill. I do not believe that anything more than that and the other provisions to which I have referred is required to ensure that the FSA continues to operate an anti-fraud unit. I am happy to look again at that and to see whether any additional provision is required in the Bill to ensure that the FSA continues to do what it already does and will do under the Bill to pursue this objective of reducing financial crime.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. I have followed her comments. She said that the FSA has rule-making, prosecuting, investigatory and information-gathering powers. What she is really saying is that that is enough. Does she not see why we say it is not enough? If it does not have an active obligation to monitor, it will not pick up the nasty secret things which it is part of its role to try to identify and stamp out. The information-gathering powers sound fine. However, if one had sent a missive to the late Mr. Maxwell asking him on how many occasions he used the same security to secure different debts, I doubt whether the reply would have been very helpful.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am intrigued that Opposition Members who have on several occasions described the FSA as a Leviathan are seeking further to extend its powers. I do not see how the FSA can possibly do its job or pursue and achieve the statutory objectives that we are giving it here--the market confidence as well as the financial crime objective--without constantly, both formally and informally, obtaining and sharing information about what is going on within the industry. That is what it does every day of the week. That serves the objective of reducing financial crime just as it assists it to meet its other objectives. The power to obtain information is an important part, but in which it is not the only way in which it obtains its information.
<P>
It might be helpful if I said a little more, particularly in response to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's earlier questions, about how the FSA works with other agencies in the fight against financial crime. The police, the Serious Fraud Office and the Department of Trade and Industry all play vital roles. The FSA brings a unique insight into what goes on within authorised firms, in part because it has access to detailed financial information about those firms. It will monitor systems and control arrangements as part of its everyday activity. It will often be in a position to spot matters of concern well before anybody else.
<P>
It also has the expertise to take forward investigations into complex financial crime. The knowledge that is needed to disentangle what may be incredibly complex and contrived arrangements is part of its bread-and-butter business.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Did the Minister say the SFA?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, I said the FSA. It has expertise, which it uses day in and day out as part of its regulatory function and which helps it to spot the possibility of financial crime, investigate it and to take action against it.
<P>
The FSA is currently in discussion with the Serious Fraud Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police to draw up a memorandum of understanding governing the responsibilities and relationships between those different organisations. They have expertise and responsibilities in helping to crack down on financial crime. When that is concluded, the results will be published.
<P>
The FSA is already working closely with other agencies to combat financial crime. There are several things that it can do in pursuit of that objective. The authorisation process should help to keep out criminals and ensure that authorised people are fit and proper. The process of requiring firms to make returns, to keep proper records and to have proper audit trails in place will help. There is also a requirement on firms to have adequate training and competence standards. The FSA will have a monitoring role and will undertake in-depth inquiries, followed, if necessary, by rigorous enforcement against non-compliance. That will all help.
<P>
I shall not go into details of clause 117, which we are still a long way from debating, but the Bill gives the FSA the power to prosecute breaches of the money laundering regulations, which are about the systems and controls that businesses must have in place.
<P>
The FSA has also established a central financial crime liaison unit, which is a centre of expertise on financial crime, especially on money laundering. It contributes to the general development of FSA policy, and provides key support to the financial fraud information network, which is a network of UK authorities that acts as a forum, sharing information and concerns about suspected financial frauds.  That network includes, in addition to the FSA, Serious Fraud Office, the DTI and the police.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister has just mentioned officials with whom I have worked for years and for whom I have a high regard. I am emphasising monitoring because I am trying to tease out from her where the FSA puts out its tentacles into people who are living and working day by day in the market. She has given an answer, which I well recognise, about everything that officialdom does, but I am worried about what happens unofficially. What about the people at the sharp end of the market? What informal committees are there?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point, but it is not easy, or indeed possible, to try to formalise in the Bill essentially informal arrangements and relationships that generate information, which is often highly sensitive and which, almost by definition, will not be obtained by more formal processes. The FSA, as a daily part of its work, is in constant contact with the people working in authorised firms and the regulated industry as a whole. Those relationships need to be built up in order for the FSA to receive informal as well as formal information on which it depends to do the job effectively. To secure its objectives, it is also helpful to have some of the more formal networks in place. In addition to the agencies to which I have already referred, the financial fraud information network includes the national crime squad, the Law Society, the Home Office, the stock exchange, the London metal exchange, the London international financial futures exchange, the takeover panel and various other associates.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That formalised, but none the less useful network for the exchange of information--and, perhaps, of early suspicions and warning signs--will form the basis for deciding which agency or agencies should properly pursue the matter, to ensure that serious financial crime does not go uninvestigated. As I have indicated, the FSA has regular contacts and dealings with market participants, including senior managers and compliance officers. Similarly, they liaise closely with the recognised exchanges, again through formal and informal means.
<P>
I should add that we strongly support the efforts of the financial action task force on money laundering; its 40 recommendations are the global standard for anti-money-laundering systems. We seek to expand that membership, because financial crime and money laundering are global problems. They are certainly not confined to the United Kingdom. Under that umbrella, we seek to encourage regional anti-money-laundering networks and to identify and address the problem of non-co-operating jurisdictions. We were able to take that issue forward during our presidency of G7, improving co-operation between overseas financial regulators and law enforcement and prosecuting authorities.
<P>
I hope that, in this somewhat extensive reply, I have been able to establish that, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister famously said, we are ``tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime''. That applies to financial crime as much as it applies to any other sort of crime.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In talking about the central financial crime liaison unit and the methods of tackling money laundering, the hon. Lady is getting closer to what I urge her to do. I confess that I have no personal knowledge of that unit, but I suspect from having some knowledge of how money laundering is carried out--[Laughter.] Having been responsible for prosecution in that area of law for a long time, I learned a thing or two about it.
<P>
I suspect that that unit operates much more informally than is suggested by the formal information-gathering function of the FSA. The point that I am trying to get across is that when it is monitoring a financial crime, informal networks will be needed. Our Parliament is part of a free society, and we should be told a little about those informal networks. Unless the Bill reminds the FSA that it must jolly well act informally in that way, it is less likely to do so. Apart from the money laundering aspects, will the Minister expand a little on those informal networks?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am not sure that there is much that I can add. The right hon. and learned Gentleman properly reminded us of his legitimate experience of money laundering; he is well aware, probably more so than I am, of the informal and informal networks and the exchanges of information that take place and are absolutely essential. As I have explained, the Financial Services Authority already has a unit to deal specifically with that matter. I have also tried to stress that its daily dealings with the industry provide an informal and a formal source of information that is vital to the pursuit of financial crime.
<P>
I have undertaken to consider refining the drafting of amendment No. 42. I repeat the commitment that I gave a few moments ago to consider whether we need to make specific reference in a different part of the Bill to monitoring and to the establishment of the unit. I do not think that that is necessary, but I am willing to consider it again. I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will be able to withdraw the amendment in the light of those assurances.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Bearing in mind your injunctions, Mr. Atkinson, that it would be rather muddling if I spoke after my hon. Friend who moved the amendment, I shall speak now. I am grateful for what the Economic Secretary said. I was encouraged to hear her say that the FSA have some informal methods. She was not expansive about them; she may not have been fully informed about them, or she may be being cautious.
<P>
In the materials sent to us by Mr. Howard Davies, I noticed that he kindly offered to give us further briefing. It might be sensible to ask for that, perhaps with other members of the Committee, so that we can understand matters better.
<P>
I would like to re-urge the good sense of considering a requirement in the Bill for the authority to monitor in the way suggested. If one does not place an obligation in legislation in respect of <P>
great statutory bodies, relevant work is significantly less likely to be carried out and if they spend any large sum of money, some people will question their authority for doing so.
<P>
One of my worries about the structure being created, which has so many merits that we broadly support it, is that it will put a huge effort on everyone else. It will give immense power to the Treasury to specify everything that it thinks should or should not happen. We will get that in spades when we consider clauses 19 and 20. We will find that things will be regulated when they are specified.
<P>
I think that the Economic Secretary accepts that the activity is important, but that is not specified. I believe that it ought to be, so as to point out that monitoring is not merely an objective. Some specific active monitoring processes are required to comfort the citizens of this country by showing that practical action will be taken to help fulfil that objective.
<P>
I agree with the Economic Secretary that up to a point the network of 1,850 people, who have brains, tongues and ears, will pick things up and say, ``You're getting on to me, but really you should be looking at someone else.'' They are busy people. Their calibre varies but they are often excellent regulators or compliance officers. One of the criticisms that I have heard in relation to the subject is that everything is desperately formalised. Compliance officers--I am not sure that I would ever want to take a job as a compliance officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie (Chichester):</B> You would be very good.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am not sure about that. Compliance officers are desperately keen not to break the complex rules and formalised requirements. The real work that takes place underneath has little to do with them; they are there to see that the business does not transgress formally. The people who do the work and in a sense make the money are not the compliance officers, but the compliance officers are more likely to be in touch with the officials. I therefore believe that we are making a serious point about encouraging the authority to set up a monitoring network that is more informal, which is spread out, which has gatherings and which deliberately takes the time to create information-gathering processes that are outwith the formal regulatory structure. I have laboured the point enough, but I hope that the Minister will take it on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are pleased that the Minister has indicated that the Government will take note of the point about the inclusion of people who should be registered. My earlier point about the police being equally responsible for licensed and non-licensed cars was meant as an analogy. We are happy to withdraw the amendment and we accept that amendment No. 43 may be too pernickety.
<P>
However, for the reasons most eloquently put by my right hon. and learned Friend there needs to be something in the Bill that addresses the issue raised by amendment No. 44. We are not convinced that it is covered by paragraph (6) to schedule 1 or elsewhere in the Bill. That issue relates to the reporting requirements, in that the Bill should set out what is expected of the FSA in terms of researching, monitoring and assisting the market to steer clear of criminal organisations. The financial fraud liaison unit has already been set up--under what powers? It has been set up in a vacuum. The Bill is supposed to be an enabling one and it should set out what is expected of the FSA in that crucial area. The FSA should therefore be judged, monitored and reported on whether it has done what society wants it to in that regard. We therefore wish to press amendment No. 44 to a Division.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should deal with the lead amendment first.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> The importance of this clause has been demonstrated during the debate on our amendments. We have no quarrel with the objectives of the FSA, including the reduction of financial crime. Such crimes are a denial, almost a contradiction, of a free and fair market. They can also wreck people's personal lives, in ways which members of the Committee may have experienced personally if they dealt with cases such as the Barlow Clowes affair or the Maxwell scandal. Some of our constituents had money stolen from them; it is tragic when that happens in an institution that they do not fully understand, and forces beyond their control leave them bankrupt and penniless.
<P>
A further point relating to the status of the City of London is that people will invest and conduct their business in the United Kingdom only if they have confidence that financial crime is taken seriously, and that organisations exist to suppress it. The Minister helpfully emphasised the importance that the authority gives to that issue, saying that the authority staff working specifically on it are in a good position to spot financial crime and wrongdoing, and are determined to do something about it.
<P>
The Minister also mentioned schedule 1(6), in relation to obligations on the authority. I am puzzled by the difference in language between schedule 1(6) and clause 6, as they relate to the intensity of the authority's obligations. Clause 6(2)(b) requires ``regulated persons'' to take measures ``to prevent financial crime'', whereas under schedule 1(6)(1),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority must maintain arrangements designed to enable it to determine whether persons''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are complying with the terms of the Bill.
<P>
That is a subtle, but important, distinction. It is obviously easier for an organisation to put in place an arrangement designed to prevent wrongdoing than actually to prevent it. I hope that a tendency is not creeping into the Bill to impose tougher obligations on the regulated community, or on the general public, than will apply to the Treasury and the authority. Why was it not convenient to import into clause 6 the language already used about the authority in schedule 1?
<P>
My second question relates to the definition of financial crime. Clause 6(3) states:--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```Financial crime' includes any offence involving--
<P>
(a) fraud or dishonesty;''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Other crimes, such as theft, are excluded. If a person were to steal some money, might they refer to this provision and claim that their crime was common theft, not listed under the definition of financial crime? The Minister may reply that that action will be covered by the word ``dishonesty'', but that is so general a term that it adds nothing to the clause. I should appreciate a brief explanation as to why the Bill specifies certain crimes such as fraud, which is included under the heading of ``dishonesty'', but not others that are equally serious, such as theft.
<P>
Not being a lawyer, I hope that my next question is not regarded as stupid, but the definition of ``offence'' under subsection (4) includes an act that takes place in the United Kingdom. Which part of the United Kingdom does the provision refer to, because there are different arrangements and different definitions of crime in Scotland from those in England? Given that ``United Kingdom'' crops up frequently in the Bill, a more general question might be whether it is right to refer to one jurisdiction. For example, would it be open to someone accused of financial crime to say, ``That is not a crime in Scotland, where I come from''. It might be a crime under English law, so the reference to the United Kingdom makes the provision ambiguous.
<P>
A few years ago, I doubt whether anyone would have dreamed of asking such a question, but we are all now becoming frightfully sensitive about where we come from and whether we are English, British or Scottish. Such distinctions may be more important, especially as the Scottish Parliament is only too anxious to drive wedges between bits of the Bill and scrutinise the references to the United Kingdom that perhaps do not make such matters entirely clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Kidney (Stafford):</B> As this is my first Standing Committee, I shall refer to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests. I do not think that any of my interests are relevant to the Bill, although I was once a solicitor in a firm that was registered for giving investment advice, which is a pretty tenuous link. I am a member of the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union, however, which has many members from the financial industry.
<P>
Although I agree with the Opposition's message, I do not support any of their amendments. The reduction of financial crime objective is one of great enormity, yet little in the Bill concentrates on how the FSA should deal with it. I hasten to say that it has not put a foot wrong in taking steps to prepare for meeting that objective, whether by establishing links or sources of information--formal and informal, national and international. Work is being carried out by the FSA and has been well reported on in its annual reports to date. I am not criticising the FSA; I am concerned more with how much wording there should be in the Bill to explain exactly what work it should carry out.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs who said that the financial crime objective has got off lightly in terms of the attention that it has received. The education and consumer protection objectives attracted a strong lobby from consumer organisations; even a Liberal Democrat Member was present at our proceedings when we debated that matter. It seems that the criminal fraternity is not so keen to press us to consider the objective now under discussion, which warrants serious attention. Let us bear in mind that both the Treasury Select Committee when conducting its investigation and the Joint Committee when conducting its pre-legislative scrutiny excluded the financial crime objective from their considerations, pleading that there was not time to do everything. So this is the first time that this part of the Bill is receiving close attention.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Presumably, the hon. Gentleman is referring to the annual report. Did he spot something about the monitoring of financial crime in the report? Perhaps I missed it. Can he tell me where I might find such a reference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> Yes. I referred to the second annual report of the FSA. I think that page 54 contains a short section on financial crime; I have only to hand page 56 because I want to refer to the number of convictions for financial crime. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire might agree that the report does not cover the subject satisfactorily.
<P>
As for the problem of insider dealing, the London Stock Exchange reports that 50 transactions each day require either closer attention or an explanation of why they seem odd. The memorandum that the British Bankers Association submitted to the Joint Committee mentioned that in 1989 suspicious transactions involving money laundering had risen to 14,129--a huge number that needs to be investigated. The Ernst and Young national fraud survey for 1998 disclosed that 90 per cent. of the respondents--admittedly, only 132 responses were received, although 1,000 questionnaires were sent out in Britain--had suffered fraud up to 50 times in the previous 12 months and stated that four United Kingdom respondents each admitted to losing more than US$25 million through fraud in the past 12 months alone. So we are talking about a staggeringly huge, significant illegal market, which requires serious attention.
<P>
Under the Bill, the FSA will be given powers to prosecute. However, it is not good enough simply to say that, instead of three prosecutors for fraud we shall have four--the FSA will join the Department of Trade and Industry, the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution Service in having responsibility for prosecuting. Therefore, the memorandum of understanding, which the Minister mentioned a moment ago, is an important tool to ensure that effective action is taken so that criminals cannot slip through holes in the net.
<P>
I hope that the FSA will be able to provide politicians with reliable information. Mr. Christopher Blair, a researcher in the Library, and I have had great difficulty during the past year matching the figures given by different organisations. The DTI annual companies report gives one set of statistics; the SFO gives another, as do the FSA reports. The previous FSA annual report stated that in 1997-98 there were four convictions for financial fraud, but this year's report states that there were 13 convictions that year. I suspect that different figures are given for the same year simply because of the various sources of information--the DTI, the SFO, and the CPS. It is dreadfully important that we establish a proper base on which we can all judge the effectiveness of prosecutions involving financial crime.
<P>
When discussing the principles, we heard that the FSA must have regard to the international character of financial services. Of course, it should also have regard to the international character of financial crimes. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary mentioned the global nature of the crime. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary about the FSA's links with other bodies. The FSA has links with all the usual bodies--the National Criminal Intelligence Service, Europol and Interpol. Such links are important. I have an FSA press release in which it announces that it has joined the Forum of European Securities Commissions. The Treasury Committee in its investigation received a paper from the Treasury on the FSA's links with the Securities and Exchange Commission in America and the joint work that they do.
<P>
I am reassured that the FSA is doing all the right things; it is just a matter of our knowing about them, which is why it is useful to ask what is in the annual report. As I said on Second Reading, the new civil regime on market abuse will be a great addition to the FSA's armoury, but that is for another day's debate.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I shall be brief. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells Mr. Heathcoat-Amory said, clause 6 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulated persons devoting adequate resources''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is that the authority itself must devote adequate resources to the reduction of financial crime. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for what he has said, and I agree with him, up to a point, that the FSA is doing many of the right things. Good links exist between the various investigative and prosecution agencies, but, at the risk of labouring the point, they are on a totally different level from those that authority needs. After all, it is the authority for the City of London, a square mile with the most financial activity of any square mile in the world. That requires something different.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The authority contains, works with and regulates some people of immense sophistication, most of whom are of high integrity, a great many of whom are of enormous intelligence and have the ability to make a great deal of money for themselves and others, and most of whom are anxious that the probity of the City should not be undercut, and are strongly supportive of the authority's work. If the authority thinks that it can rely on the network between its regulatory and prosecutorial functions and the functions of other administrators and regulators to do the trick, it is missing an important point. All those links are important, but I have a strong feeling that something else is necessary.
<P>
The Committee has not yet been persuaded of that. I therefore briefly return to the point to ask the Economic Secretary to say, ``The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire has been banging on about a different type of informal set of networks, which he thinks will give us a better chance of sensing or hearing about the sort of wrongdoing that could cause genuine problems''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard (Bexleyheath and Crayford):</B> Is that point not covered in schedule 1(6)(2), which provides that the arrangements may provide for functions to be performed by others on behalf of the authority? In other words, the authority may commission the police, MI5 or the Serious Fraud Office to be its antennae in such matters.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman referring to schedule 1(6)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> I am referring to schedule 1(6)(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Those arrangements may provide for functions to be performed on behalf of the Authority by any body or person who, in its opinion, is competent to perform them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> If that provision is related back to the objective of suppressing or stopping financial crime, the FSA has the authority to appoint agencies such as the police, MI5 or special branch to watch out for financial crime on its behalf and to warn it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That is an interesting point. The answer is probably no, because the paragraph deals with monitoring and enforcement of the regulatory requirements. Paragraph (6)(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority must maintain arrangements designed to enable it to determine whether persons on whom requirements are imposed by or under this Act are complying with them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (6)(2) continues with the provision to which the hon. Gentleman referred:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Those arrangements may provide for functions to be performed on behalf of the Authority by any body or person who, in its opinion, is competent to perform them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means monitoring to ascertain whether people who should be regulated are regulated. I am making a wider point that the authority should have a network, probably a comparatively informal one, to give of it a better chance of securing the ear of people who work in the City on a day-to-day basis--the movers and shakers, not the regulators or compliance officers, which it will also use. I would not for a moment suggest that the FSA is powerless in that respect, but that if it is conscious of that, it can do better.
<P>
I could see the Economic Secretary moving into public mode with the reference to the phrase ``tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'', which the Prime Minister used when he was shadow Home Secretary. It was a good catchphrase. It gave the impression that the Labour party was tough and compassionate. The causes of crime that the Prime Minister had in mind were poverty, drugs and so on, but the causes of crime in the City are almost entirely greed, profit and personal gain.
<P>
We need a network of information gathering, but the Bill does not provide for that. We have been able to discuss the issues, and I hope that the Treasury and the authorities will consider whether our suggestions might be beneficial.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The only specific point that I wish to make relates to the regulation that has been in place over the past 14 years. There has been massive under-allocation of resources to the hunting down of crime. That problem has not been given a high priority when it comes to the regulatory body's call on resources. If anything, the resources allocated to rule book ticking functions have been excessive. Unless what is expected of the FSA is defined, that problem is likely to continue.
<P>
The organogram to which I referred has two--maybe three--units out of 50 devoted to the identification of crime. The prima facie evidence is that that is inadequate for the FSA's responsibilities for this matter. Its role must be defined much more clearly, so that it is aware of its responsibilities and can obtain the appropriate resources to carry them out.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been a brief, but interesting debate. We all utterly agree about the importance of dealing with the growing problem of financial crime.
<P>
I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for an excellent contribution that rightly reminded us of the scale of the problem and the growth in it. It underlined the need for a single regulator who has a proper statutory base, statutory objectives and adequate powers and resources to deal with the matter.
<P>
I shall consider my hon. Friend's other point about the need to obtain proper information, so that we can compare on a consistent basis the progress that has been made in tackling the problem. However, it is difficult to get information about prosecutions, convictions and acquittals, because the figures may be revised if a prosecution begun in one year is concluded in a subsequent one or if a conviction obtained in one year is successfully appealed in another. The information requires revision, but I shall certainly consider whether the different authorities involved can do anything to provide more consistent figures.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire returned to a point that he had already made persuasively in the debate on the amendment. I am not sure what I need to say to persuade him that I have responded to his arguments. I will try again by repeating my undertaking to consider whether anything further is needed in the Bill to ensure that the FSA--both formally and informally--uses its monitoring functions and establishes the proper internal staff units in pursuit of the objective that is spelt out in the clause.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells raised a point concerning the drafting of clause 6(2)(b). To be fair, we have already discussed that in the debate on the amendment. It was not a point of political substance.
<P>
As I said earlier, clause 6 does not impose any obligations on firms It simply spells out the FSA's objectives in relation to reducing crime. The FSA has a duty to do that; its other duties are contained in schedule 1. However, clause 6 does not impose any duties on regulated firms. I trust that that deals with any drafting problem, although I do not believe that the clause contains any such problem.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the matter of theft. Let me reassure him that dishonesty covers theft. He also asked about Scotland. We must be sensitive about such matters following devolution, and I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that the reference to the United Kingdom means any part of the United Kingdom, although I am not aware of any relevant difference between Scots and English law in relation to the area that we are discussing. However, as Committee members have reminded me, such differences may arise in future.
<P>
Clause 6 is an important provision which gives the FSA a clear objective to reduce the risk of financial crime. The FSA is already taking that objective seriously and, in future, will continue to report on it to Parliament, the Government and the regulated community.
<P>
However, the FSA is not the only agency with responsibility and powers relating to financial crime. Therefore, as I spelt out at some length in response to an earlier debate, it is important that the FSA continues to work closely and effectively with the other agencies in this country and the law enforcement and regulatory bodies across the world to ensure that, as the global economy gives further scope for the greedy and crooked to undertake financial crime, our regulators, police and prosecuting authorities can, as far as possible, keep up with that and ensure that financial criminals are brought to book.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Authority's general duty to consult</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 3, line 42, after `consumers' insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on whether any proposed rules or guidance, or amendments to them, are appropriate in light of the Authority's general duties, and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following:
<P>
Amendment No. 64, in clause 8, page 4, line 15, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) any consultation on proposed rules and guidance shall initially involve the Practitioner Panel, before any proposals for general consultation are finalised.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 66, in clause 9, page 4, line 33, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) Any consultation on proposed rules and guidance shall initially involve the Consumer Panel, before any proposals for general consultation are finalised.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 4--Duty of Treasury to consult practitioners and consumers--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.--(. ) The Treasury must make and maintain effective arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers on the extent to which any regulations or orders proposed to be made by it under this Act are consistent with its duties under section (Duty of Treasury to maintain competition and competitiveness).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before we start, let me say that clause 7 is short. The amendments have the potential to cover most of the substance of the clause. Naturally, I shall listen to the debate, but perhaps Committee members would bear my remarks in mind when it comes to whether there should be a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The three amendments and the new clause refer to clauses 7, 8 and 9. Therefore, I shall nip in and out of those clauses when making my remarks.
<P>
I shall run through the gist of the amendments and the new clause before getting to the meat. Amendment No. 62 relates to the authority's duty to consult practitioners and consumers on the extent to which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any proposed rules or guidance, or amendments .€.€. are appropriate in light of the Authority's general duties''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an extension of one of the duties listed in clause 2, making a requirement that is more specific than one dealing with whether the FSA is doing a good job on consultation.
<P>
The drafting of clause 7 is currently rather woolly. I should like the FSA to have to consult rather more widely on a number of matters pertinent to its general duties to include the regulatory objectives regarding market confidence, public awareness, consumer protection and reduction of financial crime.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall speak mostly to amendments Nos. 64 and 66. Amendment No. 64 adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Any consultation on proposed rules and guidance shall initially involve the Practitioner Panel, before any proposals for general consultation are finalised.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is self-explanatory although I should like to elaborate on it. If we recognise the virtue of practitioner panels which have now been enshrined in statute--they were not in the Bill as originally drafted--we ought to use them, recognise their strengths and give them more teeth. Just ``having regard to''--that oft appearing phrase in the Bill--is far too woolly. It is in character with so much that is in the Bill already.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 mirrors that. It relates to clause 9 which deals with the consumer panels. Similarly, if we set up consumer panels and recognise them as a good thing, we ought to use them to consult before going out to consultation in the big wide world outside.
<P>
New clause 4 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury must make and maintain effective arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers on the extent to which any regulations or orders proposed to be made by it under this Act are consistent with its duties''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under clause 2. That clause deals with the competition and competitiveness issue which we debated fairly extensively. I want the Treasury to have effective arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers for the duties of competition and competitiveness.
<P>
Indeed, when the FSA announced the people serving on the practitioner forum in its press statement of 12 November 1998, one of the roles detailed for that forum was the promotion of innovation and competition. The FSA has already recognised that and we are really just trying to add that in detail to the Bill.
<P>
Why do we propose these amendments? Effectively, we welcome the enshrining of the practitioner and consumer panels on a statutory basis. Way back in those heady days in March, just after the Joint Committee had started its deliberations, we were treated to the Treasury's progress report on the various proposals on which it had consulted so far. In that progress report we were pleased to hear:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The FSA is to be required by law to maintain Consumer and Practitioner panels. The panels will have a role in assessing the performance of the FSA against its statutory objectives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was welcome news to the Joint Committee although meat needs to be put on the bones of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the panels will have a role''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the purpose of the amendments.
<P>
I should like to deal briefly with the consumer panel which was established in November 1998 on a non-„statutory basis. It will obviously convert to a statutory basis if the clauses are agreed. Under those arrangements, members are appointed under open competition rules--under the Nolan principles, I believe. The Bill now gives the panel powers to provide advice. It gives it powers to evaluate the effectiveness of the FSA in meeting public awareness and consumer protection objectives. It also enables it to conduct and publish research. We await with interest to hear about the extent and detail of such research. However, we want to add greater openness, as discussed extensively in the Joint Committee. We want the FSA to respond publicly to the advice of the consumer and practitioner panels, and to provide reasons if it decides not to adopt it. There would be scope within the annual report to provide more detailed information.
<P>
We are also worried about funding. Howard Davies, when interviewed by the Joint Committee, admitted that the budget for the consumer panel--currently estimated at £420,000--will not go very far and that, in the longer term, the panel is under-resourced. That is worrying. Another problem is the staffing of the consumer panel by the FSA, because there is a question mark over its independence and the panel will have to compensate the FSA for costs.
<P>
All those matters raise concerns, which is why we want greater autonomy enshrined in the Bill for the two panels. The Joint Committee agreed that it was essential that the consumer panel should be independent and be seen to be independent. I wholeheartedly concur with that, as would be expected from a member of the Joint Committee. However, the panel is still effectively inside the FSA and the panel members are appointed, after open advertising, by the FSA.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman. I understand that his amendments stray into other clauses, but we are supposed to be debating consultation, rather than the details of the consumer and practitioner panels, which are dealt with in clauses 8 and 9. A difficult line has to be trodden here, but I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would attempt to follow it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Atkinson. I was bearing in mind your comments about clause stand part and was trying to argue--in more detail than perhaps I should--that the amendments would provide greater autonomy to the panels and that they are especially important because of the perception that the panels could be lapdogs of the FSA establishment. It is essential that they are not. The amendments are necessary to clarify and strengthen the panels' roles. They must be given as much autonomy as possible in practice and in terms of the perceptions of the financial community.
<P>
The FSA consultation document also deals with training and competence panels. I served on a training and competence panel that was set up by the Securities and Futures Authority. My experience was that it was always very much Buggin's turn. Matters were handed on from the compliance officer to someone else. Made up of various practitioners throughout the City, it was not a terribly effective body. I mention that because we want the consumer and practitioner panels to be much more effective and to be seen to be much more effective. That is why we tabled the amendments--to provide the panels with greater autonomy.
<P>
Let me deal briefly with the practitioner panel, which was appointed in November 1998 on a non-„statutory basis. It consists of the great and the good: the president of Fidelity Management, the chief executive of Axa Investment Management, the managing director of Morgan Stanley, the chief executive of Norwich Union, the chairman of KPMG and so on. My one reservation is that those people are very experienced at running businesses rather than doing business; I would query how much they are practitioners--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise again, but the hon. Gentleman is straying from the matter of consultation. We need to hear him saying consultation every now and then and the Chair will be happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall move swiftly to a sentence which will include a form of the word consultation. David Challen, who has been appointed as head of the practitioner forum, stated in paragraph 133 of the Joint Committee report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Before proposing new, or revisions to existing policies and/or associated principles or rules, which could have a material impact on regulated firms, the FSA will consult the Practitioner Panel.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I built up to that word, Mr. Atkinson, and I am grateful for your tolerance in allowing me to lay the ground to do so. As a consequence of the evidence from Mr. Challen and others, the Joint Committee made a specific recommendation. It commented that it was a helpful suggestion as it combined both consultation--there we go again--and transparency and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We recommend that the Government consider including a requirement on these lines in the Bill. We also recommend that a requirement that the Chairman of the Panel be appointed by the Treasury after consultation with the FSA be included in the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was a clear recommendation by the Joint Committee but it does not appear in the Bill, hence the reason for the amendment.
<P>
In the FSA's response to the Joint Committee, it said that it will maintain effective arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers on its policies and activities and this will include taking account of the views of consumer and practitioner panels. Those panels report annually on their work and may be expected to comment on the FSA's responses to their report and recommendations. That is awfully woolly. Effective arrangements for ``consulting'' and ``taking account of'' may mean that they will pick up a one-page memo and say, ``That's all very interesting,'' and do nothing about it. The amendment would pin down what ``taking account of'' or ``having regard to'', to use the Treasury's phrase, actually means.
<P>
The Bill is far too woolly. If, like me, the Treasury and the FSA believe that the practitioner and consumer panels are a good thing, that they strengthen the role of the FSA, adding expertise from practitioners, the industry and consumers, why are they not to be allowed the autonomy to be consulted first? Setting up and establishing those panels, which involves advertising for and appointing members, giving them budgets, setting out their remit, and providing them with staff, means great expense. When the FSA decides to consult the industry on a rule change, a new requirement or perhaps a whole new area of financial services that it wants within its regulatory ambit, it would be absurd not to consult first the practitioner or consumer panel that the FSA has set up on how the consultation exercise with the wider financial world should take place. That has advantages, the first of which must be putting together some of the greatest and wisest minds in the industry, who will clearly have something to say. They might be able to hone the proposed consultation process into a better targeted, better focused and more meaningful consultation exercise, before it goes out to hundreds and thousands of members and registered persons in the industry.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments would add value to the consultation exercise, which was a clear specification, requirement and recommendation from the Joint Committee. I am at a loss to understand why that was not picked up by the Treasury and why it was not included in the relevant clauses. To be cynical, it strikes me as another example of the Government admitting the need for checks and balances on the leviathan of the FSA, and of recognising that the panels are a way of adding a check and balance that can make a contribution and add worth. However, the Government are not prepared to give those panels teeth, and to make them more effective in the work that we all agree that they should do. We want to give the panels extra independence, which will provide them with more credibility.
<P>
The same would be true in relation to the role of the investigator. We all recognised that the role of the investigator was good and necessary to the Bill. However, the Government stopped short of giving it the teeth and compensation schemes that it needed. It is essential that the two panels should be seen not merely as an appendage to the regulator, but as central to the FSA's policy thinking. The FSA said as much in its initial consultation document on practitioner involvement, which it issued as long ago as October 1997. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the FSA additionally sees a key role for practitioners in helping us to understand and be closer to the regulated markets and the firms which operate in them. This in turn will assist us to formulate sensible policies and improve decision-making.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The FSA has admitted that, and the Treasury admits that practitioners have a role to play, so it must be clear that they should be the first port of call for any consultation exercise on rule changes, amendments or new proposals before they are submitted to the financial industry. That is the purpose of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The clause, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) recognises, places an important duty on the FSA to maintain effective arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers on the extent to which its general policies and practices are compatible with its general duties under clause 2. We have already debated those important duties at length. Clause 7 is one of the ways in which we can ensure that they are complied with.
<P>
Without straying ahead of the Committee's progress, I should like to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to a later clause in the Bill--clause 125--which places the authority under an obligation to consult on its proposed rules, explain the purpose of those rules, state why it believes that the rules are compatible with its general duties under clause 2, and allow representations about its proposals to be made within a specified time. In addition, the Bill requires the FSA to have regard to such representation.
<P>
I would also like to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraph 3.2 of the progress report that we published in March 1999 on the establishment of the Joint Committee. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The FSA is to be required to consult practitioners and consumers on its rules, including its fees, standing guidance and certain policies and arrangements that it is required to put in place such as its fining policy and complaints handling arrangements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a firm commitment from the Government as part of the accountability package. We shall ensure that those measures are implemented, although the provisions do not yet appear in the Bill. I shall table appropriate amendments to give effect to that undertaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am glad that we have teased out from the Economic Secretary the fact that the provisions will appear. The progress report was produced back in March and it is now July. The provisions do not appear in the Bill, so that information is interesting. However, the thrust of the amendments is that the panels should be consulted first. Presumably, the intention has always been that they would be consulted at some stage, but the point of the amendments is that the panels should be consulted first to improve the consultation exercise.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am just coming to that, but I want to put the debate on clause 7 and the amendments in the context of the provisions in the Bill and those that will be in the Bill, because consultation is an important part of the accountability package.
<P>
The FSA has already established practitioner and consumer panels. Clauses 8 and 9 put those panels on a statutory footing and give the Treasury the power to approve the FSA's appointment and dismissal of the chairman of each panel and ensures that the FSA takes account of the panels' views. The panels must be representative of the regulated community and consumers.
<P>
It is important to understand that the panels are an important and integral part of the FSA's general arrangements, which are spelled out in clause 7, for effective consultation, so they will have a significant role in assessing the performance of the FSA against its general policies and practice.
<P>
The amendments deal specifically with the role of the panels. Our general approach has been to require the FSA to establish and maintain the panels as part of the effective arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers, to which clause 7 refers, while avoiding detailed specification in the Bill for those arrangements, so that we can provide flexibility for the arrangements to develop. Opposition Members are not always keen on flexibility and like the details to be spelled out in the Bill, but flexibility is important in an industry that is changing so fast. Opposition Members will acknowledge that we shall always be learning and that the authority will always be learning as it develops its practice. It is important to allow flexibility for the regulator to keep up with developments and to ensure that regulation is cost-effective and sensitive to the views of those affected by it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does the Economic Secretary accept that the people most likely to be able to advise on how they are being affected by the change that she described are the practitioners themselves? The FSA is likely to be one step behind the practitioners. The best place for consultation to start is with the panels, for the reason given by the Economic Secretary--that is, the pace of change.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I want to turn to the subsequent amendments. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the FSA from sounding out either panel in advance of the wider consultation with consumers and practitioners, if that would be helpful. But I do not want to tie the FSA down to a requirement in the Bill that they must always consult the panels in advance of the wider consultation. That would unnecessarily inhibit the FSA's flexibility and would create the danger of slowing down the process of deciding on the rules or guidance that the FSA will develop. It is important that the FSA consults on its policies, rules, guidance and so on, but if we specify in the Bill too rigid a process and sequence of steps for that consultation, we risk creating a bureaucratic and slow process, which might be wholly unsuited to the nature of what is being consulted on.
<P>
There is nothing to prevent the FSA from using pre-consultation, if that is thought to be appropriate in the circumstances, but I resist making that a requirement or imposing it as a duty on the FSA, as the amendment would do.
<P>
I do not doubt that the panels will give appropriate publicity to their work. I am sure that they agree with us about the fact that there will be considerable value in their producing periodic reports on their activities. That will create an opportunity to inform the wider public of the panels' role and help to promote debate on a wide range of issues, which might include, as the Joint Committee suggested, the adequacy of funding and the way in which effective use is made of resources, which is referred to in paragraph 134 in the Joint Committee's report.
<P>
As I said earlier, the Bill already places on the FSA numerous duties to consult on its rules, and establishes appropriate processes. I have no doubt that, one way or another, the panels will be fully engaged in that process.
<P>
The FSA will want to test proposals on the panels before fulfilling its wider obligations about broad public consultation. Nothing in the Bill will prevent that from happening. However, stipulating a formal pre-consultation process with the panels on each occasion on which new proposals are due to be published would slow down the whole process.
<P>
I want to discuss new clause 2, which is an interesting new clause--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the Economic Secretary means new clause 4.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. It is sometimes hard to keep up with everything. We have already discussed new clause 2, and the question of Treasury consultation, at length.
<P>
New clause 4 raises the proposal that the Treasury should consult practitioners and consumers on whether regulations or orders made by it are consistent with its ``duties'' under what would be new clause 2, which we have already discussed at length, but I will remind Committee members of our position.
<P>
It is our intention to consult widely on the most significant items of secondary legislation under the Bill. We have already set that process in train, for instance in relation to the consultation on the scope order. That approach, which was widely welcomed, allows firms and others to bring their concerns to our attention. If consultation respondents feel that our orders and regulations are not in line with any of the Treasury's objectives, I am sure that they will tell us.
<P>
The Treasury should--and will--be aware of the impact of its rules on competition in UK markets and on the competitiveness of UK firms. When we debated that matter--at length--I said that the situations of the FSA and of the Treasury are fundamentally different. The FSA is an independent statutory regulator, and the Treasury is a Government Department and its Ministers are directly accountable to Parliament for the way in which we exercise our powers. I do not believe that new clause 4 would add anything to the process of Treasury consultation.
<P>
I am happy to give Opposition Members an undertaking to give further consideration to the ways in which the panels could add value to the consultation process and to the question of whether further amendments are needed. However, for the reasons that I have given, I believe that an inflexible requirement for pre-consultation is not the right way to proceed. I hope that, in the light of that undertaking, the Opposition will withdraw the amendment and not press the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am afraid that I shall disappoint the Economic Secretary. I was unconvinced by her arguments and became rather less convinced as they went on, particularly with regard to the meat of amendments Nos. 64 and 66 and the question of consulting first. If I heard her correctly, she said that the amendments would tie down the FSA, that the pre-consultation process--as she termed it--would slow down the process, that the sequence of steps was too rigid, and that our suggestions were bureaucratic.
<P>
After all that, I was left wondering what on earth other practitioner panels and consumer panels dare do. So far, we have heard a lot of warm words. The Bill, the progress report and the Treasury responses to the Joint Committee are full of warm words about why consumer panels, practitioner panels and other checks and balances are such a good thing. However, when it comes to setting them a meaningful task in black and white, and giving them the teeth to perform their supposed duties, the Treasury is not forthcoming. That smacks of tokenism and simply will not do.
<P>
Too much in the Bill smacks of tokenism. ``Look'', say the Government, ``we are setting up this enormous leviathan.'' ``Leviathan'' is the favourite noun to apply to the FSA, and now we are all using it. ``It will be more powerful than any other such body in this country's history. Indeed, it will be one of the world's most powerful regulators and certainly the most powerful regulator of any financial services community. Therefore, to calm people's nerves and to allay the City's worry that it will be too powerful, we will set up checks and balances, so you can be sure that it will not lose control and go beyond its remit.'' That is fine, but for goodness sake let us give it the teeth to do the job. Yet again, the Government are not doing that.
<P>
I admit that I did not remember the paragraph in the progress report to which the Economic Secretary referred. The report was published in March and the Bill was published in June. It is now July. The Government have had four months in which to amend the Bill, but I see no Government amendments to any of the relevant clauses. Why the delay? Had we not tabled relevant amendments, would the issue have come to light? That is worrying, and I wonder what other improvements the Economic Secretary has up her sleeve that we may or may not see.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that there is nothing mysterious or concealed about the delay. As several right hon. and hon. Members have remarked, the Bill is long and complex. It placed enormous demands on the parliamentary draftsmen and I am grateful to them for their work. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will table an appropriate amendment on that point, and on any other points where I have undertaken to reconsider certain issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to hear that, but it would have been nice if the Government had tabled an appropriate amendment, which need not have been complicated. I fully acknowledge the enormous pressures placed on parliamentary draftsmen. They must feel exceedingly weary after helping the Joint Committee with this marathon process, of which, as we know, there are many more miles ahead.
<P>
Again, it was down to the Opposition to table amendments, to which I hoped that the Economic Secretary would react favourably. In her defence, she pleads clause 125, which we shall consider any year now. It includes proposals to bring rules to the public's attention, but not to the panel first. I was not entirely reassured by that, because the amendments seek to ensure that the panels are consulted first on any rule changes or proposals. Clause 125 has nothing to do with that, so I fear that the Minister is bypassing the panels, which leads me to worry about their worth and about whether they are being set up as a red herring, to give credibility to the Government's assurances.
<P>
The Minister said that she needed flexibility. What does that have to do with consulting panels? Why does consulting panels constrain flexibility? She also said that it might slow things down, but actually it will do the reverse. We are trying to get the consultation process right first time. I can quote a wonderful example of not getting it right when, on 2 December, the former Paymaster General published a consultation document on ISAs. It was an interesting document, but probably one of the worst consultation documents that the Government have issued so far. It completely failed to recognise the way in which the savings industry works and the fact that PEPs have been very successful, and it would have effectively destroyed much of the savings industry that has been built up.
<P>
I hear you heaving a sigh, Mr. Atkinson, but that consultation document was issued by the Treasury, and if the Treasury had had the benefit of a practitioner panel, along the lines of the one promised in the clause, you can bet your bottom dollar that no practitioner panel that knew its stuff would have allowed such a misinformed and misguided consultation document to go out in such a raw state. The role of the practitioner panel will be to ensure that the consultation exercise that the FSA proposes to conduct with the industry will be far more meaningful. Otherwise, the industry will take one look at a badly-put-together consultation exercise and decide that it is nonsense, and the FSA will have to start the whole exercise again.
<P>
The amendments propose a time-saving measure, and I ask the Minister to reflect on that. There is no question of trying to restrict flexibility or slow down the process. We are trying to add value to the process and to get it right first time. Consequently, I am inclined to press the key amendments Nos. 64 and 66 to the vote, although of shall not press amendment No. 62 or new clause 4.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I wish to make a simple point. Are these practitioner and consumer panels to be real organisations or are they to be foliage? If they are to be real organisations, it seems to me to be axiomatic that they must be consulted first when any changes are proposed If they are not consulted before changes are announced, their credibility will be completely undermined. Secondly, as has been pointed out, they should be the very bodies with whom the FSA teases out from debates, much as we are doing today, the merits or otherwise of the changes that it wishes to make. To argue that it should not be required in the enabling legislation because it would tie down the FSA is the complete antithesis of having serious consultative bodies. The acceptance, or otherwise, of our proposals, is a measure of whether or not the Government and the FSA want serious consultative bodies. If they are in limbo and used only when it suits the FSA, their credibility will be undermined and they will not get the right sort of people to serve on them. The FSA will find that it will be lobbied directly, rather than through organised bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not propose to have a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have only a little to say on a topic that has not been covered in the debate so far.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Well, as long as the right hon. Gentleman does not take liberties.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I heard what you said earlier, Mr. Atkinson. I shall not abuse the debate.
<P>
I have only one question for the Minister. Is it her intention elsewhere in the Bill or by amendment to include the Treasury as well as the authority in the consultation requirement? It is of some importance to the markets because the Treasury has big responsibilities under the Bill, including defining the scope of the legislation and whether additional activities or markets should be taken under the authority in due course. Appointments to various bodies will be made by the Treasury, which also has responsibilities in relation to the Director General of Fair Trading. A great deal of secondary legislation will emanate from the Treasury. The rule-making powers of the authority are covered, to some extent, by the undertaking to consult that is provided elsewhere in the Bill. In so far as the Treasury will be emitting regulations, it is most important that there will be an opportunity to comment on these matters in plenty of time. I wonder whether it is deliberate that the Treasury is not included in clause 7 and whether that is taken care of elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall be brief because I dealt with that point earlier. The Treasury is already consulting on the draft scope order that will be made under the Bill. It is our intention that the Treasury will continue to consult on any occasion when it is exercising powers provided by the Bill. However, it would be inappropriate to try to put the FSA and the Treasury, which are two completely different organisations, on the same footing, especially because secondary legislation that is made by the Treasury also has to go through proper parliamentary procedures.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must tell the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that I have considered his request for putting amendments Nos. 64 and 66 to the Committee. The principle can be best served with a vote on one of them--either No. 64 or No. 66. If the hon. Gentleman will say which one he wishes me to put to the Committee, we shall deal with it in its proper place, which is after the next group of amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Practitioner Panel</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 4, line 4, leave out from first `The' to `to' in line 5 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`members of the Practitioner Panel shall elect one of its members'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 65, in clause 9, page 4, line 19, leave out from first `The' to `to' in line 20 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`members of the Consumer Panel must elect one of its members'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before the hon. Gentleman speaks to the amendment, I wish to say that the Committee has probably passed a milestone, given that we have just got rid of clause 7 and this is our seventh sitting. We now have only 360 more clauses to deal with; at our present rate, the Committee will still be sitting in February 2001.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is a sobering thought, but if our proceedings extend to February 2001, the Bill could be described as a leviathan. We would have done it every justice, ensuring that it is far, far better than the tawdry Bill that was launched in draft form on the day before the recess a year ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The heart of the Bill is in its first 20 or so clauses and it is vital that they receive the scrutiny that they deserve.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can say hear, hear to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. Not only are we discussing the heart of the Bill, but we are trying to get to its guts, too.
<P>
The two amendments are similar in spirit; they refer to both the practitioner and the consumer panels. Amendment No. 63 would make members of the practitioner panel responsible for appointing that panel's chairman not, as the Bill is currently constituted, the authority. To mirror that, amendment No. 65 requires that members of the consumer panel should be responsible for electing their chairman rather the authority. We must remember that the members of the two panels will be appointees and that they are appointed by the authority, over which the panels are supposed to be exercising a check and a degree of scrutiny. We must also be careful that the panels have the maximum degree of autonomy and that they are seen to be as autonomous as possible.
<P>
I am slightly bemused as to why the Government did not go along with that suggestion. What on earth do they have to fear? I shall not bore the Committee by reading out the great and the good who constitute the panels, but they are both great and good. They have been appointed under the Nolan principles; many checks have been made for quality, and any member of either panel must surely be of sufficiently high calibre to be appointed as chairman or chairwoman.
<P>
The Joint Committee recommended that the chairmen of the panels should not be appointed by the authority. With regard to the consumer panel, paragraph 127 of its report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We recommend that a requirement that the Chairman of the Panel be appointed by the Treasury after consultation with the FSA be included in the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As for the practitioner panel, paragraph 133 of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We also recommend that a requirement that the Chairman of the Panel be appointed by the Treasury after consultation with the FSA be included in the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Well, it was not.
<P>
We want to go further than that; we want those panels rather than the Treasury to have the right to appoint the chairmen--and most certainly, rather than the authority as is the current position. It would be another way of ensuring further checks and balances, so that the FSA was not seen to hold all the cards in respect of the appointments of members and heads of the panels. That is what the amendments boil down to.
<P>
No doubt the Minister will fall back on the extra check--that is how it will be represented--of the Treasury having to be consulted if the FSA dismisses the chairmen of the panels. How hands-on does the Treasury intend to be in dealing with the everyday issues of the membership of the panels and who their chairmen must be? Surely, in practice, it will take the FSA's recommendation on the nod. For whatever reason, however, the FSA might want to get rid of an especially troublesome chairman.
<P>
The amendment is quite simple, and I can see no reason against it if the right members are appointed to the panels through the due processes in the first place. I fear that leaving the power of appointment solely with the FSA gives the financial community the wrong impression. It would give the FSA the extra power to be slightly unscrupulous if it chose to be, although I do not suggest for a minute that it would. It might, however, want to get rid of a chairman who was more effective and might cause it more trouble.
<P>
The amendment provides a perfectly sensible extra check and balance and will go a long way to reassure the financial community that the panels have teeth, that they are not just showpieces and that they are meaningful.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was struck by your reminder that we have dispatched seven clauses in seven sittings, Mr. Atkinson. I was somewhat dismayed to hear the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs say that the Financial Services Authority and the practitioner and consumer panels should proceed in the way that we have been doing. That does not encourage me to think that we will speed up the process of consultation on the FSA's rules and guidance.
<P>
It is perfectly true that the early part of the Bill contains much of the meat. None the less, we should--this is a general point--be mindful of the fact that the industry is looking to us to make proper progress on the Bill and ensure that it can be put in place no later than Easter next year. The current patchwork of arrangements under which the FSA operates--with remarkable success--cannot be allowed to remain in being until 2000 and 2001, while the Committee wends its way through the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 63 and 65 deal with the appointment of the panel chairmen. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, they intend to allow the panels to elect their own chairmen, rather than having the FSA appoint them. I understand the hon. Gentleman's desire to give the panels greater independence. I should, however, stress that the Joint Committee--of which he was a member--recommended that the chairmen of the panels should be appointed by the Treasury after consultation with the FSA. We recognise the validity of the Committee's view that some element of external oversight in the appointment of the chairmen might provide important assurances as to the independence of the panels. We also believe, however, that the FSA should continue to have the primary responsibility as regards establishing arrangements for consultation on its policies and procedures and--in order to do that--for establishing the two panels. We have, therefore, given the Treasury a role in approving the appointment of the panel chairmen to maintain the useful external control to which the Joint Committee referred. That is consistent with the arrangements for the chairman of the ombudsman and compensation scheme boards to which we will come in due course.
<P>
I should also stress that, in clause 8 and, correspondingly, in clause 9, we have arranged that the Treasury's approval would be required for the dismissal of the chairmen. In that way, the FSA could not, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham feared, simply sack a troublesome chairman who had become a bit too vociferous on some point.
<P>
There is a practical concern, too. It is right for the FSA to appoint the panels because that will ensure the proper standing of the panels as regards their role in relation to the FSA itself. We need to avoid the danger of appearing to recreate the self-regulatory organisations, when a central purpose of the Bill is to replace the SRO regime with a statutory regime. The practitioner panel is being created, as clause 8(1) says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to represent the interests of practitioners''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the FSA. It is not there to establish itself as a separate organisation which might be misunderstood as having some SRO-type role. For that reason, it is right that the FSA should appoint the chairman, particularly as it will also be responsible for appointing members. It would be odd if it were to appoint the members but not the chairman.
<P>
In addition, it is difficult to see how the procedure of enabling panel members to elect their own chairman would sit alongside the requirement for Treasury approval--a requirement that we have included in response to the Joint Committee. That would rather mix up the concepts of election and appointment. It would hardly make sense for the panel to vote for a person, only for the Treasury to refuse approval.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Can the Economic Secretary give examples of other panels or committees that are appointed by an outside body, but which do not have the power to appoint their own chairman? After all, every elector elects councillors to a council, but electors do not have the power to elect the chairman of that council; that is up to its individual members. Members of this House elect their own Speaker--it is not up to electors to elect the Speaker as well. Are there any other examples on which the provision is based?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I cannot think of other examples at the moment. If there are any, I will certainly bring them to the attention of the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We are concerned with providing for arrangements that will be right for the Financial Services Authority. The authority has already established--without being statutorily required to do so--a practitioner panel and a consumer panel, which already play a valuable role. I do not think that the role that a panel could play would be in any sense undermined by the Bill's requirement that the FSA appoint one of the panel members as chairman, subject--as we have now said in response to the Joint Committee--to the approval of the Treasury. I would point out that the FSA board does not elect its own chairman. That is a matter for the Treasury, and properly so.
<P>
In conclusion, we have significantly strengthened the arrangements for the panel to ensure that it represents the interests of practitioners and can provide the FSA with expert advice and a source of consultation. I think that we have got the balance right. I hope that I will not be disappointed again and that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> For the same reasons as before, I cannot be assured. It must be right for members of the two panels to appoint their own chairmen. The Minister was unable to give any other example of a similar body that does not have the right to elect its own chairman.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> A large number of research councils, including the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences research council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences research council, have their chairmen appointed separately from the other members. In the past, chairmen of regional health authorities have been appointed separately. The Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification and the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, which have recently been in the news, have chairmen who are appointed separately from the other members, as does the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. Dozens of chairmen are appointed in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> None of those bodies has anything like the power of the FSA. Although, the hon. Gentleman's point would favour the FSA committee not having the power to appoint its own chairman and/or chief executive, the examples that he gave are not comparable with checking panels within the authority itself, which is what we are discussing. The role of such checking panels is to oversee the whole authority. The examples that he gave are merely the boards at the top of the relevant authorities, so they do not apply. It is perfectly normal for a committee--if its members are trusted and of high calibre, and have been selected properly--to be trusted to appoint its own chairman. Any one of the members could be suitably qualified to be that chairman.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am trying to see a silver lining in the Minister's refusal to accept the suggestion. That silver lining might be that because the Treasury's approval is required, and the clause requires that the practitioner's panel comprises suitable people to represent the interests of practitioners, if a flabby body were to be appointed we could hold Mints responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My right hon. and learned Friend makes a fair point. However, it is not enough of a silver lining to make me want to withdraw the amendment. I should like to press amendment No. 63 to a Division. On the basis of your previous ruling, Mr. Atkinson, I shall press amendment No. 64 rather than amendment No. 65.
