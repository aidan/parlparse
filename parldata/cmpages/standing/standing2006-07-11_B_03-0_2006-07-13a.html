Activity</div><a name="06071347000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed</i>, That this schedule, as amended, be the Third schedule to
the
Bill.</div><a name="06071347000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000193"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I want briefly to explore
paragraph 2(1)(e), on regulated activities, with the Minister. It is
aimed primarily at regulating those who moderate chat rooms or online
discussions forums and is very welcome. However, it refers to</div>
<a name="06071347000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;moderating a public electronic
interactive communication service which is likely to be used...by
children.&#148;</div><a name="06071347000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
amendments have to be tabled on Report, will the Minister consider
whether that provision could apply to electronic interactive
communication services that are used to locate children and thus
interact with them?</div> <a name="06071347000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
raised this issue on Second Reading, because an increasing and
frightening range of electronic services are being used to track
children. Allegedly, such services are meant to promote safety, but
there are huge dangers of potential abuse, despite the current
voluntary code on who should have access to services and other items.
The code is inadequate, and there are too many examples of it not
having been followed. I have called for a licensing system for the
industry in a Bill that happens to have been sponsored by three members
of the Committee&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley
(Kali Mountford), the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
(Annette Brooke) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary
Creagh). I have also had support from within the industry.</div>
<a name="06071347000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the code, someone who is
being tracked is meant to give their consent. In that sense, the system
is interactive, as set out in paragraph 2(1)(e). Often, however, the
electronic interaction is with the child and it might occur with or
without their knowledge. That might be in a situation in which they can
be put in danger, but it is extremely odd to think of a four-year-old,
for example, giving informed consent. That raises the issue of how we
can be sure who is doing the tracking and how it is done. We therefore
need a regulatory system.</div>
<a name="06071347000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under paragraph 2(1)(e), chat
room moderators will rightly be regulated because of their access to
sensitive information and communication channels with children, as well
as the need to regulate who operates 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 96</div>such services and how. However, we need to control location services
that provide electronic access to children. Some services include
information about children&#146;s phone numbers and homes, and the
tasks performed by providers of such services are very similar to those
performed by chat room moderators.</div>
<a name="06071347000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister consider
whether the issue can be covered by paragraph 2(1)(e)? If not, can we
table an amendment to secure at least one element of the regulatory
system and the protection that we need from a mushrooming, scary
industry that is using the latest electronic communications technology
and which falls right within the scope of our efforts in the Bill to
protect vulnerable children? I am happy to talk further to the Minister
about this issue before Report, but I ask him now to see whether it
could be covered. If not, perhaps we could discuss whether an amendment
might be appropriate.</div>
<a name="06071347000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000194"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I support the
comments of the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), but I
wonder whether I could take a few points a bit further by writing to
the Minister over the recess. I am a member of the Home
Secretary&#146;s task force on child protection on the internet, and
various concerns were raised at our meeting about 10 days ago. However,
it was far too difficult to table amendments on the issue, so I should
just like to ask the Minister whether he will be receptive and provide
me with some reassurance that the protection that we need is in the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000195"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills
(Mr. Parmjit Dhanda):</b> It is good to have you
back in the Chair, Mr. Conway. I appreciate the comments of
my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley, who raised this issue on
Second Reading, and I thank her for giving me advance notice of this
debate and a copy of her ten-minute Bill, which made for interesting
reading.</div> <a name="06071347000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
happy to read the letter from the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole. I should also be happy to meet my hon. Friend, who rightly
suggests that this area has seen a great deal of change over a short
time. Before making any changes to the Bill, I would like to satisfy
myself on the level of interaction. The Bill tackles situations in
which there is activity, correspondence and a strong level of
interaction between a child and another child or someone who could be
posing as one. I would want to take a closer look at the issue, but I
should be happy to meet her and have that discussion between now and
the Report stage, and even to read correspondence over the
recess.</div><a name="06071347000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a

of a designated responsible officer of the body, he (as well as the
body) commits an
offence.&#146;.</div><a name="06071347000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000198"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I appreciate that the Minister might find some
technical fault with the amendments, so I shall concentrate on the
sentiment behind them, which is all-important. The core amendment is
amendment No. 106, which has the support of the Parkinson&#146;s
Disease Society. It would require a regulated activity provider to
inform direct payment recipients about the vetting and barring system,
to increase awareness and to offer to undertake an appropriate check on
the individual&#146;s
behalf.</div><a name="06071347000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
backtrack and explain how the issue was dealt with in debates in the
other place, where I understand it was one of the most controversial
issues. My noble Friends argued that people who arranged services for
vulnerable recipients of direct payments should be classed as regulated
activity providers and wanted everybody involved to be vetted and
barred. Probably quite rightly, the Government did not accept that
argument taken to its extreme, because it would have placed a huge
burden on some 2 million carers in the UK, many of whom are family or
friends, perhaps in informal
arrangements.</div><a name="06071347000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction of the direct payments scheme has brought additional
bureaucracy, which has destabilised some long-term caring arrangements
with extra requirements. The last thing that amendment No. 106 is
attempting to do is destabilise arrangements or make already difficult
situations even more difficult; rather, it says that the local
authority, which is likely to be the instigator of the direct payments,
should tell the recipient that the vetting and barring scheme
exists.</div> <a name="06071347000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have all
acknowledged how complicated the system is, and the recipients of
direct payments will not have much time or inclination to work their
way through the complexities of the legislation. Amendment No. 106 is
intended to say that the local authority should say to the recipient of
the direct payments, &#147;This system exists&#151;would like
assistance to do any checking on the carers you&#146;re going to use?
If you&#146;re quite satisfied, because you&#146;ve known them for
20-odd years, we needn&#146;t take it any further.&#148; In other
words, amendment No. 106 is permissive. However, taken together, the
amendments would place a duty on the local authority or whomever to
alert the recipient to the fact that the new system exists and to give
assistance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div><a name="06071347000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister cannot accept
the wording, I hope that he will accept the idea as a compromise that
would meet the many concerns that have been raised. The direct payments
scheme is becoming a bigger and bigger way to provide care. It is a
good way to give people choice, but we want a bit of a safety net when
that choice is
exercised.</div><a name="06071347000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000199"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): Welcome back
to the Chair, Mr. Conway. I shall say a few words in support
of the amendments. They are sensible. As she has said, it is an area of
care for vulnerable people that will grow. The Government rightly
support direct payments, and many authorities throughout the country
have pushed them.</div> <a name="06071347000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also fit in with the Government policy, which we share, of
encouraging as many people as possible to stay at home for as long as
possible, but only where due and appropriate support is available. It
should not be done by continually raising the threshold qualifying them
for residential care without providing sufficient support to ensure
that they, particularly elderly people, can stay at home without harm
or injury.</div><a name="06071347000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
increasing number of people will use the direct payments scheme to
engage the services of complete strangers to help clean their homes, do
their shopping and provide other health-related and personal services.
Such people will be put into a strong position of trust and will be
able to take advantage of vulnerable people should they be so minded. I
am sure that a few people will get into the system in order to take
advantage of vulnerable people. Although the vast majority of people
offering services through direct payments will not, the Bill is about
weeding out bad
apples.</div><a name="06071347000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be an
excessive obligation to require every person offering such services to
be vetted. It could cause enormous delay for people trying to exercise
direct payments, and could lead to a diminution of choice for those
trying to engage the services of somebody about whom they might know
very little. It is eminently sensible and not too onerous a new
obligation on local authorities simply to inform a vulnerable person or
their carer&#151;if there is a part-time carer, somebody with a power
of attorney or an appropriate person&#151;about the availability of
the vetting system, and that they might like to avail themselves of it
before taking a firm decision about whom their direct payments will go
to.</div><a name="06071347000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would enhance the Bill by providing an extra safeguard for the growing
part of the population that belongs to one of the vulnerable groups
that we are discussing. The amendments would achieve that without being
unduly onerous on local authorities, which after all will be
responsible for organising direct payments. A reminder of the
service&#146;s availability would therefore not be too great an
additional
requirement.</div><a name="06071347000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000200"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Ivan
Lewis):</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Conway.
This is the first time that I have spoken in Committee with you in the
Chair, and it is good to see you.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div><a name="06071347000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">This debate is sensible and
important. The concepts of direct payments and individual budgets are
at the heart of public service reform, empowering individuals with far
more control over the services provided for them. It is right to make
the point, as did the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim
Loughton), that that will be a significant part of how services are
provided in future.</div><a name="06071347000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must strike the right balance. We must ensure that people receive
appropriate protection and safeguards without undermining the principle
of empowering them by giving them more control and choice. We must not
place onerous and undue requirements on them but must give them every
assistance and support to ensure that they can employ anybody they
choose, either on their own behalf or on behalf of a family friend or
relative.</div><a name="06071347000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Individual
budgets and direct payments will be a greater part of the mainstream
care system than they have been. We are running 13 pilots at the moment
for individual budgets, and we want to learn from those before we
decide whether to roll out individual budgets as a national option or
an entitlement for
people.</div><a name="06071347000169"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="06071347000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should be
trying to incorporate into those 13 pilots, which are at an early
stage, a means to ensure that people understand their right to seek
information and make the necessary checks so that they have the maximum
protection. During those pilots, I shall certainly look at lessons that
can be learned.</div><a name="06071347000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 105, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to
bring a family member or friend within the definition of a regulated
activity provider. We should enable and assist relatives and friends to
have the right to make the necessary checks, but it would be
inappropriate to oblige them to do so by
statute.</div><a name="06071347000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 106, we agree that all individuals in receipt of a direct payment
should be aware of the vetting and barring scheme, and of their right
to engage with it. I shall try to assure hon. Members. In another
place, we gave a commitment to introduce a Government amendment placing
a duty on local councils to inform direct payment recipients of their
right to engage with the new scheme. As hon. Members are aware, we have
tabled that amendment, and either I or the Under-Secretary of State for
Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester
(Mr. Dhanda), will speak to it later. That should meet the
intention of the amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole and for Brent, East (Sarah
Teather).</div><a name="06071347000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition&#151;I hope that this gives further assurance to the
Committee&#151;we are exploring how people who require help in making
checks can be assisted by local authorities. We envisage direct payment
support services playing a key role in that area. The new scheme will
allow all private, domestic employers, including direct payment
recipients or their nominees, to check an individual&#146;s status in
the scheme online, or via other means. At this stage, we do not think
that it is necessary to put a requirement on local councils to do that
on an individual&#146;s behalf.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div><a name="06071347000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 107 relating to
criminal offences&#151;I do not think that the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole referred directly to it&#151;the Bill
provides already for a number of offences, where appropriate. We are
not convinced by the argument for specific or additional offences in
respect of direct payments and individual budgets. Therefore, although
it is right that we send a strong message about the consequences of
breaching the law, to introduce specific offences relating to those
issues is neither necessary nor
desirable.</div><a name="06071347000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I like to
think that we have given way significantly since the debate began in
the other place. We are all learning as the concept of individual
budgets and direct payments develops and we will need to reflect on the
lessons learned. However, I think that the Bill just about strikes the
right balance between enabling and supporting people to have access to
the relevant vetting process and procedures and not placing an
inappropriate duty on them. It will give them more freedom and control
over the choice of care provided. On that basis, I ask hon. Members not
to press their
amendments.</div><a name="06071347000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000201"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for his comforting words. At
this stage I shall be happy not to press the amendments. However,
although I did not refer specifically to amendment No. 107, I do think
that, if we consider the matter important, it needs to have some legal
force. For example, in children&#146;s legislation, we had to clearly
make a person responsible within a local authority. In this area, we
have seen so much buck-passing over the years that, if we consider it
to be of importance, we must be clear that there is a designated person
who has
responsibility.</div><a name="06071347000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 107 follows if we accept the logic of amendment No. 106 that we
cannot leave direct payments out of the whole scheme. We must bring
them in, as the Minister says, in such a way that they are not a burden
and do not upset long-standing arrangements, but give the necessary
protection. I may revisit the matter, but given the Minister&#146;s
comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

7</h4><a name="06071347000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Barred
person not to engage in regulated
activity</div><a name="06071347000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000202"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Maria Miller</b> (Basingstoke) (Con): I beg to move amendment
No. 136, in clause 7, page 4, line 14, leave out subsection
(3).</div><a name="06071347000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment was
originally intended to be read alongside another amendment, which
unfortunately was not selected. We have made the Minister&#146;s
office aware of that, so that he understands the tenor of this debate.
The amendment seeks to remove from the Bill the defence of an
individual not knowing that they were barred. We shall seek to add a
further amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 101</div>to ensure that the clause makes it clear that it is an offence for an
individual intentionally to mislead an employer about their barred
status.</div> <a name="06071347000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we know,
the clause creates an offence, punishable by up to five years&#146;
imprisonment, of seeking to engage in regulated activity if barred. It
also allows for an individual to put forward a defence of not knowing
that they were barred from regulated activity, or that they could not
reasonably have been expected to know that they were barred. It is
clear from those particular provisions that it is not the
Government&#146;s intention to criminalise people who may have been
barred but for whatever reason are not aware of that
situation.</div><a name="06071347000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">This debate
was had in the other place but we feel that it is important to continue
it. The reason why we tabled the amendment is that a broad scope of
regulated activities is included in schedule 3, meaning that many
thousands of people who are not involved directly in teaching or caring
will fall under the schedule&#146;s provisions. It is easy to imagine
a situation where an individual who has been barred may not be fully
aware of the wide range and extent of the activities that are covered
in the barring process.</div>
<a name="06071347000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The vetting procedure would,
for the most part, ensure that any of those barred people would not be
able to work face-to-face with any vulnerable groups covered in the
Bill. As the Minister will be aware, the criminal act includes seeking
or offering to engage in activity from which an individual is barred;
it is not only working with vulnerable groups or children, but offering
or seeking to engage in that employment. It is important that we focus
on that point.</div> <a name="06071347000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, this is an important issue that was debated at length in the
other place. Indeed, Lord Adonis provided clarification on Report on
the issue. In underlining the need to address it, he set out quite a
lot of detail on how the procedure will work, particularly on how
barred people will be informed of their status. The system sounds
robust, but its complexity&#151;the number of activities that will be
subject to monitoring and barring&#151;means that more discussion is
needed.</div><a name="06071347000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has assured us on a number of occasions in the debate that there will
be a great deal of communication about the Bill with those who are
barred and with the employers of those who will be monitored or subject
to barring. Our concern is that the Bill&#146;s complexity means that
people could put themselves forward for employment without any
intention whatever of undertaking a criminal act, and that they will be
criminalised and subject to quite severe penalty. The amendment, hand
in hand with subsequent amendments that would include a requirement of
intention to mislead, is a way of closing what we feel is a loophole in
the Bill. I look forward to hearing from the Minister whether any
further thought has been given to the issue since the debate in the
other place.</div>
<a name="06071347000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000203"></a><b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I heard the context of the
hon. Lady&#146;s proposed amendments and I am sympathetic to her
sentiments. In his reply, will the Minister explain why the Government
decided to draw the clause so broadly that individuals will have to
prove that they did not know, rather than prove that they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div>were acting misleadingly? The narrower definition would be much more
likely to criminalise the people that the Government are seeking to
criminalise, and would avoid catching many others who would not
otherwise be caught under the umbrella.</div>
<a name="06071347000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government obviously intend
to protect vulnerable children and adults rather than criminalise such
other people, but there is already plenty of other legislation with
that purpose, and it is inappropriate to criminalise those who, as the
hon. Lady said, may not understand the full scope of regulated
activity. They may understand that they have been barred from one
activity but, as we discussed on Tuesday, there is difficulty in
defining exactly what is meant by regulated activity and it is
perfectly conceivable that a barred person may not appreciate that
other forms of activity may bring them into the category that would
cause them to be criminalised. Will the Minister therefore say why the
Government decided to draw the provision so broadly and whether they
might consider an amendment on Report that would narrow the
definition?</div><a name="06071347000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000204"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> First, it is important to say that I entirely
understand what the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs.
Miller) said about intentionally misleading. We are at one on
that&#151;it is the Government&#146;s intention that it be covered
in the Bill. The amendment relates to the clause that will make it a
criminal offence for a barred person to engage, seek to engage or offer
to engage in a regulated activity. However, it is a defence to prove
that the person did not know, and could not reasonably have been
expected to know, that he was barred. The amendment would remove the
defence.</div><a name="06071347000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 12
of schedule 2 imposes an obligation on the IBB to take all reasonable
steps to notify a person that he is barred. Clearly, it would be unfair
to penalise individuals who did not know that they were barred because,
despite best efforts, the IBB had been unable to contact them. We hope
that such situations are kept to a minimum, but removing that defence
would criminalise people unreasonably. We do not seek to do that;
hence, we oppose the amendment. However, underlying the amendment is a
concern to ensure that barred individuals who apply for work without
realising that such work is a regulated activity are not criminalised.
That also covers what the hon. Member for Brent, East was trying to
say.</div> <a name="06071347000170"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
<a name="06071347000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand hon.
Members&#146; concern, and we do not wish to criminalise individuals
unfairly. However, we will ensure that the scheme is well publicised
and we will issue guidance to provide further detail about what type of
activity will be a regulated activity. Furthermore, when an individual
is informed that they are barred, the intention is that the types of
activity for which they are barred will be explained to them.</div>





<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000205"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> Given the difficulty that we had on Tuesday
defining exactly what regulated activity was, does not the Minister
concede that it would be perfectly logical for somebody else to be
unable to appreciate the full extent of the activities from which they
may be barred?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 103</div><a name="06071347000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000206"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I take on board that point but, at the same time,
the hon. Lady must understand the situation when, for example, a
predatory paedophile applies to work in a school. Many people in
regulated activities are part of the school work force. That is a
simple example of why we need the provision. People may try, perhaps
deliberately, to get into those workplaces, and the Bill exists, so
that we can err on the side of caution and protect children. That is a
relevant part of the issue.</div>
<a name="06071347000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000207"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> The point that the hon. Member for Basingstoke
and I made was that, if we redrafted the clause so that it specifically
ruled out behaviour that intended to mislead, such as applying in a
false name or the Minister&#146;s example, it would capture those
individuals but not others who did not intend to act
criminally.</div>
<a name="06071347000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000208"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> As I have already said, we do not wish to
criminalise those who genuinely do not know or have not been informed,
but that is a matter for the police, who will have to consider the
evidence. The judgment is best made by them, rather than us, because we
would have to come up with a prescriptive list of circumstances, to
which the hon. Lady seems to allude. We cannot do that, and it is more
effective to rely on the police to do their job. The right thing to do
is to err on the side of caution, and on the side of those vulnerable
adults and children who need protecting.</div>
<a name="06071347000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend that there should be
a widespread communications campaign to ensure that all groups affected
by the Bill know their new responsibilities and consult with
stakeholders on the most appropriate methods for information
dissemination. We will use a range of media, including the trade press,
websites, newsletters and practitioner workshops and seminars, to get
the message across.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000209"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Given that the Minister has written into the Bill
an ability for the Government to change what falls into the regulated
activity category, does he anticipate ongoing communication with those
people who are barred in order to update them on the changes that are
made? I understand what he says about the power of advertising and
placing advertisements in the trade press, but surely we cannot rely on
individuals to read magazines to keep themselves up to date with the
process. Does he expect a continuing dialogue with those who are
barred, so that they are fully up to date with any changes that the
Government make?</div>
<a name="06071347000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000210"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> It is important to do so. It is also important to
remember that, when barred individuals apply for a post in a regulated
activity area, people will be able to check that they are subject to
monitoring and then block their application. I take on board the point
that the hon. Member for Basingstoke makes about discouraging people
from applying in the first place to work in areas of regulated activity
in which they are not entitled to work.</div>
<a name="06071347000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000211"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am sorry but clearly I did not make myself as
clear as I meant to earlier. The issue is about not employers knowing,
but the individuals applying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div>for employment knowing. In the circumstances that we are discussing, it
is a criminal offence to seek or offer to engage in employment, so it
is fundamental that the Government should undertake such
communication.</div> <a name="06071347000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall press the Minister a little further. Will the IBB have an
obligation to conduct a communications campaign directly with those who
are barred? If so, does the Minister have costings for that? Given the
40,000 discretionary judgments that the IBB will undertake, will it
have the capacity to undertake what will be a complex process? Would it
not be easier to follow the line of argument that we have advanced and
remove the provision to make the process much
simpler?</div><a name="06071347000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000212"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> We should not be looking to create a simpler
process if that would put vulnerable adults and children at risk. I
already answered the hon. Lady&#146;s question earlier&#151;we
intend to inform those who are barred about the activities in which
they are and are not entitled to take part. We shall update that as
well.</div><a name="06071347000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000213"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): Will the Minister confirm
that it will be standard practice for an employer to include in the job
description and person specification the fact that the job would be
barred to anyone on the barred lists? That would mean that anyone
barred who was taking the initial step of applying for a job and
seeking the application form would immediately have that information
before them and not apply for the
job.</div><a name="06071347000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000214"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I cannot say to my hon. Friend that job adverts
will say that the job is available only to people who are not barred
from working with the relevant groups, any more than happens at the
moment in advertisements for head teachers&#146; and teachers&#146;
jobs. That would be a broad commitment to make, and I cannot make it
per se. However, as I said, it is important that we communicate as
broadly as we can with everybody on barred lists and all employers and
regulated activity providers to ensure that they know what is required
of them. We undertake to do
that.</div><a name="06071347000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000215"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> May I clarify the point? I was thinking not about
the advertising for the job, but the person specification and job
description. The advert might well be general, but the information
should be provided when the individual rings to say that they are
interested and receives details from the employer. Most employers would
be vigilant in ensuring that such information was given to anyone who
sought to enter their
employment.</div><a name="06071347000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000216"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I shall take my hon. Friend&#146;s interesting
point on board and consider it. It is important that the barred
applicant should know in the first instance that they should not be
applying for the job. If we do that in the first place, such situations
should not arise.</div><a name="06071347000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have clarified that the important thing for the Government
is to err on the side of caution and protect vulnerable groups. I hope
that the hon. Member for Basingstoke sees fit to withdraw her
amendment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 105</div><a name="06071347000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000217"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for his detailed response,
although I remain most concerned. We have discussed the role of the IBB
in communicating information and the issue of including communication
as part of a statutory obligation. That has been dismissed as
inappropriate by the Government, although we have received strong
assurances that communication will be effective. I was surprised to
hear that the Minister feels that the police should decide how this
part of the law should be interpreted. Obviously, the police interpret
the law, but it is made clear by the Bill, which leaves several other
things unclear, that it is a criminal offence to seek to engage, or
offer to engage, in the relevant activity.</div>
<a name="06071347000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have discussed, there is
nothing in the Bill to provide that those who act in that way commit a
criminal offence only if they are seeking to mislead an employer. It is
purely the act of seeking, or offering, to engage in the activity that
constitutes a criminal act. I therefore find it difficult to see how
the police could come to any conclusion other than that individuals on
the barred list who put themselves forward for employment were doing
something they should not, and that action should be taken accordingly.
Unless the Minister has other information to share with the Committee,
surely that is the intention in the
Bill.</div><a name="06071347000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000218"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I should be intrigued to hear from the hon. Lady
who she thinks should decide whether an offence has or has not been
committed, if it is not the
police.</div><a name="06071347000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000219"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The reason for the Bill is to define what the
House considers to be an offence. It is clear in the Bill that the
Government consider it should be an offence for someone who is barred
to seek to engage in regulated activity, or offer to do so. If the
Minister does not think so, perhaps we should proceed with the
amendment, which is widely supported in the Committee. If he does not
think that the police should pursue the issues, we can, obviously,
amend the clause accordingly. I remain concerned, and we shall perhaps
seek to revisit the matter later. In the meantime, perhaps the Minister
could think further about the debate that we have had today, and about
the degree of concern expressed by hon. Members of different parties. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071347000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000222"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> There are three amendments in the group, one of
which was tabled by Conservative Front-Bench Members, and one of which
has joint support. The principle behind them is the same. They deal
with the question whether the categories of establishments in which the
relevant regulated activity is carried out are broadly enough defined.
Of course the issue arises of whether to confine the provisions to
cover those most at risk or whether to cast the net further. I think it
is important to ensure that we assess the risks in more educational and
health institutions than are set out in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06071347000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 1 ties in with
amendment No. 2; it could almost be a computer cut-and-paste, as the
two amendments together would transfer further education institutions
from the provisions on controlled activity to the provisions on
regulated activity. I raised the issue on Second Reading in an
intervention. I could not see that there should be a distinction
between further education establishments and schools, in the matter of
ancillary workers, given the 14-to-19 agenda. That encourages the idea,
which I support, that children will move between institutions, fully
engaging in their new curriculum and studying in different contexts.
What on earth will be the difference, as the agenda
extends?</div><a name="06071347000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">My local
further education establishment has an enormous array of special
educational needs courses. It is the usual route from a special school
to the local college and is promoted the most for younger people with
special needs. We could argue that it is promoted for vulnerable
children more than for others. I do not understand why further
education should be included in that section. The response that I
received from the Minister for Children and Families on Second Reading
was that we should scrutinise such issues in
Committee.</div><a name="06071347000171"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000223"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> It is obviously difficult to know what should
and should not be in the Bill. It would be helpful to learn whether the
hon. Lady is asking for more areas to be included in regulated
activity, given that she has said previously that we might be including
too many areas. I realise that it is difficult to strike a balance, but
is she asking for more regulation or saying that we already have too
many regulated
activities?</div><a name="06071347000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000224"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Further education colleges are included in the
Bill. At present, they are in the controlled activity area, presumably
on the basis that a large number of further education students are
over 18 years old. However, we are on the cusp of a change
with the 14 to 19 agenda, and children will move interchangeably
between colleges and schools, so there should be a regulated activity
aspect. For example, the school caretaker or the college site manager
should be subject to the same degree of checking and barring as those
in regulated activity. A lot of the Bill stems from the Ian Huntley
case when a school caretaker was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 107</div>subject to the same checks as a school teacher. With a controlled
activity, the catering people, site managers and others in a further
education college will be treated differently from those at a school. I
should like the Minister to respond to such matters. I am talking about
the difference of treatment of ancillary
workers.</div><a name="06071347000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000225"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> My hon. Friend may recall that, when I raised the
matter in response to the statement that the Secretary of State made on
the Audit Commission report, he undertook to look at it. I have not
heard from him, so it would be helpful if the Minister could explain
why FE has been treated slightly
differently.</div><a name="06071347000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000226"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank my hon. Friend. I recall clearly the
important statement made by the Secretary of State about the Ofsted
inspection and how staff were being checked. There was a positive
response to her suggestion that, as we move to the 14 to 19 agenda,
further education colleges should be treated exactly the same as
schools.</div><a name="06071347000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
picks up a point that has been made on the Conservative Benches about
checks on members of governing bodies. As the Bill is drafted,
governors of further education colleges are not checked in the same way
as governors of schools. That is why the amendment is necessary. I
remind members of the Committee that I am concerned not only about the
14 to 19 agenda but about particularly vulnerable young people with
special needs at colleges, and as long as they can still receive
funding, there will also be adults with learning disabilities
continuing with their courses at further education colleges.</div>
<a name="06071347000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The area that we are discussing
is important. I hope that the Minister will make a positive response.
Furthermore, I hope that I have made it crystal clear why I suggest
this simple movement of category. We must take on board the nature of a
further education college in the 21st century. It may have been
reasonable in the past to treat further education colleges as the Bill
does, but I do not think that it is
now.</div><a name="06071347000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support
amendment No. 137, but I will leave comments on it to others. We tabled
amendmentNo. 114 in response to the excellent speech by
thehon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood
(Mrs. Humble) on Second Reading. I asked her whether she
would mind if I tabled an amendment, and I spoke to her this morning on
the way here to explain what I intended to say. I want to make it clear
that I am not trying to steal anyone&#146;s thunder. I was extremely
moved by her speech on Second Reading, and it was noticeable that the
Minister, in summing up the debate, did not provide any answers in this
area, so I very much want it to be considered in detail in
Committee.</div><a name="06071347000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important area: many families have experienced heartbreaking
situations. It is easy to say, &#147;Oh, that involves the Ministry
of Defence; it has nothing to do with this,&#148; but the Bill is
designed to safeguard vulnerable groups of people and that should
include raw recruits, if I can put it that way, who are under 18. I am
talking about young people who probably have not left home and may not
have experienced the wider world until they entered a military
education or training establishment.</div>

said:</div><a name="06071347000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
acutely aware of the pain and anger that arises from the suspicion that
those with responsibility for the care of children fail to protect
young recruits from sexual abuse.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 19 June 2006; Vol. 447, c.
1106.]</div><a name="06071347000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">She gave a particularly
telling quotation from the inquiry and review carried out by Nicholas
Blake QC on the tragic deaths at Deepcut barracks. As she said, at the
close of the review recommendation 12
states:</div><a name="06071347000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Instructors
should be vetted for their suitability to work with young people,
applying standards that are no less rigorous than those applied to
civilian establishments educating or training people under
18.&#148;</div><a name="06071347000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Lady said, the Bill is intended to provide proper arrangements for
vetting people working with children and barring those who are
unsuitable, so we are asking why on earth military establishments
should be excluded from it. As she also said, child abuse cases in
schools and the outcry about staff not being subject to enhanced
Criminal Records Bureau checks concern all parents, but the Deepcut and
Beyond families point out that problems also exist in military training
establishments. I understand that non-commissioned officers and
civilian staff are not subject to Criminal Records Bureau disclosures
of any kind. That is absolutely shocking. No parent who is passing over
their child to be cared for, in a sense&#151;someone else is to take
on the parental responsibility&#151;can have any idea that that is
the situation, and the issue is not only that checks are not made, but
that there are outcomes from that. The hon. Lady went on to give a
number of examples from parents who were totally bewildered to discover
that the checks were not made. That is absolutely incredible, which is
why her speech was so
moving.</div><a name="06071347000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dipped a
little further into the Deepcut review by Nicholas Blake QC and I
picked up another paragraph, with which I shall conclude my remarks on
the
amendment:</div><a name="06071347000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Review recommends that the Army applies, as a matter of best practice,
no less rigorous checks on the background of its instructors who will
supervise recruits and trainees under 18 than would apply in civilian
life, particularly in a residential boarding school. Such information
could no doubt be accessed through RMP files and personnel records. If
the present state of the law proves an obstacle, the Review would
recommend that military service is identified as an exception to the
position of employers
generally.&#148;</div><a name="06071347000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
can dig that strong recommendation out from the Deepcut review. We have
a duty to consider this important exclusion from the Bill and the lack
of checks that has resulted in some dreadful
outcomes.</div><a name="06071347000109"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000227"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I must draw attention to an error in the
amendment paper: the names of the hon. Members for St. Albans (Anne
Main) and for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) have been
mistakenly added to amendments Nos. 137 and 114. I apologise for that;
their names will be withdrawn. They do not sign blank cheques
either.</div><a name="06071347000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000228"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole feels deflated because she does not have the support of
my hon. Friends the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 109</div>Members for St. Albans and for Reading, East, whose names were added to
her amendments in error. I shall mention her amendment before talking
to amendment No. 137, correctly tabled in my name and that of my hon.
Friends.</div><a name="06071347000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
sympathy with amendment No. 1, which goes to the heart of the problem
of when children stop being children&#151;particularly those with
learning disabilities for whom special provisions need to be made when
they reach 18 but will continue in various educational or support
establishments. It is an anomaly why governors of such establishments,
which deal with vulnerable people, are not covered by the Bill, whereas
governors of other educational institutions are. I am confused about
why the explanatory notes do not say what subsections (3), (4) or (5)
are intended to achieve and why certain things have been left out of
them. I have some sympathy with including additional educational
institutions that the hon. Lady mentioned. I am interested in hearing
what the Minister has to say in defence of keeping them
out.</div><a name="06071347000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have less
sympathy with the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment No. 114, although I
endorse all her comments about the telling speech made by the hon.
Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood. Problems with recruits in
certain Army barracks are rightly the subject of ongoing
investigations. The people responsible for those institutions need to
get their act together and provide assurances to the House, those
serving and those who may be considering serving in the forces.
However, although I am not trying to pre-empt the Minister, the way in
which the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment is phrased could cause great
confusion. She refers
to</div><a name="06071347000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a military training
or educational establishment with recruits and trainees under
18&#148;,</div><a name="06071347000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">but because the Army
can recruit from the age of 17, that would presumably mean that an
entire training or educational establishment that takes on recruits,
including senior Army people who happen to be part of it, would be
subject to all the vetting and barring. Under no definition could those
recruits be construed as vulnerable adults. Indeed, if they could be,
what place would they have performing such a potentially dangerous task
as serving in the
military?</div><a name="06071347000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000229"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but is it not also the case that the Armed
Forces Bill, which is currently proceeding through the House, includes
measures for the protection of new recruits to all the armed forces?
Those who are under 18 would receive special protection under the
provisions of that Bill, so the amendment is not
necessary.</div><a name="06071347000172"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000230"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am not as familiar with that piece of
legislation as the hon. Lady is, but it is greatly reassuring that it
includes those checks and balances. They will remove the requirement
for the amendment in its current form, which has enormous implications
for a raft of military institutions that it is not intended to cover
but that happen to take on a small number of recruits at the age of 17.
As specific provisions of a dedicated Bill can be applied to them, the
hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 110</div>Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole might wish to reconsider the
amendment.</div> <a name="06071347000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment No. 137 is a probing amendment, which was largely instigated
because the explanatory notes are unclear on what is covered under the
definitions of &#147;establishments&#148;, in clause 8(5), and the
governing bodies of such establishments. I want to give just one
example of where an establishment might fall between two
stools.</div>
<a name="06071347000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recently
visited a fantastic charity-run establishment in Surrey, a residential
establishment looking after young people with severe learning and
physical disabilities. Most of them were in wheelchairs and most had
profound learning disabilities. The charity, which has been running for
many years and is connected with Great Ormond Street, provides a
fantastic, unparalleled service to those young people. Alas, there are
not enough institutions like
that.</div><a name="06071347000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That charity is
not strictly</div> <a name="06071347000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
educational institution which is exclusively or mainly for the
provision of full-time education to
children&#148;,</div><a name="06071347000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">as specified
by subsection (5)(a), however. By their very nature, those young people
could not have full-time education. It is difficult to define a lot of
their classroom time as education in the sense that we might
understand. A lot of their daytime is spent on more therapeutic, health
and other caring services, which is not strictly education. Some
fantastic educational work is certainly done, giving skills to those
young people in their disadvantaged circumstances, but such an
institution would not necessarily fall within the definition in the
clause.</div><a name="06071347000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should make
it clear that I have nothing but praise for that institution. I have
absolutely no reason to think that anything bad goes on there, but
there could be similar places, to which certain individuals might be
able to find their way and have access to physically and mentally
vulnerable children, whom they could then take advantage of. The
purpose of amendment No. 137 is to add residential health institutions
to the list of establishments in subsection (5), because places such as
the one that I have described fall between a healthand
therapeutic establishment and an educational
establishment.</div><a name="06071347000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 137 is not phrased in the best way, and I am sure that the Minister
has all sorts of criticisms based on the unintended consequences that
it could cause. The point of it, however, is to ask him to reconsider
the phrasing of the definition in the clause, because there is no
clarification about that in the explanatory notes. Strictly speaking,
some institutions would not be covered by that, so some people with bad
intentions could gain access to a governing body and not be subject to
some of the barring and vetting procedures to which they would be
subject under other provisions in the Bill. Will the Minister look
again at the definitions or give some reassurance that such
establishments are covered by other definitions in the Bill that are
not made clear in the
clause?</div><a name="06071347000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000231"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The amendments extend the definition of regulated
activity in relation to children to governors of further education
institutions, military training or educational establishments and
residential health institutions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div><a name="06071347000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides already that governors of institutions, primarily for the
full-time education of children and of maintained nursery schools, must
be subject to monitoring and requirements to check. So the bar will
apply because the role of governor places the individual in a position
of trust and gives them the opportunity of contact with children, and a
role in appointing staff with significant contact with
children.</div><a name="06071347000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Governors of
FE institutions delivering full-time education, mainly or exclusively
to children, will be subject to those requirements. Furthermore, if a
governor of an FE institution teaches or supervises children
frequently, or carries out another activity mentioned in paragraph 2(1)
of schedule 3, he will be engaging in regulated activity and the same
requirements will
apply.</div><a name="06071347000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
must ask themselves whether they want a catch-all system in which, for
example, the instructor of an adult pottery class will be barred from
running that class because they are on the children&#146;s list. That
would be the consequence of the amendment saying that all FE
institutions should be treated the
same.</div><a name="06071347000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sympathetic
to the argument about the changing role of FE institutions, which is
why they are included as controlled activity providers. Principals in
FE institutions can put those safeguards in place using common sense
and with an awareness of their staff and those in regular contact with
children.</div><a name="06071347000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000232"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am still slightly confused by what the
Minister is saying. He has given examples of part-time or voluntary
pottery teachers, but subsection (3) refers only to members of a
governing body of specific establishments, so I am not sure why his
comments are
relevant.</div><a name="06071347000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000233"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am digressing and responding to the hon. Member
for Mid-Dorset and North Poole who asked specifically about further
education and regulated activity. However, I hope that I explained also
the point about governors during my contribution. I hope that I made
that clear, but I am happy to reiterate the point if I did
not.</div><a name="06071347000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 1
would capture governors of all FE institutions, including those working
at a working men&#146;s college, for example, who deliver exclusively
adult education, and place a duty on some institutions and governors
when clearly inappropriate. The Bill should be proportionate. I accept
that, as the hon. Lady said, the role of those institutions can change.
If the roles change, activities considered regulated and controlled can
change also. However, we want to get it right for the situation as it
is at the
moment.</div><a name="06071347000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071347000234"></a><b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): May I seek clarification? I
understood that governors were covered because possibly they have some
control over the appointment of staff. Would that view extend to
trustees of charities that work with vulnerable children, which will
have some control also over the appointment of staff and so have a
similar role to such governors? As the Minister mentioned, very few
governors teach 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div>children, but they do have control over the staffing and running of the
school. Very few indulge in teaching, particularly as many are
appointed by councils, which they represent. In that case, should we
considering a wider pool of the people who have anything to do with
appointments for vulnerable children or
adults?</div><a name="06071347000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000235"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am trying to stay as close as I can to the
amendments. Some governors do have a role in selecting staff, which is
why it is particularly important that they should be involved. The
wider roles that the hon. Lady mentioned are covered in other parts of
the Bill. I am happy to drop her a note about trustees if she wishes to
follow it up.</div><a name="06071347000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move
to amendment No. 114, because it is important. The amendment refers to
military training establishments, which do not have governing bodies,
as they are under the control of a commanding officer. Unlike schools,
they deliver training and education to adults, which includes 16 and
17-year-olds serving in the armed forces. Unlike other organisations in
which individuals work with 16 and 17-year-olds in the course of the
child&#146;s employment, the armed forces will be specifically
allowed by the Bill to check the scheme status of those who supervise
or train under-18s. I hope that that satisfies some of the legitimate
concerns of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole.</div><a name="06071347000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
137 would make it mandatory for governors of residential health
institutions that provide children&#146;s health care to be subject
to monitoring. Not all health institutions have governors, and the
governors of those that do might have no contact with children or any
role in appointing staff. The Bill already requires governors of
residential health institutions who frequently care for, supervise or
carry out another activity mentioned in schedule 3(2)(1) to be subject
to monitoring. We have carefully considered such settings. I hope that,
taking all that into consideration, hon. Members will not press their
amendments.</div><a name="06071347000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000236"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Perhaps I might respond on amendment No. 137. I
am not entirely convinced by what the Minister said. He did not respond
to the specific example that I gave. The amendment is designed not to
cover various health institutions that happen to have governors but to
expand the definition of an educational establishment that does not
offer full-time education, as the clause puts it, &#147;exclusively
or mainly&#148;.</div><a name="06071347000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
example that I gave might be rare, but there will be such examples. I
do not think that the institution involved could be
classified&#151;one could certainly make a strong case that it should
not be&#151;as
being</div><a name="06071347000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exclusively or
mainly for the provision of full-time
education&#148;.</div><a name="06071347000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There appears
to be a kind of halfway house, which falls between two stools, that
provides education but predominantly provides care, therapy and
therapeutic services to severely mentally and physically disabled young
people. I do not think that the Bill covers the governors of such
institutions, which could be run as small private charities not subject
to the normal attention from the local education authority, for
example. We need to ensure that people cannot effectively hide in just
that sort of institution, obtain a position of responsibility and then
abuse.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div><a name="06071347000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000237"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that where the staff
have the regular contact with children that he describes, they will be
covered under regulated
activity.</div><a name="06071347000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000238"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful and not surprised by that
assurance. The Minister is discussing staff, but the clause deals with
governors. However, I just wanted to place that thought in his mind.
The definitions are broad, and certain institutions that deal with the
most vulnerable children will not necessarily be
covered.</div><a name="06071347000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
Ministers seem to want to contribute at this
point.</div><a name="06071347000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06071347000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000239"></a>Mr.
Lewis:</b> This is an important issue in terms of places where
vulnerable adults are being cared for on a full-time basis. There might
be ambiguity about whether they are in education, care or a combination
of the two. The term &#147;governor&#148; is quite important. An
educational institution is likely to be run by a board of governors. If
it were more of a care-type institution, it is more likely that the
equivalent would be charitable trustees or a board of people of that
nature. Therefore the term &#147;governors&#148; is generally
understood in the context of an organisation predominantly providing
education, whereas if it were predominately about care, it would either
be a board of management or a group of
trustees.</div><a name="06071347000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000240"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point but he said
&#147;more likely&#148; and &#147;generally&#148;, not
exclusively. That leaves a raft of institutions that may not be
covered. We need to ensure that all of them are covered. He refers
purely to governors. As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans said,
there are organisations run by other classes of people who are not
governors. The reference is only to members of the governing body. Does
that include charitable trustees or directors of, for example, a
charitable company?</div><a name="06071347000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am a director of a charitable company that is considering taking over
the management of an arts education facility, which has been provided
as a section 106 gain to the local authority. I wonder&#151;now I
think about it&#151;whether I would be covered. I am part of the
governing body but I am not a governor. We are not offering mainly, or
exclusively, full-time education to children. However, I will be in a
position, if we take over management of that facility, to engage
members of staff&#151;who may or may not be subject to vetting
procedures&#151;who will be opening up the premises and involved with
children. That is part of our charitable trust remit. On the basis of
what is in this Bill, I am not sure whether I and fellow directors of
this charitable company, who are the governing body effectively, will
be covered. Therefore, many anomalies are still creeping
in&#151;which the Minister is now going to
allay.</div><a name="06071347000143"></a>

Shoreham&#151;I will clarify where it is in the Bill. What I can
confirm is that if he is a trustee of a charity and that charity is

covered.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000242"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Strictly speaking, I am a director of a
charitable company limited by guarantee. I am not strictly speaking a
trustee. Am I covered on that basis? I am directly covered as a
director of a charitable company. The Minister is indicating that he
believes so. It has gone from yes to believe so.</div>
<a name="06071347000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is that there are
many question marks being thrown up. That is not helped by the fact
that there is no mention of any of this in the explanatory notes, which
are particularly brief in this area. I will not press my amendment to a

the Liberal Democrats on that.</div>
<a name="06071347000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we need some extra
clarification. It might come in one of the many letters that the
Minister has been promising to myself and other Committee members all
week&#151;he is going to have a very full list and we are going to
have full postbags. Some more thought needs to be given to that and
some clarification, if not some amendments, needs to be introduced on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000243"></a>Annette

in which one might, for example, reach40 per cent. as the
total proportion of students at an FE college who are under 18, or
under 16, or who have special needs or who are adults with learning
disabilities. It would easy to reach that 40 per cent. mark. We might
say that there should be a majority, but a significant minority would
be just as important. Nevertheless, I shall not press the amendment at
this stage, although I am not happy about the trigger&#151;the
threshold&#151;when one slips from one definition to
another.</div><a name="06071347000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
114 was always intended to be a probing amendment. It was difficult to
find a suitable opportunity to address the point, but I felt that it
should be pressed, as we had not received any answers on Second
Reading. I make no apology for pressing it, because there was no
response to what I thought was an excellent speech on an issue of
national significance that should be considered at all possible levels.
There will be more and more trust situations&#151;the
responsibilities of the trustees of new trust schools may need to be
clarified, for instance. So I concur with the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham that notes are required, and I look forward to

Teather:</b> I continue to have some concerns about the
breadth of clause 10. The sentiments underlying the clause are similar
to those underlying clause 9, except that clause 9 relates to people
who are barred rather than those subject to monitoring. As drafted, the
clause would criminalise mistakes, which I do not believe is the
Government&#146;s intention. I suspect that, particularly as the
legislation beds down, mistakes will be likely, because there are a
number of points of potential confusion. For example, there is the
question of whether therapy is a regulated activity. Therapy provided
to a child is a regulated activity. However, under clause 14(1)(a),
complementary and alternative therapy are listed as areas of exemption
from the need to make monitoring checks for vulnerable adults.
Meanwhile, therapy is listed as a controlled activity in relation to
both children and adults, requiring guidance from the Secretary of
State before engagement in it. Clauses 18 to 20 deal with
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div><a name="06071347000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation is confused. As I
said on a similar matter earlier, the definitions are not clear and I
suspect when the legislation first comes into force there will be a
high potential for mistakes. Serious misconduct can lead to
disciplinary action or dismissal, but there is a question mark over
whether it is appropriate to deal with it in legislation. I wonder
whether the Government might consider an amendment on Report to narrow
the definition so that there would have to be knowledge of monitoring.
That would catch fewer
people.</div><a name="06071347000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071347000245"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> With your permission, Mr. Conway, I
shall leave the discussion on clause 14 until we reach clause 14. As to
use of people who are not subject to monitoring, many of the arguments
were made in discussing an earlier clause. The Government wish to err
on the side of caution and our arguments remain the same.</div>
