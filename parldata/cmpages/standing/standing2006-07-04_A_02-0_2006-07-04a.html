<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000390"></a>The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>
Welcome to the Committee, Mr. Gale. It is a great pleasure to have you
with us.</div>
<a name="06070511000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had an
interesting debate this morning on amendment No. 71 and issues relating
to public benefit. I thought that it would be helpful to the Committee
if I explained in the context of the amendment how public benefit will
work under the Bill. Then I will deal with the specific issues raised
by the
amendment.</div><a name="06070511000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
organisation must satisfy two tests to be a charity: it must exist for
a purpose under clause 2(2), and its purposes must be for the public
benefit. To answer the question of my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael), who is not in his place, the
purposes listed in subsection (2) are capable of being for the public
benefit but are not necessarily so. A trust to relieve the poverty of
one family member is for the relief of poverty, but would not be deemed
for the public benefit.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div><a name="06070511000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key question with which
amendment No. 71 is concerned is how public benefit will be defined. As
set out in the Charity Commission document &#147;The Public Character
of Charity&#148;, the public benefit requirement means that an
organisation must do two things. It must provide a recognisable
advantage for people at a level that reflects their need; that is the
benefit element. In addition, the benefits must be provided to the
public at large, or at least a sufficient section of the community;
that is the public element. Those are the general principles that apply
across the board, but they are flexible enough to be applied by the
Charity Commission and the courts in different ways, depending on the
charitable purpose that they are considering. A large mosaic of case
law underpins those
principles.</div><a name="06070511000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to the substance of amendment No. 71. I shall deal
first with the second part of the amendment, which would introduce a
presumption of public benefit for charities that benefit the natural
environment or species within it. The Government do not believe that
that is desirable or necessary, and not only because the hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) seems to be introducing a second
Cheltenham principle, which is to support presumptions of public
benefit in one respect but not at another. The amendment is undesirable
because it singles out one charitable purpose. It is unnecessary
because a charity established to benefit the natural environment or a
living species can be deemed to provide public benefit on a number of
grounds, not simply the prevention of extinction, which I think was the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern. For example, animal welfare charities
are recognised as charitable not because the animals are necessarily
threatened with extinction but because of a broader acceptance of the
public benefit of avoiding cruelty and animal suffering. I understand
that the Wildlife Hospital Trust to which the hon. Gentleman referred
qualifies on that
basis.</div><a name="06070511000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Environmental
protection is acknowledged to provide public benefit because it
improves the living conditions of humankind. The Government think that
that part of the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="06070511000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000391"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): My hon.
Friend is making an important point on the issues that I raised this
morning. Would it not be correct to say that just as animal welfare
produces a public good because it is recognised to be of public benefit
without necessarily benefiting individual human beings, environmental
protection need not directly benefit individuals to satisfy the public
benefit
criteria?</div><a name="06070511000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000392"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That is correct to an extent. I do not think
that my right hon. Friend was in his place when I said it, but is
important to restate the point that purposes under clause 2(2) can be
for the public benefit but are not necessarily so. The public benefit
test is applied by specifically examining the individual charity and
seeing whether it benefits a sufficient section of the
public.</div> <a name="06070511000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">To illustrate
that important point, I shall quote from the case of IRC <i class="I">v.</i>
Baddeley. Lord Somervell of Harrow, talking about a charitable trust,
said:</div><a name="06070511000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
might well be a valid trust for the promotion of religion benefiting a
very small class. It would not follow at all that a recreation ground
for the exclusive use of the same class would be a valid
charity&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div><a name="06070511000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point I am making is that there is a
general public benefit test: a sufficient section of the community must
be benefited. That test is then specifically applied, and has been
applied by the courts&#151;there is a bedrock of common law on the
matter&#151;in different cases in different ways. My right hon.
Friend looks quizzical, so I shall give way to
him.</div>
<a name="06070511000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000393"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The difficulty is applying the same principles to
a variety of the 13 categories that we have in the Bill. Let us stick
with the animal welfare point for a moment. Does my hon. Friend accept
that, in the terms that he used earlier, one does not have to show that
members of the public benefit from the pursuit of animal welfare in
order to show that it is charitable and in the wider sense of the term
produces that &#147;public benefit&#148;? I think that I virtually
paraphrased his words. If we were to paraphrase that in relation to
others of the objects, surely it would explain the situation
clearly.</div><a name="06070511000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000394"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I always hesitate to disagree with my right hon.
Friend, but ultimately there must be some benefit to the public in
order to show &#147;public benefit&#148;. It is pretty clear from
established case law that animal welfare charities are deemed to
provide public benefit, because there is public benefit in avoiding
cruelty and suffering to animals and that redounds to the benefit of
humankind. That is my understanding of the basis on which the courts
have made their decisions. In a way, the meaning of public benefit is
that it must provide benefit to the public.</div>
<a name="06070511000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000395"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am sorry to intervene on my hon. Friend again,
but surely the same must apply in relation to the environment. If it is
accepted that the protection of the environment more widely produces a
general public benefit, one would not have to show that a particular
group, or number or proportion of the public benefit from that any more
that one would in relation to animals. Surely the same test must
apply.</div>
<a name="06070511000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000396"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> There has to be a wider public benefit. It can
be a collective benefit, for example, one that comes from preserving
the environment or avoiding cruelty or suffering to animals. The point
that I am making to my right hon. Friend is that ultimately we must
come back to a benefit to the public in some form or another. That can
be collective; it does not need necessarily to be about direct benefit
to individuals. That is the point about animal welfare
charities.</div>
<a name="06070511000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
important to get clear, because in a way public benefit is the basis on
which the Bill turns. We are rightly relying on the common law
definitions of public benefit, which have built up over 400 years. The
matter therefore takes some explaining and understanding, because the
criteria have been built up over a number of years and apply in
different cases in different areas.</div>
<a name="06070511000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move on to
the substance of the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for
Cheltenham. It might not be specifically targeted at private
schools&#151;it might be more generally targeted&#151;but one of
the things he clearly has in mind is schools. I shall say something
about the position relating to schools because I do not accept his
characterisation, as I said on Second Reading.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div><a name="06070511000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is based on four
principles. The first is that charities must show public benefit, and
there is no free pass for any charity&#151;that is the reason to get
rid of the presumption in favour of education, religion and the relief
of poverty. The second is that the Charity Commision will have the
final say, depending on the circumstances of the individual charity, as
has always been the case and has been demanded by the National Council
for Voluntary Organisations and others. The third is that indirect
benefit that is simply relief of the public purse should not be
regarded as satisfactory. The fourth is that, as it stands, the Bill
can raise the bar of what is required, while also raising the overall
standard of education in this country.</div>
<a name="06070511000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman referred
briefly to re Resch. As I said on Second Reading, I am not sure that I
accept his characterisation. He seeks to introduce a clarification
derived from recent Scottish law. On Second Reading, my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said, regarding the
advisability of a clarification of the
Bill:</div><a name="06070511000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
trying to be more specific, we do not want to exclude organisations
that should not be excluded. I hope that hon. Members, especially my
hon. Friends, understand that we are determined that there will be a
test of public benefit, which we expect to be meaningful, but that
trying to identify matters too clearly frequently brings disbenefits
that nobody anticipated.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 26
June 2006; Vol. 448, c.
26.]</div><a name="06070511000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one danger in what
the hon. Gentleman proposes. I shall explain
why.</div><a name="06070511000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scottish charity
law is now based on a different legal framework than the law of England
and Wales. Under the Bill, the public benefit test is based on
&#147;charitable purposes&#148; as established in common law. Under
the new Scottish law, the public benefit test is based on the
activities of the bodies that seek to become charities, and the
regulator has been given a large amount of power to make executive
decisions about which charities meet the public benefit test. In a
sense, the intervention of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight
(Mr. Turner) on the hon. Member for Cheltenham illustrated that point.
The hon. Member for Cheltenham is right to say that what &#147;unduly
restrictive&#148; would mean is not a decision for him, but it will
be a decision for the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.
Clearly, that important decision has been taken. That is an overall
perspective of some of the differences between English and Scottish
law, and the direction of travel of the Scottish
situation.</div><a name="06070511000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is basically in two parts, the first of which deals with the
public benefit test and provides that the benefits must outweigh the
disbenefits. That is already established in law and does not add
anything. As I understand it, a 1947 case concerning the National
Anti-Vivisection Society, with which I have a passing familiarity,
established that the benefits must outweigh the disbenefits as part of
the public benefit test. Therefore, that part of the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="06070511000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the amendment contains the wording &#147;unduly
restrictive&#148;. That wording is not clear enough for us to be
confident that it would improve the public benefit test in the Bill and
would not have unintended consequences. Could we be sure, in the
context of the law in England and Wales, that existing charities, such
as museums that charge fees, would not be caught? I am sure that that
is not the intention of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>the framers of the amendment, including the hon. Member for Cheltenham,
but we are not confident that it is the best way forward. At best it
would mean no change to the public benefit test that is carried out by
the commission; at worst, it could have harmful effects. Perhaps that
is why Lord Phillips of Sudbury said, in a letter to me, that the
Scottish provision is not well drafted. That is consistent with what he
said in another place a year ago&#151;the Liberal Democrat Front
Benchers should hear this. He
said:</div><a name="06070511000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It was
pressed upon me that it might assist our deliberations to introduce
some of the Scottish wording around this very issue. However, I
rejected that out of hand because in this instance I believe that the
Scots have got it plumb wrong&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 28 June 2005; Vol. 673, c.
168.]</div><a name="06070511000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberal Democrat
Front-Benchers might need to consult with Lord Phillips on that, but on
this occasion at least, we agree with him that the amendment would not
be helpful. We have not closed our minds to the possibility of
improving the Bill, but any change must meet the true criteria set out
by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: that
it provides a sound legal basis for the public benefit test and avoids
any unintended or harmful consequences. On the basis of those
explanations, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06070511000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000397"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall take the second part of the amendment
first regarding</div> <a name="06070511000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;benefit
to the natural environment, or the living species within
it&#148;.</div><a name="06070511000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am encouraged by the sympathetic comments from the hon. Member for
Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), the right hon. Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth, the Minister and others about the spirit of the
amendment. There has been genuine concern about the risk of an
organisation passing the clause 2(2) test as an environmental
organisation, but going on to fail the public benefit test,
because&#151;I shall paraphrase the right hon. Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth&#151;it might not always be possible to demonstrate
public benefit when one cannot demonstrate a public who obviously and
directly benefit. I am partly reassured by the Minister&#146;s reply,
but the risk still exists and there is still a need for clarity. Should
the amendment be defeated, I invite the Minister to look
sympathetically on the idea of introducing a Government amendment that
might meet some of the same objectives. However, I advise him not to
use &#147;presumed&#148;, as it is liable to
misinterpretation.</div>
<a name="06070511000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main body
of the amendment is concerned with the Scottish public benefit test.
The Minister suggested that four principles were being followed: first,
that there is no free pass to pass the test, which is correct;
secondly, that the Charity Commission has the final say; and thirdly,
that the benefit is not automatically satisfied simply by the provision
of education. I agree with those three principles, but there is doubt
regarding the fourth&#151;that the Bill will raise the bar. The legal
opinion that I have heard is divided on whether the Bill will make any
difference to charity law in terms of the public benefit test. The NCVO
and the Charity Commission support that view in many of their
comments.</div> <a name="06070511000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight questioned why the view of the Charity
Commission, or the NCVO, or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>indeed the Liberal Democrats, since I have not reintroduced Lord
Phillips&#146; amendment, might have evolved during the course of the
long debate about this Bill. One obvious reason is the passage of the
Scottish Act, because it sets a clear example of how a stricter set of
guidelines on the public benefit test might work.</div>
<a name="06070511000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me answer a few of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions about my amendment. He asked me to define
or clarify what I meant by benefit or disbenefit. He kept on referring
to them as my words, but they are the words adopted by the Scottish
Parliament, so I can do no better than to refer to the Office of the
Scottish Charity Regulator&#146;s guidance on public benefit. It
says:</div><a name="06070511000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example, if a charity relieves a person&#146;s sickness or financial
hardship, the person&#146;s health or financial circumstances can be
measurably improved. Such benefits could be described as tangible. On
the other hand, intangible benefits may be more difficult to measure,
but should still be identifiable. These can include, for example, many
of the benefits of education or religion, or promoting appreciation of
historic buildings. Both tangible and intangible benefits will be taken
into account.&#148;</div><a name="06070511000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that reassures him, given some of his worries about whether the
amendment would apply to the provision of education.</div>
<a name="06070511000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also asked
about the disbenefit. It, too, is explained more clearly in
OSCR&#146;s guidance, which says:</div>
<a name="06070511000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many of the everyday
actions of organisations (and individuals) may cause a degree of harm
to others, either directly or indirectly. This fact should not
unnecessarily stifle the operations of charities. Where any disbenefit
caused is due to reasonable and necessary actions in connection with
the (prospective) charity&#146;s purpose and is the inevitable and
generally accepted result of such actions in the society in which they
take place, then such disbenefit may be largely disregarded (for
example, when a degree of harm to the public is caused (by road
accidents and pollution) by charities that need to use cars in the
delivery of services to their
beneficiaries).&#148;</div><a name="06070511000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
hope that he is reassured that the emerging practice in Scotland is

substantive debate already on the clause and, that being so, it is
unlikely that I shall be minded to allow a stand part debate. Hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000415"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It is a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship again, Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="06070511000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both of the
amendments resist the abolition of the presumption of public benefit
which seems to be at the heart of the Bill. Amendment No. 4 refers to
clause 2(2)(a) and (c) and amendment No. 54 to clause 2(2)(b). The
principle embodied in the Bill is very simple: it is that there should
be a level playing field and all charities should have to demonstrate
public benefit, albeit that that principle was somewhat undermined by
the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Cheltenham in support of
amendment No. 71. What is interesting is that the public benefit test 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div>seems to be different for many of the causes set out in clause 2(2). My
intention in tabling the amendments is twofold. First, it is to tease
out what the law is on public benefit in respect of each of the three
charitable purposes. Secondly, it is to test whether it is to the
advantage of the populace in general that charities should have to
devote time and energy to demonstrating public benefit when to do so is
otiose, as in the case of the relief of poverty, or impossible, as in
the case of the advancement of
religion.</div><a name="06070511000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am told
that, under charity case law, it is not those who engage in religious
practices who are the public who benefit; the public benefit is the
benefit that they bring to society by rubbing shoulders with those who
do not so engage. In other words, people who engage in religious
practices are presumed to become more moral and altruistic as a result,
so the public at large benefit when they mix with such people. That is
an ingenious interpretation. However, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster has said
that</div><a name="06070511000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all charities will
have to show that they are for the public benefit...an
organisation will have to show that it generates identifiable benefits
that reach...a sufficiently large section of the
public.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 26 June 2006; Vol. 448,
c. 25.]</div><a name="06070511000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are the
identifiable benefits from religion that reach a sufficiently large
section of the public? If it were a case of rubbing shoulders, many
religions, but not all, will be able to demonstrate public
benefit.</div> <a name="06070511000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
prayer brings comfort to those who participate in it, but I am worried
about how we can demonstrate that it generates a public benefit. I said
that on Second Reading, but I do not think that I received a
satisfactory reply. Can we demonstrate that the prayer undertaken by
people engaged in religion has made them more moral and altruistic? Is
that what religions will be asked to
demonstrate?</div><a name="06070511000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000416"></a><b class="B">Helen
Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman may be
aware that, in America, an experiment was carried out in which
religious communities prayed for people who were ill. The people
involved did not know whether or not they were being prayed for but, as
it happened, those who had been prayed for did get better
faster.</div><a name="06070511000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000417"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> That is most encouraging for those who
occasionally pray and even more so for those who pray more frequently.
The case seems to be very much on the lines of the arguments over
health foods&#151;we might be able to demonstrate the statistics, but
can we demonstrate the cause and effect? Perhaps I should not go down
this road&#151;in fact, I know I should not. I shall do so at another
opportunity, Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="06070511000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty
is demonstrating that the prayer has the effect that the hon. Lady
mentioned. If we are providing a place of worship and some comfort is
taken by the people who attend the place of worship, is that providing
a public benefit in that the place of worship is open to a fair number
of people, or are we providing a private benefit? Is it sufficient that
that group of the public should take comfort from prayer or is there
also a requirement that that comfort be extended to other
people?</div>

highly academic, but what about people in religious groups who pray but
do not rub shoulders with others? The Parliamentary Secretary assured
me on Second Reading
that,</div><a name="06070511000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for religion, the

mentioned that point earlier, because it was part of my earlier
argument.</div><a name="06070511000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
about those who pray behind closed doors? There is a current television
programme about women attending a convent of the Poor Clares. Few
people have the opportunity to attend such a convent temporarily,
because the Poor Clares are a contemplative order that operates mostly
behind closed doors. What is the benefit to the public of the activity
of the Poor Clares and, more significantly, how do they demonstrate it
to the satisfaction of the Charity
Commission?</div><a name="06070511000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000418"></a>Alun

says:</div><a name="06070511000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000420"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Surely, that is precisely what it does. By
removing the presumption that the general legal definition&#151;that
which is understood in common law&#151;applies to schools and other
organisations that were previously presumed to have a public benefit,
the clause does precisely what he says it does not
do.</div><a name="06070511000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000421"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> If by &#147;raise the bar&#148;, the
Parliamentary Secretary meant &#147;remove the presumption of public
benefit&#148;&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> He is saying that he did.
That makes it a lot
easier.</div><a name="06070511000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that the Parliamentary Secretary has given the impression
to certain hon. and right hon. Gentleman on the Government Back Benches
that he will require independent schools to demonstrate a higher level
of public benefit than they have been required to do so far. I
understand that, currently, there is a presumption and an act by the
Charity Commission would be required 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div>to overturn that, but the test is the same whether there is a
presumption or not. Under the current law, once the Charity Commission
tested whether a charity was meeting the public benefit test or the
presumption was ill-founded, it would apply the same test once the
presumption was removed. I hope that I am making this clear for the
Parliamentary Secretary, because he may shake his head if I am not
doing
so.</div><a name="06070511000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Parliamentary Secretary is not raising the test. He may be raising the
bar and abolishing the presumption, but he is not making the test more
difficult. I have to leave it to him, unless he wishes to
intervene.</div><a name="06070511000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000422"></a><b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I am trying with interest to
follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Surely a presumption is a
presumption, beyond which there is no further need for a test. The Bill
says that we need organisations to justify their charitable status. The
hon. Gentleman appears to suggest that Eton, Harrow and all such
schools should not have to demonstrate their public benefit, but
organisations such as the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children should have
to.</div><a name="06070511000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000423"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The selection of examples makes the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, and I am sure that that is why he selected
them. However, I am afraid that he is wrong. A presumption is a merely
a presumption: in the absence of other evidence, we presume that public
benefit is met.</div>
<a name="06070511000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
presumption, however, is not an insurmountable assertion; otherwise,
the Finsbury Park mosque would not have been required to take action to
preserve its charitable status. That mosque benefited from the
presumption that the advancement of religion is a charitable purpose.
There were complaints about how the mosque was used and the Charity
Commission waded in to persuade those who run the mosque to act
differently and bar certain people from using it for certain purposes.
There was a presumption, but it was not irrebuttable. Once the Charity
Commission had found that the mosque was not being used for public
benefit, it asked the trustees to change their behaviour. They
did.</div> <a name="06070511000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am asking
whether the test in clause 3(3), to which the right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth referred, will be the same or whether it is
of a higher level, first in respect of religion, as the right hon.
Gentleman says, secondly in respect of the alleviation of poverty, on
which nobody has uttered, and thirdly in respect of the advancement of
education. If the test is the same, we are fine and dandy. However, if
it is different, the assertion that subsection (3) guarantees no change
in the test is false. I had not intended to go down that avenue,
although it would be useful to do so. I am sure that the Parliamentary
Secretary will respond helpfully to that
point.</div><a name="06070511000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000424"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): Does my
hon. Friend agree that the issue relates not only to the position
directly after the Bill is enacted? The test could be ratcheted up year
after year, both by Government-appointed charity commissioners and
political pressure, and that would effectively be an extra tax on
independent schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div><a name="06070511000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000425"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> That has certainly been a concern. I accept, of
course, that, in the Bill, the Charity Commission is deemed to be
independent, but Ministers make the appointments. When we come to
clause 4, I intend to discuss the process through which the public
benefit test may evolve; that is certainly a concern of mine.</div>
<a name="06070511000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I go back to my amendment. The
second example referred to by amendment No. 4 is that of the
alleviation of poverty. As I said on Second Reading, I find it
difficult to understand how it can be argued with any reasonable
likelihood of success that a charity for the relief of poverty is not
for the public benefit. On Second Reading, the Parliamentary Secretary
said that</div><a name="06070511000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if we take the
case of a trust to benefit a few people in one&#146;s immediate
family, one might say that it was set up for the relief of poverty.
However, there might be questions about whether it genuinely provided
public benefit.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 26 June 2006;
Vol. 448, c. 96.]</div><a name="06070511000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
presumption that there is public benefit, of course&#151;but it is
rebuttable. In the case under discussion, such use of a trust would be
excluded, because it would be so defined that its membership would be
fixed, which means that it would be a private trust, not a public
trust. A private trust cannot be for public
benefit.</div><a name="06070511000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
there may be cases in which the presumption is unreasonable, but those
are cases in which the presumption is rebuttable. I do not want every
charity whose object is the relief of poverty having to go out and
demonstrate that it is relieving poverty in the way the Charity
Commission intends, and thereby expend a huge amount of time and
energy. I do not see how the abolition of the presumption can have any
effect unless charities are asked to demonstrate what Ministers say
that they want them to demonstrate: identifiable benefits. So every
religious or educational charity&#151;not just Eton and Harrow, but
the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, which is an educational
charity&#151;will be asked to spend time and money demonstrating how
it provides public benefit, when the Isle of Wight Steam Railway would
far rather build an extension to join the island line from Shanklin to
Ryde pier head.</div>
<a name="06070511000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000426"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to forget that the
enormous majority of charities already have to demonstrate public
benefit under current law, because the fourth head of charity requires
it. Is he suggesting that the current requirement to prove public
benefit is enormously onerous for all the thousands of charities that
endure
it?</div><a name="06070511000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000427"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am not suggesting that. I simply do not know,
but I do know that some charities have been caught, and I mentioned one
earlier. I did not quote its name because the Charity Commission did
not tell me the name, but I quoted the Charity Commission as saying
that a particular charity that operates for the benefit of police
officers&#146; widows and orphans was behaving inappropriately by
giving them a Christmas gift of &#163;50. I am quite happy to table
the letter&#151;or whatever one does with papers&#151;so that hon.
Members can read them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div><a name="06070511000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000428"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Since that organisation did not make its gifts to
the widows of police officers on the basis of need, it would not meet
the criteria in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, which excludes
the prevention or relief of poverty, and the advancement of religion.
It would still have to pass the public benefit test even if his
amendment were
passed.</div><a name="06070511000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000429"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Charity Commission would have to put that test
to the organisation to demonstrate, but the commission would not have
to ask every charity to demonstrate it. Many charities will demonstrate
it perfectly adequately, but we will be asking charities&#151;and the
Charity Commission, for that matter&#151;to expend a lot of time,
effort and money, and, in the case of the Charity Commission, our money
and our constituents&#146; money, in demonstrating something that it
is unnecessary to demonstrate unless there is a prima facie case that
those organisations are not conferring public
benefit.</div><a name="06070511000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000430"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that any
charity of any size produces a business plan&#151;for its own
internal reasons, never mind any external scrutiny&#151;that
demonstrates how it is pursuing its charitable objects and how it is
therefore delivering public benefit? No extra work is
required.</div><a name="06070511000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000431"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> No, I do not accept that, any more than I accept
that every business has a business plan. Perhaps they ought to have,
but I am sure that not every Conservative association has a business
plan. Mine does, as it happens, but I do not suppose that every
constituency Labour party has a business plan. Of course, that is the
way that things should be done in the best of all possible worlds, with
an infinite number of staff who can spend their time on such matters,
but charities are not like that. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] I did not hear
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention.</div><a name="06070511000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000432"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I said that charities are a lot more
business-like than the hon. Gentleman
thinks.</div><a name="06070511000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000433"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Many are, but not all are able to act in the way
that the right hon. Gentleman describes, and I am concerned that they
will be forced so to act. If I can find the example that I was given
earlier&#151;well, I cannot find it, but I am sure that I will have
an opportunity to quote it later during the Bill&#146;s proceedings.
Anyway, I received an e-mail from someone who claimed to be a lifelong
Labour voter. I know that lifelong Conservative voters are those who
are not going to vote for me at the next election; the same probably
applies to this lifelong Labour voter. He has taken on the treasuryship
of his local church, but complains that, even in the present
circumstances, the Charity Commission is expecting far too much, and he
says that it is not surprising that one cannot find people who are
willing to take on such responsibilities. Although I accept that the
other charities whose purposes are in the list are required to
demonstrate public benefit, it would be better if we did not impose
that requirement on lots of new ones as
well.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000434"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> As one spent three very enjoyable summers on the
Isle of Wight in my student days, I certainly take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the valuable work of the Isle of Wight
Steam Railway Co.
</div><a name="06070511000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I wish to
comment on the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth about the onerous nature of demonstrating
that a charity is doing what it was set up to do. If I were asked to
give money to one of those charities, I would want to know that it was
doing what it was set up to do; if I were a trustee, I would expect
some sort of annual report from the chief executive or the chairman; if
I were an auditor, I would expect the audited accounts of the
organisation to demonstrate that the charitable purpose is being met.
All those things should really be being done now. The Bill raises the
threshold at which charities have to register and so reduces the burden
on smaller charities, but the hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out
of a molehill in suggesting that there is any significant extra work
for charities to do under the
clause.</div><a name="06070511000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000435"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b><b class="B"> </b>I cannot judge the size of the mountain,
but we should remember that those charities that do not have to
register are still obliged to demonstrate public benefit. As for the
small charities, if I give money to the Isle of Wight bat hospital, I
know where that money is going, because I can go to that hospital and
see the bats; the same is the case for the Isle of Wight Steam Railway
Co. There is a difference between a small, local charity and a large
charity that requires auditors, business plans and goodness knows
what.</div><a name="06070511000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee what happens when a charity is not delivering public benefit;
that is particularly significant to an educational charity. The
document from which I quoted earlier, &#147;Public Benefit&#151;the
Charity Commission&#146;s approach&#148;, sets out what happens
then. It states:</div><a name="06070511000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;our
action might include helping the charity change its stated purposes or
its activities so that it is benefiting enough of the public to show
public benefit&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="06070511000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is
fine&#151;</div><a name="06070511000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
might also use our regulatory powers to enforce change if the trustees
are not co-operating with us, although we anticipate we would need to
do this in only in a few
cases.&#148;</div><a name="06070511000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">That, too, is
excellent.</div>
<a name="06070511000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However, in extreme
cases, where the trustees are co-operating with us but the organisation
simply cannot in all the circumstances provide public benefit, our
action might include removing the charity from the register and making
a legal scheme where necessary to ensure that any charitable assets of
the organisation will in the future be applied for other charitable
purposes close to any purposes that have ceased to be
charitable.&#148;</div> <a name="06070511000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
suggests that there are some activities that will cease to be deemed
charitable, and that the charities concerned will therefore lose their
assets. I am worried principally that the abolition of the presumption
of public benefit will put an additional burden on charities and on the
Charity Commission that they are ill placed to
meet.</div><a name="06070511000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000436"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I would like to draw a little on my experience of
being on the senior management team of a national charity that had to
pass the public benefit test. The Alzheimer&#146;s Society did not
qualify under any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>of the first three heads of charitable purposes. The hon. Member for
Isle of Wight seems to think that passing the public benefit test and
maintaining the status of passing the public benefit test is some
terribly onerous and difficult responsibility that involves
lawyers&#146; fees and heaven knows what else. However, I have to say
that in five years on that senior management team, the public benefit
test did not bother us for one
minute.</div><a name="06070511000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am speaking about a charity that did not provide a benefit to the whole
public. We were quite shamelessly restricting our services for the
benefit of carers and people with dementia, so there is perhaps a case
to be made that we were not providing a wider public benefit and that
we restricted our services. However, most of us thought that if we had
ever been challenged as to whether we were providing a public benefit,
we could have dispatched the argument on one side of A4 faxed to the
Charity Commission, which I suspect would not have wasted any more time
on it than we would have done.</div>
<a name="06070511000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
overwhelming majority of cases, charities will have little difficulty
in passing the public benefit test or proving that they are capable of
passing it, should they ever be challenged. I echo the words of the
hon. Member for the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) when he says that
a mountain is being made out of a
molehill.</div><a name="06070511000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
specific case of religion, the hon. Member for Isle of Wight seems to
be concerned that it is difficult to demonstrate the benefit of prayer
or religious activity. Through a precedent in case law, which I do not
pretend to fully understand, even religious charities have to
demonstrate some public benefit. It is probably because of the need to
demonstrate that they are advancing religion as opposed to just
practising it. For example, closed orders&#151;I do not know whether
the Poor Clares fall into that category, but I suspect that they
do&#151;do not now qualify as charitable organisations in charity law
because they are practising religion behind closed doors for their own
personal benefit. Therefore, that restriction already
provides.</div>
<a name="06070511000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
beyond the hon. Gentleman&#146;s faculties to demonstrate the benefit
of prayer or religion in a wider sense. It could be argued that
advancing religion for the general public might allow some members of
the public to believe that they were gaining greater insight into the
truth of life, the universe and everything; or that it might bring them
greater comfort; or that it might even help them to recover from
illness. It could be argued that encouraging them to perform an act of
contemplation or meditation might bring peace of mind by the very
process that they were going through. It does not seem difficult to
demonstrate that religious charities could pass the public benefit test
that is in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06070511000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some sympathy with the
question that the hon. Gentleman put to the Government. Given the
failure of my earlier amendment, we now have a public benefit test that
advances little from existing charity law. However, for exactly that
reason, given that most charities have no difficulty passing the test
under existing charity law, they would have little difficulty in
passing it under the Bill.</div>
<a name="06070511000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test is designed to catch
charities that are scams, in which there is obvious possibility of
abuse or of the misleading or corruption of individuals by the
organisation. Those kinds of organisations were failing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>the public benefit test before. On that front, the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment poses a practical risk. He is taking the
principles from previous Acts and applying them to a new Bill, which
might have unintended consequences. By putting in a deliberate
statement that there will be a presumption that religious charities
will satisfy the public benefit test, he may bring in religious
organisations that are incontestably religious&#151;whether or not
they believe in a supernatural principle, or one god or many&#151;but
that would not have passed a more general public benefit
test.</div>
<a name="06070511000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that we can all think of the most extreme examples, such as the Aum
cult who gassed the Tokyo underground, the Branch Davidian sect who
committed mass suicide in Guyana many years ago, or Satanists who would
presumably regard themselves as religious. Under that blanket
presumption, which enables them to evade any further public benefit
test, those type of organisations might seek to claim charitable
status. That is an extreme and absurd version of the argument but there
is a risk that there may be unintended consequences to his amendment
that he has not
considered.</div><a name="06070511000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the general principle of the amendment, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
arguments are simply wrong. One of the Bill&#146;s great attractions
is that it seeks to modernise the structure of charity law. It will
remove the antiquated and almost stereotypical preference for the
relief of poverty and the advancement of religion and education as
charitable objects that are somehow proper, with everything else having
to pass a second test. I thought that equalisation and levelling the
playing field among all charities enjoyed enormously wide support in
the sector. I am aware of no significant opposition even from religious
charities, and the provision has been supported even by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s noble Friends in another place. I repeat the words
of Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbots on 28 June. He said that all charities
should</div> <a name="06070511000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have to meet a
public benefit test, no matter what their purposes
are&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 June
2005; Vol. 673, c.
154.]</div><a name="06070511000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is arguing that particular categories of charity,
including private schools such as Eton, Harrow and Winchester, should
be put back in a privileged position. The list of charities that he
would relegate to a secondary position is quite impressive. The RSPCA,
the Dogs Trust, the Shakespeare Globe Trust, the Dartington Hall Trust,
Help the Aged, Age Concern, Youth Music, the Royal Society for the
Protection of birds, Alcohol Concern and even the Police Dependants
Trust about which he spoke earlier would all be relegated to that
secondary status. That is quite wrong in principle.</div>
<a name="06070511000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the best things about
the Bill and the reason why it has commanded such wide support in the
voluntary sector is that it moves away from that slightly mediaeval
approach toward a level playing field for all charities in a modern
context. I shall oppose the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment if he
presses it to a
Division.</div><a name="06070511000130"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000437"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> We have had a most illuminating debate, I think.
The starting point is whether we agree with the overall principle that
all charities, in return for receipt of public money, should have to
show public benefit. The Government and the Liberal Democrat Front
Benchers agree with that principle, but I am sad to say that the
Conservative Front-Bench spokesman does not appear to do
so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div><a name="06070511000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000438"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> On a point of clarification, what exactly does
the Minister mean by receiving public money? Does he mean receiving it
by not being taxed? That is somewhat different&#151;a flow of funds
in the opposite direction. That is
fundamental.</div><a name="06070511000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000439"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman can dance on the head of a
pin if he likes, but there is a significant cost to the public purse as
a result of charities&#146; preferential tax status. It is clearly a
cost, and in my view such preferential treatment relative to other
organisations must therefore be justified. That is
obvious.</div><a name="06070511000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000440"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): On a minor

might?</div><a name="06070511000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000441"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Part of
the Bill is about ensuring public confidence in the charitable brand.
We cannot say that the public should have confidence in the charitable
brand if a whole set of classes of charity is presumed not to have to
show public benefit. That is the existing
law.</div><a name="06070511000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Isle of Wight asked about the nature of the test. That will be
determined on the basis of common law, but it is clear that at the
moment, various charities are essentially not scrutinised because of
that presumption. That is how it works in practice. The Government
think that that is wrong. We think that the RSPCA, Eton college and a
religious charity should all provide proof of public
benefit.</div><a name="06070511000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000442"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): The Parliamentary Secretary
might have received correspondence from various religious organisations
on the subject. The Christian Institute expressed concern that the
removal of presumption on the public benefit of religious organisations
will give the
commission</div><a name="06070511000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;greatly
increased powers to reject the applications of religious bodies or even

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000443"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> There is a difference. A test will be applied in
practice that is not currently applied. The hon. Member for Isle of
Wight quoted my point on Second Reading that it is clearly established
in common law that the practice of religion and religious organisations
is seen as providing a benefit to the public. It will be for the
Charity Commission to make the final decision, and I cannot speak for
it. That is a commonly accepted principle. It is clear that religious
charities and organisations provide public benefit, and I see no reason
why that should change. The hon. Lady can therefore reassure religious
organisations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000444"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> I am not absolutely certain about the status of
the commission&#146;s position paper, &#147;Public
Benefit&#151;the Charity Commission&#146;s Approach&#148; or
about the relationship between that paper and the Bill. Religious
organisations believe that the commission will distinguish between acts
of worship and services in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>a public place and other forms of religious practice
such as, for example, missionary work and the alpha course. Will the
commission distinguish between acts of worship and services and other
forms of religious practice? There is a concern that if public worship
is not included, religious organisations might encounter difficulties
under the Bill.</div>
<a name="06070511000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000445"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Reassurance can be offered on the point about
missionary work, which has been raised before.</div>
<a name="06070511000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return to the argument.
There will be a public benefit test for every charity, and that is
right. There is a specific issue about fee-charging charities, because
they have to show that they provide benefit to a sufficient section of
the population, and it will be for the commission to implement the
provision in practice. My concern about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is that, essentially, he seeks to provide a free pass to
certain charities. His concern is probably motivated by independent
schools, but the Conservative party is on its own not only in this
Committee but in relation to independent schools. They welcome the Bill
and say that it is the right thing to do.</div>
<a name="06070511000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a letter from Jonathan
Shephard, head of the Independent Schools Council, to my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. It is important for
the Committee to hear it. He says:</div>
<a name="06070511000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Presumption of public
benefit will be removed. This is of prime importance. Until now, the
presumption has been that a body established for charitable purposes
(including education) is charitable. This is (broadly) irrespective of
performance. Now that the presumption is being removed, there will be
no place for the lazy charity.&#148;</div>
<a name="06070511000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Shephard goes on to say that in
evidence to the Joint Committee, chaired by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), he referred to the fact that some
charities needed to pull their socks up. He said that they will now
have to do so, because of the removal of presumption, and the likely
annual audit and return of public benefit that they will be required to
provide.</div><a name="06070511000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
Mr. Jonathan Shephard. Many private schools do incredibly good work
with the state sector, but as he said to me, we aspire to ensure that
as many schools as possible rise to the standards of the best in
co-operation with the state sector. We are trying to break down the
divide between private and state schools. That is important, and I
would have thought that the Conservative party would welcome it. The
Bill, by removing the presumption, will help to ensure that it happens.
Mr. Jonathan Shephard of the Independent Schools Council, which
represents the private schools, after all, agrees. He thinks it is a
good idea. In fact, he has said that it is a very good Bill, so I
cannot for the life of me see why the hon. Gentleman is worried. There
will be a test, and the bar will be raised, because the test was not
being implemented in practice before.</div>
<a name="06070511000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000446"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The Minister has now said something
illuminating&#151;not that most of what he says is not illuminating.
He says, &#147;because the test was not being applied properly
before&#148;.</div>
<a name="06070511000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000447"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I said
&#147;implemented&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div><a name="06070511000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000448"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am sorry. The Minister used similar words. If
that is what he is asserting, we are beginning to understand his point,
but if the test was not being applied properly by the Charity
Commission when it had only to look at cases that were brought to it,
how on earth will it be applied properly to every charity in all three
categories when it has to go systematically through every charity? Is
the Minister saying that it was pure luck that the Charity Commission
found the Finsbury Park mosque, applied the test and found that it
failed?</div><a name="06070511000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000449"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman is bringing up all kinds of
different issues. The Finsbury Park case was not about public benefit
but we should not go down the Finsbury Park road because it will
confuse an already somewhat confused
picture.</div><a name="06070511000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
simple: at present there is a presumption of public benefit for
educational, religious and anti-poverty charities. As I said on Second
Reading, that presumption has, in effect, meant a free pass for
charities in those categories. There should not be one law for one set
of charities and another law for another set. It is right that every
one should have to pass a public benefit test and that is what will
happen. There is no great revelation in what I have said; it will be
for the Charity Commission to implement that test and we will discuss
in clause 4 how that will be done.</div>
<a name="06070511000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Upminster
referred to the illustrative material for this Bill that was published
by the Charity Commission. When the Bill is enacted, it will publish
general draft guidance for consultation with stakeholders, individuals
and the public and that is the right way to go. It will then consider
specific groups of charities and it will be for the Charity Commission
and the chief charity commissioner to implement the proposal in
practice, which is right. It is not for politicians to do
so.</div><a name="06070511000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several questions
were asked about the precise test of public benefit and they are very
legitimate questions. If my answers have been somewhat inadequate on
the matter of the specific test for individual charities, it is because
there is a body of case law that has been built up over time. On the
advice of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and other
major charities, we made a decision on public benefit to stick with a
flexible definition that was defined in common law.</div>
<a name="06070511000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
make things simple; it makes them incredibly complicated, especially
for people who are not lawyers. We could have said, &#147;For every
charity and for every possible purpose, we politicians will provide a
public benefit test,&#148; but that would not have been the right way
to proceed. However, the implications are that we have to rely on the
wisdom of the courts and the Charity Commission. When enacted, the Bill
will be implemented on the basis of the established body of
law.</div><a name="06070511000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
misconceived. It troubles me, because it puts the hon. Member for Isle
of Wight and the Conservative party outside the mainstream of opinion
on the matter. I still do not fully understand the motivation behind
the amendment; it is right that all charities should have to pass the
public benefit test and I urge the hon. Gentleman to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div><a name="06070511000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000450"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which
he has responded to the amendment. The motivation is to scrutinise the
consequences of the Bill. I am by nature someone who is concerned when
everyone agrees because it may mean that we have scrutinised the
proposal insufficiently.</div>
<a name="06070511000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am particularly concerned
about the imposition of an additional responsibility on small
charities. I originally intended to table one amendment that would have
overturned the abolition of the presumption in all three cases. As a
result of what Ministers said on Second Reading, I decided to table two
separate amendments because if the independent schools think that it is
all right, I see little point in arguing on their behalf that it is all
wrong. However, I have certain concerns about the position of Mr.
Jonathan Shephard and the independent schools, to which I shall
return.</div><a name="06070511000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Upminster has suggested, I am concerned that the
consequence of the abolition of the public benefit would be onerous and
would establish a higher level of test. The Minister has persuaded me
that it will not establish a higher level of test in the cases of the
abolition of poverty and the advancement of religion.</div>
<a name="06070511000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reasons why people are
concerned are set out, as my hon. Friend mentioned, quite well in the
Christian Institute paper. It
stated:</div><a name="06070511000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#146;&#145;Public
Benefit - the Charity Commission&#146;s approach&#146; is very
secular in tone. It states that that public benefit must be assessed
&#145;in the light of modern conditions&#146; and that keeping up
with &#145;modern society&#146; is required if a charity is not to
have its charitable status
revoked.&#148;</div><a name="06070511000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was noted
that that is contained in paragraphs 15, 23 and 24 of the Charity
Commission document.</div>
<a name="06070511000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the nature
of things, some people who are religious think that there is something
wrong in modern society and that not everything is right about it, and
they point out that major religions are not modern and that one cannot
interpret belief in the light of modern society. Plenty of people will
do that, some of whom are in the Episcopal Church in the United States
of America, but others do not, some of whom are in the Anglican Church
in Nigeria. Without going too far down that road, such people are
concerned that they will be told to modernise in order to comply with
the new thinking of the Charity Commission. The Minister has gone some
way towards setting my mind at rest.</div>
<a name="06070511000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000451"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The Charity Commission has had a rough time
today. There is no sense in its guidance that modernisation means
somehow abandoning the religious principles that these organisations
rightly want to uphold. In fact, my hon. Friend the Member for High
Peak made the point that, hundreds of years ago, such provisions might
have been applied only to Christian organisations. Now, we are talking
about a wider set of religious purposes. That is what modernisation
surely means in this
context.</div><a name="06070511000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000452"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> We may find that modernisation involves some of
the religions to which the hon. Member for Cheltenham rightly referred
disparagingly, so I hope it does not. I accept what the Minister is
saying, but I hope that he will accept that the reason for scrutinising
these passages with care is because we need to understand the
consequences of invoking them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div><a name="06070511000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the Minister will also
accept that although the cost to the public purse, by his definition,
of the independent schools is about &#163;100 million, they put
considerable additional money back into society in the form of
scholarships and so on. I am sure that he will accept that. Although
the overall cost of charities to the public purse is in excess of
&#163;2.8 billion, there is a value of what charities do in return
for it. Perhaps it is a value that has not been quantified; perhaps it
is impossible to quantify. In talking as I think the hon. Member for
High Peak did about the cost to the public purse of charities, we
should recognise, as I know the Minister does, that there is a benefit
to the public purse of charities as
well.</div><a name="06070511000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not arguing
for a free pass to charitable status for charities; I am arguing that
it is a more efficient way of regulating&#151;it might be more
efficient in the case of all charities, but this is the position we are
discussing&#151;to have a system whereby a charity that fulfils the
basic qualifications can be deemed charitable unless someone says,
&#147;Look here, that organisation is not doing its job
properly&#148; than to have one where charities have go through
certain hoops before they are allowed to become a
charity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000453"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman must realise that efficiency
is not the only issue at stake. A private preparatory school in my
constituency without great grounds or theatre facilities struggled to
think how it might pass a future public benefit test, and it decided to
share one of its music teachers with local state schools. That was a
laudable response, but that step is being taken only as a result of the
possibility of a public benefit test. Can the hon. Gentleman possibly
be arguing against
that?</div><a name="06070511000362"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000454"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I happen to think that education is a public good.
It does not matter that I benefit from the education, because the world
benefits from my being better educated. In fact, it would probably
benefit if I were better educated. The Chancellor of the Exchequer says
that education is a public good: that is the argument he puts forward
for taxing us to put money into schools. That is the argument advanced
by the Make Poverty History lobby for paying for more people to be
educated in the developing world. Education is a public good, and that
is a benefit. I accept and am glad that the school that the hon.
Gentleman mentioned is doing something rather more useful than building
rowing trenches near Slough to demonstrate public benefit. It is
important that children are educated. It does not matter if some can
afford a better education for their children than others; it is good
that they are
educated.</div><a name="06070511000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000455"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I fear that, although he is trying to close the
divisions, the hon. Gentleman is opening them up. Mr. Jonathan Shephard
says that the indirect benefit that private schools provide in relief
to the public purse is not enough, in his view, to justify their
charitable status. That suggests that education on its own is not
enough; in his view there needs to be co-operation. Does the hon.
Gentleman disagree?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div><a name="06070511000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000456"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I did not think that that was what Mr.
Shephard was asserting. I thought that he was saying that there should
be additional benefit, not that education was an indirect benefit. I
think that that is so, although I cannot speak for him. My view is that
it is beneficial if more people are better educated. That should be
enough to justify an educational organisation being
charitable.</div><a name="06070511000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000457"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> No doubt Jonathan Shephard will be pleased about
his role in this Committee. The question and answer document issued to
Members of Parliament by independent schools
asks,</div><a name="06070511000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Is
indirect public benefit through savings to the taxpayer enough to meet
public benefit
requirements?&#148;</div><a name="06070511000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
is:</div><a name="06070511000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Indirect
public benefit is not enough on its own to ensure charitable status.
There are many reasons...which support the charitable status of
independent schools, of which indirect public benefit, though a very
large benefit, is only one. Savings to the taxpayer, however large,
will not be enough on their own to make a school (or hospital, or
retirement home)
charitable.&#148;</div><a name="06070511000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
Jonathan Shephard&#146;s view and that of the Independent Schools
Council.</div><a name="06070511000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000458"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am sorry; I misunderstood the Parliamentary
Secretary. That is Mr. Shephard&#146;s view. However, we are not
talking about the indirect benefit of savings to the taxpayer, but the
direct benefit to the public of more people being better educated. That
is the
benefit.</div><a name="06070511000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000459"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06070511000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000460"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> If the hon. Gentleman really thinks that it is
worth
it.</div><a name="06070511000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000461"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> If he is arguing that all education, however or
wherever it is delivered and whoever it is delivered by, is by
definition a public benefit, notwithstanding how restrictive it is
regarding the number of people who can engage in it, would he say that
state schools should have charitable status? Should a company providing
supply teachers, or individuals who set themselves up as private piano
teachers, have charitable status? If he is saying that education must
always in every context have charitable status, he will make spending
commitments for a future Government that will be impossible to
keep.</div><a name="06070511000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000462"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Many state schools have charitable status. For
example, all grant-maintained schools were exempt charities. I do not
know whether the same is true of foundation schools, but I suspect that
that is so. My argument is that education is a public good, and that is
generally accepted. I was not asserting that, just because someone says
that they are educating, there should be the irrebuttable presumption
that it is charitable. It is the rebuttable presumption that
matters.</div><a name="06070511000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are at the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000465"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Well, my contribution will be. Some months ago,
members of the Bill team at the Home Office gave me the benefit of
their advice on the process in respect of the guidance on the operation
of the public benefit requirement. I should like to read out my
understanding of what that is and ask the Minister whether I have it
right.</div> <a name="06070511000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
organisation can become a charity if it comes under one of the
charitable purposes listed under clause 2(2) and meets the public
benefit test. Despite the desires of the hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood), there is no presumption that any purpose is for the
public benefit. Public benefit will not have a statutory definition and
will continue to be interpreted according to case law.</div>
<a name="06070511000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Charity Commission must
issue guidance on the meaning of public benefit, and that will be
updated when necessary. That guidance is not legally binding; I
understand &#147;guidance&#148; to mean that charities must have
regard to it and take account of it when deciding what they will do,
but that they are not obliged blindly to follow it.</div>
<a name="06070511000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission&#146;s
objective is to promote awareness and understanding of the operation of
the requirement that a charity must be for the public benefit. Before
the commission issues guidance, it must undertake a consultation
process. Charity trustees must have regard to any guidance published by
the commission when they make decisions to ensure that their activities
remain for the public benefit.</div>
<a name="06070511000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 9 February
2005, Baroness Scotland told the Grand Committee in another place that
the
commission</div><a name="06070511000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
have to explain in its guidance what the public benefit requirement
is&#151;in other words, the nature and meaning of the

proposes to operate or apply the requirement in practice to charities
of various types and characteristics...it will have to carry out
the public and other consultation mentioned in Clause

it will have to disseminate the guidance&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 9 February 2005; Vol. 669, c.
103.]</div><a name="06070511000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have put my point in
those terms because I find it difficult to describe the process off the
cuff. Does the Minister think that I have it right, and does that
include a change to the public benefit test, as set out in clause
3(3)?</div><a name="06070511000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000466"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My understanding is that the hon. Gentleman is
right. If his information came from formerly Home Office, now office of
the third sector, officials, I am sure that it is right.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The letter did not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>come from them. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of
the process is broadly
right.</div><a name="06070511000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
gives the commission a duty to carry out whatever public and other
consultation it thinks appropriate before issuing the guidance. My
understanding is that the commission is very keen to provoke widespread
public discussion about the nature of public benefit in general and how
it will be applied. That is a good idea.</div>
<a name="06070511000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of hon. Members,
including my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth, emphasised on Second Reading that they expected the commission
to take into account views expressed in Parliament about how it should
approach the whole process. I agree with that too.</div>
<a name="06070511000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission has published
its illustrative guidance; we can expect that only to be illustrative
before the Bill becomes law because, as the hon. Gentleman emphasised,
the process is new for the commission, and it is important that it
undertakes it well and properly. In the guidance, the commission says
that it will interpret the public benefit requirement in the light of
three criteria: case law, modern conditions and the removal of the
presumption of public benefit. It says that after the Bill is enacted,
it will issue a new version of the guidance as an exposure draft for
public consultation. Having published that overall guidance, it will,
as I said, look at specific areas. It is for the commission and the
chief commissioner to move forward on that basis. I hope that that is
helpful for the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06070511000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000467"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> That is indeed helpful. I should also acknowledge
that my research assistant wrote the letter, not the Home
Office.</div>
<a name="06070511000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000468"></a>Edward

part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06070511000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070511000469"></a><b class="B">Peter
Bottomley</b> (Worthing, West) (Con): First, I apologise for
not being here earlier, but I have just come back from a meeting of the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Brussels, and
the train was delayed. I am especially sorry to have missed the
consideration of clause 2, which links to this clause.</div>
<a name="06070511000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 is
about guidance on the public benefit requirement. There have been
several recent communications from Churches Together in Britain and
Ireland asking what guidance will be given on the public benefit test
for religion when the presumption that religion is a public benefit
goes. I am not suggesting that the Minister can necessarily give a full
and detailed answer about what the Charity Commission will put in its
guidance, but he should offer to go into rather more detail either now
or on Report.</div> <a name="06070511000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the Minister should say how the Charity Commission will be expected to
deal with non-religions, such as the British Humanist Association,
which might carry out some of the functions normally carried out by
churches or faiths, but which, by definition, are clearly not
religions. Secondly, he might wish to liaise with the Charity
Commission&#151;the body to which the clause relates&#151;to put
together detailed considerations on how the commission will respond to
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland and other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>organisations, including parts of the Muslim Council
of Britain, which have made representations. He and the Charity
Commission might have had time to consider them, but if they have not,
it is important that they make it clear that there is no intention of
excluding one of the great faiths of the world, Islam, from providing
the public benefit that it clearly does.</div>
<a name="06070511000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to get on a late
debating train on the issue of education, but most of us who support
arts organisations&#151;whether performing arts or
others&#151;think that, as long as it is not for profit, the question
of art not being a public benefit is not a problem. Quoting too much
from the Independent Schools Information Service on the question of
whether education is a public benefit puts weight where it should not
be. The Charity Commission should be able to say that education is of
direct benefit and, if and when the direct benefit is not sufficient,
it should specify when an indirect benefit would be needed as
well.</div>
<a name="06070511000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000470"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman places me in a
slightly difficult position. I fully appreciate, as does the House,
that hon. Members have duties in other places, but the hon. Gentleman
will find that much of what he has just raised was covered in earlier
debates, and it might be to his advantage to study <i class="I">Hansard </i>and
then return to the issue. I am not seeking to curtail the debate, and
if the Minister wishes to respond briefly to the points that have been
raised in the spirit in which they have been raised, he may of course
do so. Strictly speaking, however, they fall outwith the scope of the
clause stand part debate.</div>
<a name="06070511000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000471"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I have great respect for the hon. Member for
Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), so I will definitely
respond.</div>
<a name="06070511000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
briefly cover the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about religion and the
public benefit test. He is completely right that religious
organisations need to be given reassurance and confidence that those
that have charitable status will continue to enjoy it and that the Bill
does not affect their status. We can give them that assurance in broad
terms. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about the handling of
specific religious organisations will also have been heard by the
Charity
Commission.</div><a name="06070511000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000472"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I understand your remarks, Mr. Gale,
and I shall not try to detain the Committee. In the early part of my
speech, however, I asked whether the Minister would consider whether
services that were offered by an openly non-religious body and which
were often also provided by faiths could be regarded as charitable.
That is not a test question or a trick question, but a serious issue,
which deserves some thought.</div>
<a name="06070511000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to
the Minister&#146;s kind remarks, let me add that he might want to
consider between now and Report whether relying on Charity Commission
guidance is sufficient to deal with the point that I raised. Giving an
assurance is one thing but, if it were not given in clear guidance by
the Charity Commission and it is not in the primary legislation, there
will still be
apprehension.</div><a name="06070511000205"></a>

Charities Act 1958, certain provisions would apply to it, but if a

past&#151;becomes a charity by virtue of its sporting activity and
then becomes a registered sports club, what is the position of its
assets? When an organisation ceases to be a charity, it loses its
assets. What will be the consequences of that treatment of a sports
club that is a charity, but which then chooses to register under the

Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): I draw attention to subsection
(3) because I am particularly worried about the proposal to omit miners
welfare trusts from the special provisions category. I am sure that
right hon. and hon. Members have experience of such trusts. I have a
miners welfare association in my constituency. The Beech Tree Miners
Welfare Association in Wollescote provides great assistance to miners,
ex-miners, their families and widows. It assists with matters like aids
and adaptations. It is its centre of the community. Most community
events take place there, such as family weddings. It is a polling
station. It runs youth clubs and has all sorts of recreational
facilities for the whole community. It is most definitely of great
benefit to the community, so I am greatly worried that it is to be
omitted. Will my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary reconsider the

that the notes on the clauses do not make clause 5 clear. I was not
sure whether to read subsection (3), under which miners&#146; welfare
trusts are omitted, without submitting it as an exception to the change
that the clause makes or whether in light of the fact that they will
cease to be charities. My guess is that it is the first assumption
rather than my second, but no doubt the hon. Gentleman will be able to
the help the Committee about

motivated by a desire to be compatible with the European convention on
human rights. I thought that that would cause some gasps. Let me
explain what the clause does, because as the hon. Member for Worthing,
West said, it is not clear.</div>
<a name="06070511000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first part of the clause,
up to the end of subsection (2)(b), deals with the problem that the
Recreational Charities Act 1958 makes it charitable in certain
circumstances to provide recreational leisure time facilities either
for the public as a whole, or for women only, but not for men only.
That element of discrimination arguably makes the Act incompatible with
the ECHR. Subsection (2) therefore makes it charitable to provide
recreational leisure time facilities for men only as well as for women
only, or for the public as a whole. The only alternative to that would
have been to rule out women-only charities, which we feared could
adversely affect women&#146;s institutes, among others. In order to
comply with the principle of non-discrimination, we have allowed for
men-only charities. We know better than to take on the
WI.</div><a name="06070511000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000478"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> A bright
future.</div><a name="06070511000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000479"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Indeed. Subsection (3) deals with miners welfare
trusts. I note the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for
Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) on this issue, and I promise that I will
report back on this matter on Report, and that I will make further
inquiries into it. The provision is being repealed because it is also
seen as being incompatible with the ECHR, because it discriminates in
favour of a certain occupation as against members of other trades or
professions.</div> <a name="06070511000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
members of the Committee become alarmed, I should point out that there
has been extensive consultation with the Coal Industry Social Welfare
Organisation on this issue to find a way to enable the 330 miners
welfare trusts to continue their good work. As the consultation took
place before I became a Minister, I shall meet representatives from
CISWO and other miners welfare trusts. We will do further research on
the position of such trusts, and I will report back, as my hon. Friend
asks, on Report. Miners welfare trusts that allow entry to people other
than miners will not be affected and will continue to qualify. I think
that in practice&#151;I have to be careful what I say
here&#151;other organisations should also qualify as having
charitable purposes with little effort, but we need to research that.
Further work must be done, and I will report
back.</div><a name="06070511000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final part of the clause deals with sports clubs. Subsections (4) and
(5) prevent a sports club that is registered as a community amateur
sports club, or CASC, from also being a charity. That is because CASC
status and charitable status are meant to be separate options for
small, community-based sports clubs, because there are different tax
and regulatory regimes for CASC 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div>organisations. We certainly do not want to get rid of CASC status,
because it has been widely welcomed in the amateur sports club
community. Given the different tax and regulatory regimes, clubs could
not be covered by both the CASC and charities regimes. Hence, the
slight ugliness of this part of the
clause.</div><a name="06070511000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to what
happens to organisations that might transition from one to another, my
understanding is that it will continue to be possible for a CASC to
move to charitable status and vice versa, which is exceptional in
charity law. I hope that that reassures the Conservative spokesman and
the hon. Member for Worthing,
West.</div><a name="06070511000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000480"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> This is a serious issue and it is useful for
the Committee to hear the background to the sports club change.
Incidentally, I am sure that the Committee will welcome what the
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office said about the miners trust,
but he may want to get his experts to look at organisations that are
not clubs and do not have premises, such as associations of people who
have retired from work in the Royal Mail, local government, national
civil service and so on. I suspect that there is no problem because the
provision may be tied to property, but if I am wrong the Minister may
want to help the House with a statement or some words on
Report.</div><a name="06070511000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">On community
sports clubs, if they started as a charity and had it written into
their articles that if they ceased to be a charity they would be
required to yield up their assets to another organisation, they might
be involved in turning into a completely new organisation with extra
costs as a result of this legislative change. If the Parliamentary
Secretary has time, it would be worth him double checking that he will
not force innocent bodies into paying a lot of money to lawyers to go
through a change of form. If that can happen automatically, the
Committee and, later, the House will accept what he said, but it might
be worth double checking that to be
sure.</div><a name="06070511000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may also want to clarify the position of recreational
charities with premises and those who provide activities that may not
take place on their own premises. I have no doubt that in tax law the
community sports facility concession is equivalent to that available to
charities with perhaps some change on VAT. He may want to check that it
is not tied to premises and that others will not be caught
unnecessarily. I am not accusing him of being malevolent, but the
matter is tricky and words of assurance do not work if all the
possibilities and circumstances of those involved have not been
checked.</div><a name="06070511000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000481"></a>The

Members to keep interventions relatively

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000482"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The hon. Gentleman
obviously knows far more than I do about community amateur sports
clubs, which play an important role. My understanding is that if a
charity wants to become a CASC, it can start a new CASC and pass its
assets over. The new CASC would then have charitable purposes without
being a charity but would have all the benefits of charitable
status.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div><a name="06070511000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000483"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> This will be brief. Unless there is a provision
in the legislation dealing with CASCs that allows a charity to pass its
assets to an organisation that is not a charity, the Minister may be
providing more reassurance than the legislation provides. It would be
helpful if he could clear up the matter&#151;if not today, then
soon.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000484"></a>Edward

trying to clear it up today. I will return to the matter on Report to

CASCs and charities that are sports

him down a completely different avenue, so the Parliamentary Secretary
was unable to say what I anticipated: that he accepted that it was a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000489"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Specifically, but ineffectively, that the
commission should be accountable to a Select Committee. That was out of
regard for the fact that, as far as I know, there is no Committee
responsible for the activities of the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, so I did not know where to put that
responsibility.</div>
<a name="06070511000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, I have experience
of the Education and Skills Committee, to which a similar
non-ministerial department, Ofsted, is accountable in practice, if not
in law. That is immensely helpful. Ofsted had two hearings a year
before the Select Committee; those hearings generated substantial
reports that covered a wide range of Ofsted&#146;s activities,
including changes to its responsibilities, the implementation of new
legislation, value for money, and the means by which Ofsted develops
its relationship with schools. I am sure, Mr. Gale, that you can see
the analogies with the Charity Commission emerging. It will have to
develop its relationship with charities and implement new legislation.
It will have an awful lot of money and will, I hope, deliver good value
for it.</div> <a name="06070511000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Education and Skills Committee, I was able to question the decisions of
Ofsted. For example, I questioned why it defined a particular local
education authority as being &#147;satisfactory&#148; when in fact
it was deeply unsatisfactory in a number of particulars. I am pleased
to say that that local education authority is no longer under Liberal
Democrat control, partly, I am sure, as a result of the answers that I
got from Ofsted. The point is that the commission needs to be
accountable. It is fine&#151;excellent&#151;that it is made clear
that the commission is not under the direction of any Minister of the
Crown, but it has to be under the direction of someone. In my view, a
parliamentary Select Committee is where that accountability would
appropriately lie. In line with the suggestion of the Association for
Charities and many other organisations, I hope that the Minister will
find a way, on Report, to bring us some good news on how the commission
will be accountable in
future.</div><a name="06070511000243"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000490"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#151;or I did, before his speech.
Perhaps I will get my own back in a minute. He makes a serious point:
the Charity Commission is an extraordinarily powerful body. That came
home to me when I worked for Oxfam; recently, its reputation, and its
very future as a charity, had been under question, largely because
members of the Conservative party, in those days, seemed less convinced
of the presumption of public benefit attaching to organisations. I
speak of organisations such as Oxfam, which not only address the relief
of poverty, but seek to prevent it by addressing its fundamental
causes, and campaigning on that basis. As I say, Oxfam&#146;s
reputation, and indeed its future as a charity, did, in one sense, hang
in the balance, and depended on the judgment of the Charity Commission.
I am pleased to say that the Charity Commission came to enlightened and
correct conclusions about the status of Oxfam, but had it not done so,
it would have been a very serious matter that would have affected the
lives of millions of vulnerable people from around the world, not just
in the UK.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div><a name="06070511000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right that a body that has
such powerful influence over some of the most vulnerable in our society
and others is subject to the fullest scrutiny. Much in the Bill
reflects that. It introduces bodies such as the charity appeal
tribunal, which provides a court of appeal against the decisions of the
Charity Commission. Nevertheless, a mechanism by which the commission
might be brought before Parliament, perhaps through a Select Committee,
would be desirable. Some of our later amendments reflect that. The
Minister would be wise to reflect on some of the comments that the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight made, except those about the Liberal Democrat
local education authority, and consider, through legislation,
regulation or his advice to the commission, some ways in which such
parliamentary scrutiny might take place.
</div><a name="06070511000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000491"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am sorry that the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight was defective, but I agreed with much of his
speech and with the hon. Member for Cheltenham.</div>
<a name="06070511000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the issue about clause
6 and scrutiny of the Charity Commission is that for a long
time&#151;I am not sure how long&#151;responsibility for charities
lay with the Home Office, and the relevant Select Committee was the
Home Affairs Committee. As I said on Second Reading, the Committee has
a lot on its plate, and charities were never going to be top of its
list of priorities. Others with more experience of this House than
myself will know more about procedure, but I do not think that it is
really up to us to specify in legislation the relationship to the
Select Committee. It is more a matter for Standing Orders.</div>
<a name="06070511000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">This legislation is the first
since 1960 to modernise the commission, and the commission recognises
that the role of the modern regulator requires proper scrutiny by this
House. My personal view is that the Public Administration Committee,
which scrutinises other Cabinet Office matters, would provide the
appropriate scrutiny. It is ably chaired by my hon. Friend the Member
for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). I wish the clause to stand part of the
Bill, but I shall return and, I hope, report further progress in my
discussions with that Committee.</div>
<a name="06070511000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000492"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I have no more experience in this House than my
hon. Friend, but the Charity Commission, as a recipient of public funds
like other regulators, will be scrutinised by the National Audit Office
and the Public Accounts Committee. It is a question of considering not
so much the efficiency, which I hope hon. Members feel that Committee
will deal with adequately, but the policies of the Charity
Commission.</div>
<a name="06070511000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000493"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The only
thing I would say is that the NAO and the PAC have considered the
Charity Commission in the past, but the examinations have been
infrequent&#151;every few years rather than annually or more than
annually. I sense from this Committee a desire for regular scrutiny and
regular Charity Commission appearances before a Select Committee. I
hear what the Committee says, I shall continue discussions with other
Members, and I hope to report progress, if possible, on
Report.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div><a name="06070511000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000494"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> That is very welcome. The Committee needs to
accept that charities law is now in the hands of a Minister who is not
subject to a Select Committee is a matter of chance. That was not
intended. No one seriously believes that the Government said,
&#147;We will make this arrangement to avoid a Select Committee
taking interest.&#148; The best thing we can do is accept that the
situation is unlikely to continue for very long. We should request
that, when convenient, the Government ensure that charities law goes to
a Secretary of State who is subject to a Select Committee, and where
possible, the commission and the Minister are answerable to this
House.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000495"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The Charity
Commission has had a hard time today, but my final comment is that I
think that there is a genuine desire in the Charity Commission to be
properly scrutinised in what it is doing. Under the legislation it will
have to submit an annual report to the House, not through the Home
Secretary as was previously the case. I believe that there is a genuine
desire for maximal scrutiny and accountability through the House and I
hope that that can happen through our good

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000498"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The previous discussion on the responsibilities
and powers of the Charity Commission is relevant to this provision too.
One of the things that I have noticed, on moving from the charity
sector to Parliament, is that there is a charming belief in this place
that laws always have the right results once they are passed.
[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] The more experienced Members do not share that
belief, so I stand corrected. Sometimes, though, I think that when
considering legislation we should introduce mechanisms to make it more
likely that bodies will do what we intend them to do, so that the
representative nature of bodies such as the Charity Commission is
preserved.</div><a name="06070511000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
some disquiet in the voluntary sector about the operation of the
Charity Commission in practice and about the need for it to reflect the
wider population in two important respects. The first such respect is
the increasingly diverse nature of British society. It is probably
unfair to say that the commission reflected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div>the great and the good in the old-fashioned, traditional charitable
sense, but there is certainly a risk that it does not reflect the full
diversity of modern Britain. If it is considering religious charities,
which may include Islamic charities, Buddhist organisations or others
from a wider range of social and ethnic backgrounds than previously, it
should perhaps be more representative of those communities as
well.</div><a name="06070511000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second important respect is the increasing trend toward representation
of people who have direct experience as beneficiaries of a charity.
That applies in the running of the organisations themselves. There is a
clear trend among grant-giving bodies such as Comic Relief or the Big
Lottery Fund and even Government Departments to insist on evidence that
beneficiaries of charity services or service users are represented in
the running of an organisation, and that would be a good principle to
extend to the Charity Commission itself. I suggested an amendment that
would have made that explicit, but the Clerks pointed out, in ruling it
out of order, that almost everybody could be the beneficiary of some
charity, and that therefore the provision would be rather meaningless,
and I am sure that that might be
right.</div><a name="06070511000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
72 would increase the minimum number of members of the commission from
four to six, thereby increasing the likelihood of the commission being
a more representative body in both those respects. It would also
incidentally reduce the potential power of the chairman&#146;s
casting vote&#151;a reduction that would be a desirable thing in any
organisation. On a probing basis, I would like to test out the reason
for having such a small number as the minimum number of members of the
commission.</div><a name="06070511000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 73 specifically addresses experience of charitable activity. The
original amendment that I drafted was rather more explicit about that
experience being experience as a beneficiary or as a service user, but,
as I explained, that has been ruled out of order. The revised amendment
does what I did not really intend, which is to provide a new broad
power for the Secretary of State. Under most circumstances that is the
kind of thing that I stand up and indignantly oppose, so I am not sure
that I am as enthusiastic about the re-drafted amendment as I was about
my original one. Nevertheless we should take every opportunity to
ensure that members of powerful bodies such as the commission&#151;it
will make rulings on charities rooted in particular communities, social
backgrounds and ethnic origins and representing, for instance, people
with disabilities&#151;should wherever possible have experience of
such services themselves. Ideally, the Charity Commission should
include a person with disabilities and perhaps someone with a different
ethnic background from the majority of its members. That is why I have
proposed the
amendments.</div><a name="06070511000365"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000499"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> By an inadvertent slip of the tongue, I think, the
hon. Gentleman suggested that under the Bill, the commission will have
a minimum of four members. If he looks at the schedule, he will see
that it will have a chairman and four members, so the minimum number
will be five.</div><a name="06070511000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
all of us are potential beneficiaries of charitable services in one
form or another&#151;citizens 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>advice bureaux, for example, could benefit everyone&#151;is the hon.
Gentleman not stating the obvious by specifying such a measure in his
amendment? No Minister would put forward the names of people who were
not representative or potential beneficiaries. Is he not guilty once
again of the Cheltenham principle in tabling an amendment that is
harmless if not entirely
necessary?</div><a name="06070511000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000500"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
great experience in the voluntary sector. The joke is beginning to wear
a little bit thin, though, as we have now heard it four times during
this debate, and I am not sure that it was entirely fair the first
time, let alone the fifth or
sixth.</div><a name="06070511000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is correct up to a point, but I am not sure that it is always
automatic that such an exalted body as the Charity Commission will
necessarily represent the interests of users and beneficiaries. It is
sensible and almost inevitable that it will represent people who know
how to run a charity. Such people might be in the old mould and
represent, if I might use a slightly pejorative phrase, the rather
patronising traditional approach to charity as something done to people
rather than something shared with people that empowers them.</div>
<a name="06070511000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are moving toward a
different understanding of charity that is about empowerment and giving
the users and beneficiaries of charities the right to some say in how
those charities are run. That is the kind of change that I am seeking
to
effect.</div><a name="06070511000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000501"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we proceed, the Committee should know
that there will shortly be a Division or Divisions in the House. It is
customary to suspend the Committee for 15 minutes after the start of
the Division or the second or final Division, whenever that is. There
will therefore be a period of
suspension.</div><a name="06070511000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
will be gladdened to know that I have told the Government Whip that I
am prepared to sit in the Chair for as long as it takes this evening,
within reason. If Members wish to sit, they may do so. That will be a
matter for negotiation among the Government and Opposition Whips, the
Minister and others. Members may wish to take the opportunity of the
Division to work that
out.</div><a name="06070511000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will say to the
Committee, because I believe in making sure that people are aware of
what is going on, that it will in any event be necessary at some point
in the fairly near future for me to break the Committee, probably for
an hour, to allow Committee staff something to eat. With that proviso,
Members may now choose to negotiate their own
positions.</div><a name="06070511000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because a
Government amendment is grouped with the amendments, it might be
helpful if I call the Minister to speak to Government amendment No. 57
and then allow the Committee to debate the group. I shall not seek to
restrict debate before I invite other Members to
participate.</div><a name="06070511000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000502"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The purpose of Government amendment No. 57 is to
maintain the status of the Charity Commission&#146;s staff as civil
servants. Without it, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div>they might well cease to be so once the Bill is enacted. The amendment
will deal with the effect of an earlier amendment agreed in another
place whose stated intentions were to deal with concerns about the
commission&#146;s independence and to ensure that it was not under
ministerial control.</div>
<a name="06070511000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad to say that the
Government feel that the Charity Commission&#146;s independence has
been made clear through the provisions of new section 1A(4), which
states that, in the exercise of its functions, it should not be subject
to the direction or control of any Minister of the Crown or other
Department. The wording of my amendment would maintain the status of
the Charity Commission&#146;s staff as members of the home civil
service. That is a common provision used in other legislation where
non-ministerial Departments are established, for example, that which
established the Food Standards
Agency.</div><a name="06070511000274"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000503"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall ask what may sound like a mischievous
question, but in fact it is genuine. Will the Parliamentary Secretary
summarise the benefits to the staff of being classed as civil
servants?</div><a name="06070511000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000504"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> There are two choices for Government: the
Charity Commission staff can be civil servants, because they are
working for a Department, albeit a non-ministerial one, or there can
bea non-Departmental public body approach. My understanding of
this matter, which was fully considered by the Joint Committee and the
strategy unit, is that there would be more control by Ministers of a
non-Departmental public body; such a body would be more subject to the
direction of Ministers than a non-ministerial Department. People are
clear that in regulating for food safety, the FSA, for example,
operates transparently and independently. That is a good model for us
to follow.</div><a name="06070511000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Charity
Commission already has delegated authority on behalf of the Minister
for the Civil Service to determine the number and grading of its posts
and the terms and conditions of employment, in so far as they relate to
remuneration allowances, and so on. The commission is only required to
agree the overall pay remit with the Treasury. It takes its own
decisions on terms and conditions of service within a broad framework
and has some latitude, while remaining a non-ministerial
Department.</div><a name="06070511000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is important to the board and staff of the Charity
Commission, because without it the commission might end up in the
unique position of being the only Department whose staff are not in the
civil service. That is the basis of the amendment, which I commend to
the
Committee.</div><a name="06070511000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000505"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary&#146;s
response. The Government amendment is sensible. I read it as saying
that Ministers will not get involved in the appointment of the chief
executive; that is left to the Charity Commission, which is a good
idea.</div><a name="06070511000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ought to
acknowledge and put on the record that I am and have been a trustee of
a large number of charities, and so has my wife, who is also involved
in headhunting in the charitable field.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div><a name="06070511000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Parliamentary Secretary has
chosen the right form for the Charity Commission. Ministers have much
more power over things that they do not directly control than those
over which they have closer control, such as Departments, from which
they are kept further away. That helps keep away some of the
malevolence or frustration that is occasionally expressed by
Ministers.</div><a name="06070511000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that the amendment is saying that the number of charity commissioners,
plus the chairman, should increase. However, that is not necessary. It
is clear that the Government intend to appoint six, seven or eight.
Having a low number means that the commission can still exist if one
member has a car crash, another is struck off and somebody else
retires.</div><a name="06070511000282"></a>

comments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000508"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I will be brief.</div>
<a name="06070511000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 72, the Bill
makes significant improvements to the Government&#146;s arrangements
for the commission. It enables the board to reflect legal and
accounting expertise, a Welsh perspective and the diversity of the
sector.</div>
<a name="06070511000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is our
strong intention to appoint nine members to the board. In
accordance with the wise words of the hon. Member for Worthing, West,
we have to plan on the basis that if there were some act of God, the
commission could carry on functioning. I hope that the hon.
Member for Cheltenham will withdraw the amendment. We want a commission
of nine because that is far more likely to represent the diversity of
the sector and be an effective board for the Charity
Commission.</div><a name="06070511000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 73 does not reflect the intentions of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham. I have already spoken about Government amendment No. 57,
which I hope will be
supported.</div><a name="06070511000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000509"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful that the Minister has the strong
intention to appoint nine members to the commission. I am reassured by
that, as I am by his comments on amendment No. 73. However, I hope that
he will take on board the comments made about having not only a more
socially and ethnically representative commission, but one that, for
instance, includes somebody with disabilities. We should also look at
the users and beneficiaries of charities as possible members of the
commission; that would be in line with the general trend towards the
empowerment and representation of users and beneficiaries in the sector
as a whole.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div><a name="06070511000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not refer to Government
amendment No. 57 and am still slightly mystified about the supposed
huge benefit that attaches to commission members&#146; belonging to
the civil service. I am sure that that is great and laudable, but this
is my first public sector job and I sometimes find it a little rigid
compared to my previous experience in the business and charity sectors.
I am not sure that it is necessarily right rigidly to prescribe terms
and conditions for any organisation in that way. However, I take it on
trust that the move is sensible in the context of the Government as a
whole. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000512"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The amendment is very simple.In the
spirit of e-government, inclusiveness and accessibility, it aims to
extend the publication of the commission&#146;s report, which would
normally simply be laid before Parliament. The amendment would add the
report to the commission&#146;s website, as opposed to simply the
parliamentary website, so that it would be there for any affected
charities to read and access in the easiest form possible. I hope that
hon. Members will happily support
that.</div><a name="06070511000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No.
7, with which mine has been grouped, the Conservatives suggest the
organisation of an annual meeting of the Charity Commission, which
would have to maximise the attendance of charity representatives. That
objective seems entirely laudable. In keeping with the Cheltenham
principle, it is both harmless and desirable, and I therefore support
it.</div><a name="06070511000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000513"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Amendment No. 7 does not follow the Cheltenham
principle because it is harmless but necessary&#151;organisations are
good at organising their annual meetings at inconvenient times in
inconvenient places. I suspect that the Charity Commission would not be
doing this intentionally. However, the most sensible time from its
point of view would be lunchtime on a Wednesday but from their
trustees&#146; point of view it would probably be at a weekend. That
is why I hope that the commission will take account of this when
deciding when and where to locate its annual general
meeting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div><a name="06070511000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="06070511000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000514"></a>Peter
Bottomley:</b> May I suggest that we can trust the Charity
Commission to have more than one meeting? The annual meeting does not
have a legal status except it may be required by the legislation. I
would hope that the Charity Commission is similar to the BBC and that
it will go around the country so that trustees of local charities can
be in attendance and raise issues.</div>
<a name="06070511000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">When making a decision that
could go either way, the Charity Commission ought to go out to public
consultation. I can give one example that would be relevant to an
annual meeting, which is the suggestion that the commission will pick
out one or more Olympic sports and say that they are not charities. It
would be useful at a public meeting, or even a private one, for the
Minister to say to the Charity Commission, &#147;Do not try and pick
out one or two of the Olympic sports and say that they are not
charitable.&#148;</div>
<a name="06070511000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000515"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> In relation to maximising the number of
representatives, may I ask the Committee to consider that the case made
by the hon. Member for Cheltenham sounds entirely reasonable because it
is a matter of getting an effective discussion that involves the
sector? However, there is a danger with the wording that success will
be measured merely by numbers, in which case the commission would take
Wembley stadium for the meeting. However, that might be less productive
and less challenging to the commission in terms of debate and
engagement.</div>
<a name="06070511000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000516"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I fear that&#151;I hate to end the evening on
an uncharitable note&#151;both amendments follow the Cheltenham
principle. Neither of them is necessary. I hope that I can explain why
to the Committee.</div>
<a name="06070511000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
already requires the commission to publish its annual report and lay a
copy before Parliament, as right hon. and hon. Members know. The
commission&#146;s publication scheme also sets out the classes of
information that it intends to make available to the public as a matter
of course, the manner in which it intends to publish the information
and whether a charge will be made for that information.</div>
<a name="06070511000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Publication schemes are
intended to encourage organisations to publish more information
proactively. The commission&#146;s publication scheme includes
details of its annual report, which it makes freely available on its
website. It is also available in print.</div>
<a name="06070511000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000517"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that amendment No.65
puts a technological limit on the Bill? For example, we are already
moving towards podcasts. By having websites, what happens in a few
years&#146; time when they are old hat and there is a new form of
technology? Does my hon. Friend agree that, by being prescriptive, we
are probably being
counter-productive?</div><a name="06070511000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000518"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. His
e-sophistication is greater than mine, and I suspect, than that of most
members of the Committee.</div>
<a name="06070511000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill already requires the
commission to publish its annual report. The commission&#146;s
publication scheme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>provides for it to be made available on the commission&#146;s website.
That is an example of the aforementioned principle and therefore I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06070511000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes
me to amendment No. 7, which encourages the Charity Commission to
ensure</div> <a name="06070511000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;attendance by as
many representatives of charities as reasonably
practicable.&#148;.</div><a name="06070511000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
say&#151;I hesitate to be the defender of the Charity Commission on
this occasion and I do not intend to be&#151;that we need to
understand what the commission is doing. The Bill sets out detailed
requirements for the commission about the timing of advance publicity
of the AGM. The commission will be required to take reasonable steps to
notify all registered charities of the arrangements for the AGM and to
publish details bringing it to the attention of the general public.
That will ensure that the main stakeholders in the work of the
commission are aware of the
AGM.</div><a name="06070511000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
last year&#151;even before the Bill has been passed&#151;the
commission has been holding an open AGM as a matter of good practice.
It has notified all the main registered charities&#151;there are more
than 150,000&#151;of the AGM&#146;s details in advance. It has
already communicated, to all the main charities on the register,
details of the AGM that will be held later this year.</div>
<a name="06070511000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission does, however,
limit the number of attendees to two from each charity, although I
think that all hon. Members will agree that that is sensible. I wonder
what would happen if all, or even asignificant proportion, of
the 150,000 charities sent representatives to the
meeting&#151;Wembley stadium, even in its rebuilt form, would not be
big enough.</div> <a name="06070511000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission is therefore taking important steps to make itself as open
as possible and to encourage as many representatives as possible to
attend its annual meeting. However, I take on board the interesting
and, once again, wise words of the hon. Member for Worthing, West about
the need for the commission not only to hold an annual general meeting,
but to have a roadshow at which it can talk about its work. I am sure
that the commission will be listening and will read the report of our
proceedings, and I hope that it will take up that suggestion.</div>
<a name="06070511000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said all that, however,
I should repeat that neither amendment is necessary. I hope that the
hon. Member for Isle of Wight will not press amendment No.
7.</div><a name="06070511000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000519"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am intrigued by the suggestion from the hon.
Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South that the commission&#146;s annual
report might be translated into a podcast. Given that podcasts are
live-action broadcasts, that would require somebody to sit there
reading the report, which might make for a fairly boring podcast and an
enormous file size. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is quite
right about that.</div>
<a name="06070511000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070511000520"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I was merely illustrating the fact that there are
alternative technologies out there, and who knows what tomorrow will
bring.</div>
