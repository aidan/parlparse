<P>
<B>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody </B>(Crewe and Nantwich): I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<P>
I had been looking forward to serving under the chairmanship of one of our most talented, intelligent and tolerant Chairmen, Dr. Clark&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> And then I turned up.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Dunwoody:</B> It is a great disappointment to me that, because we are unable to proceed with the Committee this morning, I have had to move the adjournment. I do so with some dispatch, and I hope that we shall be able to return next Wednesday morning.
<P>
<B>Sir Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire):</B> I endorse everything that the hon. Lady, whom I think of as my hon. Friend, has said about your chairmanship, Dr. Clark. I, too express the hope that we shall indeed be able to meet next Wednesday morning&#151;and for many subsequent Wednesdays&#151;and get this most important piece of legislation on to the statute book. I am fortified by the knowledge that the Minister is here, because I cannot think that he would have allowed us to meet so briefly today if he had not been absolutely confident that the Government would remain in office to complete their full mandate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
<UL><UL><UL>Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes to Eleven o'clock till Wednesday 4 April at half-past Ten o'clock.
