Bill.</div>
<a name="09061655000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061655000374"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Atkinson, and welcome back to the Chair for
what I think will be a very interesting day for the Committee. May I
also welcome the hon. Member for Burnley back to her previous
Department? We went head to head last year on a particular clause in
the previous Finance Bill, so it is good to have her
back.</div><a name="09061655000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
56 relates to the tax treatment of Members of the European Parliament.
It gives tax relief against United Kingdom tax for the new, or maybe
not so new, Communities tax that the European Union will levy on
MEPs&#146; salaries and benefits. The relief will operate in broadly
the same way as if the MEP had paid, for example, Belgian tax on his or
her earnings. The peculiarity involved, however, is that the UK has no
dual taxation treaty with the EU.</div>
<a name="09061655000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes state that, in subsection (1), the clause</div>
<a name="09061655000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;extends the
application of &#145;double taxation relief&#146; under the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA) to European Community tax
deducted from the pay, transitional allowances and pensions of members
of the European Parliament (MEPs) under the new Statute for Members of
the European
Parliament&#148;.</div><a name="09061655000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth placing the statute&#146;s reference number, 2005/684/EC,
Euratom, on record, as I will refer to it in due course. The
explanatory notes go on to explain that, in subsection (2), the
clause</div><a name="09061655000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;also
amends the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA) to
provide that payment of transitional allowances to MEPs under the
Statute will be treated as termination payments in line with the
current treatment of other, similar
payments.&#148;</div><a name="09061655000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important for us to consider whether the termination payments are
indeed in line with the current treatment of other similar payments, at
least in the UK. I intend to examine MEPs&#146; pay, transitional
allowances, pensions and termination payments, all of which are covered
by the clause.</div>
<a name="09061655000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me begin
by giving some background information on why the payment of MEPs is
changing at all. MEPs&#146; pay will be going up as a result of the
new scheme of central payments by the EU, rather than payment by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>the Cabinet Office as is currently the case in the UK. In practice, the
new common salary for all MEPs across the EU will mean a significant
pay increase in sterling terms for UK MEPs. To be fair, the situation
is a result of the decline in the value of the pound thanks to the
Government&#146;s policies against the euro since the statute was
voted on. At the time of the vote, MEPs were voting for a pay rate that
was very similar to the current rate, and that was the same as an
MP&#146;s pay
rate.</div><a name="09061655000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000375"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> I
cannot resist asking whether the hon. Gentleman feels that that is an
argument in favour of joining the
euro.</div><a name="09061655000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000376"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> It most certainly is not. I have heard some fairly
spurious arguments in favour of joining the euro, notably from the
noble Lord Mandelson in recent days, but that particular argument may
be the most spurious of them all, so we reject
it.</div><a name="09061655000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061655000377"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
share my concern that the Labour party&#151;sorry, the
Government&#151;is now encouraging Britain to join the
euro?</div><a name="09061655000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000378"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that we will go any
further down that
route.</div><a name="09061655000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000379"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. He is
quite right. I recall that there were a number of tests involved, but
they seem to have been thrown out by the Minister, who has returned to
the Treasury from the Department for Work and Pensions. Perhaps she
came under influence while she was at the DWP.</div>
<a name="09061655000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that
the salary, at the time it was voted upon, would be broadly similar to
that of an MP was an important factor in Conservative support for the
new statute at that time. As far as MEPs&#146; tax arrangements are
concerned, UK MEPs are currently paid monthly via the Cabinet Office,
and under those arrangements they pay tax through PAYE, along with
national insurance contributions. After the end of the tax year they
have to complete a self-assessment form, send it to Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs at its public department No. 1
office and pay any tax that was not already paid under PAYE. On the
face of it, that looks pretty much like the arrangements for any other
taxpayer.</div>
<a name="09061655000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, once
the new Europe-wide statute is in force, UK MEPs who were re-elected in
2009 will have the option of staying in the current pay arrangements
for as long as they remain MEPs. If they do so, they will continue to
be paid their present salary with no change in the tax and national
insurance contributions arrangements that currently apply. If, however,
they decide to opt for the statute instead&#151;new MEPs will have no
choice in that matter, as they must go for the new, standardised,
Europe-wide statute&#151;they will be paid directly by the European
Parliament, their salary will be paid by Brussels and they will pay
that Community tax on it.</div>
<a name="09061655000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current
plans to implement the statute, the Government have decided to exercise
their right to apply UK tax as well, and we in the Conservative party
strongly support that. We have consistently argued that it would be
iniquitous for MEPs not to pay tax at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>same rate as their electors. They will therefore pay UK tax on their
salaries but will, under clause 6, be given credit for any Community
tax already paid, which is what is proposed in clause 56. They will
therefore be taxed at the same rate as a UK resident earning the same
salary in the UK.</div>
<a name="09061655000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding of the new statue is that, because MEPs will be paid by
the European Parliament, tax will not be deducted under UK PAYE.
Instead, any additional UK tax liability will be collected through
their self-assessment. MEPs will therefore need to set aside money from
their salaries to pay their prospective UK tax bills at the end of the
financial year. They will also continue to be liable for employee-rate
UK national insurance contributions on their salaries and will work out
their contributions each month and make payments, so UK MEPs face a
complicated regime.</div>
<a name="09061655000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, that is a
rough synopsis of the provision before us. It is just a shame that the
clause could not have been debated a couple of weeks earlier, before
the European elections, when it would have been rather more topical. In
fact, I wonder whether the Government&#146;s approach will be
coloured by the loss of five of their 18 MEPs earlier this month. There
are now so few Labour MEPs that I wonder whether the Government were
considering a late volte-face on clause 56 and dropping its provisions
altogether. With only 13 seats, Labour scored less than parties it
loves to criticise.</div>
<a name="09061655000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000380"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman did mention clause 56,
but he is nevertheless straying wide of the clause. I would be grateful
if he came back to the matter at hand.</div>
<a name="09061655000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000381"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> You are of course right, Mr.
Atkinson, but I will just finish the sentence. They won only
13 seats, fewer than the Polish Law and Justice party, which
is one
of&#151;</div><a name="09061655000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000382"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am quite happy to give some latitude,
but the hon. Gentleman is now taking liberties.</div>
<a name="09061655000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000383"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I apologise, Mr.
Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09061655000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061655000384"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Will the hon. Gentleman show
the leadership for which he is renowned by encouraging all Conservative
MEPs to forgo any additional
salary?</div><a name="09061655000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000385"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am not quite sure about the leadership for which
I am renowned, but what other salaries might be available to MEPs? Did
the hon. Gentleman mean outside
employment?</div><a name="09061655000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000386"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> No, I did not. I understand that they could decide
unilaterally to pay themselves the same amount, in pounds sterling in
equivalent terms, as MPs in this House, so any increase that they might
enjoy, as a result of either a higher rate of pay or exchange rates,
could be forgone.</div>
<a name="09061655000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000387"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b><b class="B"> </b>We obviously have many more MEPs than any
other party, so I have not been able to check those arrangements with
each of them, but I understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>that they will all be following the rules precisely. I  refer
the hon. Gentleman to a document on the conservatives.com website,
&#147;Our Commitment To The British People&#148;. I accept that we
are straying from the debate a little, but precisely how our MEPs will
accord with the rules is there chapter and verse.</div>
<a name="09061655000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, when it
comes to clause 56, I find it interesting that the Government are
proposing tax relief for MEPs, deciding to hide it from public view
before the European elections, and have almost no MEPs for the clause
to refer to.</div>
<a name="09061655000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say a
little about the new rules for MEPs pay, coming into effect next month,
which, as mentioned, are the background to clause 56. The new rules
will have the most impact in poorer countries, such as Bulgaria, where
MEPs earn around 50 times more than the average domestic salary. As we
know, the rules will set a standard salary for all 736 MEPs, regardless
of the economic conditions of the relevant member state. The
think-tank, Open Europe, has
said:</div><a name="09061655000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
huge gaps in pay will tempt the most talented people away from national
politics.&#148;</div><a name="09061655000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
particular issue is probably beyond the remit of today&#146;s debate,
but I notice that the Government seem to have decided that there is too
little talent left for them in the House of Commons, as shown by the
appointment of seven Peers to attend
Cabinet.</div>
<a name="09061655000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000388"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is trying my patience.
I urge him to keep to the essence of clause 56,
which is about double taxation relief for
MEPs.</div>
<a name="09061655000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000389"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Indeed, Mr. Atkinson.
Ironically, the Government are bringing back MEPs to serve in the
national Government. I was going to come back later to the tax
treatment of a member of the European Parliament joining the
Government.</div><a name="09061655000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the explanatory notes say, the new pay regime takes effect from the new
Parliament, which will assemble in a few weeks. The new package has
certainly raised some eyebrows, not least because it was voted on by
the European Parliament itself. New MEPs will automatically be subject
to the new package and re-elected MEPs will be able to choose which
package suits them best. I am not aware of any legislature in the world
that has that luxury. The consequence is that MEPs will be paid
directly by the Community, rather than by their mother country, and
will be subject to tax by the
Community.</div><a name="09061655000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
obvious area that the Minister needs to explain is the EU&#146;s
ability to raise tax in its own right&#151;the so-called &#147;tax
for the benefit of the Communities&#148;. At first, I thought that
the EU having tax-raising powers must be entirely new, but can the
Minister confirm that the European Community tax referred to in the
explanatory notes is derived from Council regulation No. 260/68 of 29
February 1968? It was designed for Commission staff and later European
Investment Bank staff. I shall be grateful if she will explain whether
the tax has existed for a long time. The tax is paid back into the EU
budget and clause 56 extends the scheme to MEPs. Can the Minister
confirm
that?</div><a name="09061655000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister needs to explain which part of the EU raises the tax and where
it goes&#151;for example, to which part of the EU budget. What is
more, even if the European Community tax is not new, I am sure that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>am not alone in being worried about its extension into fields not
foreseen in 1968. The ability to raise taxes would confirm broader
fears of a European superstate and measures to give it tax-raising
powers should generally be resisted&#151;not least, powers over
elected representatives from the member states.</div>
<a name="09061655000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I found that
most sources on this Community tax were extremely opaque. The best
explanation that I could find was on the website of the
EIB:</div><a name="09061655000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
key-concepts concerning the community tax:</div>
<a name="09061655000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">Progressive tax scale:
as with the majority of national taxation systems, Community tax is
based on the principle of a progressive tax scale: the greater the
taxable income the higher the rate of tax.</div>
<a name="09061655000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">Brackets: Progressive
taxation is achieved by dividing the scale into brackets. The taxable
amount in each bracket is taxed at the rate applying to that
bracket.</div> <a name="09061655000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">Top
bracket: the lowest bracket is zero-rated for tax purposes, the second
is taxed at 8%, and so on up to the top bracket, which is taxed at the
maximum rate of
45%.&#148;</div><a name="09061655000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09061655000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of us will find it ironic that the Finance Bill, which sees an enabling
clause to create a new 50 per cent. tax rate for all British subjects,
is the same Bill that allows our MEPs to be taxed by this &#147;tax
for the benefit of the Communities&#148; at a maximum rate of only 45
per cent. Having said that, it looks as if the HMRC reserves the right,
as I have said, for UK MEPs to pay tax on the difference between this
&#147;tax for the benefit of the Communities&#148; and UK tax.
However, the Minister will need to make that clear and it would be
interesting to know whether other states&#146; MEPs have to pay that.
Knowing in which states that is not the case would inform the debate a
great deal.</div>
<a name="09061655000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">If this
&#147;tax for the benefit for the Communities&#148;, as referred to
in the explanatory notes, has been in place since 1968 and the UK has
had no double taxation treaty with the EU, which is actually the
origins of clause 56, have there been cases in the last 41 years of
someone working for the EU&#151;perhaps the Commission, or a body
such as the EIB&#151;actually being taxed twice? That is the
implication of the Government&#146;s argument for introducing these
measures.</div>
<a name="09061655000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose
that all those subject to the Community tax are probably resident in
Belgium, but that is not necessarily the case, perhaps, for a member of
staff of the EIB working in a London branch. I would be grateful for an
explanation of whether they are paid by the EU, but have effectively
been subject to taxation by both authorities in the period since 1968.
It would be helpful to have some light shone on that, because we are
talking about introducing a new clause which may have been needed in
1968, but not in 2009.</div>
<a name="09061655000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will also have to explain the coefficients being used for these taxes.
Returning again to the EIB website, the best explanation I could find
of this &#147;tax for the benefit of the Communities&#148;
was:</div><a name="09061655000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
original tax scale was laid down by regulation 260/68: coefficient of
100%. This coefficient is readjusted on a regular basis by the Council
of Ministers of the E.C. The current coefficient adapting the tax
brackets is
486.7097%.&#148;</div><a name="09061655000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
the Committee needs to know what has been increased almost five fold
since 1968 in this &#147;tax for the benefit of the
Communities&#148; referred to in the explanatory notes. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>Is it the level of the tax brackets, or the actual percentage taxed on
the lowest band? I simply do not understand what these coefficients
are, but it is very important for us to know what they
are.</div><a name="09061655000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth having a look at what sort of sums might be involved in clause
56. The think tank Open Europe published a comparison last week between
the costs of the UK and the European Parliaments. Their findings are
that the European Parliament cost taxpayers a staggering &#163;1.8
million a year for each MEP. That is in contrast to the House of
Commons, which cost taxpayers only &#163;364,000 for each Member for
each year. The other place costs only &#163;208,000 per member per
year. So the overall bill is over five times the level of a national
MP, or nine times the level of a peer.</div>

In recent months perhaps five times the media attention has been given

shone on those things. I commend, again, my party colleagues in the

basis?</div><a name="09061655000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000395"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000396"></a>Mr.

guidance on that particular matter, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="09061655000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to Open Europe&#146;s comparison, as it is important here.
According to that comparison, based on the respective
Parliaments&#146; budget allocations, national MPs at Westminster
claim &#163;148,297 in allowances each year on average, while our
counterparts in Brussels can claim up to &#163;363,000 per annum,
which is two and a half times as much. Furthermore, MEPs, in contrast
to national MPs, do not have to produce receipts to claim their
allowances, although that is changing. Mr.
Atkinson, I apologise if this is outside the scope of today&#146;s
discussion, but I am yet to hear of plans for any Liberal Democrat or
UK Independence party MEPs to publish their receipts.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div><a name="09061655000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly,
the Open Europe study found that 22 UK MEPs retiring this
year will receive a share of a &#163;20 million pay-off,
in both pensions and benefits. Each will be
paid&#151;</div><a name="09061655000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000397"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are straying again. The clause is to
do with
tax.</div><a name="09061655000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000398"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you for that guidance,
Mr. Atkinson. I was coming on to describe the tax
on those pensions and benefits. Each of those MEPs will be paid up to
two years&#146; salary to help them adjust to their new life, and
will share a &#163;10 million index-linked pension pot. This is where
the important matter of the transitional payments comes in. Earlier, I
mentioned the Government&#146;s argument that the tax treatment of
those transitional payments is essentially the same as the tax
treatment of redundancy payments in the private sector. I am going to
doubt whether that is the case. That is the importance of the
transitional payments. Each of those MEPs gets a transitional payment
of more than &#163;30,000, up to &#163;55,000 to close their
offices and lay off staff, and a pension worth between &#163;175,000
and
&#163;235,000.</div><a name="09061655000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not entirely clear to me whether those extremely generous
transitional payments and pensions will be subject to the tax regime
that was in place prior to 2009 or the one that will be in place
afterwards, or whether some choice might be involved. The explanatory
notes state that existing MEPs can chose
to</div><a name="09061655000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;retain
their existing remuneration
package.&#148;</div><a name="09061655000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
that apply to the tax treatment of moneys that they receive after 2009,
if they have stood down? In other words, will Community taxes or UK
taxes be paid on those transitional payments? That is not entirely
clear. I read in <i class="I">The Times</i> of 2 June that the first
&#163;30,000 of the transitional allowance will be tax-free, but who
will tax the amounts on top of that is not yet
clear.</div><a name="09061655000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we debate the clause, we should be mindful of the generosity of the
regime in Brussels, but to be fair, and in the interests of balance,
the degree of generosity is the cause of some dispute. The head of the
UK office of the European Parliament recently told<i class="I"> The Guardian
</i>that an MEP&#146;s allowances
are</div><a name="09061655000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;comparable
to an MP&#146;s
allowance&#148;,</div><a name="09061655000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
accused British media reports of being &#147;inaccurate or
tendentious&#148;. Open Europe&#146;s analysis, however, is
extensive and attributive, and I have yet to see any detailed counter
argument.</div><a name="09061655000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061655000399"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): My
hon. Friend and I, as central London Members, are perhaps unaffected by
this, but will he also note that there is a similar scam in section 292
of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, which ensures that
the additional cost allowances are tax-free? That is basically a scam
that our own MPs play on each other, and one hopes that the Treasury
will pay immediate and urgent attention to ensuring this particular
situation is
entirely&#151;</div><a name="09061655000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000400"></a>Mr.

intervention.</div>
<a name="09061655000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000401"></a>Mr.

offended?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div><a name="09061655000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000402"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think it is a suitable word and I hope the
hon. Gentleman does not feel too offended. I am sure he is robust
enough.</div><a name="09061655000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000403"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> It would be dangerous for me to give an opinion on
my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention. He has made his point and perhaps
it might be more appropriate for others to respond in due course when
considering any reforms of the allowance structure in this place.
Nevertheless, the UK office of the European Parliament misleadingly
claims that MEPs&#146; pension rights are the same as for a
Westminster MP when in fact, under the new rules coming into force
following the European elections and giving rise to clause 56, MEPs
will be entitled to a far more generous pension scheme than MPs. My
understanding of the MPs&#146; pension scheme is that if we
contribute the standard 10 per cent. of our salary over a 10-year
period&#151;that is, a whole year&#146;s salary of &#163;63,291,
although I am not sure that is the latest figure&#151;we will have
access to a pension of &#163;15,822 per annum.</div>
<a name="09061655000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contrast,
under the new rules to come into force after the election, MEPs will
receive an annual pension of &#163;27,954 which is almost twice as
much, after paying in nothing from their own salaries over the same
10-year period. This is what Open Europe has said about the whole
package:</div><a name="09061655000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
European Parliament has introduced some reforms to come into force
after tomorrow. However, under the new rules, UK MEPs will get a huge
payrise, and while receipts will for the first time have to be produced
for travel expenses, the vast majority of expenses will continue to be
available without a receipt. On top of that, the pension becomes even
more generous than before&#151;dwarfing the pension that national MPs
are entitled to.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061655000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we debate the tax
treatment of MEPs, we need to be aware of what we are paying for,
previously directly and now to be
indirectly.</div><a name="09061655000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
aspect on which the Government will need to provide reassurance is what
happens to MEPs and whether they need to pay any tax to the Belgian or
French national authorities if they declare themselves to be resident
in Belgium or France&#151;the two locations of the Parliament. With
the new tax for the benefit of the Communities, are MEPs now exempted
from Belgian taxation if they are mainly resident in Brussels? I do not
know the answer. That question has probably cropped up on a number of
occasions over the decades but I am not sure of the
situation.</div>
<a name="09061655000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of my
London MEPs wanted me to raise a question relating to the tax treatment
of those who are or might be deemed non-domiciled MEPs. Independent of
any questions relating to MEPS, it would appear that HMRC is
increasingly taking the view that EU citizens working in the UK are
generally to be treated as non-domiciled. There is a very important
issue in London. My constituency has the second highest proportion of
non-UK EU citizens in the country. Kensington and Chelsea is the first
and the two Cities is probably the third or fourth along with Camden.
That means that over 9 per cent. of my constituency are non-UK EU
nationals. There is an important point about whether they will normally
be deemed non-domiciled, which I believe is the view increasingly taken
by HMRC.</div>
<a name="09061655000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interesting
questions arise with MEPs who were not previously UK residents. Let me
try to explain by using a specific example. This question to date has
been more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>theoretical than practical. I recall that either in the 1984 or 1989
European Parliamentary elections, David&#151;now Lord&#151;Steel
stood in Italy to become an Italian MEP, if my schoolboy memory is
correct.</div>
<a name="09061655000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000404"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> He did not win.</div>
<a name="09061655000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000405"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I think my hon. Friend is right. I cannot remember
whether he had any chance of winning, but that is a debate for another
day. Other than that, I am not aware of a trans-national MEP either
coming from the UK or representing the UK. However, as Dr. Tanner
pointed out to me, that changed on 4 June, with the election of Marta
Andreasen as an MEP for the south-east of England. Some might argue
that her election was  a little incongruous for UKIP, but that
would be to digress. I must say that I have no personal axe to grind
against Ms Andreasen at all. In fact, three or four years ago I spent a
pleasant half-hour or so with her on the Commons Terrace, being briefed
on the hows and whys of the EU not having its accounts properly signed
off. She seemed to be a very pleasant lady and I have nothing against
her being elected in this way. I am just using her example, more or
less at the request of one of my MEP colleagues, to try to establish
what the status might be of somebody who is a non-domiciled but
UK-resident
MEP.</div><a name="09061655000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
<a name="09061655000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, looking
at Ms Andreasen&#146;s case from a tax perspective, it throws up more
questions than answers about clause 56. This particular MEP
for the south-east of England was, as I understand it, born in
Argentina of Danish descent, is married to a Spaniard and lives in
Spain and has been elected to a Parliament that is based in both
Belgium and France. For a moment, I will ignore the policy of UKIP that
all UK citizens working in the UK should require a work permit; I will
ignore it as I do not think that it is within the scope of
today&#146;s debate.</div>
<a name="09061655000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
want to pose a tax question. Ms Andreasen seems to be someone who is
not domiciled in the UK but she may also wish to declare herself to be
resident here. Therefore, are the Government expecting that this type
of MEP will be taxed only by the new tax for the benefit of the
Communities, or do they expect that a non-domiciled UK MEP will also be
subject to UK taxation? Furthermore, how will the Government&#146;s
proposals for non-doms, as outlined in the Finance Act 2008, be applied
to non-dom MEPs if they are also deemed to be resident in the
UK?</div>
<a name="09061655000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we know,
timing can be key with the Government when it comes to changing the
remuneration and tax treatment of politicians. In last year&#146;s
debate on the severance payments for the Mayor of London, we saw just
before the election that the Government seemed especially keen on a
favourable tax treatment and severance package for any outgoing Mayor.
The timing for that was really most curious; I think that it was in the
last days of April 2008. The Government told us that the severance
payments given to Greater London assembly members and to outgoing
Mayors would be akin to private sector redundancy arrangements. They
argued that the same was true for Members of Parliament here. As I
understand it, a MP who retires here is treated in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>the same way as one who offers themselves for election but fails to be
elected; at least that was the situation until it was reviewed last
year.</div>
<a name="09061655000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thanks to the
Finance Act 2008, similar arrangements will be in place for the GLA.
The payment is not so much the equivalent of a redundancy payment in
the private sector; it is a payment that will be made in all cases to
MPs, Mayors and Greater London assembly members when they stand
down.</div>
<a name="09061655000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same now
appears to be the case with MEPs  and the Government&#146;s
treatment of them, according to clause 56 and the
explanatory notes. Clause 56(2), which is about termination payments,
puts the new scheme on to the same basis as the old scheme and gives
exemption to EU termination payments in the same way as House of
Commons termination payments. Nevertheless, it is still worth pointing
out that these rules, for both sets of parliamentarians, are more
favourable than those affecting the vast majority of the population. If
there was an entitlement in an ordinary employee&#146;s contract
along similar lines, it would normally be taxable in full and the first
&#163;30,000 would not be tax-free, as is the case with MEPs. I think
that the HMRC website
says:</div><a name="09061655000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
the first &#163;30,000 of redundancy can be received tax-free, this
tax-free limit only applies to ex-gratia payments, which means those
made to compensate for the end of employment. Therefore, unpaid wages,
notice period payments and bonuses are taxed as normal employment
income.&#148;</div><a name="09061655000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
it would be helpful to have a clarification of the tax status of the
termination payment of &#163;30,000&#151;in fact, it is more than
&#163;30,000&#151;paid to MEPs.</div>
<a name="09061655000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, this matter, in relation to termination payments, was
debated with regard to the Mayor of London and the Greater London
assembly in the discussions about the Finance Act 2008. The general
rule is that redundancy payments of up to &#163;30,000 are not
taxable if they are ex gratia and are not provided under the terms of
the contract of employment. Interestingly, HMRC has been seeking to
widen the definition of what is provided for in the specific terms of a
contract to benefits that are provided on a routine or customary basis
upon termination. Employees have long been able to argue at tribunal
that something has been customary in their employment, so it is
understandable that HMRC now seeks to extend that logic to attack
payments that are non-contractual, but customary on termination of
employment.</div>
<a name="09061655000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet, once
again, in this year&#146;s Finance Bill HMRC seems quite happy to
allow tax-free termination payments to politicians. I certainly do not
argue that Members of Parliament should have special
treatment&#151;in fact, quite the opposite. Why, therefore, are
payments like this given favourable statutory tax treatment when any
other termination payment has to be defended on a case-by-case basis
against the Revenue? It is not clear why Members of Parliament, MEPs
and Mayors of London should be offered statutory protection from such a
challenge. I would again be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
views.</div><a name="09061655000310"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000406"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I think I am going to take issue with my hon. Friend
here and ask him to explain the logic. Redundancy is where a job
disappears, normally because the company is closing down or is having
to cut back. The position disappears. In the case of politicians, the
position is not disappearing but involuntarily the person is not
allowed to continue in that post. I can understand why there is
different tax
treatment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000407"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. He is
right: it is not exactly the same. The easiest thing for me to do is to
refer him to the lengthy debate that was held on this very point during
the consideration of last year&#146;s Finance Bill by the Committee
of the whole House.</div>
<a name="09061655000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
be helpful to get clarification from the Minister about cases where an
MEP gives up his or her position voluntarily to take on office in a
national Government. The Government do not appear to be particularly
expert at these provisions. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for
Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) drew attention to the
case of an MEP who was appointed Europe Minister recently, rather
embarrassingly in the course of the Prime Minister&#146;s press
conference, the day after the European elections. He pointed out that
she would be unable to take on the role unless she first stood down as
an MEP. That seemed to be news both to the MEP and the Government,
despite the fact that anyone familiar with the European Parliament will
know that MEPs come in and out of national Government quite often in
other countries, requiring them to step
down.</div><a name="09061655000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to clause 56, what will be the tax status of the severance arrangement
for that particular MEP who is now, or maybe is not or perhaps soon is
the Europe Minister or is perhaps just the acting Europe Minister? I am
still not sure of her status. I think the public have a right to know,
not least because she is listed on the No. 10 website as being a
recipient of a full ministerial salary, unlike many of her Lords
colleagues, or soon-to-be colleagues, who have also been appointed to
the Government and/or attend
Cabinet.</div><a name="09061655000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have asked the Minister a number of questions during this short debate
on MEPs&#146; pay arrangements. I shall summarise them again.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I have eight questions. First, is
the assumption correct that the tax for the benefit of the Communities
is the one derived from the 1986 Council regulation? Secondly, which
part of the EU does the tax raising and where does the tax go? Thirdly,
have there been cases since 1968 where someone has been paid by the EU
Commission or the EIB and has been taxed twice because of the lack of
this clause? Is the clause absolutely necessary?</div>
<a name="09061655000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, the
Minister will need to explain the obscure coefficients I mentioned
earlier when referring to the EIB website to try to see whether we
really are comparing like with like on these matters. Fifthly, which
tax regime will apply post-2009 to MEPs&#146; pensions and transition
payments? Sixthly, are MEPs as a class of persons now, or were they
ever previously, exempted from national income taxes raised in Belgium,
France or any other country where they declared themselves to be
resident? Seventhly, what about a UK-resident but non-domiciled MEP,
like the UKIP MEP I mentioned earlier? I cannot say with any degree of
certainty that that is her status&#151;I have made a number of
inferences&#151;but I would be grateful for an explanation of how
that sort of person is, or might be, treated under clause 56. Finally,
what will be the tax treatment of any severance package of an MEP who
steps down voluntarily under the new statute, and how will that compare
with the existing
arrangements?</div><a name="09061655000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not, of course, oppose the clause. It would not be right for MEPs to
be taxed on their full salaries and other entitlements in their
entireties by two separate tax authorities. However, we have many
questions and seek a number of clarifications on the whole
matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000408"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Thank you for giving me the opportunity to
make the main speech on the clause, Mr. Atkinson.
I also support the Government&#146;s intentions, although I may
express my support in different terms. I congratulate the hon. Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham on his customary rigour in seeking
ministerial clarity on some individual cases, as well as on the broad
principles under
discussion.</div><a name="09061655000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make three brief points. First, I see the logic behind all MEPs
being paid the same, although some may feel that it is another step
down the path towards an EU Parliament that assumes a national profile,
rather than one that is an amalgamation of different nation states.
Similarly, I see the merit and wisdom of UK MPs being paid the same,
regardless of their individual contributions to our deliberations. I am
comfortable with that broad
principle.</div><a name="09061655000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I see the logic of phasing in the arrangements. I am willing to be
corrected, but I vaguely remember the Conservative party leader, the
right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron),
recently talking about closing the existing parliamentary pension
scheme to new entrants. If he did make that point, it would similarly
involve a phasing, interim arrangement whereby existing MPs would
continue to benefit from the current system, rather than a blanket
arrangement whereby all MPs, regardless of the length of their service,
were required to switch over to the new arrangement. In that context, I
see some sense in applying interim arrangements to the European
Parliament as
well.</div><a name="09061655000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
I see the sense in taxing MEPs at the same rate as their constituents.
Of course, there is a slight difference in that the provision should
very much apply to us in this House, because we set the rates of
taxation for our constituents, which is not true of MEPs. Nevertheless,
I see the sense in MEPs paying the same rates of taxation, whether they
be higher or lower than at present, as the people they represent.
However, under the salary level, MEPs would not, as was perhaps
inferred by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, be eligible to
pay the 50 per cent. rate on their income unless there was a massive
change in the rate of exchange between sterling and the euro. That
causes some difficulty, as we have seen in trying to work out whether
football transfers have broken records, because the pound is at such a
weak level that it affects comparisons between the UK and the eurozone.
However, seeing as the dominant EU currency is the euro, it seems
logical to pay MEPs at the euro rate rather than at, for example, the
Danish krone rate, or at a more significant currency rate, such as
sterling.</div><a name="09061655000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000409"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument. We all know that the Liberal Democrats&#146; policy is to
join the euro at the earliest possible opportunity. I wonder how he
feels about national parliamentarians who are elected by a country but
who are paid directly by the EU, rather than by their national
taxpayers. Will that have an impact on whether they view their duties
as being to their home country or to the
EU?</div><a name="09061655000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09061655000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000410"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That is not something that causes me sleepless
nights. I can see the merit in having the European Parliament
administer the pay of its Members. I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>of course expect the six MEPs who represent the south-west of England to
have foremost in their mind the concerns of the residents of the
south-west of England, but I would not expect them to have those
concerns exclusively in their minds. If they were able to advance
animal welfare standards across the EU, for example, in a way that was
advantageous to farmers in Somerset, who currently feel that they have
to adhere to superior standards of animal welfare, I would regard them
as discharging their function effectively. There are all kinds of roles
that MEPs may play, and they might feel that they can make a
contribution by advancing some of our European values in other parts of
the world to the advantage of citizens there, so I do not wish their
remit to be too narrowly confined.</div>
<a name="09061655000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000411"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I certainly agree with part of the thrust of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument: that MEPs have a responsibility to
their constituents and also to look at the wider picture, in the same
way as debating the clause in Committee is beyond our remit in relation
to our constituents in Taunton and in Hammersmith and Fulham. I wonder
what his view is on the change of who is making the payments. Does he
feel that the fact that Europe is paying UK MEPs, rather than the UK
Exchequer, will make no difference to how they view their loyalties, or
that that will make some tangible
difference?</div><a name="09061655000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000412"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> My feeling is that it would almost certainly make
no difference, but I have never served in the European Parliament and
so have difficulty putting myself in the mindset of one of its Members
and trying to decide what my primary motivation would be. I imagine
that I would be highly motivated by the desire to serve the people in
the region that elected me and consider the interests of the people in
the country I came from. I would also be motivated by a desire to see
the EU shaped in a way that conformed to my ideals and values. All
those factors would be considerations that would rest with me,
regardless of whose name was on the payslip I got at the end of each
month.</div><a name="09061655000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000413"></a>Mr.
Binley</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="09061655000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000414"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I give way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061655000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000415"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, I
say that the Chair is motivated by wishing to discuss clause 56. I
think that we had perhaps better leave the motivations of MEPs to one
side.</div>
<a name="09061655000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000416"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> With respect, Mr. Atkinson,
does not the hon. Gentleman recognise the old phrase, which I am sure
most west country people would recognise, that he who pays the piper
calls the tune? There is a symbolic aspect to this business that ought
to be taken into account. One owes one&#146;s loyalty to the person
who hands out one&#146;s pay packet. That is the point; will he
recognise
it?</div><a name="09061655000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000417"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The Conservatives are obsessed by symbolism, with
regard to the EU, and I am interested in practicalities. I apologise
for having a less romantic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>view of politics than the hon. Gentleman does. I observe that the EU is
funded through contributions made by member states, and the question
whether MEPs are paid directly by that money raised in the UK, or
through the mechanism after the money has gone to the EU, I suspect,
will not have as big a bearing on their deliberations as some members
of the Conservative party fear.</div>
<a name="09061655000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000418"></a>Mr.
Stuart</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="09061655000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000419"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> However, I am always open to more conspiracy
theories.</div><a name="09061655000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000420"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b><b class="B"> </b>Perhaps it is not surprising that the hon.
Gentleman, as a Liberal Democrat, is not too worried about where the
money comes from, but I put it to him that receiving one&#146;s pay
cheque from an organisation that never has its accounts signed off
because they are subject to so many questions would undermine the
confidence with which one served. If I were an MEP, I would wish to be
paid by the Exchequer of this
country.</div><a name="09061655000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000421"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> All I can say is that I hope that Conservative
MEPs, who will share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s anxiety, will forgo
their pay until they feel that the auditing arrangements within the EU
are administered to a more satisfactory standard. That seems to be the
logical inference.</div>
<a name="09061655000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
extremely concerned about value for money, so I am concerned by all
kinds of statements made by different parties in the House, but I do
not wish you to think that I am straying from clause 56,
Mr. Atkinson. The Conservative leadership could
certainly pay their stamp duty, for example, which would be helpful to
the Exchequer.</div>
<a name="09061655000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061655000422"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): Is it not the case already
that MEPs claim from the European Union for travelling expenses and
other things? We know that certain prominent Conservatives made ample
use of that fund.</div>
<a name="09061655000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000423"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That is my understanding. I have been shocked by
the loose attitude that some Conservative MEPs have adopted towards
value for money for the taxes that I pay in good faith hoping to see
improvements in public services. That point is directly relevant to
clause 56, Mr. Atkinson, and I am more than
willing to take interventions on it. If you are not keen to expand to
that conversation, I will move on to my concluding remarks.</div>
<a name="09061655000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can only
observe that the Conservatives are keen to talk in broad-brush
principles and are keen on symbolism, but are less keen on value for
money when it comes to Conservative MEPs. Everybody who sees the
formation and the practical workings of the European Union and its
Parliament in pragmatic and non-paranoid&#151;that may be an accurate
way to describe it&#151;terms can see merit in an administrative
system of this type. It is important that politicians who serve
constituencies in the United Kingdom pay levels of taxation
commensurate with those of other UK residents. On that basis, I, like
the Conservative party, am an enthusiast for clause
56.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div><a name="09061655000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000424"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, who
made such an excellent but unfortunately short speech. I owe the
Government Whip an apology because I was very annoyed at the last
sitting that we could not continue into the evening as he had choked
off debate on the clause. I now understand why&#151;he had obviously
anticipated a longer debate on it than I had.</div>
<a name="09061655000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham was right in putting the
Conservative Front-Bench position and saying that we would not vote
against the clause. However, my leader, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Witney, has shown great leadership in saying that Back-Bench
Conservative Members do not have to follow the Whip in Committee, so do
not be surprised if there is a Division, Mr.
Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09061655000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause gives rise to a number of interesting points but I will try to
keep entirely to the clause. It has opened up a lot of new ideas that I
was not aware of. The Government are right that double taxation should
not be allowed and, if a country is taxing a British citizen, that tax
should be allowed against British tax. Unfortunately, we are not
talking about another country; it is that thing called the European
Union, which is supposed to be a Union of nation states so, by that
definition, it cannot have tax-raising powers. Before we debated this,
I thought that that was the position. Now I understand that it may not
be the
case.</div>
<a name="09061655000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000425"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Without wishing to put too many cats among the
proverbial pigeons, does my hon. Friend agree that if the EU were a
tax-raising institution, it might spend less money, which might be a
good thing?</div>
<a name="09061655000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000426"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I quite agree. The problem we have is that the
Government are rightly trying to solve a problem for British citizens,
who should not be taxed in two places and should get relief against it.
That is what clause 56 does, and I agree with it. However, should we be
allowing that taxation in the first place when it is not another
country but this organisation that is imposing a tax on British
citizens? Should not the Government fight this tooth and nail and tell
the MEPs not to pay the tax because it is an
outrage?</div><a name="09061655000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will be able to deal with the following
technical point. The taxation that will be charged will be through
self-assessment at the end of the year. I assume that MEPs receive
their money in euros each month. How will that be converted into
sterling for taxation purposes? Will it be done on a monthly basis when
the money is remitted or at the end of the year when the tax is
decided? That could be a significantly different tax charge. As I
understand the clause, it will mean a loss of money to the Exchequer. I
stand to be corrected, but it appears that there is a European tax
charge that will go into the European Union&#146;s coffers which will
then be set against the tax that the MEPs would have paid. That
difference will be a loss to the UK Exchequer. How much will that
loss
be?</div><a name="09061655000127"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000427"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a legitimate
concern about currency fluctuations within the year and the effect on
tax liability. Does he conclude that the Conservative policy of
shadowing the deutschmark in the early 1990s would be wisely replicated
by shadowing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>the euro now so that those difficulties could be avoided? That is not my
view, but it seems to be the view of Conservative Back
Benchers.</div><a name="09061655000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000428"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Mr. Atkinson, I am sorry that
I accepted that intervention. It would be quite out of order for me to
deal with it. I promised to stick to the clause and I will do my best
to talk about this and the technical issues that come up.</div>
<a name="09061655000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
important point here that I had not understood before. In the past,
MEPs were taxed on their salary as though they were British citizens.
That made a lot of sense, and I understand it entirely because there
was no Community tax involved. We now know that there was a Community
tax, and I am not sure on whom this was charged. There is an issue.
Were these officials or employees of the European Union? If they were,
were they just being taxed as citizens of some European Union state and
not being taxed here, or was there double taxation? That is a really
important point. How much money was
involved?</div>
<a name="09061655000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000429"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I expect that the Government will answer that all
of the people affected were not resident in the UK, but I suspect that
the EIB has some kind of London representation. It would be interesting
to hear from the Minister whether those people have been affected since
1968.</div><a name="09061655000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000430"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very important point to which
I hope the Minister will
respond.</div><a name="09061655000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was just about to refer to clause 56(1)(c) which
reads:</div><a name="09061655000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Article
14, 15 or 17 (pensions for old-age, incapacity and
survivors)&#148;.</div><a name="09061655000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
I move straight on from there to the Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills, with responsibility for regulatory reform,
enterprise and science, First Secretary and Lord President of the
Council&#151;and deputy Prime Minister&#151;the noble Lord
Mandelson? He was a commissioner. What was his tax position? Was he
being taxed in this country or was he paying some sort of Community
tax? Is it something new? Has there been a loss to the Exchequer or has
the poor Lord Mandelson actually been paying tax twice? Will there be
some sort of retrospective relief for commissioners? I assume that the
commissioner is regarded as ordinarily resident in this
country.</div>
<a name="09061655000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Mandelson is a high-profile case, but there must be many other people
who were caught in this position. It is important to know whether they
were paying UK tax, both UK tax and EU tax, or only EU tax. People will
want to know that information.</div>
<a name="09061655000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 56 is
right in principle, in that it saves British citizens from paying tax
twice, but it has opened up a can of worms. Therefore, I hope that the
Minister will be able either to answer now all the questions that have
been raised or, if that is not possible, to write to the Committee with
that information.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000431"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> May I start, Mr. Atkinson,
by saying what an honour it is to serve under your chairmanship? I
think that I am serving under you for the first time and I welcome you
to the Chair.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div><a name="09061655000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
pleasure to debate with the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham. I
thank him for his kind words. Indeed, as he said, I recall that we had
a lengthy debate during the deliberations on the Finance Bill last
year. My memory is that it was about sovereign debt issuance and he
gave an extremely interesting and, I am sure, historically correct
account of various currency crises and sovereign debt issuances by
various countries, including the UK. I also seem to remember that my
contribution to that debate was principally to point out&#151;rather
continually&#151;that although that account was very interesting, it
was perhaps not entirely relevant to the specific point on the issuance
of Islamic bonds that we were discussing at that time. I feel a strange
sense of d(c)j  vu now, one year
on.</div>
<a name="09061655000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000432"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> With your forbearance, Mr.
Atkinson, I want to point out that the Minister is right that that
debate was about sukuk bond issuance, but the question was whether or
not it was advisable for a sovereign issuer to be issuing structured
notes, regardless of the structure. The debate was not actually about
Islamic finance; it was about whether or not sovereign issuers should
be going down that road.</div>
<a name="09061655000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say
that now might be the opportunity for the Minister to apologise for
misquoting me later that week to an audience in the City of London in a
talk about Islamic finance, by claiming that Conservatives were opposed
to Islamic finance, which is certainly not the case. So the debate
today gives her an opportunity to apologise for misquoting me, which
happened in the same week as the debate that she referred
to.</div>
<a name="09061655000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000433"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I think that honours are even in this
respect.</div>
<a name="09061655000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000434"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Thank you for your clarification,
Mr. Atkinson. All I will say is that my sense of
d(c)j  vu has now increased.</div>
<a name="09061655000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
enjoyed the debate today hugely; I always enjoy it when the
Conservative party splits very openly in front of our eyes. I have also
enjoyed the revelation by the hon. Member for Taunton, when he said
that it was difficult to put himself in the mindset of someone who
served in the European Parliament. I do not know whether we should draw
anything from that comment about his relationship with his
leader.</div><a name="09061655000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000435"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I gently give the Minister a word of advice?
It is possible that there is a difference of opinion within a party,
but when it happens people should try to disagree without
rancour.</div><a name="09061655000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000436"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Opposition Members are obviously the best of
friends. Moving on swiftly, I am of course grateful for the support of
at least the Front-Bench spokespersons of both the main Opposition
parties.</div>
<a name="09061655000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As today is
the first time that I have served under your chairmanship,
Mr. Atkinson, in an attempt to ingratiate myself
with you I will attempt to keep my remarks specifically related to the
clause. I remind the Committee that the clause simply does two things.
Since the European Community is not a territory, as defined 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>in double taxation law, we therefore need another piece of primary
legislation to ensure that MEPs will not be subject to double taxation
under the new regime. So, we are simply aligning the situation of MEPs
with the existing provisions under double taxation law.</div>
<a name="09061655000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing that the clause does is to ensure that the new transitional
allowance, as it is called, which is now available to MEPs under the
new system, has a basis in law, by linking it to the legal concept of a
termination payment.</div>
<a name="09061655000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000437"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Is that a unique situation, or are there other
organisations that are not territories that deduct
taxation?</div>
<a name="09061655000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000438"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I think that it is unique. If my view on that
changes, I will let the hon. Gentleman
know.</div><a name="09061655000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000439"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Can the Minister explain to us, therefore, why the
situation is unique? My understanding is that the United Nations or the
World Bank will pay their staff whether or not the Minister believes
that they level a tax. If that is not the case, why not? Why is it only
the EU that decides that it wants to have those tax-raising
powers?</div><a name="09061655000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000440"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Perhaps I can add that to the list of eight
questions that the hon. Gentleman has put and that I shall attempt to
answer.</div>
<a name="09061655000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to
the specific points, I am delighted by the summary of the eight
questions, although perhaps we could have cut to the chase and gone
straight to them. I am slightly concerned because I think that I have
more than eight answers, but I will do the best I can.</div>
<a name="09061655000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
first questions that the hon. Gentleman seemed to ask was whether this
was a secret plan and why we were talking about this after the European
elections of a fortnight ago. I am delighted exclusively to reveal that
our policy was communicated to MEPs in a letter from the Minister for
Europe in July last year. We also wrote to MEPs of all parties in March
this year. So there was no intent to reveal it only
now.</div>
<a name="09061655000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000441"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09061655000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000442"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I will, but I will not always give way if the hon.
Gentleman seeks to intervene at this rate in
future.</div><a name="09061655000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000443"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way and apologise
if I am intervening too often. Can she tell us when she told the House
of the Government&#146;s intention to do
that?</div><a name="09061655000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000444"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Well, it is in the Finance Bill, so it will have
been in the First Reading of the Finance Bill.</div>
<a name="09061655000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on, I
am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has been looking at the EIB
website with such diligence. I will write to him on the precise point
about coefficients. The substantive point seems to be that, as a result
of the double taxation, MEPs will now be subject to an effective tax
rate of 27.95 per cent. If we did not introduce the clause in the
Finance Bill, their effective tax rate would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>be 21.84 per cent. So they will be paying more tax at the same effective
tax rates as their constituents as a result of the clause, which I
think all Members of the Committee would agree
with.</div><a name="09061655000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EC tax that is applied to MEP&#146;s pay is the same tax that EU
officials have paid since
1968.</div><a name="09061655000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000445"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I must have misunderstood that point. She is saying
that MEPs are paying extra tax. Are they getting a refund? She seemed
to imply that. What I thought the Minister was saying was that the
Community tax was higher than the basic income tax in this country. If
that was the case, there would be a refund. Am I wrong in
that?</div><a name="09061655000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000446"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I hope to be able to come back to the net position
of the UK Exchequer as a result of all the changes. What I think his
question was getting at was that marginal rates, and the way in which
they are tiered, are actually higher in the UK than the EC rates.
Therefore, as a result of the double taxation treaty, they will pay
more tax in total, although there is a sort of credit put in as part of
that
process.</div><a name="09061655000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
will the tax work if an official is employed by the EU, but, for
example, works in London? We have heard members of the Committee
mention, perhaps, the EIB staff in London and, of course, the European
Commission has staff in London. EU officials working in this country
will generally be liable for UK tax. Those working in Brussels will
generally be liable for Community tax, but obviously each individual
situation will be looked at
individually.</div><a name="09061655000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
there any cases in which someone working for the EU has been taxed
twice? We are not aware of any such cases. The clause is required only
because a specific statute has been introduced which provides for MEPs
to be paid by the EU instead of by national Governments. That was not
previously the case, so MEPs were not previously subject to Community
tax.</div>
<a name="09061655000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
specific question about Community taxes being levied on transitional
allowances. Those MPs who have recently stood down are entitled to
resettlement grants under existing pay arrangements. Resettlement
grants are subject only to UK tax; they are not  subject to
Community tax. There were a lot of questions  about people who
were not, perhaps, UK residents and what their situation was with
respect to other member states. Not being a Minister for another member
state Government, or indeed a tax administrator for the European
Community, I am not able to provide specific answers. However, I will
write to the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham to answer the
question whether MEPs need to pay tax to the Belgian or French
authorities if they are resident there.</div>
<a name="09061655000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000447"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Can I take the Minister back to the point that was
mentioned a moment ago? Although the MEP whom I mentioned might be an
exception at the moment&#151;going to be a UK resident but a
non-dom&#151;there will possibly be more cases in future. I mentioned
that 9 per cent. of my constituency were EU nationals. It is not
impossible&#151;I think that the fourth Conservative candidate on the
London list is probably an EU national. Will the Minister clarify the
position of UK-resident MEPs who are
non-doms?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div><a name="09061655000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000448"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am coming to that point. An MEP who after the
elections of a fortnight ago ceases to become an MEP will be eligible
for the transitional allowance under the new regime that the European
Parliament has now
agreed.</div><a name="09061655000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to the specific points about residents and non-residents, and
domiciled and non-domiciled status. In summary, the rules regarding
resident and domiciled status for MEPs are no different from those for
any other category of person. We know of only one UK MEP who has ever
claimed non-residence in the UK. That might be useful background
information. It follows that an MEP representing a UK constituency
would not then be fully liable for UK tax because they are non-tax
resident. It is unlikely that the situation would arise because most UK
MEPs obviously have ties, duties and work to undertake, which means
that they will be
here.</div><a name="09061655000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000449"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> What checks would the Treasury undertake to ensure
that an individual was not trying to suggest they were not domiciled
anywhere&#151;in other words, that there was some domicile that they
were admitting to and therefore had tax liability in some
territory?</div><a name="09061655000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000450"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We take great pains to ensure that the tax law is
not abused and that there is no fraudulent activity, avoidance or
evasion. MEPs would be no different from any other category of person
in that
regard.</div><a name="09061655000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
non-resident, non-domiciled MEP would not be fully liable to UK tax.
However, if they were non-resident &#151;as I said, there has
been only one case so far&#151;like all other non-residents they
would be liable to UK tax on the portion on their employment duties
carried out here. Broadly speaking, days spent working in the UK would
be liable to UK tax, as is normally the situation for other people, but
employment duties carried out abroad would not be liable to
tax.</div>
<a name="09061655000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">A resident
but non-domiciled MEP using the remittance basis would also be liable
to UK tax on those employment duties carried out in the UK and, in some
circumstances, as is normal, also liable to UK tax on their duties
carried out abroad. I do not want to imply that this is something we
are routinely looking into because, as far as we are aware, there has
been only one
case.</div><a name="09061655000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise to the Committee, as I need to clarify what I said previously
about whether this is a unique situation. There are some similar
circumstances, as hon. Members rightly said, relating to the UN and
NATO. I will write to the Committee to explain the
parallels.</div><a name="09061655000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wellingborough asked about exchange rates used for the
purposes of self-assessment. If an MEP is paid in euros, the conversion
to sterling is at the time of payment, which is normal for any person
paid in a different currency. I do not want to confuse the Committee
further, and I am mindful of the fact that we have spent a lot of time
on this, but I mention for the record that MEPs have the option of
being paid in sterling. I do not know whether Conservative MEPs will be
taking up this option.</div>
<a name="09061655000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
theme running through some Back-Bench Conservative
Members&#146; remarks was whether the EU should have tax-raising
powers and whether this was the thin end of the wedge. I wish to
reassure the Committee that this is an extremely limited tax, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>applies exclusively to EU officials and MEPs. It does not imply any
wider EU tax-raising powers, and indeed has no basis in law to do
so.</div><a name="09061655000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000451"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I do not know whether that was a slip of the tongue
in the Minister&#146;s last sentence or so. She linked EU officials
and MEPs, as though the clause applied to both. I thought that it
applied only to MEPs. There are a couple of issues. How have the tax
affairs of officials who are resident in the UK been treated? Have they
been paying Community tax and British tax, or just Community tax? What
was the loss of revenue to the UK Exchequer due to the double taxation
relief mentioned in the
clause?</div><a name="09061655000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000452"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The clause applies only to MEPs. The tax applies
to EU officials and MEPs. As I have tried to explain&#151;I apologise
if I was not clear&#151;if there are such categories of people who
are working in the UK, they will normally pay UK tax. However, I
obviously cannot comment on every individual
case.</div><a name="09061655000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000453"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The question remains as to which part of the EU
does the tax-raising and where that money goes. I understand that
payments will be made by the European Parliament. Presumably the
European Parliament is not a taxing authority, so where do the moneys
go?</div><a name="09061655000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000454"></a>Kitty

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000455"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I beg to move amendment 206, in
clause 57, page 27, line 27, leave
out subsection
(2).</div><a name="09061655000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000456"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It might be convenient for the Committee to
treat this as one debate on a technical matter, rather than to debate
the amendment and then clause stand
part.</div><a name="09061655000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000457"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I, too, welcome you back for this morning&#146;s
deliberations Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="09061655000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
the giddy heights of political drama in our debate on clause 56, we
reach a substantial set of clauses that aimed mainly at scams of
various kinds 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>designed to facilitate tax avoidance. I think that we will find some
drama in these clauses as well, although not so much in clause
57.</div><a name="09061655000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause changes how the amount of double taxation relief available to UK
companies is calculated. Subject to certain criteria, UK companies in
receipt of dividends paid from abroad are entitled to relief for tax
charged on the original profits out of which the dividends have been
paid; that is relieved against the UK corporation tax due on receipt of
those profits. The recent reduction in the corporation tax rate caused
a mismatch in how the relief is calculated. The clause corrects that by
ensuring that the amount of relief available to UK companies is
calculated by reference to the actual rate of corporation tax suffered
on their UK
profits.</div><a name="09061655000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
HMRC review of the clause found that subsection (2), which
restricts the change to corporation tax cases, simply restates a
restriction already contained in the Finance Act 2000, which first
introduced the relevant legislation. The amendment removes the
unnecessary duplication, which would otherwise have created some
uncertainty and could have given rise to tax avoidance opportunities. I
hope that the Committee is satisfied with the
amendment.</div><a name="09061655000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem addressed by the clause was recognised last year, on Third
Reading of the 2008 Finance Bill. My predecessor as Financial Secretary
committed to rectifying the problem, after consulting with interested
parties. HMRC has discussed the draft clause with business
representatives, and the simple solution provided by the clause ensures
that credit is given in line with my predecessor&#146;s
commitment.</div><a name="09061655000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is retrospective and applies from 1 April 2008. The
retrospective action is such that it can only apply to the benefit of
companies by increasing the amount of foreign tax credit available. The
clause is likely to have limited application after 1 July this year,
because of the introduction of legislation that exempts from UK tax
almost all foreign dividends, which we have already
debated.</div>
<a name="09061655000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000458"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> We agree with the Government&#146;s amendment. I
will talk mainly about the general issues that arise from the
clause.</div>
<a name="09061655000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
a result of the changes enacted in the Finance Act 2008 that changed
the corporation tax rate in the middle of a company&#146;s accounting
year, and the unforeseen consequences of that. As the Financial
Secretary has said, the clause deals with foreign source dividends,
which are subject to corporation tax at the effective rate applicable
for the accounting period in which they were received. Companies with
accounting periods straddling 1 April 2008 have an effective
corporation tax rate between 30 and 28 per cent.&#151;29.5 per cent.,
for example&#151;depending on how much of the tax year is in the
relevant accounting year. However, the double tax relief mixer cap
formula, which limits the amount of credit relief available for foreign
dividends, operates by reference to the statutory rate of corporation
tax in force on the payment date&#151;either 30 or 28 per cent. in
that particular tax year, but not a combination of the two. That
potentially results in an unintended restriction on the amount of
double tax relief that might be available.</div>
<a name="09061655000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC first
acknowledged that mismatch in September 2007 and confirmed in July 2008
that the rules would be amended with retrospective effect from 1 April
2008, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>introduced in the Bill. The impact of the discrepancy is to be
eliminated by calculating the mixer cap by reference to the blended
effective rate for the period. My understanding is that the formula
used would be: (actual number of days in period 1 divided by 365,
multiplied by the corporation tax rate effective in period 1) plus
(actual number of days in period two divided by 365
multiplied by the corporate tax rate effective in period
2).</div><a name="09061655000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Foreign
dividends are chargeable to UK corporation tax and in calculating the
relevant income one has to show the dividend gross of all taxes
suffered. Dividends received may have also suffered withholding tax.
Withholding tax is always recoverable, subject to the limits for credit
relief. However, in addition, as dividends are paid out of post-tax
profits, the dividend will also have suffered what is called underlying
tax. A credit for underlying tax can be claimed only when a company
holds, directly or indirectly, 10 per cent. of the voting power of the
company paying the dividend, or is a subsidiary of such a
company.</div>
<a name="09061655000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying tax, which is referred to as U in the legislation, is
initially calculated by using the following formula: (dividend paid
divided by relevant profits) multiplied by actual tax paid. The
relevant profits are the profits of any period shown as available for
distribution in the company accounts; they are not taxable profits. The
underlying tax available for relief is found by using the formula: (D +
U) x M, where D is the dividend&#151;the amount received plus
withholding tax; U is the underlying tax; and M is the relevant rate of
UK corporation tax at that time, which is 28 per cent. The (D + U) x 28
per cent. formula is referred to as the mixer
cap.</div><a name="09061655000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause has been welcomed by tax commentators, but I have one immediate
question and one that is more fundamental. First, it is not entirely
clear to me why subsection (5) is to take effect immediately, while all
the other subsections are backdated to 1 April 2008. I thought the
whole provision was supposed to be backdated to 1 April 2008. Perhaps I
am just misreading the
clause.</div><a name="09061655000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another important and technical question. The clause and everything
that the Minister and I have mentioned so far refers to dividends, by
which I assume that we mean dividends on all financial instruments, not
just equities. If it were to refer to coupons or the interest rate
payable on bonds or other fixed income instruments, an important
consideration may arise on the precise day count used in those fixed
rate instruments. For example, in this country the day count convention
used is actual over 365 fixed, whereas in Japan it is actual over 365,
and most eurobonds are denominated on a 30 over 360 basis.</div>
<a name="09061655000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
calculating the relevant corporation tax using the blended rate, what
consideration will need to be given to the accounting method of the
coupon&#151;or, in this case, what the clause calls a dividend but is
effectively a fixed income coupon&#151;and the different day count
conventions that may be involved in those coupons? What effect might
that have on the blended mixer cap rate? As I said, we broadly welcome
the clause and I await the Minister&#146;s response to those two
questions.</div><a name="09061655000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000459"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I rise to agree with the Minister that we have come
to an important and surprisingly interesting set of clauses. A bit like
the dull books of the Bible, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>such as Leviticus, which contain all the things that Hebrews got up to,
some of the clauses reveal the dodges and scams that companies get up
to.</div>
<a name="09061655000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek
clarification on a simple point. I understand that the clause is about
the interaction of something called the mixer cap&#151;a terms I had
only associated with bathroom showers&#151;and corporation tax.
Essentially it deals with the unintended consequences of lowering
corporation tax in 2008. The clause is meant to have retrospective
effect. The explanatory notes make it clear that a concerted effort has
been made to limit any potential disadvantages, and I thought I heard
the Minister say that the effect of the clause was wholly to the
benefit of companies&#151;that nobody is disadvantaged by the
original change in corporation tax. Can the right hon. Gentleman
confirm that? If he cannot, can he tell us who was disadvantaged and
who is still
disadvantaged?</div><a name="09061655000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000460"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I welcome the support that has been expressed for
the clause and the fact that it has commended itself to the Committee.
The change to the rate of corporation tax took effect from 1 April
2008, so it is right that the change takes effect from that date as
well. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham asked me why
subsection (5) is not retrospective. In very rare situations subsection
(5) can have a negative impact on business and that is why we are not
applying it retrospectively. Nevertheless, I can confirm for the hon.
Member for Southport my previous comments about the overall benefit for
business from the change that we are
making.</div><a name="09061655000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circumstances where there could be an increased burden for companies
are rare. There could be an increased burden for some companies, but
only where dividends paid between foreign companies were paid before
the change in the corporation tax rate. The subsequent case 5 dividend
is paid after 5 April 2009 and is not exempt. Given the introduction of
the dividend exemption with effect from 1 July 2009, that would occur
only in very rare situations. Indeed, that aspect of the legislation is
not retrospective so as to ensure that there is not an unfair negative
retrospective impact on business.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000461"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point that the
provision is entirely for the benefit of business and will in no way
disadvantage business. My question is simply this: as a result of the
decision to alter corporation tax in 2008 and the difficulty that has
occurred with the mixer cap, is it now the case that no one has lost
out at
all?</div><a name="09061655000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000462"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Yes, it is. There will, no doubt, need to be some
adjustments in the light of the clause, but I can give the hon.
Gentleman that
reassurance.</div><a name="09061655000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham asked about some detailed
aspects of the profit calculations. There are two steps involved:
calculation of profit and taxation of profit. The blended rate applies
to all profits, however calculated, and there is no need to consider
the precise details of the calculation when considering the relevant
tax rate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div><a name="09061655000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000463"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> To press the Financial Secretary a little on that
point, can he be absolutely clear that the clause also relates to bond
coupons and payments on fixed income instruments? It is surely the case
that, if the accounting basis of the bond and the day count convention
is different, calculating the mixed rate, where one looks at the actual
number of days over 365, times each of the relevant corporation tax
rates, will in turn depend on whether the coupon rate, for example, has
changed during that time. If there is a step-up bond, and if the coupon
rate has changed during that time, surely the corporation tax
calculation would have to be aligned in accordance with the way in
which the bond is
paid.</div><a name="09061655000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000464"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The clause is about correcting an unintended hit to
double taxation relief and it is effective, whichever way the profit is
achieved. The clause is not specific to one particular form of
profit.</div>

<a name="09061655000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000465"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Clauses 58 to 64 relate to anti-avoidance and we
broadly support them. Since the Finance Act 2008, various attempts have
been made to eliminate so-called MODs, which are manufactured overseas
dividends, not the 1960s bikers seen in films such as
&#147;Quadrophenia&#148;. Clause 58 and schedule 29 refer to
repurchase agreements, or repos. The essence of the clause is that tax
credit is being given for deemed payments on repos, rather than for
actual payments, and the clause seeks to ensure that tax credit is only
given for actual
payments.</div><a name="09061655000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
might be the only member of the Committee who has ever carried out a
repo, or repurchase transaction, so, seeing as that is the subject of
schedule 29, it may be helpful if I explain what it is. An explanation
will not necessarily help, however, because even though I might have an
advantage in understanding the sorts of financial instrument behind
clause 58 and schedule 29, that knowledge does not give much assistance
in understanding the technical nature of the clause and
schedule.</div><a name="09061655000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
repo allows a borrower to use a financial security&#151;an equity, a
bond or pretty much any financial instrument&#151;as collateral for a
cash loan at a fixed rate of interest. In a repo, the borrower agrees
to sell immediately a security to a lender and also agrees to buy back
the same security from the lender at a fixed rate at some later date. A
repo is therefore equivalent to a cash transaction combined with a
forward contract; it is a little bit like a foreign exchange, or forex,
swap, where the price of the trade-back is a function of the relevant
interest rate for that period. The cash transaction results in a
transfer of money to the borrower in exchange for legal transfer of the
security to the lender, while the forward contract ensures repayment of
the loan to the lender and return of the collateral of the borrower.
The difference between  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>the forward price and the spot price is the interest on the loan, while
the settlement date of the forward contract is the maturity date of the
loan.</div>
<a name="09061655000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">A repo is
therefore economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer
receiving securities, or a security, as collateral to protect against
default. There is little that prevents any security from being employed
in a repo: for example, probably one of the most frequently
repo&#146;d instruments would be a gilt, or a US treasury bond.
Corporate bonds can be repo&#146;d, as well as stocks and shares. The
relevance to clause 58 is this: coupons or dividends, which are paid
while the repo buyer owns the securities, are, in fact, usually passed
directly onto the repo seller. It might seem counter-intuitive that the
ownership of the collateral technically rests with the buyer during the
repo agreement; however, that is where&#151;I am guessing from the
clause&#151;that the problems arise in relation to the avoidance of
tax, or more specifically, the creation of a manufactured overseas
dividend.</div>
<a name="09061655000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, HMRC has become aware of complicated schemes involving
intra-group sale and repurchase agreements undertaken by bank
groups&#151;that is, within two parts of the same banking
family&#151;which are intended to produce a perceived tax advantage.
As a result of the structure of the transaction and the prescriptive
nature of the UK rules relating to manufactured overseas dividends, one
party to the transaction is deemed for UK tax purposes to receive a
MOD. In addition, that deemed MOD is treated as having been subject to
deduction of foreign withholding tax and the recipient of the MOD is
entitled to relief for that foreign tax. However, since the receipt is
deemed an MOD rather than an actual payment, there is no actual
deduction of foreign tax from any amount actually received by the
recipient. Therefore, as I understand it, HMRC&#146;s view&#151;I
would be grateful if the Minister confirmed this explanation&#151;is
that the recipient does not actually bear the economic cost of the
foreign tax, despite the fact that it is entitled to relief for that
tax.</div>
<a name="09061655000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
technical explanation I have been given, but it seems to me that
certain foreign securities have been repo&#146;d solely or mainly for
the purpose of creating a credit or a debit against foreign tax paid or
received, typically within the same banking group. The purpose of the
clause, as I understand it, is to prevent that
practice.</div><a name="09061655000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also puzzled by the fact that the clause, according to the
explanatory notes, relates to repos that would normally relate in terms
to fixed income instruments, or bonds. My understanding is that most of
the MODs are actually created from equities, so I would be grateful for
more explanation of what sort of underlying repo transaction we are
considering that has been used in the pursuit of avoiding UK
tax.</div><a name="09061655000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would also seem sensible, if we are looking at repo agreements, to
examine their stablemate, the buy-sell agreement, or the buy-sellback
agreement. Those differ slightly from repos in that, with the
sell-buyback agreement, any coupon payment on the underlying security
during the life of the sell-buyback agreement will generally be passed
back to the seller of the security by adjusting the cash paid at the
termination of the sell-buyback agreement. In a repo, the coupon will
be passed on immediately to the seller of the security. My guess,
therefore&#151;and I would be grateful in the Minister could confirm
it&#151;is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>that it is not possible to manufacture an overseas dividend, or an MOD,
using a sell-buyback transaction. It would be important to have that
confirmed by the Minister; otherwise we might have to reconsider all of
this again if people stop using repos and start to use sell-buyback
agreements instead.</div>
<a name="09061655000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
counters that type of transaction by preventing relief for foreign tax,
either by credit or deduction, when the recipient of a manufactured
overseas dividend does not bear the economic cost of the foreign tax.
In other words, relief for overseas tax in excess of the amount borne
cannot be claimed. The legislation, as I read it, takes effect for
dividends paid on or after 22 April 2009. We will have no
problem supporting the clause if the Minister is able to confirm that
my understanding of the situation is correct, that the clause covers
equities as well as fixed income, and that sell-buybacks and
buy-sellbacks are accounted for on the same basis and we do not need to
be troubled by whether they might be used for the manufacture of
overseas dividends in the
future.</div><a name="09061655000220"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000466"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that useful lesson. I
shall now test my understanding of this fairly complex schedule and
clause.</div><a name="09061655000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, it is intended that manufactured overseas dividends
will qualify for exemptions from double taxation, as real dividends do.
Manufactured overseas dividends are characteristics, as the hon.
Gentleman has said, of repo deals. I believe that the scam to be
targeted involves one might call an illusory repo deal between two
companies in the same group&#151;phantom dividends, an allowance for
foreign tax liability but no actual foreign tax liability. If I am
correct that that is what the Minister wishes to target, my only
question is: how prevalent is the scam and what are the savings to the
Exchequer in closing that
loophole?</div><a name="09061655000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000467"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to both the Opposition spokesmen for
their
support.</div><a name="09061655000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause and schedule 29 counter a complex tax avoidance scheme whereby
the recipient of a manufactured overseas dividend claims relief for
overseas tax that he has not paid, as the hon. Member for Southport
described. The description of what is going on given by the hon. Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham is broadly correct. The manufactured
payments arise under repo or stock-lending transactions. They are
payments that are representative of interest or dividends paid on
securities such as gilts or shares, and are intended to compensate the
transferor of the securities for not receiving the real interest or
dividends.</div>
<a name="09061655000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nearly all
manufactured payments are made by companies under routine transactions
involving banks, securities houses and insurance companies. Earlier
this year, we became aware of a complex tax-driven scheme involving the
sale and repurchase of a foreign shareholding between two group
companies. Part of the repo agreement involves what is, in substance,
an obligation to pay a manufactured overseas dividend, which does not
bear any overseas tax and is equal in amount to the gross overseas
dividend. Despite that, the recipient claims relief as if overseas tax
had been deducted. That is the heart of the scam.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div><a name="09061655000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Southport asked about the potential losses from the scheme.
Our assessment is that more than &#163;150 million per year would be
at risk if the measure was not put in place. Tax avoidance is unfair to
the majority of taxpayers. It can undermine the funding of public
services, and we are determined to take appropriate and prompt action
to counter it. The set of clauses before us contain a number of
instances of such action being
taken.</div><a name="09061655000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham asked about the extent to which
the measure is applicable in slightly wider circumstances. Other
non-avoidance legislation deals with transactions other than repos, but
repos cover sale and buyback transactions, and the legislation will
apply to those. Only dividend repo transactions are affected by the
avoidance legislation in the clause and schedule, because only
dividends can give rise to double taxation relief. I therefore commend
the clause and the schedule to the
Committee.</div><a name="09061655000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15pm</div><a name="09061655000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09061655000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000468"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The clause contains a provision to counter an
avoidance scheme that abuses the double taxation relief rules. The
provision will not bring in substantive additional corporation tax, but
it is estimated that it will prevent losses to the Exchequer that would
be up to &#163;100 million a year if the abuse continued unchecked.
The double taxation relief rules are designed to give relief in the UK
for foreign tax paid on the same income or profits charged to UK tax.
If any of that foreign tax is reduced, UK tax should be reduced by the
same
amount.</div><a name="09061655000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
has become aware that in some circumstances it is possible for a UK
parent company to obtain a payment by reference to the foreign tax paid
by a subsidiary company. The payment is made when the subsidiary pays a
dividend, so the parent company receives the profits with little or no
foreign tax suffered. That has been exploited by groups in an avoidance
scheme that seeks to obtain relief for foreign tax where the group has
not borne the economic cost of that
tax.</div><a name="09061655000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a long-standing principle that if foreign tax is repaid, credit for
foreign tax should be reduced by the amount of the repayment. The
clause ensures that the same reduction in credit occurs if the payment,
by reference to the foreign tax, is made not only to the company that
originally paid the tax, but to a different person connected with that
company. Typically, that will be the parent company. However, it has
been brought to our attention following the publication of the Bill
that the clause may affect the operation of commercial cross-border
loan arrangements arising from the London loan market.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div><a name="09061655000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
amendments would have provided that the clause applied only to payments
made under the laws of a territory outside the UK. Opposition amendment
217 addresses the same point differently and perfectly appropriately,
although not, technically, in the correct way. The Government
amendments reflected agreement that HMRC reached with industry legal
advisers and had the advantage of following existing legal precedent
that applies for the purposes of controlled foreign company
legislation. The Government amendments would have covered the
overwhelming majority of cases where refund of foreign tax might arise
from commercial contracts. However, since formulating the Government
amendments, we have received further representations&#151;I am
grateful to the Chartered Institute of Taxation for those&#151;which
show that there may remain situations where the amendments do not go
far enough to ensure that the clause does not hit any unintended
targets. Although these are unusual circumstances, it is right that we
should take account of
them.</div><a name="09061655000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition amendment would restrict the operation of the clause across
a wider range of circumstances than the Government amendments because
it limits the clause to those cases where the repayment is made by the
foreign tax authority only. By contrast, the Government amendments
would have left the clause in operation whenever the repayment arose
out of the application of foreign law. In view of the further
representations that we have received, I accept that the Government
amendments would not have gone far enough in restricting the scope of
the clause. Therefore, I have not moved the Government amendments. I
will reconsider the position and return to the matter with further
Government amendments on Report.</div>
<a name="09061655000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition amendment is broader in scope but has some technical
difficulties. The reference to a taxing authority would be novel in tax
law and its effect is not altogether clear. Although I am grateful to
hon. Members for tabling it, there needs to be further reflection in
order to get this right on
Report.</div><a name="09061655000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000469"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I reiterate that we broadly support
clause 59. As the Minister said, it targets a specific
avoidance scheme. In essence, as I understand it, this relates to where
the UK gives credit for tax paid elsewhere but where separate relief
has already been granted to a connected party. The Minister used the
term &#147;group&#148; and I would be interested to hear from him
what sort of groups he means. Would they typically be financial
institutions, as with the last clause, or would another type of
corporate structure be involved in this sort of scheme?</div>
<a name="09061655000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, a
UK company which has claimed double tax relief in respect of foreign
tax paid must notify HMRC and amend its claim if there is a subsequent
change in the amount of foreign tax, for example, as a result of a
repayment. However, if the tax is repaid to a person other than the
claimant, it is arguable that there is no obligation to amend the
double tax relief claim. This can arise, for example, because in some
foreign territories when a resident company pays a dividend, a refund
of tax paid by that company is made to the recipient of the dividend
rather than to the company. Clause 59 ensures that a double tax relief
claim will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>have to be withdrawn or amended where there is a repayment of a foreign
tax to a person other than the company that made the claim&#151;that
is, to a connected party, as the Minister described another party
within that same group. Relief will then be given only for the net
amount of foreign tax paid, less the payment to the connected person.
As we know, the clause is effective for payments made on or after
Budget day, 22 April 2009. We very much agree with that
point.</div>
<a name="09061655000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am going to explain our amendment and consider where we would go from
here in relation to the three amendments. In our view&#151;and I
think the Minister is saying the same thing&#151;the clause does not
specify that the payment must come from a taxation
authority. There are situations between private companies where one
company may pay another in respect of foreign tax. For example, on the
simple sale of a company, the selling company will normally indemnify
the purchaser against any outstanding tax liabilities, which would
include foreign tax. Under the current drafting of subsection
(2) &#151;the proposed new section 804G of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988&#151;the person making the payment is not
specified. Therefore, in our view it has great potential to catch
unintended matters that are entirely commercial and at which the
legislation is not aimed.</div>
<a name="09061655000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that our amendment does not deal with these matters in technically
the same way. I am slightly at a loss. I think he is
probably right and I am going to take his word for it in this
circumstance. I am slightly disturbed that we are now going to have to
come back to this on Report. We have had two Government amendments, two
attempts to get this right, since the Finance Bill was published. I
must minute our disappointment that we are going to have to bring back
this measure on Report, even after today&#146;s reasonably full
debate. However, we will not oppose either the clause or the
Government&#146;s intention to return to
it.</div><a name="09061655000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000470"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I beg to move amendment 218, in clause 60,
page 29, line 34, after
&#145;costs&#146;, insert &#145;,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) the taxpayer has entered
into a scheme or arrangement a main purpose of which is to secure that
the included funding costs are less than the national funding
costs&#146;.&#146;.</div><a name="09061655000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000471"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 209 to
212.</div><a name="09061655000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000472"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause deals with anti-fragmentation, a term I
had not heard of until I started working on the Bill. However, I have
been trying to get my head around the term and I will give it the best
that I can.</div>
<a name="09061655000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
another anti-avoidance measure that has our support. In essence, it is
about banks, and in particular how they might find ways to book income
and expenses in different accounting units to avoid tax. Following the
decision in a 2005 court case, Legal and General Assurance Ltd
<i class="I">v.</i><i class="I"> </i>Thomas, in front of the special commissioners, the
Finance Act 2005 introduced legislation restricting the availability of
double taxation relief for foreign taxes paid on schedule D case 1
income, which now of course are treated just as &#147;trading 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>income&#148; under the Corporation Tax Act 2009, or income computed on
a similar basis for UK tax purposes. The rules aim to ensure that the
double taxation relief claimed cannot exceed the equivalent corporation
tax on the net profits attributable to that source of income, after
deducting an appropriate allocation of expenses, and are often referred
to as a &#147;mini-D1 computation&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061655000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC believes
that certain banks have sought to avoid the impact of this legislation,
either by routing loans through subsidiaries, which are taxed
differently, or by financing in such a way that funding costs are not
directly attributable to the income and therefore are not deducted in
calculating the double taxation relief restriction. Although HMRC
considers that the existing legislation should already have the desired
effect, clause 60 is intended to put the matter beyond
doubt.</div><a name="09061655000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current rules provide that, where income that would otherwise have
formed part of the trade receipts of a bank but instead is received by
an affiliate that is differently taxed and can claim double tax relief
without the restrictions affecting the bank, the income is treated as
trade income of the subsidiary. With effect from Budget day, the new
measures will extend the existing wording, with the intention that its
scope mirrors HMRC&#146;s interpretation of the current rules.
Furthermore, when allocating bank funding costs in calculating the
relief due, this must now be done on the basis of a proportion of
average funding costs, even when specific funds are used to finance an
investment.</div>
<a name="09061655000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that, if one has a pool of investments and a pool of
different vehicles funding those investments, one would have to
allocate things on a proportion of the average funding cost for the
whole portfolio rather than specific funds underlying a specific asset
and how that asset in particular has been funded. That is my
understanding of the situation; I would be grateful if the Minister
could confirm whether that is correct. These changes have effect from
22 April
2009.</div><a name="09061655000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
218 was suggested to me by the Law Society, which believes that both
sets of amendments, as they are aimed at artificial manipulation of
double tax relief, should be subject to a tax avoidance motive test.
The basic rules, as they stand, already contain provisions relating to
the allocation of expenses and these rules should apply over and above
those rules only in exceptional cases where there has been deliberate
manipulation for tax
reasons.</div><a name="09061655000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is what our amendment seeks to do. My understanding is that the
language used is entirely normal for these tax avoidance motive tests
and I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s view on whether he
will accept the amendment and on the importance of attaching motive to
tax avoidance in this case.</div>
<a name="09061655000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000473"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I rise to test my understanding of the term
&#147;anti-fragmentation&#148; in the clause. It seems to me that
the term restricts the banks in two ways. First, it restricts them in
how they proportion the cost of overseas transactions under the Finance
Act 2005. Secondly, it curtails their ability to dodge that regime by
arranging income to be received by a non-banking company under their
control. The explanatory notes say that clause
60</div><a name="09061655000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
clarify the existing legislation that prevents banks avoiding the
intention of the DTR legislation by artificially arranging for income
to be received by a non-banking company&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div><a name="09061655000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">That rather
creates the perception of the banks as a slightly slippery customer, if
one considers what might be behind it. It certainly makes the case for
HMRC vigilance and Treasury intelligence. It also endorses the strong
public suspicion over banking behaviour in general. Can I tempt the
Minister to indicate which bank&#146;s behaviour is being targeted
and how many banks are in receipt of taxpayer
funds?</div><a name="09061655000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000474"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Again, I welcome the support of both Opposition
spokesmen for the clause. It contains further clarification of the
double taxation relief rules to prevent the abuse of those rules by
banks through tax avoidance schemes. This is the last of the four
clauses that deal with double taxation relief. The double taxation
relief rules are designed to give relief in the UK for foreign tax paid
on foreign profits and to ensure that UK tax paid on profits earned in
the UK is not reduced by foreign tax. Some companies, banks in
particular, devised sophisticated schemes to abuse those rules by using
foreign tax to reduce the UK tax payable on
profits.</div><a name="09061655000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Southport has drawn attention to the general public
view of behaviour of that kind. There has been some press coverage of
it in recent months, which the banks are sensitive to. I am not able to
name names in this debate, as he knows, but the Chancellor has
announced that we will publish for consultation a code of conduct for
banks in this area in the hope of changing some of the practices that
have grown up over the
years.</div><a name="09061655000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000475"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000476"></a>Mr.

intention is that all banks will sign up to it. It will be a voluntary
code, but I am pleased to say that broad support has been indicated
across all
banks.</div><a name="09061655000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
banks have attempted to avoid the intention of the double taxation
relief legislation by separating foreign receipts from the expenses of
earning them to maximise their double taxation relief claims, hence the
fragmentation. One method has been to divert what is in substance trade
income into investment subsidiaries that are not subject to the same
requirements. Another is to purport to fund avoidance schemes involving
receipt of foreign income with money that does not have an associated
funding cost, such as customers&#146; deposits in non-interest
bearing current
accounts.</div><a name="09061655000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will amend rules introduced in the Finance Act 2005, as hon.
Members have said. That legislation is working well, but the clause
will clarify its intention by putting two matters beyond doubt. First,
where there is an avoidance scheme, the assumption is that any income
received by a member of a banking group is trade income, unless that
assumption is not reasonable. Secondly, a bank&#146;s funding costs
should always be taken into account when calculating the double
taxation relief
due.</div><a name="09061655000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will apply to avoidance schemes, and I believe only to avoidance
schemes. Its effect in all cases will be to ensure that a fair amount
of tax credit is given. There are no circumstances in which double
taxation relief should be given without regard to bank 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>funding costs, so a restriction to avoidance
schemes  or arrangements is not necessary. My concern about
amendment 218 is that, since the aim of the clause is to put the matter
wholly beyond doubt, the additional requirement that it applies only in
cases of avoidance would be an unnecessary obstacle to its proper
implementation.</div><a name="09061655000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000477"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I expect that the Minister knows more about motive
clauses than I do. Given the fact that there are a lot of motive
clauses on anti-avoidance measures, what kind of parameters have the
Government used? I think that he is saying that it would be too
burdensome or difficult to have the motive clause in the case under
discussion. Is there a particular point at which the motive clause
makes sense and another point at which it becomes too administratively
difficult?</div><a name="09061655000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000478"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that those tests are
appropriate in a range of circumstances, but they are not appropriate
in the case under discussion because the purpose of the clause is to
make things absolutely clear. To apply a test in this case would add
uncertainty, which the clause exists to remove. To add an avoidance
purpose test risks undermining the clause&#146;s aim of ensuring that
the point is
unarguable.</div><a name="09061655000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000479"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The Minister, in the course of our discussions on
this and previous clauses on double taxation and avoidance, has
referred to avoidance as undesirable, and he has also referred to the
abuse of rules. We are trying to clarify the Treasury&#146;s
position. One of our concerns, both moral and ethical, is also a
concern that we hear loud and clear from outside interest groups, and
it does not relate to a lack of certainty. I appreciate that our
amendment adds an element of uncertainty by discussing the main
purpose, but the issue is surely that some emphasis should be placed on
intentions, as well as
outcomes.</div><a name="09061655000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s strong view on the undesirability of any sort of
tax avoidance, which has manifested itself in some of the retrospective
and retroactive legislation of recent years, effectively centres just
on outcomes, rather than on intentions. Is it the case that the
Treasury, not only in relation to clauses such as this but also more
generally, wants to remove motive-type clauses in order to produce
total certainty? If that is the case, no attention whatever is being
paid to the intention of the main purpose; it is being paid, rather,
towards the outcome of the avoidance of tax, which is wholly
undesirable from the Government&#146;s
perspective.</div><a name="09061655000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000480"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not think that that is an accurate description
of what has happened. For example, we have had a debate about
principles-based legislation in relation to the Bill, and a very clear
statement has been included in it about the intended principles. We had
a debate about whether uncertainty was being created by that, so I do
not think that the general direction described by the hon. Gentleman is
right. However, in the case under discussion, the clause will apply to
avoidance schemes only. There may well need to be a motive test in a
case in which there might be a risk of inappropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>application, but there is no such risk in this particular case. It is a
fair result in all cases, so there is no need for the test to be
added.</div><a name="09061655000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000481"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I think I understand what the Minister is saying,
but there seem to be two ways of looking at the issue. Option A is that
such practice never happens unless it is done through deliberate
anti-avoidance, and option B is that, if such practice does happen, the
party involved may have innocently carried out the transaction, but
such transactions should be forbidden to prevent similar avoidance
schemes. The clause seems to conform to option A, which states that
such transactions never happen unless they are wilful and deliberate
avoidance.</div><a name="09061655000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000482"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Double taxation relief for a bank should always
take account of the bank&#146;s cost of funding. The clause does no
more than ensure that that is the case. If the qualification was added,
it would give tax avoiders an excuse for arguing that the legislation
should not apply and, for as long as they carried on arguing the point,
they would not be paying their tax. I therefore hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061655000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments avert a risk of an excessive reduction in tax
credit. The clause requires a bank or a company associated with a bank
to use the average costs that the bank would incur to fund a
transaction, known as its notional funding costs, for the purposes of
its DTR claim, rather than the funding costs actually used in its
calculations, where the notional funding costs are significantly
higher. Normally, banks fund all their transactions from a single
undifferentiated pool of assets, but in very limited circumstances a
company associated with a bank may fund a particular transaction with a
loan taken out for that specific purpose and thus have legitimate
direct funding
costs.</div><a name="09061655000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments ensure that all funding costs, whether direct or indirect,
will be taken into account in the DTR calculation, so relief will not
be restricted where companies associated with banks have incurred
legitimate direct funding costs. I hope that the Committee will feel
able to accept the Government amendments and the
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000484"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My contributions so far to this year&#146;s
Finance Bill seem to be in inverse proportion to the length of the
material in front of us. Schedule 30 is extremely lengthy&#151;six
pages from page 258 to 264. As they continue the anti-avoidance theme
of the clauses that we discussed earlier, I do not intend to speak at
length on it.</div>
<a name="09061655000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000485"></a>The
Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury (Mr.
Bob Blizzard):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Atkinson. I thought that we were discussing
clause 61.</div>
<a name="09061655000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000486"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are discussing clause 61, which introduces
schedule 30. It would be perhaps more convenient for the Committee to
discuss them together, given that clause 61 is simply a one-line clause
introducing schedule 30. The Chair is content with
that.</div>
<a name="09061655000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000487"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. It
would certainly be more convenient, but I must commend the Government
Whip for being on the ball. I was lost in schedule 30 before I realised
that we were officially debating clause 61.</div>
<a name="09061655000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
proposes, in some detail, various new measures to stop specific tax
avoidance schemes and practices, which seem to arise from the tax
avoidance disclosure regime of recent years. It is a bit of a motley
schedule&#151;paragraphs 2 to 5 could make some sense together, but
paragraph 1 appears to be something rather different, at least in my
interpretation.</div>
<a name="09061655000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 1
relates to various structures akin to the previously favoured film
partnership structures, which were tackled, I think, in the Finance Act
2006. Interest paid on qualifying loans, such as loans taken out to buy
into a partnership or shares in a close company, is deductible. It was
announced on 19 March 2009 that legislation would be introduced in the
2009 Finance Bill to deny individuals relief for loan interest on
investments in partnerships or close companies, where the interest is
paid as part of an arrangement and the deductibility of the interest
means that the investor is guaranteed to make a profit. In other words,
it is a no-lose investment scheme. Draft legislation was released on 19
March and will be retrospective to that
date.</div>
<a name="09061655000335"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09061655000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is understood that that anti-avoidance measure is principally aimed at
several arrangements that were being offered to partners in old sale
and leaseback film partnerships&#151;people who had previously gone
down that road of tax avoidance. They purported to produce an interest
deduction for borrowings to participate in the new arrangement, which
could then be used to offset the reverse in film sale and leaseback
income. There were other arrangements whereby a significant loss,
funded by debt rather than personal investment, would be generated in
the first year that an individual joined a partnership and would then
give a &#147;guaranteed&#148; return of funds over the life of the
partnership. Put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>another way, some companies had been getting full tax relief for making
only a partial investment. As I understand it, the legislation is not
intended to affect genuine commercial investments in businesses where
there is uncertainty as to the return that will be produced from the
arrangements.</div>
<a name="09061655000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs 2
and 3 relate to amounts not fully recognised for accounting purposes.
Their provisions block certain tax avoidance schemes that involve
derivatives. Under a certain scheme and its variants, a company would
derecognise in its accounts a derivative that is carried at fair value,
with the result that profits arising to the company on that derivative
fall out of the account for tax purposes. Where a derivative contract
of a company is matched with shares, securities or fixed income
instruments issues by it, it might be permissible under generally
accepted accounting principles for the contract or amounts arising in
respect of the contract not to be recognised in determining the
company&#146;s accounting profits or losses for the period. The new
legislation requires the profits and losses on the derivative to be
fully brought into account for tax purposes, even if they are
recognised separately or not at all in the
account.</div><a name="09061655000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
4 relates to amounts not fully recognised for accounting purposes. That
is another scheme that involves an intra-group convertible loan that is
highly likely to convert into shares of the issuing company. The debtor
company accrues and obtains a tax deduction for more than the
corresponding taxable amount in the creditor company. The new
legislation will input additional taxable credits into the creditor
company to make the tax treatment
symmetrical.</div><a name="09061655000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
5 deals with credits and debits for manufactured interest. Again, as
announced on 27 January by the Financial Secretary, the paragraph is
being introduced to ensure that the tax treatment of manufactured
interest payments is consistent with the treatment of such payments in
company accounts prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. The announcement
followed a decision in the High Court&#151;DCC Holdings (UK) Ltd
<i class="I">v. </i>HMRC&#151;relating to the treatment of deemed manufactured
payments. It was felt that that decision could result in payers of real
manufactured interest obtaining excessive deductions and recipients
being taxed on amounts greater than those they actually
received.</div><a name="09061655000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation will apply to real manufactured interest payments made both
before and after 27 January and to manufactured interest payments
deemed to be made on or after 27 January. HMRC has indicated that the
legislation is not intended to apply to the type of deemed manufactured
payments that were the subject of the High Court case. I would be
grateful if the Minister would confirm that that is
correct.</div><a name="09061655000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation for those proposals,
to check that we understand schedule 30 correctly. There is,
however, one area on which we would especially like to question the
Minister: the retrospective nature of the provision in paragraph 5
following the DCC Holdings case. As I understand it, there was a widely
held, but not universal, view on how the legislation should apply, but
that did not accord with the Court&#146;s decision on the case. The
Chartered Institute of Taxation argues that neither taxpayers who have
followed the letter of the law, nor taxpayers who have followed the
accepted practice, should be penalised. I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s view on that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000488"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I had not intended to speak, but have been inspired
to do so by the hon. Gentleman, who referred to this as a motley
schedule, because that was exactly my perception. It seems rather like
Leviticus, listing a set of financial sins in no particular order. I
would like to make a brief comment on anti-avoidance, which  is
at the heart of the debate. There seem to be two essential processes in
the Bill. First, there is a kind of anti-avoidance catch-up process of
identifying things that have gone wrong and tabling clauses to deal
specifically with them. The other choice that the Government have is of
the kind that one always has in these dilemmas&#151;to go for a set
of broad principles against which firms can judge for themselves
whether they are on the right side of tax law. With either choice,
there is some difficulty. With a broad set of principles, there is a
wide scope but certainty is lacking. With a measure such as schedule
30, on the other hand, there is certainty but much may be missed and
other things might evolve that have to be dealt
with.</div><a name="09061655000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall, who arrived in the
Committee recently, has been at a meeting of the Treasury Select
Committee, which has been discussing this issue today. Let me read from
the notes that were presented to
him:</div><a name="09061655000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
should also not overrate the capacity of standards to ensure
appropriate national regulation&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061655000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I guess that is why we
have schedule 30 and why we will have schedules precisely like it in
every financial Act to
come.</div><a name="09061655000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000489"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not quite understand the parallel with
Leviticus, but I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="09061655000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000490"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> When one reads Leviticus, which has a long series of
very detailed clauses, one finds that the ancient Hebrews must surely
have been getting up to some very strange and diverse activities, which
were obviously identified as the sins of Leviticus. When one reads
schedules such as this, one reaches similar conclusions about the
financial
sector.</div><a name="09061655000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000491"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I shall bear
that in mind the next time I read Leviticus, and I shall look for those
similarities.</div><a name="09061655000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule tackles three tax avoidance schemes and responds to a recent
High Court decision that could give rise to avoidance. The hon. Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham has talked us through the measures, but let
me go through them. Paragraph 1 involves exploitation of the tax rules
for interest relief under which individuals can claim relief against
their general income for interest paid on loans used to invest in some
small companies and partnerships. The existence of relief for interest
in those circumstances encourages investment in small businesses that
are carried on commercially and with a view to
profit.</div><a name="09061655000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the schemes that have been notified to HMRC as a result of the
disclosure provisions that we have put in place, the interest relief
provisions are artificially exploited by means of arrangements that are
almost guaranteed to allow the investor to exit the arrangements with
more money than was originally invested. That will be achieved by the
interest paid being set against other income, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>which is unrelated to the business in which the cash is invested, for UK
tax purposes, while the matching gain is not chargeable to tax. The
legislation will not deny relief to anyone who makes legitimate
investments in businesses that bear a normal commercial
risk.</div><a name="09061655000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
2 and 3 relate to a scheme that involves a company exploiting a rule in
the tax provisions for corporate debt and derivative contracts, which
is intended to deal with revaluation issues on transition from one type
of GAAP to another. A company transfers risk and rewards of a loan or
derivative contract to a connected party and, in consequence, is
required by GAAP to derecognise the asset and so to reflect a loss in
its accounts equal to the value of the loan or derivative
contract.</div><a name="09061655000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to paragraph 4, the scheme involves avoidance of corporation
tax by large companies using convertible loans. A company lends money
to another member of the same group&#151;the debtor company&#151;in
return for the issue of a bond that is likely to convert into shares in
the debtor company. Initially, no interest is payable, but interest
will be paid if the loan does not convert. The debtor company accrues a
deduction for that interest from the start, because under UK GAAP it
must not anticipate conversion and it must spread the expected interest
evenly over the length of the loan. The creditor company, though,
accounts for the loan on the more realistic assumption that it will
convert and so does not accrue any receivable interest. As a result,
the deduction for the debtor company is greater than the income that
the creditor company brings into account, so although there is no
economic loss for the group, the debtor company is able to claim a tax
deductible expense while the creditor claims not to be taxable in
respect of any corresponding amount.</div>
<a name="09061655000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
paragraph 5 responds to the High Court decision, in the case of DCC
Holdings, that might allow some companies to reduce their tax
liabilities inappropriately and other companies to be taxable on
profits not received. The case was concerned with the deductibility of
manufactured interest and suggested that it might be possible for
companies to claim deductions in excess of the amounts appearing in
their profit and loss accounts. Not making that change would result in
companies being able to release their profits artificially, and
therefore their tax liabilities. The total tax protection of all those
four measures, over the next four financial years, is expected to be,
or thought to be, in excess of &#163;2
billion.</div>
<a name="09061655000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000492"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for giving us that figure. In
the previous couple of clauses he mentioned annual figures&#151;I
think the amount in the previous clause was &#163;150 million and the
one before that was &#163;100 million. Will he tell us why he is
suddenly giving us a four-year forward projection? Is he able to break
down that &#163;2 billion on a per annum basis? How much will it save
in this financial
year?</div><a name="09061655000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000493"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not have the figure for the current year. I
can check whether we have such an estimate and, if we do, I can send it
to him, but the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is a very
substantial sum indeed. When we have seemingly arcane debates on these
topics, we need to bear in mind just how much revenue is at stake for
the Exchequer.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="09061655000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000494"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right in pointing out
that &#163;2 billion is a very significant amount to save the UK
taxpayer by ending these avoidance schemes. Could he therefore tell us
something about the breakdown of the &#163;2 billion between the
various paragraphs? We have already discussed the power of one in
particular being rather different to the other paragraphs. Surely he
must have some idea of how that &#163;2 billion breaks down across
the various paragraphs.</div>
<a name="09061655000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061655000495"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am happy to drop the hon. Gentleman a line
setting out our assessment of how that is made up, both between the
four things being addressed here and how it looks as though they would
fall over the coming four years. Let me also respond to his point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>about the application of the schedule to deemed payments. He is right,
legislation does not apply retrospectively to deemed
payments&#151;only to real payments. The High Court litigation on
