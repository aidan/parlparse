							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): We have had a most
interesting opening to our proceedings on the Bill through the witness
procedure. I want to begin this afternoon with a general question
directed at the Minister for Local Government about what we have heard.
The Bill has been set in the context of the nature of government in
this country and the concerns that are expressed outside about the
powers that people have locally to make decisions and to make things
happen, and a recognition of the frustration that is sometimes out
there. We have seen the Government&#146;s determination to do
something about it being challenged by some of the witnesses, who would
have liked them to go further. I would therefore like to ask the
Minister, in the context of listening to the evidence sessions and
taking part in them, have you changed your opinion on anything that you
have heard about? Have queries been raised in your mind about the
balance of devolution that you have reached? Does the witness procedure
mean that you will be thinking about the Bill in a way that you would
not have been without that
procedure?</div>

						</i> First, Mr. Chope, I thank you and
wish you well in the Chair. We are very proud to be the first Ministers
to give evidence to a Standing
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0702028000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Alistair,
could I say what a clever question that was? Government Departments
have relationships with each other, as well as with Parliament and, in
our case, with local government. Our strategy has been to ensure
that
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div>Government across Whitehall come with us. We are trying to join up the
governance and delivery of services at local level, so it is necessary
that the consultation and the effort of that consultation are deep and
broad and real. By the end of the consultation on the White Paper, we
were being criticised for having taken too long. We therefore saw it as
a sign of
success.</div>
					<a name="0702028000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
would be inconsistent and dishonest to say that the evidence that we
have heard has not influenced thinking. There are a number of areas
where the Government genuinely have an open mind about how best to
achieve the objectives on which we think there is a consensus. We have
spent particular effort in building a consensus across the parties in
the Local Government Association. I was particularly pleased by its
representatives&#146; evidence on the first of their three major
points. I cannot say that, and then not take its second point
seriously. So the answer is yes. I personally think that it has been
valuable and I hope that this sitting is, too. I am conscious of not
wanting to take up all of your
time.</div>

Woolas:
							</b>
						</i> When we set out the invitation to propose, we
were&#151;and we remain&#151;committed to a genuinely permissive
regime. We did not wish to adopt a one-size-fits-all model because
there is a paradox between devolution and equal treatment. We cannot
genuinely say that we are devolving for local decision making and then
say, &#147;This is how you are going to do it.&#148; Previous
reviews, particularly the Banham review, had a role within that process
for the boundary committee, so that it could have the power of
direction to ensure that, if a proposal for unitary were to be adopted,
it was fair for the whole area that was affected&#151;that is, for
the neighbouring councils&#151;it was robust and it met the criteria
in the proposing area. It is clear that there is support for that power
among some of the people who are
proposing.</div>
					<a name="0702028000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
equally clear that there is a suspicion&#151;let me put it that
way&#151;that that power could be used in a different way. The Local
Government Association made that point clear on an all-party basis. Our
policy intention was to allow a window of opportunity for proposals for
unitary, but to close that window, not in haste, but so as not to allow
an undue period of uncertainty. All local government knows that that is
damaging for
it.</div>
					<a name="0702028000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Representations
have been made by the Local Government Association. We accept its
point. We are working on parliamentary counsel instruction to have a
power of direction that is defined in both geography and time to the
satisfaction of the LGA. Indeed, that was a major issue that came up on
Second Reading. It is not our intention to impose change. I think that
the evidence now backs up that point, although there is a raging debate
out there in some councils and motives are often ascribed that are not
intended. We intend to listen to the points that some hon. Members
madeon Second Reading and well as those made by the
LGA.</div>

							<b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): In the regulatory
impact assessment to the local government White Paper, the Government
accept that the costs indicated for restructuring are broad brush.
Obviously, we have seen some of the criticism produced by academics of
the way in which the costs are being assessed. Some interesting figures
have been bandied
about.</div>
					<a name="0702028000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do you accept
that some figures that are based clearly on what happened in and around
Banham probably cannot be moved across to the current situation because
local authorities are now much more under the microscope in terms of
their financial probity and so on. Therefore, those authorities that
are likely to be going forward will be doing so from a much better
informed position than some of those that had looked at it under
Banham.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Phil
Woolas:
							</b>
						</i> There is a wide spectrum of opinion in
academia about costs. One of the obvious points in local government
finance is the ability to compare like with like. We set our policy of
inviting proposals within two frameworks. I described the first in the
previous answer. The second framework ensures that thenewly
created financial regime benefits the counciltax payer and
does not jeopardise but indeed supports the Government&#146;s overall
macro-economic policy, particularly the famous golden rule.</div>
					<a name="0702028000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The invitation therefore
contains five criteria, including that proposals must be self-financing
within five years; must be met from within the resource envelope of the
local authority or authorities concerned&#151;in other words, they
must be self-financing through efficiency savings or through reserves;
and must result in a council tax that is equalised down if it is across
district borders, and cannot be greater if it is in a single transfer.
The context of that is that the up-front costs contribute towards local
government total borrowing because of their impact on reserves and
assets. When one asks, &#147;How can you say that there can only be a
limited number and make sure that they are self-financing?&#148; the
answer is that we have to look&#151;as my colleagues and I do
anyway&#151;at the total local government borrowing
position.</div>

						</i> In the process of the Banhamreview,
the Local Government Commission made recommendations that were either
accepted or rejected on the basis of all the factors. Finance was just
one of the factors, and there were no requirements as now. Indeed, for
some of the new unitaries set up then, the payback periods were about
10
years.</div>

							<a name="0702028000277"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I have a couple of questions. First, there have been
26 proposals for unitary status. The White Paper said that you were
looking for eight that you might have the opportunity to process. Are
you going to stick to eight, or are you going to try to make the most
of those 26? Surely the more there are to consider, the more
unacceptable it is in terms of public expenditure?</div>

							<b class="B">
								Phil
Woolas:
							</b>
						</i>
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>The 26 proposals are in some
cases mutually contradictory. Hence the first question on the power to
direct, the controversy and the point that although it is always
desirable to achieve consensus and have a permissive devolved regime,
the question always arises, &#147;What do you do if people
disagree?&#148; whether at ward level, neighbourhood level, borough
level, district or county level.</div>
					<a name="0702028000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The eight figure comes from a
calculation of the potential impact on local government borrowing. If
assets and reserves are used to fund up-front costs, that has an impact
on the balance sheet and on the golden rule. That is where the eight
comes from. Without knowing where the eight, six or 10 proposals would
come from, and without having the analysis of that, it is impossible to
say exactly, which is why the Secretary of State used the phrase
&#147;around eight&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702028000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The constraints upon us are,
quite rightly, the viability of the proposals and the macro-economic
picture. The chances of there being more than eight are there, and the
chances of there being less than eight are there, depending on that
analysis. Once we had said that we were asking for invitations, apart
from the macro-economic context, we do not see that it is our role to
determine how many there should be.</div>

							<a name="0702028000278"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b>
						My second question relates to
general costs. You listened to the evidence from the chairman of
Conservative district council groups. He said that in his experience no
restructuring had ever saved any money. Do you have any experience of
savings achieved through local government restructuring?</div>

						</i>
						Personally? East Riding of
Yorkshire&#151;that is one that I have studied. In my view&#151;I
think it would be shared by my predecessors in all
Governments&#151;when you make changes in local government finance,
there is normally a built-in creep upwards. It is therefore incumbent
on Government to make sure that that does not happen. For example, our
new burdens policy is a good policy, which rightly recognises that
councils may be given extra responsibilities and that it is incumbent
on Government to provide the resources to meet them. However, it is a
net new burdens policy&#151;savings as well as costs are generated by
changes. Precisely because it is a bottom-up process that we are
proposing, it is incumbent on councils, and not the Government, to
prove the financial case, and we have built that in to the criteria.
That is how I see it.</div>

objective of opening the window of opportunity and then closing it, so
that we do not get the uncertainties. The uncertainties can be very
real&#151;they can be about staff deciding to move jobs or contracts
going unsigned. Although there are benefits from the process, there are
disadvantages, of which I am very conscious. On the other hand, public
support for change is the ultimate arbitrator. If there is no public
support, the question of how it could be done
arises.</div>
					<a name="0702028000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have allowed
in the timetable a window of opportunity, which closed on 25 January.
Only a council could propose change in that time. If a council has not
proposed change, there can be no change, other than by the direct
all-county solution that we have talked about. The second stage in the
process is the assessment of a proposal against the criteria, which is
subject to legal challenge should we stray&#151;in other words, we
have to consider whether there is a prima facie case against the
criteria. The third stage is what is called, in the modern world,
stakeholder consultation, which will include all interested parties,
especially the public.</div>
					<a name="0702028000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are therefore two built-in
safety mechanisms. First, there has to be a demonstration of public
support. A feature of our permissive regime is that councils can go
about doing that in different ways. Secondly, the third period
coincides with local elections. I expect that local elections in those
areas where a prima facie case has been accepted will provide
significant guidance to the councils that are putting forward
proposals.</div>

be prepared to consider the possibility that savings may be obtained if
a council can demonstrate that clearly. I know of one bid that claims
that the council concerned can meet quite a few of the costs from
reserves. It is self-financing not only in terms of long-term revenue
savings, but up front from reserves. That is a point that must be
considered. Is it not also the case that it is not just a question of
justifying possible unitary bids in terms of immediate or longer-term
savings but of making more effective use of what money there is? That
is what local government should be about too.</div>

there was evidence, I cited East Riding. It is clear that the potential
savings from going unitary are significant. We know that from closer
working now and from previous experience, but by putting the onus on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 91</div>the council to show that the savings can be made and allowing interested
parties and then the Government to test that, we think that we can get
a much more accurate picture of the real potential savings than has
been the case in some of the previous local government
reorganisations.</div>

one would not be doing the exercise if one did not think that it was

and strong evidence. He and I disagreed in that exchange on where the
pressure for the process was coming from. The pressure was coming from
local councils. The <i class="I">Municipal Journal</i> reported a robust survey
of chief executives of district councils&#151;I have no predilection
for districts or counties, but in this case it was a survey of
districts&#151;that showed that 80 per cent. of chief executives
believed that significant savings could be made by the unitary process.

the proposal will increase accountability and develop the relationship
with the electorate. Indeed, what we are trying to do through the
Bill&#146;s devolutionary process is put a councillor at the heart of
their community, as a community champion. If you look at the processes

talking about replicating the current size of wards, which have three
members. They would be smaller, roughly a third of that size.
Therefore, I cannot see how the proposal would increase the work load
of councillors. What it does is balance the relationship between the
councillor and their division as it does with county councillors.
However, at the end of the day, it would be a matter for the council
itself to decide if it wants to go down that route or not. The
councillors, who know the work load in their areas, will make that
decision. Does that increase the work load and make it more difficult

that the model of a directly elected executive was not exactly what
they first thought of. That model seems to have quite a lot of problems
and difficulties attached, and no doubt we shall explore them. Will the
Minister comment on how that model came to be included? Other evidence
that we have heard suggested that there should be a way to allow the
public to endorse a new governance model, whereas the Bill goes in the
opposite direction&#151;for instance, by removing the right of
referendum on the creation of a mayor. It is about the model and the
endorsement.</div>

						</i>Thank you for that question; it
gives us the opportunity to clarify things. As has just been described,
we discussed different leadership models. There was a debate in the
country on whether it should be possible to impose a mayor. We decided
against that because it was inconsistent with our general policy, and
Alistair Burt has probed us on the boundaries of
that.</div>
					<a name="0702028000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consultation
with councils, which as I said was deep and broad, asked councils what
they thought. They asked us for this model. Part of the debate on
Second Reading and elsewhere has criticised the Government for the
potential pitfalls, and some have pointed out the advantages. That may
be true&#151;this Committee must discuss how we can ensure that the
rules work&#151;but whether a council chooses that option is up to
the council knowing the pros and cons. The model came from councils
such as Stockton, and other councils are discussing it in quite
exciting ways.</div>
					<a name="0702028000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that if we are genuinely devolving power&#151;we believe
that we are, particularly through the local area agreement
process&#151;we must ensure on behalf of Parliament that that power
is handled responsibly. We did not create the Scottish Parliament and
say, &#147;You guys can decide the structure of government.&#148;
We said, &#147;We are devolving power on these functions, but we
think that there have to be some boundaries to how you do
it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702028000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
mayoral appointment and the referendum, our policy is that the route
through which a governance structure was created is the route through
which it can be got rid of, except of course that the public always
have the final say. In other words, if a mayor was created by a
referendum, that mayor can be got rid of by referendum. We are not
removing the right of referendum. At the moment, one can have a mayor
either by the council proposing it and putting it to a public
referendum that says yes, or by a trigger taking place through the
petition process, after which a referendum says yes. Under the new
proposals, you will still be able to petition to trigger a referendum
for mayor; what will change is that a council will be able to create a
mayor by resolution without having to go to a referendum. That is the
change, and it will give greater freedom to
councils.</div>

						</i> I am now being quizzed from the opposite side
of the argument. The proposal and the idea&#151;to which I personally
see some advantages, in terms of leadership&#151;came from local
councils. Why not havea one-size-fits-all approach? The answer
is partly devolutionary and partly to ask why that would be desirable.
The geography of our councils is so different. One councillor said to
me in the consultation that it took him a 120 mile round trip to chair
a council meeting. That makes a directly elected executive model, if
one does not want to directly elect a mayor, a more attractive
proposition. That is one of the points about the evidence on which
Alistair Burt quizzed us&#151;whether we had an open mind on that. We
genuinely want the Committee&#146;s views and experience in order to
see how we could ensure that it works, but ultimately, if the model is
there and a council wants it, the council can have
it.</div>

relationship change; the devolving down&#151;should be done through
the elected councillor. We are not devolving outside the democratic

that has the elected mayor/city manager model. For those not familiar
with that, it puts significant executive power in the hands of the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>has that model. Because we decided that that model was not one of the
options that we wanted to make available, and because there is a strong
consensus in Stoke itself, we do make an exception. But, of course, the
mayoralty in Stoke was created by referendum and can be undone only by

in London fit with enhancing the role of the ward councillor as the
local champion, and about accountability and responsibility and how
that fits with a strong leadership model. As we have discussed, there

problem in London. There may be some initial teething problems, but all
parishes operate in a two-tier or single-tier authority area at

outlines the respective roles and responsibilities. As I say, there may
be some teething problems, but I do not anticipate an enormous
problem.</div>

appropriate to have a parish council in their area. Community cohesion
is one issue that will be taken into account when the council is making
that decision. So I think that the problem of extremism or a group
setting itself apart from the rest of the area can be dealt with in the

the Committee know, at the moment when a vacancy exists a co-option can
take place because of the problem that Mr. Stunell outlined.
The National Association of Local Councils reports that it is useful to
be able to have members with particular standing in the community or
expertise. The head teacher whom Angela mentioned is a good example. In
my constituency, one of the museum chairs is a member of the parish
council. The safeguard is that they are not allowed to take part in the

agree that that is the case. Part 5 sets out the new powers for

						</i> The scrutiny role is working very well in
some areas, but not so well in others. The best scrutiny committees
involve consensus across parties, rather like our Select Committee
system. They task and finish reports. They examine areas of policy.
They bring forward solutions, just like Select Committees, as well as
highlight problems. It is an evolving process. The criticism that was
aired on Second Reading and elsewhere of not having the old committee
system was, &#147;How do you get councils involved? How do you bring
them up? How do you give them experience? How do you involve them in
decision making?&#148; We think that to enhance overview and scrutiny
is a very important way of doing
that.</div>
					<a name="0702028000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I personally
think that the idea that being a member of the housing sub-committee is
a tremendous insight into the loop of power in authorities is
stretching it a bit. The overview and scrutiny committee conferences in
local government&#151;the national events&#151;are a substantial
part of the calendar. In essence, we want to be place-shapers in
respect of the performance regime, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div>the accountability regime and the way in which councils are judged. We
want the overview and scrutiny committees to be able to hold to account
the whole place, as far as is possible like a Select Committee. The
parallel is not too strong because, of course, there are legal
differences. We think that that will radically change the way in which
public services are delivered and the responsiveness of not only
councils but public institutions and
others.</div>

Earlier, and you have just reiterated it, you said that you wanted to

a moment about the limits&#151;there is an obligation to appear or
present evidence and an obligation upon that body that it must pay
regard, under law, to the findings of the overview and scrutiny
committee. That, we think, is a significant change. Now of course, the
number of bodies that are included within that is where it gets
difficult because registered social landlords are not statutory public
sector bodies in the sense, for example, that a PCT is. We believe that
the fact that the overview and scrutiny committee has got that power
will create not just a legal framework but a climate in which that is
expected, and that will greatly enhance the status of the councillors

effective scrutiny is having access to information. Access to
information from the partners is going to be crucial if these enhanced
scrutiny powers are going to work. This is particularly an issue for
public services that were previously provided by councils, where, for
example, the Local Government Act 1972 access to information
regulations applied. Now, if services are run by trusts or private
companies, not even the Freedom of Information Act 2000 applies in a
number of cases. So will scrutiny be relying on good will or are we
going to beef up the access to information

sounds a terrible amount, but it is mitigated by the fact that that is

that it has helped to drive improvement. The number of councils that
have improved under the Audit Commission measurement has got there. But
our analysis is completely different from the one that has been
expounded on Second Reading. Our analysis is that local government has
improved and is taking more place-shaping powers. The reforms that we

						</i> The proposal set out in one of the schedules
to the Bill is that the Audit Commission should, effectively, act as a
gatekeeper for the other inspectorates, so when the inspectors are
planning their work plans, normally on an annual basis, they will get
together to co-ordinate any inspections of individual local
authorities. We think that that will do the job that has been asked for
by local government, of ensuring that we do not have one inspectorate
after another piling into a local area. We expect that system to work
perfectly adequately without further

						</i> Mental health is a very good example of
how, under the new system, we will beable to scrutinise and
improve services for mental health service users. The problem that they
have often faced is that mental health is considered to be, in a way,
over there. Under the new system, PCTs havestrong
commissioning powers. It is important that when services are being
scrutinised and decisions are being made, the mental health voice is
there at the table.</div>
					<a name="0702028000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other thing that mental
health service users will often say is that their mental health needs
might be looked after, but their physical health needs are not. We are
asking what happens to a patient in their pathway. A mental health
service user will very often also need support from, for example, local
authority social services. The LINKs will have new powers to look at
the joint commissioning that often occurs already in mental health and
be able to scrutinise both the health side and the social care
side.</div>
					<a name="0702028000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is nothing
in the LINKs to stop specialisms. If people want to specialise in
mental health aspects of service provision, there is absolutely no
reason why they should not. If they want to have a special relationship
with a mental health trust, they can, but the discussions about mental
health will be brought to the wider table. There is also the
possibility that organisations could be joined to the new LINKs, so
that every local member of Mind or Rethink, for example, could become a
member of the LINK. That is just not possible at the moment. I see it
as widening patient and public involvement. Mental health is a very
good example of a service that would benefit from wider

Again, they will need the services of social care. As services
increasingly come out of the hospital setting into the community, we
want a LINK to have the ability to scrutinise all those services and
not be confined, as many are at the moment, to making reports about
their own institutions and not necessarily about what happens to the
patient. We do not say that they will not be able to look at particular
