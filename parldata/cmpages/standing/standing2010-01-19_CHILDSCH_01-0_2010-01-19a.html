<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000234"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before we begin, I have a few
announcements to make. I do not think that they will be terribly
interesting to anyone, but I have to go through the motions with these
announcements. If people wish to remove their jackets, please feel free
to do so if you want to be more comfortable. There is a money
resolution in connection with this Bill. Copies are available in the
room. If colleagues need advice, we have Officers who can point them in
the right
direction.</div><a name="1001205000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to remind members of the Committee that adequate notice of
amendments should be given. Three days&#146; notice of amendments is
normally required for them to be selectable. That is, amendments tabled
up until the rise of the House on a Thursday will be selectable on a
Tuesday, and those tabled up until the rise of the House on a Monday
will be selectable on a Thursday. As a general rule, I and my fellow
Chairman, Janet Anderson, do not intend to call starred amendments,
including any starred amendments that might be reached during an
afternoon sitting of the Committee.</div>
<a name="1001205000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will be asked first to consider the programme motion on the amendment
paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and then a motion to
permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral
evidence sessions, which I hope we can take
formally.</div><a name="1001205000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming
that the second of these motions has been agreed, the Committee will
then move into private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the
witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into the Room
and our oral evidence session will continue. If the Committee agrees to
the programme motion, the Committee will hear evidence this morning and
this afternoon, and Thursday morning and afternoon. Next week we will
move to the Committee Corridor and revert to the traditional clause by
clause
scrutiny.</div><a name="1001205000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="1001205000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<a name="1001205000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001205000235"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I want
to raise an objection to the way in which the choice of witnesses is
handled. I was careful to choose only a limited number of witnesses
reflecting the wide range of subjects in the Bill. However, at least
two of my witnesses were rejected and I was not given any reason why.
One was Mr. John Bald, an independent consultant and an
expert in education, and the other was Mr. Paul Strong, a
head teacher at William Farr school in Lincolnshire. There are other
head teachers who are being called as Government witnesses and I was
upset that two of my witnesses on a very short list were
rejected.</div><a name="1001205000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
this process of calling witnesses from outside to help scrutinise Bills
is to work and to be transparent and open, it is important that
Opposition witnesses are called unless there are exceptional reasons
why they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>should not be. If the Government simply use this as a way of justifying
their own legislation, it calls the whole process into
question.</div><a name="1001205000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a practical note, I understand that one of the witnesses due to give
evidence in the last session on Thursday was unable to accept the
invitation, and I would like to suggest an alternative name to fill
that
slot.</div><a name="1001205000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000236"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> We have tried as far as possible to accommodate
all the witnesses who have been suggested and have tried to ensure a
balance of people for these public evidence sessions. If the usual
channels can discuss who the alternative should be for the last slot on
Thursday when someone is not able to come, I am sure we will be able to
deal with
that.</div><a name="1001205000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001205000237"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I have two points. First, I wish
to record our thanks to the Minister for taking into account the
suggestions that we made about who should be witnesses, and for
accepting some significant amendments to the Government&#146;s
original list of witnesses. We appreciate the time it has taken to
track down a number of individuals, some of whom have and some of whom
have not been able to come.</div>
<a name="1001205000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, may
I register our concerns about the programme motion. Although the Bill
is small in size, it is great in scope, and we shall have an awful lot
to consider after we go on from the evidence sessions. I hope that we
can have some assurance from the Minister that every attempt will be
made by the Government and by the usual channels to accommodate as
extensive as possible a debate, because if we do not have that time, I
am sure that that will be taken into account in another place, when
decisions are made about how much of this legislation should be allowed
to go
through.</div><a name="1001205000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000238"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am grateful for the remarks at the beginning. I
do not run a Bill deliberately to avoid anybody that anybody else wants
being on the Committee. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks about how we have tried to accommodate people on the Committee
in order to give us
evidence.</div><a name="1001205000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman will notice that we have an end date for our discussion
of the content of the Bill, but clearly if there is a need for one or
two additional hours on one or two of the sittings, I am sure, subject
to discussion, that that will be possible. He will also note that, as
is the case 100 per cent. of the time whenever I am responsible for a
Bill, there are no knives. It is a matter for the Committee to
determine how much time it wants to spend on particular issues, and I
am sure that we will come to an arrangement without the necessity for
an artificial knife. That will lead to the Committee conducting its
business in a much more sensible and mature way. We have an end date,
and I am sure that, with the good will that we will no doubt generate,
it will be possible to put in an additional hour or two hours somewhere
if people feel it appropriate to discuss something a bit more. I am
sure that, subject to the usual negotiations and discussions, in the
spirit in which this Committee will conduct itself, that may well be
possible.</div><a name="1001205000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

would be useful to have such policy papers in advance and I wonder
whether you can make sure that we receive
them.</div><a name="1001205000028"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000241"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Amess. I echo those concerns. There is an extensive amount of paperwork
involved in trying to scrutinise a Bill and it is difficult to do our
job if we are not aware of the documents within a decent period of
time. May I ask, therefore, that we receive any documents at least
24 hours before the Committee sits? Is it possible for the
Minister to write to members of the Committee later this week to
indicate which papers might be used during each sitting and roughly
when we can expect to see
them?</div><a name="1001205000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000242"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes, I will do that. I apologise for the fact that
the documents are not here. They are on their way as we
speak.</div><a name="1001205000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000243"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Welcome to all our witnesses this morning. I do
not know whether you have had any experience of giving evidence at a
session like this, but I hope that it will be an enjoyable experience.
Please introduce yourselves and briefly say something about the
Bill.</div><a name="1001205000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> I am General Secretary of the
Association of School and College Leaders, which involves about 15,000
secondary schools, head teachers and deputy heads. We are concerned
that there is to be yet another education Bill in this parliamentary
Session, particularly so soon after the Apprenticeships, Skills,
Children and Learning Act 2009&#151;not a very well-named piece of
legislation, I might add. Our main concerns about the Bill are around
the guarantees and potential in an increasingly litigious society for
parents to take up an awful lot of head teachers&#146; time in
disputing what are rather uncertain and woolly guarantees.</div>
<a name="1001205000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Katherine Rake:</b></i> I am chief executive of the Family
and Parenting Institute. We have a long-standing concern to ensure that
families and schools engage effectively to promote children&#146;s
learning. So that is our particular interest in the
Bill.</div><a name="1001205000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> I am the local government ombudsman. As a
result of the ASCL Act 2009, to which John just referred, we are
responsible for investigating complaints relating to the internal
management of schools. We are an independent body and, as a result of
this Bill, our  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>responsibilities will extend to covering the guarantees it contains. I
have a responsibility to ensure that the dispute resolution procedure
is fair and proportionate and that is the basis on which I shall fulfil
my role here. I have a responsibility to ensure that
the dispute resolution is fair and proportionate in the way that I
carry out my functions, and it would be on that basis that I would
fulfil my
role.</div><a name="1001205000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> I am general secretary of the NASUWT and
represent more than 273,000 teacher and school leader members. I am
very pleased to have been asked to give evidence to this Bill
Committee. We are broadly supportive of a number of the principles that
are encapsulated in the Bill, particularly those that are looking to
give entitlement, guarantees and access to some of the most vulnerable
children in our schools. We have evaluated the Bill on the basis that
we believe education Bills should be looking at making the state sector
the sector of choice for education, not a sector of default. We have
issues about some of the detail of elements within the Bill,
particularly in making sure that the legislation and regulations are
cast in such a way that they will not add unnecessary bureaucratic
burdens or work loads on school leaders, teachers and other staff in
schools.</div><a name="1001205000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I am deputy leader of the London Borough of
Hillingdon, and I am here to speak on behalf of the Local Government
Association. We broadly welcome the objectives of the Bill. Local
government is deeply committed to raising standards in
education, but I have a number of observations about
the operation of various items within the Bill, particularly
the guarantees and the proposed intervention powers of the Secretary of
State, and about elements of the Badman review and how that will
operate in practice. I look forward to sharing them with you in the
course of today&#146;s
hearing.</div><a name="1001205000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000244"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. We have until midday to question our
witnesses. Mr. Gibb will ask the first
question.</div><a name="1001205000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000245"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>I wish to ask Mr. Tony Redmond
about guarantees. When you have heard a complaint and upheld and you
share the views of the complainant, paragraph 19 of the consultation
document, &#147;The Pupil and Parent Guarantees&#148;, states that
you can
recommend</div><a name="1001205000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
there has been a failure to make provision promised in the Guarantees,
the LGO could seek to ensure that it is
delivered;&#148;.</div><a name="1001205000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later
in the document, it says that you can recommend
that</div><a name="1001205000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;practices
be changed for the
future&#148;.</div><a name="1001205000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
do you intend to deliver changes at a given school to ensure that all
pupils go to schools where they are taught a broad balance and flexible
curriculum? How will you change a school so that it delivers a high
standard of
education?</div><a name="1001205000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> I do not think that it is the role or
responsibility of local government to change a school. My role is to
consider a complaint that is presented to the commission after it has
been properly considered by the school and the governing body. My
concern would be to see if there was any evidence that the guarantee
had not been fulfilled. I would rely on evidence. I
will  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>go a step further and say that I would look for any individual injustice
arising from any action of the school that may fall short of the
guarantee.</div><a name="1001205000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
determining whether or not I proceed to investigate, evidence is
extremely important. If I conclude that there is evidence that the
guarantee has not been fulfilled, I recommend to the school that it
consider how that guarantee should be fulfilled. As you rightly point
out, it is a recommendation&#151;I cannot enforce it&#151;but
I think by virtue of making that recommendation, I highlight
the issues on which I feel that the school has fallen short in respect
of fulfilling the guarantee.</div>
<a name="1001205000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you rightly
point out, it is a recommendation&#151;I cannot enforce it&#151;but
by virtue of making that recommendation, I would highlight the issues I
feel that the school has fallen short of in fulfilling that guarantee.
It is then for the school to decide how it should proceed. So a wider
issue may flow from that
recommendation.</div><a name="1001205000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000246"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> What you said is that when the school has been
complained about&#151;that it is providing a standard of education
that does not fulfil the guarantee&#151;at the end of that whole
lengthy and probably costly procedure, you would ask the school to
consider how it should fulfil the guarantee. Is that not just a
complete waste of
time?</div><a name="1001205000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> I am making a recommendation, in which I
would identify the areas where the guarantee had not been fulfilled and
ask the school to fulfil it. I think certain specifics as to how the
guarantee should be fulfilled may in part be contained in my
recommendation, but ultimately it is the school&#146;s action that
determines the next
step.</div><a name="1001205000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><a name="1001205000247"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): Could you compare that with, for
example, when you take up cases of a complaint of maladministration in
local government and the impact of your recommendations
there?</div><a name="1001205000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> Regarding the impact of
recommendations on local government, we have been the
ombudsman in that domain for some 36 years. We find
that our recommendations are implemented almost to the full&#151;in
excess of 99 per cent. In those areas, and it depends very much on the
complaint, we may advocate good practice on how a particular complaint
should be resolved, so that there is an opportunity to ensure that
there is no recurrence of that particular type of fault. It may be that
that sort of recommendation could be made in the case of a school as
well. We are practised in understanding the nature of fault and how it
can be rectified, and we will be careful and cautious about
understanding the schools well in effecting any
recommendations.</div><a name="1001205000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000248"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Therefore, in relation to your many years&#146;
experience in dealing with complaints against a local authority, you
think that the course of action the local government ombudsman takes
can also be applied to complaints about the guarantees in
schools.</div><a name="1001205000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> I think the principles that underlie our
existing local government ombudsman operation could be
applied.</div><a name="1001205000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000249"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> As we have started off with the ombudsman issue, may
I continue in that vein? I wanted to check, Mr. Redmond, how
confident you are that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>you will be able to make judgments on whether the guarantees have been
delivered. I do not know whether you have in front of you the original
White Paper that lists the guarantees. On page 98, some of the pupil
guarantees are listed. I want to draw your attention to No. 5 in the
list, which states
that</div><a name="1001205000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every
11-14 year-old enjoys relevant and challenging learning in all subjects
and develops their personal, learning and thinking skills so that they
have strong foundations to make their 14-19
choices.&#148;</div><a name="1001205000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I was a parent who felt that guarantee had not been delivered, do you
think you would find it difficult to make a judgment as to whether it
had been delivered in
practice?</div><a name="1001205000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> Yes. In response to that question, I go back
in the first instance to say that it is extremely important that our
conclusions are evidence-based. Therefore I would look at what evidence
was available to support the complainant&#146;s
arguments.</div><a name="1001205000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we are conscious of the need to ensure that we have the expertise,
experience and knowledge of the sector to be able to make judgments on
such matters, and we would certainly ensure that that is the case.
Having said that, we are also conscious of the fact that in terms of
curriculum and teaching, some of those things might step outside the
jurisdiction of the ombudsman, and we would be conscious of how we
proceeded in dealing with those.</div>
<a name="1001205000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Basically, our
principal concern is to ensure that when we carry out an investigation,
we look at what evidence is available. We will not conclude an
investigation and reach a finding if there is no evidence to support
the
complaint.</div><a name="1001205000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000250"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you think that the guarantees are drawn with
sufficient clarity that you will know what they are supposed to mean? I
do not think I would know what that guarantee is supposed to
mean.</div><a name="1001205000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> It is not for me to talk about the
guarantees and how they are drafted. However, we will be careful in
interpreting and applying the ombudsman principles to this particular
type of complaint. I can only reiterate that it is a combination of,
first, establishing whether there is any evidence to support the
complaint and, secondly, whether any personal injustice is suffered by
the individual who is making the complaint or by the parent on behalf
of the
child.</div><a name="1001205000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000251"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Have you estimated how many additional staff and how
much additional expenditure you will need to police the
guarantees?</div><a name="1001205000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> We are in continuing discussions with the
DCSF about the funding for this particular arrangement. Initially, it
will be by virtue of a pilot arrangement, which commences in
April&#151;sorry, the existing provision under the Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. If the Bill becomes law, we
would have to go back and consider whether there were additional
requirements associated specifically with the Children, Schools and
Families
Bill.</div><a name="1001205000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000252"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> But you have not done any
costings.</div><a name="1001205000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> We have not done any particular estimates as
yet, but there are provisions within the existing legislation that we
are required to consider and which are related in some part to the
guarantees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="1001205000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><a name="1001205000253"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): May I ask any of the panel if
they would like to see something in the Bill that is not there at the
moment, or see something clarified in the Bill, that would help some of
the schools in my constituency? As far as parent participation is
concerned, 95 per cent. of the children in three of my primary schools
entered school with not a word of English&#151;they all spoke
Punjabi&#151;and there is a senior school where it is up to 75 per
cent. Thus, that senior school had only three parents visiting an open
night. Can any of you suggest anything that would help parents, schools
and children in my constituency, where there is a lack of English and a
lack of knowledge of
education?</div><a name="1001205000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> I refer to my previous answer. Your
point, Mrs. Cryer, is not something that should be in a
Bill. It is something that schools should do, but it, like so much of
this, should not be in a Bill. If we were to have something around the
guarantees in this sort of area, it would be just one more thing that
made things difficult and another hoop for schools to jump
through.</div><a name="1001205000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the Committee would consider some guarantees on the
other side of the fence&#151;the guarantee that the Government will
provide sufficient funding for schools to carry out such things, or for
adequate facilities or decent buildings, or teachers well enough paid
to stop them going into the City. All those kinds of things could give
a more balanced
guarantee.</div><a name="1001205000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000254"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mrs. Cryer, your question has
triggered interest among all the
witnesses.</div><a name="1001205000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Katherine Rake:</b></i> You have put your finger on a very
important point, which is making sure that there is sensible
entitlement. It is a very important principle and one that we very much
welcome being embodied in the Bill and that is realisable in reality.
Different families have different barriers in getting to it, so
sensible entitlement is particularly important for disadvantaged and
marginalised families who would not otherwise interact with the school.
Our view very much is that for this to become a reality, that for all
parents, especially those most in need, you need provision of outreach
services or parent contact services appropriate to all those different
cultures, in order to support that entitlement. The principle is
absolutely right and particularly pertinent in the kinds of schools you
are describing, but to make the principle a reality, we need a suite of
services to support particularly disadvantaged
families.</div><a name="1001205000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> In answer to the question, it is right that
what the Bill is trying to do is to keep this at a very high level in
terms of ambitions around the guarantees. We believe that it is right
and proper for the state to set out what parent and pupil entitlements
and guarantees should be. We recognise that getting the wording
absolutely correct around such issues is fraught with difficulty, to
avoid vexatious and frivolous litigation. We know that is important,
but I do not think it should be a barrier stopping us going forward
with something that will articulate for the first time what the state
education system
provides.</div><a name="1001205000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the provisions put forward in the guarantees, schools are delivering
already&#151;they look like a long and daunting list, but very few
are new. What you are asking about is something that is part of the
issue of accessing entitlements. That has to be looked at. What the
guarantees should drive is a focus on particular areas of entitlement
that at the moment people feel 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>frustrated about not being able to access. It is an issue that has to be
picked up, but I would argue very strongly that it did not go on the
face of the
Bill.</div><a name="1001205000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with John Dunford, however, that one of the things that we think
is a missed opportunity in this Bill is to actually put forward a work
force guarantee that gives them rights and entitlements in terms of
providing the highest standards of education for every child. A great
deal has been done in the last 12 years around the work force, and we
think that it would have been very useful to state that guarantee to
the work force as
well.</div><a name="1001205000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> Having been through the process of
assisting a very small, private Sikh school, which was set up in my
borough to serve the Punjabi community, and having seen it develop into
a very large and exceptionally successful state Sikh faith
school&#151;the first one in the UK&#151;I have seen that the key
factor was the ability of those leading the school and involved in its
development to determine their own future. That is a school that now
ticks all the boxes and hits all the targets when it comes to both
results&#151;Every Child Matters&#151;and any element of target
that might be imposed upon it. But it has a very distinctive character
that has evolved in the light of the needs of that specific community.
So I think the key thing, coming back to John Dunford&#146;s point,
is that it is probably not something that should feature in a Bill. In
a sense, it is almost the absence of prescription that has allowed that
school to flourish in the way that it does
today.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><a name="1001205000255"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): This is a
question for David Simmonds. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State
suggested that there were 70,000 home-educated children, by the
Government&#146;s best estimate. According to the Government&#146;s
impact assessment on home education, the one-off costs for 70,000 would
amount to around &#163;100 million to set up the licensing
bureaucracy, and thereafter upwards of &#163;50 million a year. If
that is implemented, for the next decade it would cost about
&#163;500 million to put in place a licensing bureaucracy, with no
additional resource whatever for actual educational support. Given the
constraints on public finances at the moment, do you think that it is,
first, a good use of money and, secondly, that it might not lead to the
redirection of funding from children who are currently in need and not
being protected educationally or in welfare terms, and in fact lead to
the setting up of this licensing system?</div>
<a name="1001205000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I could not agree that it is a good use of
public money to spend that sort of figure on bureaucracy. From the
perspective of local government, the key issue for us when it comes to
home education is that there are responsibilities that sit with me as a
statutory lead member, and with the local authority. At present we have
a large body&#151;the county of Lancashire, which has the largest
number of home-educated children of any local authority
area&#151;where home education is a good and successful practice. We
also have a significant hard core where home education is used as a
smokescreen for real problems at home. When it comes to addressing the
challenge, the issue is not so much a regulatory framework for home
education in the round, but around beefing up the capacity of local
authorities, which are currently barred from access to homes&#151;I
can speak from personal experience of cases when this has cropped
up&#151;to ensure that children are safe and enjoying the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>appropriate state of well-being, which they should, so half a billion
pounds on regulation is not a good use of money in my
view.</div>
<a name="1001205000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000256"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> In their impact assessment, the Government say
that the figures for the number of children in home education who may
not be receiving a proper education are based on local authority
information. They say that it is 20 per cent., which is not what the
local authority information says. I wonder whether you could comment on
that. Had you made any assessment of the benefits that they claim in
the impact assessment, which, according to a statistician in the
information that I have received, says that they have effectively
double-counted? They have taken both the lifetime benefit for the whole
population of home-educated children as it stands now, and then taken
the percentage of all those in future years, which is statistically
completely unsound and means that they have effectively double-counted
the benefits. Can you comment on that?</div>
<a name="1001205000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I think we understand well that parents
choose home education for good reasons most of the time. It is not
possible for me to comment on the likely financial benefit or other
long-term consequence, but we know that when home-educated children
take their exams, a significant number perform extremely well, which
implies that they have received good education. The outstanding issue
will always be from a local government perspective, but it is not a
problem of home education in the round, but of a small number of
hard-core families. In the case of Khyra Ishaq in Birmingham, when
education and welfare officers were refused access to the home on the
grounds that the child was being home educated, it subsequently emerged
that that was the place where serious and prolonged abuse had
ultimately led to that child&#146;s death. In my view, we cannot
allow the situation to continue when we, as local authorities, are
responsible for ensuring a good education, but do not have the ability
to intervene in hard-core
problems.</div><a name="1001205000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000257"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> In the Khyra Ishaq case, the failure was of
following procedure by the local authorities. There was absolutely no
lack of powers, and suggesting that home education was an effective
barrier to the local authority doing its job would not be fair. The
Children&#146;s Commission told the Select Committee precisely that,
and it was wrong, too. Khyra Ishaq is not a case of the child being
below the radar because of home education. In fact, there were plenty
of signals on which the local authority did not act, nor did it use the
powers that it actually had. Can you confirm
that?</div><a name="1001205000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I have spoken to colleagues about the
issue, and on the information that I have, I can say from personal
experience of a case that I have had to deal with in my borough that it
is quite often a barrier, particularly when there are first warning
signals and the family indicate to staff that they are home educating
the child and say, &#147;No, you can&#146;t see the home. No, you
can&#146;t see the child. No, you aren&#146;t allowed in.&#148;
The local authority does not have powers unless there is some other
justification that tends not to emerge until later, such as welfare
grounds.</div><a name="1001205000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000258"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> What would you suggest is the best way forward? On
Second Reading, Front-Bench spokespeople from all parties indicated
that there had to be some updating or improvement of the present
regulations. What do you recommend?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="1001205000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> The recommendations in the Badman report
have some merit, but the key factor is that the Government
cannot have it both ways, whereby the local authority is responsible
for ensuring that the  child is getting an education, but lacks
the powers to ensure that that is happening. We should either
lose  the responsibility or we should gain the powers. At the
moment, the issue is cited frequently by local authorities as a cause
of concern in that hard core where there is a
problem.</div><a name="1001205000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000259"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Tony Redmond, have you done scenario planning with
the Department for Children, Schools and Families in the sense of
looking at the guarantees about the different types of case that might
come forward? I have always found as an MP and a Minister that looking
at different scenarios that could emerge and how we could deal with
them is helpful in seeing how the law would be applied or implemented
on the ground. Have you done any of that work so far, based on the
guarantees?</div><a name="1001205000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> Yes, we have. We spent a considerable number
of hours talking to our colleagues in DCSF to examine the different
aspects of the guarantees, in a sense to test them as to how we could
proceed in certain circumstances. We continue to do that, and I
recognise too that if indeed the measure does become law, we shall have
to continue to work with schools and representatives of schools to
understand the nature of the work that is going on in schools. We are
very conscious of its being a new jurisdiction for the ombudsman. Yes,
we have already looked at different types of case on a number of
occasions.</div><a name="1001205000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000260"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Chris Keates, you said in answer to a question that
most schools were delivering the guarantees already. That is very
welcome, but given that it might be just a way of formalising what we
should expect in raising good practice, and if schools are already
providing it, why would they need extra resources?</div>
<a name="1001205000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> Well, I did not raise the issue about extra
resources.</div>
<a name="1001205000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000261"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Okay. But others
have.</div><a name="1001205000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> I have not raised the issue about extra
resources because what we are doing at the moment is evaluating and
looking through exactly what is on the face of the guarantees. The
schools cover a vast proportion of what is in that list of
guarantees.</div><a name="1001205000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue will be the detail that underpins the high aspirations and
ambitions of the Bill; that is where the detail will come
in&#151;about what the expectations will be. We are keen to ensure
that concerns about bureaucratic burdens and paperwork, which will of
course have a resource implication for schools, are carefully looked
at. It is difficult to quantify at the moment whether it is
automatically a matter of extra resources when you do not know the
underpinning detail or how the measure would be put in place in
schools. That matter will come in probably around issues such as the
complaints procedures that we have heard examined in earlier
questions.</div><a name="1001205000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a teacher trade union, we would always argue to make sure that schools
have resources to enable them  to fulfil any responsibilities
that are placed on them. The argument about resources would start to be
devalued 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>if every time something new comes in, the immediate idea is that it will
need additional resource. For some things, it sometimes generates some
bureaucracy and additionality, because people see it as an add-on,
rather than looking at the systems they have. We would therefore argue
that we look carefully once we see more detail on the matter. There
should be minimum impact on schools from the point of view of their
having additional
work.</div><a name="1001205000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><a name="1001205000262"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): Mr.
Simmonds, I wonder if I could seek some clarification on the local
authorities&#146; responsibility for the education of a child. My
colleagues on this Committee have provided me with some information.
Most of us have received quite a lot of lobbying, which suggests that
it is parents&#146; responsibility, not the local
authorities&#146;. Can you state clearly on what grounds you feel
that a local authority has the overriding
responsibility?</div><a name="1001205000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I am not a legislative expert or a lawyer,
so if you ask me to direct you to a relevant paragraph in a relevant
Bill, I would struggle with that. However, it is clear that local
authorities have a statutory duty to secure the education of all
children in their area, which has been backed up by a subsequent
statutory duty to secure appropriate services at nursery level for
children.</div><a name="1001205000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000263"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No, they do
not.</div><a name="1001205000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I can see that Mr. Stuart
disagrees with that point. The information that I have has been
absolutely consistent and, as I understand it, well enshrined in the
legal responsibilities of a local authority. Should the Committee wish
to have a constitutional lawyer in front of it and ask them to unravel
that conundrum, that is the only way I can suggest you
proceed&#151;if you
disagree.</div><a name="1001205000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000264"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The elective home education guidelines for local
authorities produced by the DCSF lay out clearly and precisely in
non-statutory form that local authorities do not have that overriding
duty; it is parents who do.</div>
<a name="1001205000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000265"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> What I wanted to ask was whether it would be
possible for you to give a note of the LGA&#146;s understanding of
that particular point and which statute it relates to. I do not want to
put you on the spot, but we really could do with knowing the
LGA&#146;s
position.</div><a name="1001205000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> I would be happy to clarify that. The only
observation I would make is that it would not be the first time that
there was a contradiction between statute and guidelines. Guidelines
are often not reflective of what the law says, and the courts may take
a different view when it comes down to
it.</div><a name="1001205000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000266"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It would be really helpful if we could have that
clarification. I wanted to pursue this matter a little further. The
concept of registration has upset a large number of people, and there
is a difficult balance affecting large numbers of people for the sake
of a few. Obviously, the few are very important, but we are looking at
whether it is safeguarding our education. Do you think that the
registration with all the strings attached&#151;I mean the sticks,
rather than the carrots&#151;will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>be very cumbersome to implement, for example, in determining whether an
efficient and suitable education is being

balance, in terms of making sure that responsible authorities are aware
of where children are, particularly around the issues. We cannot see
why there is a real problem about registration, provided it is
proportionate and a fit-for-purpose process. We probably have a
slightly unpopular view of home education, in that we think we have
missed the opportunity to have a debate about whether it is appropriate
in a modern school education system. We have no objections in principle
to registration&#151;or the monitoring&#151;provided that it is
proportionate and fit for purpose. I would like to support my colleague
in that it may be the wording that is wrong, but some of the provisions
in the various Education Acts for local authorities&#146; duties
place on them that direct responsibility for the welfare of people, as
well as the issues around education, so I think it is a case of looking
at the appropriate parts of the legislation. There are things that
place specific duties on local
authorities.</div><a name="1001205000099"></a>

probably sub judice, so we had better not explore it. However, on that

It is important that the framework is not just included as something

about making sure that those children are part of the general framework
of safeguarding, which is good for every child, wherever they are

Flint:</b> It is probably quite difficult to get statistics on
how many home educators are abusers. I hope it is not about this. It
would be like asking how many MPs are abusers or how many teachers are
subject to serious case reviews. However, I take the point that how we
go about this must not be through taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
Getting a balance is something that I hope we can work through in
Committee.</div>
<a name="1001205000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested, Dr. Rake, in your organisation, the Family and Parenting
Institute, not having a view on this at all. Clearly, there are issues
here that colleagues are raising about the rights and engagement of
parents. In submissions that I have received on home education, one of
the asks from those who are home-educating their children is about more
capacity to get support and help for their choice in educating their
children. You are saying the Family and Parenting Institute has not
discussed this and has no view on the parenting and schooling of
children.</div>
<a name="1001205000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Katherine Rake:</b></i> It is not that we have not discussed
it. We build our policy from a research and evidence base and we do not
have a research and evidence base on this particular issue, so I feel
it is not appropriate for us to comment without that evidence base. We
represent families right across the UK, and obviously most families are
engaged in the school system. I am here to talk about pupil-parent
guarantees and family perspectives on home-school agreements. We build
as much policy as we can based on the evidence that we have. We do not,
as has been reflected in the debate, have a full evidence base on this
issue.</div>
<a name="1001205000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000273"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> May I move on to home-school agreements and ask a
couple of questions about them? The Government are seeking to introduce
clauses in the Bill because they say that the agreements are not being
used as effectively as they might be. I visited a school in my
constituency recently, where it was clear that until very recently the
head teacher&#151;I am not saying it is his fault&#151;was not even
aware that he could use parenting orders. Perhaps David and some
representatives from John&#146;s
organisation&#151;Chris&#151;could answer why, given that there are
already powers for head teachers and schools to use parenting orders,
they are not being used. Why not? Why are not teachers in every local
authority getting the right sort of advice, whether it is from the
local authority through guidance from the LGA or through head teachers
about how they can effectively use the powers?</div>
<a name="1001205000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> A brief response from me. The Local
Government Association has always taken the view that it is for the
management team and the governors of a school to use all the things at
their disposal to decide the best way to manage a particular
relationship. There are times when a school may feel that going down
the route of parenting orders is appropriate, if that is a way of
addressing particular concerns about an individual child. But I do not
think we would wish to be prescriptive and say, &#147;This is what
you must do&#148;, as opposed to a number of the other interventions
that you might put in. While home-school agreements are a good idea, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>schools operate a number of different local arrangements, which, in my
experience, have been by and large pretty effective.</div>
<a name="1001205000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> In answer to Caroline Flint&#146;s
question, head teachers tell me that the relationship between the
school and the parent is very much a human relationship. You want to
avoid, if you possibly can, trying to sort out that human relationship
in a court through parenting orders. Fundamentally, head teachers will
do everything they can to avoid going to court, because they think that
that will in the end make the relationship with the parent more
difficult, which makes the situation with the pupil in the school more
difficult. Therefore you try and you go on trying to sort out that
relationship, always with the pupil as the focus.</div>
<a name="1001205000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome the
Government&#146;s trying to beef up home-school agreements. We
particularly welcome the emphasis on the responsibilities of parents to
support the discipline of the school, because we have always felt that
there was not a good balance between rights and responsibilities. But
at the end of the day, a home-school agreement is a piece of paper.
When I, as a head teacher, am dealing with a child who has been
excluded, whose parent believes only their side of the story, I am
afraid that waving that piece of paper at them in the readmission
interview of the child&#151;reminding them what they signed four or
five years earlier&#151;is not necessarily going to solve the
problem. But we do welcome the provisions&#151;I do not want to
undermine the attempt to strengthen the discipline of the school in
this
respect.</div><a name="1001205000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000274"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> But you almost contradict yourself, John, if I may
say so. My concern is not about everyone running to issue a parenting
order at the first sign of lack of support from a parent. I think you
are right; I think most schools go through that. I am worried about
teachers and head teachers in the school community not feeling
confident about how they would go about pursuing a parenting order, and
what shape the order might take, as they can vary enormously depending
on the family, and, in extreme circumstances, could be a spur to
bringing in needed support for that
family.</div><a name="1001205000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Your
final point was about having a home-school agreement&#151;a piece of
paper&#151;and then waving it around. The Bill is partly attempting
to tighten up and improve. Therefore, effective action can be taken.
Cases where things often have been tried and are just not working, and
are having a huge displacement effect on other children in the school
community, are in the
minority.</div><a name="1001205000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> We would see this in the context of
wider support for the child, which the local authority and the
children&#146;s trust should be promoting&#151;a better, joined-up
service to support children who are in those difficulties. If the
parenting order is one part of that, then we would look to the local
authority to give guidance and help head teachers, so that they can use
a parenting order to improve a particular situation. That, however,
will not be in isolation from the other services that are being
provided to that
family.</div><a name="1001205000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><a name="1001205000275"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): In your
memorandum to the Committee, Miss Keates, you say that you remain to be
convinced of the need for parental satisfaction surveys. Why is that
your position?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="1001205000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> We are sympathetic with finding ways to
ensure that local authorities take a lead role in looking at the
quality of the provision within their areas. We can see the purpose
behind parental satisfaction surveys, but we are concerned about how
they will operate in practice and how safeguards will be put in place
to ensure that we do not have, for example, local authorities having to
produce plans about provision in their area with a low threshold of
parent
participation.</div><a name="1001205000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
us, a number of safeguards need to be built into the surveys. First, we
think that there has to be consistency of approach in how local
authorities conduct them. The threshold needs to be on the face of the
Bill rather than in regulation. There should be a high level threshold
of participation before it triggers a plan&#151;we would say
50 per cent.-plus of parents entitled to participate in that
survey.</div>
<a name="1001205000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">There must
also be safeguards on the questionnaires in terms of access through the
Freedom of Information Act 2000. In the pilots, the questionnaires have
been used by people to give individual comments about individual
schools, and it is important that local and national media, which we
think will have an interest in such issues, whatever the level of
participation of parents, are not able to identify individual
schools.</div><a name="1001205000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
could also be a series of unintended consequences from the
participation surveys if used, particularly by lobby groups and
organisations interested in the nature of provision in a particular
area, to lobby parents in a particular way. Instinctively, we feel that
many local authorities have a whole variety of ways to consult their
constituents on provision. While we are sympathetic to trying to get
something that requires that to be done, we remain to be convinced that
this is the best way.</div>
<a name="1001205000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> May I support Chris Keates on that? I
am all in favour of doing parent surveys, and schools now do them
widely with parents whose children attend their school. However, the
suggestion is to survey parents about the quality of schools that their
children do not yet attend, and that is like asking a customer to grade
a restaurant before they have eaten the meal. I am sceptical about the
value of the information that the surveys will
produce.</div><a name="1001205000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000276"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> Chris, a new clause is being proposed to the Bill
about the conduct of madrassas and Christian religious information or
education establishments outside the mainstream of schools. It is about
child protection. Do your members complain that they have a problem
with discipline in state schools because, perhaps, the majority of
children attend another religious school where, to put it mildly,
discipline is sometimes a bit heavy-handed so the kids feel that the
teachers at the state school are a soft touch? Have you ever
experienced anything like that among your
members?</div><a name="1001205000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> I have experienced that. I cannot say that it
has been on a wide scale. I cannot say that we have experienced it
recently, and that is probably because local authorities are now far
more interventionist in safeguarding the provisions that have been
brought into place. Quite a few years ago, it would have been something
that our members might raise, particularly those working in some larger
cities. I cannot say that we have had a recent case. Some matters have
been about the role taken by local authorities in safeguarding pupils
and the relationships that they have developed with the organisations
that you described.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000277"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Can I return to home-school agreements generally? In
the briefings that the Association of School and College Leaders sent,
John, you said that it was unrealistic to require home-school
agreements to be personalised for each individual, and that that would
be wholly impracticable in secondary
schools.</div><a name="1001205000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chris
Keates, you said that your union was concerned about the potential for
the agreements to become hugely bureaucratic. Will both union leaders
expand their views on
that?</div><a name="1001205000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> It seems that clause 4(8) calls on the
head teacher to review the home-school agreement at least once a year.
My understanding is that the Government intend the home-school
agreement to be personalised to an extent. A requirement that the
home-school agreement should be personalised seems to place an
impossible task on a secondary school with 1,500
pupils.</div><a name="1001205000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
a home-school agreement sets out the ethos of the school to parents,
and to which parents should sign up. It is not a matter of negotiation
between the school and the parent or the school and the pupil. I
expressed our concern in the briefing in one sense to obtain greater
clarity about exactly the extent to which personalisation is required.
If it is, we would have to oppose it on sheer work load
grounds.</div><a name="1001205000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> The current system for home-school agreements
has fallen into disrepute and the Bill starts to give some teeth to
home-school agreements, particularly our link with magistrates courts
and parenting orders. Ours is a similar point to that made by John.
There is talk in the provisions as they are drafted about the fact that
they may be personalised or may be reviewed annually. We would like
some clarity about what that would mean in practice. Clearly, there are
huge implications. If every single agreement is to be personalised, it
would be better if the school was able to use its discretion to add
something on for a particular pupil, having stated the basic standards
that the school expects. That might be part of the whole programme that
it had with the pupil. We would welcome that kind of
discretion.</div><a name="1001205000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue that concerned us was the words &#147;may be reviewed
annually&#148;. Our view is, yes, build in an annual review, but not
an actual requirement whereby people go through every home-school
agreement. It may be that we want to prompt a review of the agreement
when circumstances change for a particular child or family, and the
school actually knows that. For us, it will be what those intentions
are at the moment. The provisions are not prescriptive, but if the
intention is that they should become so, we believe that significant
additional work and bureaucracy could be imposed  on
schools.</div><a name="1001205000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000278"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> May I ask both union leaders their estimate of what
the costs might be? The impact assessment says that the additional
costs will be mainly transitional, in the sense of changing the
home-school agreement templates, but it seems to imply that the cost to
the school of reviewing and making the agreements bespoke for every
child will be zero. Do you have a feel for what the cost will be if the
agreements are bespoke and reviewed annually?</div>
<a name="1001205000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could you also
talk about the licence to practise? What are the views of your unions
on both those subjects?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="1001205000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> I do not have a figure for the cost
because it would largely be the time of senior staff in the school. As
I say, in large schools, that would be
massive.</div><a name="1001205000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have set out the licence to practise as something that would
help to give a status to the teaching profession, rather like doctors,
for example, but doctors and other professionals work in very small
groups. What we have done for teachers&#151;Chris Keates and I have
both put a lot of work into the development of this in recent
years&#151;is to establish a new performance management structure
allied very closely to continuing professional development. That will
provide over time all the guarantee that parents want that teachers are
up to date. On the one hand, you have performance management allied to
professional development. On the other hand, you have a capability
process&#151;there has been some debate recently about whether it
should be strengthened, but the process is there&#151;to deal with
teachers who are not competent. You do not have any of those things for
doctors or architects, other than the big bang of going to the General
Medical Council or whatever the equivalents are. At ground level, we
have these things in schools. Therefore, what value does a licence to
practise add, over and above performance management, CPD and capability
proceedings, which are all
extant?</div><a name="1001205000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> First, I agree with John. I think the massive
cost would be in time. There would obviously be some administrative
costs, which are difficult to quantify, but again, that would depend on
the system that was brought in.</div>
<a name="1001205000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
around the licence to practise has been quite unfortunate. The NASUWT
has opposed the introduction of the licence to practise, basically
because of concern in the profession about how it might be portrayed in
the media. It has basically been described as some sort of tool to root
out ineffective teachers, as an MOT and as various things that have
caused concern, and done so in the context that John has articulated.
At the moment, teachers and head teachers are subject to rigorous
procedures, including Ofsted, professional standards, performance
management, capability and disciplinary procedures and GTC regulation,
so we do not want another layer of regulation that is going to usurp
those procedures. As John says, we have reached agreement on a
detailed, rigorous and robust performance management
process.</div><a name="1001205000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have set out, in our briefing note, our view that if the Government are
to proceed with the licence to practise, it must not be seen as some
tool to tackle incompetence, with the implication that there are
thousands of teachers out there who are incompetent. That is not
correct. There is the point about placing no additional requirements on
teachers and head teachers. The medical licence to practise covers
doctors wherever they practise medicine, so if the teaching licence is
to be aligned to that, it would apply to teachers and head teachers in
both the state and the independent sectors. You do not have a medical

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000279"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Can I ask David Simmonds about the parental
satisfaction survey? As I interpret it, it is about influencing local
authorities and enabling them to be seen to be listening to views about
what choice is available. I do not see it as a battering ram to use
against individual schools. In a certain area, parents might want an
academy, a different type of specialist school or more diversity of
faith schools. Is that your understanding of what it is an attempt to
do&#151;to help the local authority better plan provision?</div>
<a name="1001205000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">How do you see
the surveys working? Do you think that it is appropriate that they
should be only for parents whose children have yet to enter secondary
school, for example, or should the views of parents of children in
years 7 and 8 be sought? Also, how do you think a local authority might
deal with the fact that those who return any questionnaire often tend
to be more confident and educated? Do you see a role for sampling, for
example, across different communities in a local education authority to
ensure that the response is robust and reflects the views of parents
with different levels of
confidence?</div><a name="1001205000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> There are a number of points in the
question. The key satisfaction survey, from my perspective, is the one
that will happen, in my case, in May this year: an election. That is an
opportunity for everyone who lives in the area and is entitled to vote
to express their view of the performance of the local authority. If
people are concerned about education, they will have the opportunity to
express that concern at the ballot box and, if necessary, to change the
people in charge of
it.</div><a name="1001205000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000280"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I respect that, but there are always a lot of other
issues, such as the bins being emptied. I am specifically discussing a
tool to involve parents in the planning for choice of schools in their
local area, which sometimes needs a more refined and prioritised
approach.</div><a name="1001205000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Simmonds:</b></i> To continue with the other points that you
raised, electoral accountability is key. When it comes to planning for
provision and the operation of the surveys, my question and challenge
for the Committee is what the Government seek to achieve through the
process. As a local authority, we have an inspection regime and a
residents&#146; satisfaction survey, which includes specific
questions about satisfaction with schools by category and a question
about whether people have a child attending school. The information is
already gathered through that process, which is carried out
independently of the local authority by
MORI.</div><a name="1001205000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
now have a statutory duty to prepare a plan for the children and
families trust, which involves an extensive process of consultation
with schools, parents and specific categories&#151;you mentioned
years 7 and 8&#151;such as special educational needs. A variety of
different categories of family are invited to express their view. That
then feeds into the plan, which is designed to inform the future shape
of the education provision within the local authority area. Schools
themselves then carry out a number of different satisfaction
surveys.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="1001205000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
perspective, if there is to be an additional satisfaction survey over
and above all those things, the key point is to minimise the
bureaucratic burden that it will create. Ideally, it would be done as
part of the school admissions round, if we are to do it at all. Rather
than asking parents to fill out umpteen sets of separate surveys, they
should do so through one clear and simple process when the mind is
focused on what is available in the way of educational
provision.</div>
<a name="1001205000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming back to
the point about children&#146;s trusts, every area has a
children&#146;s trust. That trust has various duties, and one of
those is drawing up that plan in consultation. I do not quite see the
value added from having an additional requirement to prepare a separate
plan in response to the results of another survey, over and above the
plans already being prepared in response to the existing
mechanisms.</div>
<a name="1001205000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000281"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have only five minutes left, so I ask my
colleagues to ask quick questions and our witnesses to provide brief
answers.</div>
<a name="1001205000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000282"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I have two relatively brief questions. I return to
both John and Chris and the additional bureaucratic burdens that will
be imposed by the Bill. We have discussed the many parts of the Bill
that concern you because of their bureaucracy. If, having listened to
you today, Vernon was suddenly to decide that he would concede two bits
of the Bill that you particularly disliked and wanted him to drop
because of their bureaucratic effect, which bits would you suggest he
drop?</div><a name="1001205000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> The guarantees and the licence to
practice.</div><a name="1001205000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> You are restricting me to bureaucratic
burdens, but I would rather drop any bits that exempt academies from
registering with the Charity Commission. To a certain extent, it is not
a particularly fair question. A lot of the evidence that I have given
on some parts  of the Bill are to do with the fact that the way
it is implemented is going to determine whether it is bureaucratic. We
must not confuse bureaucracy with unnecessary bureaucracy, because you
are always going to get some bureaucracy. It is a bureaucratic process,
and I assume that you all believe that it is a good process to
have.</div>
<a name="1001205000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it is
the licence to practice. If there was anything in the Bill that we
would say, do we need to go forward with that now, I would say the
licence to practice. But if it was implemented in the way that we set
out, it should not provide any more bureaucracy for schools at all; it
should be seen as transition from performance
management.</div>
<a name="1001205000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000283"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I have one other question, which might stir you both
up a bit&#151;if you need that. We have discussed the licence to
practice before. Head teachers around the country often say to me
privately, &#147;It is true that there are mechanisms to get rid of
teachers who aren&#146;t very good, but the truth is that they take
ages to implement; people go off sick when you are about to take action
against; and then they leave the school and appear somewhere else down
the road and do a bad job there.&#148; Are you both saying that the
existing mechanisms for dealing with teachers who are not performing
well are sufficient?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="1001205000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Chris
Keates:</b></i> I am. I don&#146;t accept that they take
too long. It shouldn&#146;t be easy to sack people. It should be a
fair and transparent and fit-for-purpose process, and I believe that we
have that in schools if it is properly used.</div>
<a name="1001205000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
issue of underperformance is, first, that it seems to be the general
view, put forward by some, that schools are rife with teachers who are
underperforming. That is not true. Secondly, there are lots of reasons
for underperformance. Some of them are inappropriate deployment, a lack
of training and being put with groups that people haven&#146;t been
trained to be put with. There are some real management issues around
that.</div><a name="1001205000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting
down to the hard core of competency, the procedure in place has been
reformed three times by the current Government. It has been changed
three times. In fact, it became known in the profession last time as
the fast track to the sack. You need to be wary of those few people who
will tell you that it is too hard for them to sack people. What you
have to ask them is have they started the process, have they looked at
the reasons and have they been using performance management
appropriately.</div>
<a name="1001205000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000284"></a>The
Chairman:</b> John, there are two minutes left. The Minister
has not yet had an opportunity.</div>
<a name="1001205000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000285"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Ten seconds from
John?</div><a name="1001205000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
John Dunford:</b></i> I disagree with Chris. Head teachers
would welcome the opportunity to have a look; it is not education law
but mostly employment law. We have to follow the law when we are
dismissing people, and that is absolutely right. But we would like to
look to see whether the process could be made more
expedient.</div>
<a name="1001205000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="1001205000286"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I have tried to keep out of this, because people
obviously know what I think; I wished to give everyone else the
opportunity of asking questions. I thank the witnesses for coming here
and for the evidence that they have given.</div>
<a name="1001205000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
question for Tony. I wish to be clear about complaints. As John said,
for most of the time one would expect the school to sort out particular
problems that parents may have about the guarantee. The local
government ombudsman has the ability not to investigate something if he
believes that it would be vexatious. That is correct, is it
not?</div><a name="1001205000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Redmond:</b></i> That is correct, yes. In terms of the
complaints that come before us, that is certainly a consideration that
we would take into account in determining whether to
proceed.</div>
<a name="1001205000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000287"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Just to echo the Minister&#146;s words, I
thank the witnesses for their time and the way in which they have dealt
with our questions. May I now ask for the next set of witnesses to join
us?</div><a name="1001205000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.2

Chairman:</b> I welcome our witnesses. You have been in the
Gallery listening to the previous session. Just to remind everyone, an
hour passes very quickly, and all colleagues seem to have many
questions that they want to ask our witnesses. Again, I appeal for
brief questions and fairly brief answers. Witnesses, will you introduce
yourselves and make a comment on the Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="1001205000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mary Bousted:</b></i> Hello. I am general secretary of the
Association of Teachers and Lecturers. In general terms, we are quite
relaxed about many of the provisions in the Bill. It is the
implementation of the provisions that we are concerned about and want
to ensure that it is done properly.</div>
<a name="1001205000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001205000289"></a>The

yourself?</div><a name="1001205000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> I beg your pardon. Mick Brookes, general
secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers.</div><a name="1001205000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background of this is that we are already down to fewer than three
applicants per primary school, special school and early years school.
It is slightly better than that in secondary. We are concerned that the
bureaucracy involved in the implementation of this Bill will further
deter people from applying to be heads. With a large number of
colleagues about to leave the profession, we need to ensure that there
is less bureaucracy and not more.</div>
<a name="1001205000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Birkett:</b></i> Hello. Pete Birkett, principal and chief
executive of Barnfield college in Luton. We were the first FE sponsor
of two academies in the country. We sponsored them on 1 September 2007
and doubled and tripled the results in that period of time. We support
the Bill because of the guarantees underpinned by excellent teaching
and learning that culminate in success and are summarised in a simple
grade that parents can
understand.</div><a name="1001205000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> My role is chief executive for the Harris
Federation of South London Schools, a grouping of nine city academies
in south London. We welcome many aspects of the Bill such as making it
easier to establish academies and accrediting academy groups. But the
overarching thrust of the Bill is that it reduces academy freedoms; it
prescribes things that were not prescribed before and, in general for
the schools system, we believe that the guarantees and the licence to
teach are likely to be a bureaucratic
nightmare.</div><a name="10012010000001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> I am head of education, equality and
professional development at the National Union of Teachers. Overall, we
cannot see the necessity for the Bill at this time. We support aspects
of it. For example, there is an important section that was not
mentioned in the previous witness session on special educational needs,
but that could have been subsumed in a serious new Bill on special
educational needs in the new Parliament, drawing from the lessons of
the Lamb review. We do not overall see the purpose or the real pressing
importance of the Bill. There are aspects of it that we support, but
there are aspects that we really do have deep, deep concerns about:
first, the licence to practice; and secondly, the extension of the
powers to the school improvement partner, and we share the anxieties of
colleagues who gave you evidence earlier about the extension of powers
to establish
academies.</div><a name="10012010000002"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Bartley:</b></i> I am Keith Bartley, chief executive of the
General Teaching Council for England. Teachers must be encouraged and
supported to exercise informed, professional judgment that leads to
sustained improvements in learning. Although the increased emphasis on
pupil and parent involvement in learning is welcome, we have previously
raised concerns about the notion of formal guarantees. We would also
like to see a clear focus on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>measures that encourage parents and pupils to engage in ways that have a
positive impact on learning, rather than passively receiving a set of
entitlements. On the licence to practice proposals, we will scrutinise
the proposals closely to test whether they will bring real and tangible
benefits for teaching and
learning.</div><a name="10012010000003"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000102"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is an interesting comment, Mr.
Bartley, from the GTCE, which is charged, I presume, with overseeing
the licence to practise. Will all the witnesses expand a little further
on the licence to teach, starting with Mr.
Bartley?</div><a name="10012010000004"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Bartley:</b></i> Certainly. I want to make it clear that the
GTCE will implement the will of Parliament, so we will be charged with
putting into place whatever measures are set out in legislation. I see
merit in measures that support teachers to develop and improve their
practice and that confer real benefits for teaching and learning that
serve the public interest. We do not yet know whether the proposals in
the Bill will achieve those aims. That will depend importantly on the
detail of the model chosen. We are working closely with departmental
officials to provide technical advice aimed at developing a feasible,
sensible and management model. However, our council has yet to express
its view on the policy, partly because it is waiting to understand the
model that will emerge as a result of the passage of the Bill through
Parliament.</div><a name="10012010000005"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> We are opposed to the licence to practise. We
do not know where it has come from. That is not just a response from
full-time officials or executive members of the National Union of
Teachers. Two or three days ago, we delivered to the Department for
Children, Schools and Families more than 17,500 cards from teachers
saying that they were opposed to the licence to practise, as well. That
is a considerable number and the tip of an iceberg of the
profession.</div><a name="10012010000006"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why there is so much objection is that teachers are the most
accountable profession already. Colleagues in the previous witness
session identified performance management and capability procedures.
They did not mention the increased powers of local authority
intervention or, indeed, Ofsted. There are a range of accountabilities
to which teachers are now subject. I see the reason for that in many
aspects, but this is just an unnecessary addition. That said, and
separate from it, very important evidence was given by the Training and
Development Agency for Schools to the Children, Schools and Families
Committee recently that identified the amount of professional
development provision as a percentage of the school budget to
individual teachers. Some schools devoted 0.5 per cent. of their school
budget, while others went up to 14 per cent. If that is the baseline,
at least at the moment, of professional development available to
teachers, a licence to practise, even in terms of its own arguments and
efficacy, rests on a very rocky and uneven
basis.</div><a name="10012010000007"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> I have a similar reply. We are not quite
clear about the problems that this is supposed to address. I asked our
senior solicitor what number of hours he needs to have to continue his
licence to practise, and it was 15 hours. When you look at the
in-service days that teachers are already required to undertake, that
is already in excess of 30 hours&#151;so time is certainly not the
problem. Where we would be supportive is to ensure that the quality of
CPD undertaken by teachers is enhanced. However, we think that that is
addressed,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>or should be addressed, in the current performance management
arrangements, and the addition of a licence to practise is an
unnecessary piece of
bureaucracy.</div><a name="10012010000008"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> Talking about academies first, we were
originally set up with freedom to set our own terms and conditions.
This measure seems to be a major infringement of that freedom. It is
not clear to us what it will add. With existing performance management
and existing arrangements for teacher professional development, these
things could be beefed up easily by central Government. What would a
licence to teach
add?</div><a name="10012010000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
schools, when they adopt performance management, judge teachers using
the Ofsted grade criteria, which is a simple, small paragraph. Here, we
have the addition of a tick list of two pages-worth of items in the
core professional standards. I can imagine a scenario where it is
perfectly possible for a teacher, over a period of time, to demonstrate
that they have achieved each of those atomistic sentences on the tick
list. Nevertheless, when you see a lesson using the Ofsted observation
criteria, that is unsatisfactory. I can also see heads battling with
teacher union representatives when they have evidence of a lack of
capability in a teacher. What will happen is the professional
association will come back to talk about not giving the appropriate
professional development as required by the licence. There are all
sorts of
conflicts.</div><a name="10012010000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, in schools, we now have something called a rarely cover
regulation, where teachers should rarely cover. Owing to a large number
of initiatives that come from Government, most of our training days are
taken out to prepare for the initiatives. If teachers can rarely cover,
and there are no training days, it is difficult to see where the time
for all that extra professional development will come from&#151;and,
indeed, where the funding will come
from.</div><a name="10012010000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mary Bousted:</b></i> I profoundly disagree with that last
answer, as it makes a number of fundamental misconceptions. First, it
is not good practice for schools to routinely grade teachers by Ofsted
grades. Most people inform us if any schools have not been
Ofsted-trained. Just giving teachers a quick grade does not give them
anything on which to base performance and improvement. Secondly, it is
important that a licence to practise does not become bureaucratic,
which is why it is important for it to come through performance
management. Frankly, anything that will make schools address the vast
inequality in CPD provision, which John referred to&#151;the licence
to practise becomes part of an entitlement to good quality CPD, which
most of my members say is parlously poor and they do not
get&#151;could strengthen the armoury towards that. From ATL&#146;s
point of view, we are not too concerned about a licence to practise, as
long as it is rooted in and comes through the existing rigorous
performance management regulations in schools. However, I think that
the previous speaker has demonstrated a number of fundamental
misconceptions about supporting the good performance of teachers. His
attitude is bureaucratic in itself and not respectful of the
profession.</div><a name="10012010000012"></a>

34</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000104"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> To put back the proposition, one of the issues that
have already been raised in your contributions is the patchy nature of
professional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>development. Therefore, from Mary&#146;s last point, is contractual
entitlement to professional development one of the ways in which,
partly, we can&#151;it is a shame that we have to say
this&#151;raise the status of teaching as a high-value profession? We
can really pull people together, by saying, &#147;Actually, you do
should have that professional development.&#148; From all the papers
that I read and going back to my days on the Select Committee on
Education and Employment, how that professional development is
delivered is still very patchy. This sort of change is not easy, but
teaching is probably one of the few professional areas of work&#151;I
respect what you said about the differences between
professions&#151;that does not have a licence. Can anyone comment on
that?</div><a name="10012010000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Birkett:</b></i> I totally agree with what has just been
said. I consulted with the staff within the academies and talked to
them about the licensing scheme. The heart of our organisation is to
ensure that students reach their potential. We appreciate that the key
way we do that is through excellence in teaching and learning. They,
like me, support the idea of so many hours allocated per year to raise
their performance. They also appreciate that, for a number of years,
they have been asking for equal status with other professions, such as
doctors, lawyers, solicitors, etc.&#151;a similar reason why they
support it. A point made earlier was that more CPD is made available
for teachers in some organisations than in others, and this is about
spreading good practice and ensuring a minimum requirement in every
organisation, so that they can raise performance. I have also found
that teachers, when taken out of the classroom&#151;they do go
through classroom observations&#151;and do something else, which
gives them time to reflect and develop other ideas, can bring that back
into the classroom. That is why we fully support
it.</div><a name="10012010000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> I am probably too near Mary for this
comment, but my experience of 27 years as a head teacher is that there
is another side to the coin. We were zealots in providing high-quality
CPD, but sometimes the problem is getting your staff to pick it up.
There is a two-edged sword here. Certainly inside the performance
management regulations, there is a requirement that members of staff
should undertake good professional development. Getting them to go on a
course, for instance, is one thing, but getting them to assimilate what
is in there is another. So I think that there is another side to the
argument.</div><a name="10012010000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> There are two things. First, one or two people
may remember the James report of the early &#146;70s, but that was
the last time that any Government investigated teachers&#146;
professional development through an independent inquiry. We had a
professional development strategy from 2001 to 2003, which was axed at
the first whiff of a funding crisis. We do not have a comprehensive
professional development strategy for teachers in this country. There
is no reference here about a comprehensive professional development
strategy. The idea that some top-down mechanism will substitute for the
lack of a strategy is one of those wishful, bureaucratic things that
sometimes appears in Bills. It looks good and makes people feel somehow
that head teachers, just because legislation exists, will actually get

Moynihan:</b></i> We have heard the value of CPD. Anyone with
any sense in teaching would agree it is a very valuable thing. The
quality of much of the stuff on the market is quite poor, and there is
a case for doing something to improve the quality of CPD, but on
whether that is best achieved by the licence to practise, I do not
think so. We can achieve these things without the tick list incurred in
the core professional standards. There are other ways to do this, which
are less painful and less time-consuming.</div>
<a name="10012010000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Bartley:</b></i> We strongly support the notion of an
entitlement and strengthening that entitlement. But alongside that
entitlement sits a teacher&#146;s individual responsibility to seek
and take opportunities to develop their own skills. Currently, our
impression is that schools are being very cautious about releasing
teachers for external CPD opportunities, with enrolment on courses
across the piece slowing down as schools anticipate budget pressures
ahead. But professional development does not have to be provided solely
externally. Structured development opportunities within schools or
within local clusters of schools can be more effective and can lead
more directly to changes in practice. But if that is the case, it leads
me to have some concerns about the equitable provision for groups of
teachers who are outside that mainstream provision&#151;for example,
supply teachers. Our research tells us that part-time teachers do not
even receive their part-time share of CPD. One could argue that no
matter how part-time someone is, they should have a full entitlement to
the same degree of professional learning and development that any other
teacher has. We are particularly concerned that there is very limited
provision available at the moment for those who intend to return to
teach. So we see that the notion of the entitlement around the licence
gives an opportunity to assure better the quality of those teachers who
are not within the mainstream performance management
arrangements.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000105"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Mary, just to be clear, you support this because you
see it primarily as a way of improving CPD. You do not see it as a
mechanism that will be helpful in getting rid of poor
teachers.</div>
<a name="10012010000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mary Bousted:</b></i> Can I just make one point here? There
is no reason why a licence to practise has to be a reassessment every
five years against the core professional standards. It should come out
of performance management, and it should come out of a dialogue between
the teacher and the context of rigorous performance management. If
performance management says that  a teacher is not achieving
the proper standards, they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>should be given support and development. If they do not respond to that,
they should go to the capability procedure; that is the way to get a
teacher out of the profession. As Chris said in previous evidence, the
regulations and the procedures are there and should be used. So I do
not see licence to practise as a sort of routine vehicle for bucketing
out loads of teachers from the profession. I do not believe that there
are thousands and thousands of bad teachers. I believe that we work in
a very accountable framework. If licence to practise is properly
implemented, it can be done in a non-bureaucratic way, and it can give
real importance to the notion of a CPD entitlement. Entitlement is the
next stage of the work that we are doing within social partnership. We
are looking at what a CPD entitlement would look like and how it could
be implemented. It is desperately
needed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000106"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Can I ask both Mick and Daniel to come back on the
debate that we had earlier, if you heard Chris Keates and John Dunford?
I said that head teachers around the country quite often say to us
privately that getting rid of poor teachers is easy in theory, but that
it can be quite difficult and quite prolonged in practice. Sometimes,
they leave before the disciplinary action is taken, and then they turn
up in another school where they might not be very good. Whether or not
through this mechanism, is there any need to change the existing
mechanisms for dealing with the minority of poor teachers? Or do you
think the mechanisms are there for the heads who are willing to really
use them, and the problem with them is weak head
teachers?</div><a name="10012010000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> The toughest thing that any head teacher has
to do is to intervene and sometimes remove members of staff from his or
her school. That is particularly difficult if you happen to be working
in a small school with four teachers. If you remove one of them, you
have lost 25 per cent. of your staff. When you go down that road, you
know two things: it is highly likely that the member of staff will go
off sick during the latter stages of the procedures, and they are also
likely to take out a grievance against the head for bullying and
harassment. That is the context in which we work. I understand the
teacher unions wanting to protect their members.</div>
<a name="10012010000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
tough call, and one thing that needs to happen is that head
teachers&#151;not specifically, but sometimes&#151;in smaller
schools need to be given support. I think that all the unions agree
that we cannot countenance poor practice in the classroom, and
something has to be done about it. Mary is quite right that the
intention of the competency procedures is to give support and guidance
in the first place.</div>
<a name="10012010000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing
teachers to leave and have a misleading reference is completely
unscrupulous, quite frankly, and it should not happen. But my
experience of teachers who find that they are in the wrong day job is
that most of them are pretty decent people who recognise that they are
in the wrong job, and they will remove themselves, which is why Keith
does not get many referrals for teacher competency; it is a
self-selecting event.</div>
<a name="10012010000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000107"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Can I ask Daniel and then perhaps bring in John
Bangs, who looks as if he is biting his lip and wants to say
something?</div><a name="10012010000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> I agree with everything that has just been
said. A small number of teachers do not make the grade and cannot be
helped with support. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>process of dealing with them can be very long and can be impeded by
people going off sick. I am not saying that the intention behind
licence to practise should be to assist schools in dealing with such
people, but if that is the intention, the licence will not assist
schools; in fact, it will make things harder, because there will be an
extra set of things that schools will need to do. Teacher capability
and competence is a separate issue that needs to be addressed. There is
a market in people moving between schools who are not competent or
capable, and that is a real problem in the
system.</div>
<a name="10012010000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000108"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> John, do you accept any of
this?</div><a name="10012010000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> As you say, David, I sat in the evidence
session earlier, and there was some impression that head teachers were
somehow finding it difficult to get rid of staff who they believed to
be incompetent. That is not the information that we have from our
regional offices. The information that we have from them is that
capability procedures are being used, but the amount of pressure that
head teachers can, rightly or wrongly, bring to bear in individual
cases means that those teachers leave earlier. From our information,
head teachers do not feel an inhibition from external sources to act
against staff who they feel are incompetent or giving
problems.</div>
<a name="10012010000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000109"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you think, John, that the risk of some of the
weak ones&#151;there are bound to be some in every profession, and
that includes Members of Parliament&#151;clearing off early and
turning up in another establishment might be prevented by the licence
to practise if it is designed in the right way?</div>
<a name="10012010000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> An academic called Stephen Ball once said that
the thing about Government legislation that always made him feel
overjoyed was that it was unrecognisable in schools, and this proposal
will be unrecognisable if someone wants to subvert it. We are talking
about 500,000 qualified teachers in the system. The vast majority of
schools, head teachers and teachers act in good faith and operate
according to the pressures on them. The licence to practise is not a
professional development strategy or an effective or partial substitute
for a professional development strategy. It will actually do nothing
other than place an additional bureaucratic burden on head teachers and
individual teachers, and it certainly will not lever in the kind of
things that we have been arguing for. We agree with a funded
entitlement to professional development, but a licence certainly will
not lever in that
objective.</div><a name="10012010000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000110"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> I want to be absolutely fair, so I will ask the
same question of you as I did of the previous group. We have talked a
great deal about the licence to practise, and I can perfectly
understand your concerns, but may I move on to the aspects of the Bill
relating to pupil and parent guarantees, home-school agreements and
parental satisfaction surveys? Do you agree or disagree with those
aspects of the Bill?</div>
<a name="10012010000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
point out that probably more than 20 per cent. of my
constituents are now either Pakistani or Bangladeshi, so I am deeply
concerned about aspects of the Bill that will affect their
children&#146;s schools. There are three primary schools in my
constituency where 95 per cent. of children enter with not a
word of English, three other schools where 75 per cent. are  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>of that ilk and a senior school where 75 per cent. of the children
entered earlier in their lives, at age four, without any
English.</div>
<a name="10012010000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am thinking
about the pupil and parent guarantees and other aspects. It is
difficult for parents with no experience of education themselves and
little English, if any, to participate in such things. For instance, my
senior school had an open evening last autumn that only three parents
attended. Is there anything that we can add to, subtract from or
enhance in the Bill that might help that sort of
situation?</div>
<a name="10012010000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000111"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who would like to
answer?</div><a name="10012010000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> I will. Two of those elements are built on a
false premise. The first is that parents have nowhere to complain. That
is wrong. Parents have plenty of places to complain, and I think that
some of the measures, if we are not careful, will give licence to
vexatious parents or parents with frivolous complaints. That is one
danger if the measures stay. I understand where they came from.
Originally, the complaint used to go to the Secretary of State. Putting
in the local ombudsman is probably a good move, but we do not also need
the measure allowing parents who are not successful there then to
complain to Ofsted. We need a single complaints mechanism for parents
that is absolutely transparent and is an escalator, starting with the
teacher and ending up with the ombudsman. The complaint to Ofsted
should be taken out.</div>
<a name="10012010000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
thing in terms of parental surveys is that any school worth its salt
will take absolute notice of what parents say about its performance. I
know that most of my colleagues do their own parental surveys as a
matter of course to inform their school development plan and
self-evaluation. The false premise here is that schools will
misrepresent that. I do not think that that is the case. Most
parents&#151;any Ofsted survey will show that it is above 90 per
cent.&#151;are very satisfied with what is happening in their school.
I think that schools should be trusted with that information. It should
not be imposed from the
outside.</div><a name="10012010000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000112"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Anyone
else?</div><a name="10012010000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> The question is an extremely good one. It
posits an anxiety about a one-size-fits-all set of guarantees.
Absolutely. We have read both the impact assessment and the equality
impact assessments of the Bill. Last night, the NUT launched a document
on white working-class people and achievement. What is extraordinary
about the Government&#146;s equality impact assessment is that social
deprivation and social class do not appear. Issues of ethnicity,
rightly, do appear, but what does not is an evaluation of the impact of
social and economic deprivation&#151;if you will, social class. That
is very important, and the question that has just been asked highlights
it.</div><a name="10012010000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second thing, in terms of our lobbying as a union and the advice we
will give to MPs and peers, is that we will not call for the removal of
guarantees for pupils and parents, but it seems absolutely axiomatic
that the Government should do not just a consultation but a capacity
audit of schools before setting the guarantees. Can they actually
deliver, and what do they need to deliver in variance to their pupil
populations? That is an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>important position to take. If it is not taken&#151;the provisions
have mandatory force, and we advise a further amendment on that; Clive
Romain, our senior solicitor, is here&#151;the schools reading the
legislation could be open to quite serious actions in court and
damages, which will cost them a lot of money, because those guarantees
have not been
met.</div><a name="10012010000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mary Bousted:</b></i> In general, ATL is not against the
concept of a pupil-parent guarantee. We think that the broad headings
of the guarantees as they are set out are fair enough; they are what
schools should be providing. The thing that we welcome, particularly
with the home-school agreement, is that you are giving much more of a
platform to the fact that parents have responsibilities as well as
rights&#151;responsibilities to support the school and its work, and
to provide the context for their child to be able to go to school, to
learn and to be able to get on and develop the skills and abilities
that they need.</div>
<a name="10012010000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much of what
is in the pupil-parent guarantees is not new; they are duties that are
already on a school&#151;a broad and balanced curriculum and to have
a behaviour policy to enforce good discipline. A lot of them are
inspected by Ofsted and through the school improvement partners as
well. In a sense, it brings together the agreement between the school
and the parent in terms of the respective rights and responsibilities
that both sides have for the child&#146;s education.</div>
<a name="10012010000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where we have
worries, and where I am with John about the devil being in the detail,
is on what the rights mean when they are translated into legislation.
For example, what does the pupil&#146;s right to be taught in an
orderly classroom mean? How do we define what that will mean? Is the
classroom not orderly because your child happens to be the collateral
damage of a fight going on elsewhere? If something kicks off very
quickly&#151;as I know it can from my 11 years in comprehensive
schools in London&#151;it is often not the school&#146;s or the
teacher&#146;s fault. You cannot always impose an orderly classroom.
Sometimes circumstances prevent you from doing so. So the devil will be
in the detail.</div>
<a name="10012010000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
that schools should have complaints systems and they should be robust.
I was in for the start of the previous evidence, and I was heartened to
hear the Government ombudsman saying that they can turn away vexatious
complaints. It is important that we do not get what John Dunford called
a whinger&#146;s charter or serial complaints. There should be an
understanding that schools are living places with lots of pupils and
sometimes things happen. So, there are aspects of the guarantee that
are in a school&#146;s power to deliver. There are aspects that are
contingent upon what is going on on a particular day, and it will be
important to look at the legislation very carefully to see how they are
translated.</div><a name="10012010000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000113"></a>The
Chairman:</b> A final comment. There are only 20
minutes left and colleagues are trying to catch my eye, so we will have
to speed up.</div>
<a name="10012010000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> The guarantees, as statements, are
fantastic. There is no doubt that everyone in education should be
aspiring to achieve them. If you look at some of the guarantees, every
child is entitled to relevant and challenging learning in all subjects.
Of course that is true, but can it be so because it is mandated by
Government? If there are still some schools that do not achieve that
now, I cannot see how central Government can guarantee it. There are
other strategies that can bring that about. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>The biggest danger is litigious parents. When a parent says discipline
is not very good and they refer the matter to the local government
ombudsman or the YPLA, how will they investigate it? There is a danger
that a huge superstructure of bureaucrats will be created to interfere
further in schools, which are already subject to Ofsted inspections,
SIP visits and all of the rest. That is fine, but for people to
investigate parental complaints&#151;if, for example, someone says
behaviour is not good enough&#151;we are adding another layer. Either
they dismiss it without visiting the school, or they have to visit the
school and make an
assessment.</div><a name="10012010000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000114"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Mr. Brookes, John Bangs
implied&#151;he did not quite say it&#151;that head teachers do not
find it hard to get rid of bad teachers. I am going back to the subject
of licensing and tackling underperformance. The information came back
from the NUT that there was not really a problem. Is that the
experience of your
members?</div><a name="10012010000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> No, it is not. Our regional officers spend a
lot of time defending our members against teachers who have been
identified as being not up to scratch and have brought bullying and
harassment complaints against my colleagues, so we will have to
disagree on that one. In my experience, it is the toughest thing you
have to do in school. That is not a charter to lay into teachers. I
think the comments about the quality of teaching are right, and that it
is the toughest thing you must do as head.</div>
<a name="10012010000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000115"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> So could you tell us, if you do not think
licensing is the way to go, what changes you would like to see to
tackle the problem? It is obvious that the teaching unions are in
complete denial of
them.</div><a name="10012010000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> Okay, there is certainly the issue of
support and the variable quality of human resources support around the
country now. It was a high quality provision put on by local
authorities, but it is now very patchy, and we are finding that some of
our colleagues are getting into trouble because they are not getting
the right advice when dealing with these very difficult
issues.</div><a name="10012010000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Bartley:</b></i> All children deserve to be taught by
competent teachers&#151;that is an absolute basic minimum&#151;and
all children should be entitled to be taught by good teachers. The
issue about this policy is that it seeks to raise the bar for the
majority of teachers as its primary objective, and raises the secondary
issue of the extent to which it can deal with underperformance or
incompetence.</div><a name="10012010000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be a small proportion of practitioners in any profession, teaching
included, who make the wrong choice, or who fail to thrive or succeed.
In teaching, a significant proportion select themselves out during
training or post-qualification. Beyond that, I believe that the
prevalence of serious professional incompetence is very small, and
capable of being managed. Indeed, it is being managed. There are
teachers who lose their way because of short-term personal or
professional difficulties, and they may thrive with support under a
fresh start. Others simply do not recognise that they have a problem,
and are unable to accept support and act on guidance
offered.</div><a name="10012010000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
cases that reach the General Teaching Council for England and are found
proven tend to exhibit a similar pattern. Teachers who, despite being
offered support, mentoring, observation and often
guidance  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>from their union representatives, are unable to raise their game and
meet the needs of their pupils should not be recycled in the system, or
permitted to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000116"></a>Mr.

played a part in removing from the profession on the grounds of
incompetence?</div><a name="10012010000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Bartley:</b></i> We have had 76 cases heard relating to
serious professional incompetence, which have resulted in 12 teachers
being prohibited from ever

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000117"></a>Mr.

Bartley:</b></i> Can I make the point that the issue is
locally a matter for employment and that the issues that the GTC deals
with are whether someone is fit ever to practise, rather than whether
their practice was sufficient in local employment? We have recently
commissioned jointly with the Department for Children, Schools and
Families extensive research into referrals, not incompetence. That
report is due to be published very
soon.</div><a name="10012010000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that, based on detailed interviews with head teachers,
local authorities and others, including teacher associations,
competence issues are being addressed primarily at local level and with
varying degrees of success and rigour. It is difficult to say that a
teacher is beyond redemption, and that is the level at which the GTC
deals with cases on behalf of the profession. The research
indicates&#151;I hope we will be able to put it in the public domain
very soon, because it will throw some light on this debate&#151;a
great deal of local activity around capability, performance management
and all the structures that are in place. The issue is its variability
across the

Ofsted says that we have the tiniest generation of teachers ever.
School standards have been raised exponentially, and it is not
bizarre&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not laughing,
or finding this funny. It is not that teacher unions generally go in to
defend improper practice. My regional and branch officials often go in
to negotiate honourable ways for people who should no longer be in
teaching to get out of the profession. The chair of the GTCE spoke
about the number of teachers who self-select out of the classroom. If
you are incompetent or a poorly performing teacher, the worst place for
you to be is in a classroom because you are humiliated on a daily
basis. Most people who cannot cut the mustard in teaching
leave.</div><a name="10012010000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must remember that performance management and data-tracking in
classrooms mean now that the teaching you do and the progress of your
pupils is measured year on year, and against schools in similar
circumstances. So the idea that there are loads of places for poor
teachers to hide is
nonsense.</div><a name="10012010000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000120"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Something completely different is personal, social
and health education, within which is sex and relationships education.
We have here a variety 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>of people from different aspects of education. Do you see any problems
with this for your school or for your role in education? How much do
you think that putting it on a statutory footing and making it a
foundation part of the school will actually improve the best practice
in this particularly important area, which I hope will be changed and
have a new name? My colleague, Graham Allen, suggested &#147;life
skills&#148;. That seems to be much better than PSHE, so I hope that
it is noted by the education
Ministers.</div><a name="10012010000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> I am not happy with the impact assessment. The
financial impact assessment is between &#163;1.9 million and
&#163;4.8 million. We supported the PSHE introduction. It is
important, but a lot of our members were very concerned about it. They
had had experience of the introduction of citizenship in secondary
schools and its operation has a variable impact. I do not want to say
quality because when people try, they make it work. But in terms of its
relationship with other secondary curriculum subjects, sometimes it is
a small amount of the overall curriculum and sometimes it is
integrated. What people told us when that happened was that actually no
proper audit had been carried out of the additional staff
needs.</div>
<a name="10012010000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">My anxiety
and that of my union is that no proper audit will be taken of the
staffing needs in relation to PSHE. Opportunity costs came up in the
first evidence session. We cannot always cost, but the devotion of
staff time, leadership time and so on to its introduction are very
real, so we will be pressing for a capacity order to be conducted by
the Government before the new subject is a statutory
requirement.</div><a name="10012010000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000121"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Can each member of the panel say something about
their view on the home-school agreement and, in particular, the fact
that it is to be bespoke and personalised, and also reviewed
annually?</div><a name="10012010000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Birkett:</b></i> At the start of the meeting, I said that I
supported the Bill because it is about engagement and parliamentary
accountability. All the things that we are talking about bring in those
things. Good schools and better schools have home agreements. We have a
home agreement. I welcome this one because it made it more focused, and
we had to identify things that we had not identified. For every year
11, 12 or personal tutor, we do that anyway. For extra catch-up
sessions, we try to do that
anyway.</div><a name="10012010000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000122"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Why do you need it to be part of a legal
agreement?</div><a name="10012010000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Birkett:</b></i> Because it is happening in some schools, but
not in others. Sometimes, head teachers, principals and others need
guidance and this sort of legislation gives that guidance. It will make
them focus on aspects that they possibly had not thought about before.
It will also enable them to do it because they have got the legislation
on their side to push it forward. It is about engagement with parents,
pupils, employers and key stakeholders in the community, and it is also
bespoke as much as it can be to an individual. We cannot say that that
is a bad thing. In the further education sector, we have been working
with students on individual learning plans for a number of years. Many
of the things that I am seeing here are already in practice. That is
why I am in favour.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="10012010000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Daniel
Moynihan:</b></i> I think that home-school agreements are a
good idea. The issue for me is that their personalisation seems
completely unnecessary, and far too much effort and work. Heads should
be working with staff to improve the quality of teaching and learning,
not worrying about personalising the home-school agreement. The thing
that you want people to sign up to is the common approach to
discipline, to pastoral care and so on. Those are things that are in
common for the school. I think it is difficult to have home-school
agreements that are personalised, because it is a common ethos that you
want people to sign up to. To me, that seems completely unnecessary,
and I think it will overburden heads.</div>
<a name="10012010000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction and the firming up of home-school agreements, though, is
generally to be welcomed and is a good move. When a parent does not
abide by the home-school agreement, a parenting order is the outcome.
That is fine, but parenting orders are terrifically demanding of head
teachers&#146; time when it comes to managing them. There may be a
role for local authorities to assist in that, because the head has to
hold the parent to account for parenting. We have heads in our group
that do it, and it takes a day every couple of weeks. It is a lot of
work.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000123"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I have an interest in the trade union&#146;s
view.</div>
<a name="10012010000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> I agree. It is good practice. It is about
expectations and responsibility. Our concern is that parents who do not
send their children&#151;to put it in context, the very few
parents&#151;who do not send their children to school in a fit state
to learn will not be impressed by this at all. They will need to be
pursued. Whether this good practice should be enshrined in legislation
is dubious, but it is good practice.</div>
<a name="10012010000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
good practice should be shared by all schools. Of course, there are
expectations of the  quality of education that children should
get in their school, but there are also responsibilities&#151;not
only  of the parents but of the children and young people
themselves&#151;to access that good quality
education.</div>
<a name="10012010000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000124"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Although there are home-school agreements under
previous legislation, am I right that parents can choose not to sign
one&#151;that there is no obligation to do so? Under the Bill, once
parents have accepted a place at a school and the child joins, they
will have to sign up to the home-school agreement. Surely it is
important to ensure that the law is clear about the responsibilities of
parents. Although schools have many responsibilities under the
guarantees, the agreement puts the onus in that direction. However, I
accept that it should not be only the school that has to deal with the
parent who refuses to send the child to school. That is why education
welfare officers and others will have to be part of the team picture
when dealing with the
matter.</div><a name="10012010000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mary Bousted:</b></i> It is important that there is a
requirement to sign. It is a clear articulation of an
understanding.</div>
<a name="10012010000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
Dr. Moynihan when he says that there is a danger; I think that
personalisation is an overused word. Largely, education and schooling
is a collective act. I do not perceive that in the system there will be
hugely personalised home-school agreements, because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>there are core entitlements and core responsibilities. However, I do
think the fact that parents will be expected to sign is important. It
gives a lever.</div>
<a name="10012010000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, in
some schools it is not the case that it is a minority of children who
do not come to school. At some schools, teachers go in daily to have a
difficult time with a preponderance of children&#151;it might not be
the majority, but it might be enough of a minority to make life very
difficult&#151;who do not buy into the ethos of the school, who do
not buy into the ethos of working or the ethos that the teacher is
there to be obeyed and respected. To have that as part of your armoury,
parents having a series of responsibilities to ensure that their child
goes to school ready to learn and behaves in school in a way that
allows them and other children to learn, is very important.</div>
<a name="10012010000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mick
Brookes:</b></i> I agree, but I do not think that it needs to
be signed every year. It should be signed on admission, so that if you
want your child to come to the school, these are the conditions and
this is the promise from the school. The other thing, just to add to
that, is another example of extremely good practice. For instance, in
north Nottinghamshire, where I worked, we had a home-school agreement
that was shared by the whole family of schools. If parents wanted to
play one school against another, exactly the same home-school agreement
would be at Sherwood school where I was as at Birkland school where my
colleague was. I think that that is good
practice.</div><a name="10012010000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012010000125"></a>The

clause 10, the
curriculum.</div><a name="10012010000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="10012010000126"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I wanted to come to an area that I do not think we
have covered in any depth so far this morning, which is the primary
curriculum. I cannot make up my mind about this section, about whether
we are really gaining anything here. I think that the changes have been
generally supported by people in primary education, but I note that the
NUT is concerned that that is too top-down. I think also Nick Gibb has
been concerned that that is too much dumbing down. Is it a waste of
time? Will it achieve anything? Do you support it? I suppose that this
question is particularly for John and Nick, but if the others are happy
to join in, we would welcome hearing from
you.</div><a name="10012010000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Bangs:</b></i> There are two areas of learning where Jim Rose
received a degree of consensus. It was a real shame that it was not
informed by the independent Cambridge review, and that the Government
did not bring the two main reviewers, Alexander and Rose, together so
that there was a genuine public debate. The issue has not been informed
by a genuine debate by two of the most senior people, one of whom had
more than 1,000 pieces of evidence from an independent review.
Therefore, we may have had a better curriculum than this had there been
a proper
debate.</div><a name="10012010000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a structural problem with the curriculum, but it goes to back to
1988. There is no explicit expectation and requirement in the
curriculum&#151;that is, it is a school that develops the curriculum
inside a broad framework; it is still a top-down curriculum. Secondly,
we are concerned about&#151;this is where the Bill provides an
opportunity&#151;the fact that there is no requirement on the
Secretary of State to review the validity and reliability of the
assessment arrangements in relation to the curriculum. That is
particularly pertinent because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>the curriculum is changing into areas of learning. Never mind the
NUT&#146;s position on the current arrangements; I do not know how,
in the future, areas of learning will be assessed. There ought to be a
requirement on the Secretary of State, once the curriculum changes, to
review the assessment
arrangements.</div><a name="10012010000088"></a>

heard some of the evidence earlier, which suggested that the threshold
response to trigger a plan should be 50 per cent. of parents in a local

that?</div><a name="10012010000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

impact assessment talks about the threshold response of the responses
received being 50 per cent., but there is no threshold in terms of the
numbers of parents taking part, and there ought to
be.</div><a name="10012010000093"></a>

Coaker:</b> I am trying to keep out to allow everyone else the
opportunity to speak, as I said to the other group. Different views
have been expressed about the licence to practise, and I will take some
of that on board. We are trying to raise the status by underlining the
importance of professional standards and ensuring the identification
and receipt of continuing professional development. We do not want it
to be bureaucratic, and we want it to build on the existing system of
performance management. I have heard what people have said, and I want
to reassure people, notwithstanding all the other bits of evidence that
we heard earlier and now, and will hear as we go through the week. I
just wanted to put that on the record because I know that it was a
particular concern for the last group of witnesses as
well.</div><a name="10012010000094"></a>

<a name="10012010000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Bartley:</b></i> That is one of the benefits that the policy
could draw down, ensuring that there is a mechanism through which
supply teachers can receive their entitlement, against which the impact
of their own professional learning and development can be assessed, in
the same way as teachers with performance management. That is capable
of being done, but it will be at a cost to the system. In order not to
ignore the issue of those returning to teach after a career break,
there needs to be some mechanism whereby they can be
supported.</div><a name="10012010000096"></a>
