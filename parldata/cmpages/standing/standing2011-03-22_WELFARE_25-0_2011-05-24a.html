other words, the Government see the charging regime as a way to deter

going through the mandatory gateway.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000025">&#160;</a>

amendments reflects the principles set out by the then Ministers when
the House debated the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008,
which put the charging provisions in place. The White Paper produced at
the time set out three clear principles for charging: first, that the
charging structure should incentivise non-resident parents to pay;
secondly, that the clear burden of charging should fall on the
non-resident parent; and, thirdly, that the payment of existing debts
to a parent with care should always have priority over fees owed to the
commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000026">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Minister or part of the team involved—it did not include the
detail he describes. Now, however, the Opposition suddenly want to put
that level of detail in the Bill through a series of amendments. Why
was it wrong to do that then, but right
now?<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> Unfortunately, I am not able to claim credit for
that outstanding Act, although I strongly support it. To answer the
hon. Gentleman’s perfectly fair question directly, we are
concerned about several comments made by Ministers and placed in
documents such as the Green Paper on how the Government envisage the
arrangements operating in the future. Whereas my noble Friend Lord
McKenzie and others clearly set down the constraints on how the powers
were to be used, the current Government have not yet signed up to
similar constraints. One benefit of this morning’s debate will
be to give Ministers the opportunity to provide reassurances about how
they envisage the powers being used. Of course, if they do not do so,
the Committee can express its will in a vote, but I hope that Ministers
will take the opportunity to provide firm
reassurances.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
the vision set out in the consultation on CMEC and the mandatory
gateway proposed in the Bill, it makes sense that we discuss fees and
ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place. The amendments
provide an opportunity for the Minister to explain the direction and
purpose of the charging system and how the Government envisage its
use.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
272 relates to an exemption from fees for parents with care in
prescribed circumstances. During debates on the 2008 Act, my right hon.
and hon. Friends emphasised our view that the burden of any charging
should rest on the non-resident parent and not on the parent with care.
That was a cornerstone of the previous Government’s view of how
the arrangements were to operate. Amendment 272 would put that
principle into the Bill. Perfectly fairly, the hon. Member for Dover
has asked why that was not done in 2008. As I have explained, Ministers
gave firm assurances at that time, and I hope that their successors
will give comparable reassurances this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the amendment, charging would fall on the non-resident parent, but the
parent with care would to be subject to fees only in prescribed
circumstances. We envisage that a parent with care might be required to
pay a small charge for use of the statutory service where the
non-resident parent has a track record of consistent payments through
the statutory service—for example, paying in full and on time,
perhaps without intervention by the commission, for at least a year.
The regulations might prescribe that no charge should be applied to
parents whose income is such that they are entitled to the family
element of child tax
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
groups have real concerns about the charging proposals and how the
Government now intend to use them. In its briefing, Gingerbread points
out:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“There
are strong reasons for the Government to think again about proposals to
charge parents with care who turn to the statutory maintenance system
in order to obtain child maintenance. The new gateway procedures will
ensure that parents with care who make a formal application to the
statutory scheme will already have been required to justify their
reasons for doing so, having been made to consider private arrangements
instead. Thus the overwhelming majority of those applying to the future
scheme will be those who do not have choice, because the other parent
is failing to fulfil his parental financial
responsibilities.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000227">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Rather oddly,
one might think, we are still waiting for the Government to respond to
the CMEC consultation, yet we have the Bill before us this morning. It
would be helpful if the Minister set out for us the proposed levels of
fees at the collection stage. For example, the consultation suggests a
collection charge of between 15% and 20% on non-resident parents, and
between 7% and 12% on parents with care. Such levels are a good deal
higher than those referred to in the report submitted to the previous
Government by Sir David Henshaw. He drew on the USA for potential
models of charging. His report
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Other
countries charge parents for the use of child support services using a
variety of different models. In the United States, non-benefit parents
with care can be charged an annual fee of $25. Some states have also
charged a percentage of maintenance, typically between 3 and 6 per
cent.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Indications
so far suggest that the Government envisage a much higher level of
charging than Sir David envisaged. Can the Minister tell us what fees
she proposes—following consultation—to levy on the parent
with care? Will they be as high as the consultation paper suggests? She
will know of the very considerable concern that those proposals have
caused. Is there not a real danger of deterring parents with care for
whom voluntary arrangements cannot be reached from applying to use the
statutory scheme? Has the Minister drawn on evidence from other
countries, such as the US, in designing the charging regime in the UK?
Does she envisage charging as a means of raising money, or is it
intended to deter parents from using the statutory scheme and so reduce
costs? It would help if she set out for us the Government’s
rationale for the charges they are
considering.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
274 would exempt parents on low incomes from fees. The consultation
document refers to a reduction in fees for people on benefits. The
amendment goes a step further and would exempt people on low incomes
from fees altogether, except in prescribed circumstances—for
example, if they are found to be abusing the system. According to a
parliamentary answer given on 24 March, the parent with care or their
partner is on income support or income-based jobseeker’s
allowance in roughly one third of “live and assessed”
cases. In 30% of cases with a positive child maintenance liability, the
parent with care or their partner is on income support or income-based
jobseeker’s allowance. Those are big proportions of the cohort
of people affected by the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
its submission, Barnardo’s made this point:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Families
living in poverty only have £13 per person per day to live on;

he share my concern that a cliff edge is built into the current system,
which the amendment would not resolve? At present, if people are on
benefit, they get a significantly reduced fee, which they can pay in
instalments. If they are on a low income, however, even if they are
bringing in approximately the same amount as they would if they were on
benefit, they face a significantly increased fee, which they must pay
in one go. The right hon. Gentleman’s amendment would not

who are just above the benefit level of income. There is an issue about
how such people should be protected, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given that
income support and jobseeker’s allowance are about to be
abolished, can the Minister tell us about future interaction with
universal credit? It would be helpful to know how the system might work
after the introduction of universal credit. There might be a way
through the issue that was raised by the hon. Lady, because many people
on low incomes will be entitled to some universal credit, although they
would not currently be entitled to income support or jobseeker’s
allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 275
would ensure that those who had suffered abuse were exempt from paying
fees. The Green Paper indicated that victims of abuse will be exempt
from the mandatory gateway and will be able to enter the statutory
system. The amendment addresses what would happen to them in the
statutory system. In its briefing to the Committee, Barnardo’s
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
statutory service needs to be designed so that it is open and as
sensitive as possible to the most vulnerable families, and that parents
must have a right to be believed when they report that they have been
victims of domestic violence.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, the amendment is
in line with the recommendations in the Henshaw report, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“However
charges are introduced, the needs of vulnerable parents with care must
be taken into account. I do not want to create a disincentive to use
the service for those parents who have no other option for agreeing
maintenance.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>If
fees are intended to discourage parents from applying to the statutory
system, I hope that the Minister will agree that the measure ought not
to include deterring those who have been victims of abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 289
would bar the levying of application fees on a parent with care, except
in prescribed circumstances. The Green Paper referred to a
£100 up-front application fee, which will be a
significant barrier to many parents with care from applying to the
system at all. I am unclear how such a large up-front fee is justified.
Much anecdotal evidence demonstrates that parents with care would find
unaffordable a £100 up-front fee—or the £50 that
was proposed for people in receipt of means-tested benefit. If parents
must forgo between 7% and 12% of every maintenance payment in fees, it
would simply make the system unaffordable for them. I have quoted one
of those who contacted Gingerbread about that matter. There seems to be
a groundswell of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1090<a class="bkMark" name="Column1090">&#160;</a>
                           </div>concern about fees being at a level would make the system unaffordable,
which would have damaging consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 273 would provide that fees were not levied until the
commission had met performance standards set out by the Secretary of
State. It is certainly true that there has been a great deal of
improvement in how the child support service has worked in recent
years. Complaints have more than halved in the four years from 2005-06
to 2009-10, and I happily acknowledge that significant improvement.
However, some performance issues remain. We face an upheaval when CMEC
is converted from its current status as a non-departmental public body
to an executive agency in the Department. Who knows exactly what that
will do to the organisation? The amendment reflects the need for the
transition to be settled and for the current level of performance to be
at least maintained and, hopefully, improved on, before the
implementation of charging. If fees are to be charged for the service,
the level of service provided should be commensurate with the
significant fees that will be levelled in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the time
of the preliminary discussions on charging, the current Chief Secretary
to the Treasury said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“if
the level of competence and administrative efficiency in CMEC and the
legacy organisations has not improved, introducing charges would add
insult to injury to users…levying charges would be hopelessly
wrong if the new organisation is unable to meet the higher standards
set by the Minister.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

                        </p>
                        <p>The
right hon. Gentleman had a point in setting out that concern. I would
hope that the Government recognise the value of requiring some
performance standards to be achieved before the provisions for charging
are brought into
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These
have been designed as probing amendments. As I said earlier, the
intention is to give the Minister the opportunity to put on the record
some important reassurances, which those who are following these
matters are anxious to hear. We want to understand the
Government’s thinking on charging, to establish whether they
have recognised the problems that could arise, particularly if fees are
set inappropriately. The Government need to proceed with caution here,
particularly over charging parents with care.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
Government Members opposed the original powers for charging when they
were introduced by the previous Government. Lord Skelmersdale, speaking
for the Conservatives in the other place, said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“it
is naïve and over-optimistic to think that voluntary agreements
are always possible. Why seek to deter a parent from using what is
clearly going to be…a very valuable service
indeed?”—[<em>Official Report, House of Lords, </em>31

                        </p>
                        <p>There
is a grave risk of parents with care being deterred from accessing the
statutory scheme and as a result finding themselves unable to persuade
the non-resident parent to make regular payments in respect of their
children. That was the problem that the previous Conservative
Government wanted to address in setting up the child support system.
There have been a lot of difficulties, but also a lot of progress and a
lot of improvements since then. It is important that we do not go
backwards to a position where many children are left 

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1091<a class="bkMark" name="Column1091">&#160;</a>
                           </div>without the maintenance that they need. There are already many
non-resident parents who do not fulfil their financial obligations to
their children. Clearly none of us would want to make things worse. I
commend these amendments to the

Green</strong> (Stretford and Urmston) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000302">&#160;</a>
                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Gray. It is a pleasure to enter this last day of the Committee with you
in the Chair. I am sure we will miss our encounters once they
conclude.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
speak in support of the amendments. As has been noted, the provisions
for charging are already understood from the 2008 Act. That set of
provisions on levying charges, however, has never been put into
practice. That is because we are still uncertain, to put it at its
mildest, what the impact of charging would be on the behaviour of both
non-resident parents and parents with care and what that would mean for
the flow of child maintenance to parents with care, to help them
support their children. It is important that we take those
uncertainties seriously and examine where there might be some risk
factors in pressing ahead with the introduction of charges without
clearly understanding how we will monitor the impact of doing that and
the circumstances in which charging will be applied.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My right hon.
Friend mentioned that there are other countries and regimes where child
support systems levy charges, and I have been interested to look at the
evidence to see how effective those systems are. However, it is
extremely difficult to extrapolate from one country to another how a
child maintenance charging system might work. The design of the overall
system varies widely from country to country: in terms of the level of
compulsion for parents to be part of a statutory scheme; whether
maintenance is passed through, in whole or in part, to parents with
care for spending on children; and the broader socio-economic position
of lone parents bringing up children in different countries when
compared with that in the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
on a recent visit by the Work and Pensions Committee to
Wisconsin—although in fact my hon. colleague the Member for West
Worcestershire was not with us on that occasion—we were able to
examine the system there in some detail. It is one of the very early
and much-wanted systems of child support. While I would not encourage
hon. Members to copy many aspects of Wisconsin’s welfare
reforms, in relation to child support they have been very effective in
producing a flow of maintenance to lone parents. They apply charging,
and I was very keen to ask them how they combined that with sustaining
high levels of maintenance flow.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The answer
was twofold. First, the system is entirely compulsory. It is not
possible for a parent from Wisconsin in receipt of financial support
from state or federal funds not to be in the statutory scheme. That
will not be the case here, as Ministers introduce a scheme in which
parents will be asked to try to make voluntary arrangements, so that
going into the statutory scheme and paying the charges to do so will be
for a residual group. That is in stark contrast to Wisconsin, where
everybody on benefits is required to go through the statutory scheme.
When I asked officials in Wisconsin what they thought about applying
charges in a non-compulsory scheme, they were horrified and said that
they could not see how it could work.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1092<a class="bkMark" name="Column1092">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
part of the answer is related to the way in which maintenance is
collected in Wisconsin. While the Child Support Agency here has
increasingly made use of automatic deduction from earnings and benefits
to get maintenance from non-resident parents where they are otherwise
unlikely to make payments, that is standard in Wisconsin. Non-resident
parents face that automatic deduction, whether they are recalcitrant,
willing or enthusiastic payers. That is not the situation that
predominantly pertains here.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
there is a very different context in the UK for a charging regime to
work. We are in a different situation with respect to other countries
that apply charges, and also to where we were in 2008. Back then we
were not looking to a system where the running assumption was
predominantly to go to voluntary arrangements. Of course, all
Governments have been keen in recent years to facilitate good quality
voluntary arrangements when they could be made to work. However, the
presumption now is that those will be the preferred model for almost
all parents. We are looking at an essentially voluntary scheme in the
future. In that context, it is difficult to see the Ministers’
charging proposals working well.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I
mentioned last week, the Work and Pensions Committee very recently held
an evidence session with expert witnesses, in relation to the
Government’s child support proposals. We specifically asked
witnesses for their views on the proposals and their likely impact on
non-resident parents, on parents with care, and on getting maintenance
flows to children. My hon. colleague was there for that session, and I
think she will agree with me that it was extremely interesting. I have
urged Members to watch the video, free to view for parliamentarians and
very riveting, on the Work and Pensions Committee website. We asked
witnesses in that Committee session for their views on the likely
impact of charging.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Caroline
Bryson, a social researcher who has done work with the DWP on such
subjects, said that the impact of charging is not known because there
has been no properly constructed study. There was some related
investigation of what the impact might be at the time of the Henshaw
review, when Caroline Bryson told us about a useful piece of survey
evidence. Parents were asked whether they would be likely to use a
calculation service if it were free, or if charges were made of, I
think, £50 or £100. There was quite a lot of enthusiasm
for a free service, although less from non-resident parents than from
parents with care. There was much less enthusiasm for—in fact, I
think it is fair to say that people would most likely not use—a
service for which they had to pay £50 or £100. I
recognise that these are not the fees that Ministers are now proposing,
but none the less, I think there is an issue about the likelihood of
any fee deterring use. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham has
already highlighted our concerns about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="hs_Timeline">10
am<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000255">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not want to set up a charging system that prevents those for whom
maintenance needs to flow from going to the system at all. We know that
financial pressures on lone parents are already increasing because of
the rising cost of living—fuel, energy and food prices and so
on—and because, in some circumstances, some 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1093<a class="bkMark" name="Column1093">&#160;</a>
                           </div>financial benefits will be reduced over time. Housing benefit changes,
changes to payments for those in larger families, and so on will
undoubtedly have an adverse effect on the material circumstances of
some lone parents too. All the witnesses to the Select Committee last
week were very concerned that the level of fees being proposed by
Ministers, modest though they may seem to all of us, were likely to be
a very substantial proportion of the income of lone parents trying to
make ends meet. They all saw the chunk of a lone parent’s weekly
outgoings that the system’s charges would impose as a
substantial deterrent. Witnesses said that we have to be realistic
about this. These are not sums that particularly low-income parents are
likely to be able to
meet.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
we have evidence from our witnesses saying that we do not really know
what the impact of charging is, but there are some concerns that, for
those on low incomes, those charges are likely to be a deterrent and,
as such, a disincentive to use the service on the part of some parents
that we want to see accessing it. I also want to look at the amendment
in relation to domestic violence and abuse, also highlighted by my
right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham, and our particular concerns
about the impact of charging on those parents affected—again,
predominantly women, as was said in earlier
debates.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Women
fleeing domestic violence often flee with nothing at all. They leave
their home, their belongings, their access to joint bank
accounts—all their resources often abandoned in the urgency of
fleeing an abusive situation, or at the moment when they reach the
tipping point at which they can no longer go on. At that point, to get
maintenance flowing from a non-resident parent will be immensely
complicated and difficult, because the relationship, by definition,
will be extremely poor. It will not be, I would venture to suggest, a
negotiation in which a voluntary arrangement is likely to be possible
for almost any of those parents with care. Further to disadvantage such
parents materially, financially, by imposing a charge to get
maintenance flowing for their children seems to me to be morally
unjustifiable and will put their children at risk of very great
hardship.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
final issue I want to raise on the impact of charging was, again,
raised in the Select Committee evidence session last week, this time by
the immediate past chief executive of the Child Support Agency, Stephen
Geraghty. He expressed some concerns about how to design a charging
structure that would, by definition, mean that fewer and fewer people
would go into the statutory system, thereby driving up the unit cost
for those who remain in it. He felt that that was a very difficult
pricing trick to pull off effectively, whereby the agency remains
financially sustainable, but low-income parents can continue to access
it. I do not know—nor, it seems, did Mr
Geraghty—Ministers’ thinking to try to get that pricing
balance right: what proportion of parents they expect to go through a
charging process and remain in the statutory system; and what
proportion of parents may go through the calculation service, but not
then go into the statutory system. As my right hon. Friend said, we do
not know whether Ministers will seek to use charging as a mechanism to
cover agency costs. If that is not the objective, is there a spending
risk here? Could it become more costly per unit cost to run an agency
for a small, residual number of parents? What models have Ministers
considered in relation to that? I am sure that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1094<a class="bkMark" name="Column1094">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that will be an issue of real concern to hon. Members who have been
anxious throughout our debates about the spending implications of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister can address those concerns in her response. I
would like more detail from her about the implementation plan for these
proposals. I would like to know what the time scale is. I would also
like to know specifically what piloting and monitoring, if any, she
proposes to put in place because it is clear from the evidence to the
Select Committee last week that there is a lot of uncertainty about how
this could play out in practice. We need to be confident that, if
Ministers’ intentions are not fulfilled, and child maintenance
is not flowing to families who desperately need it, Ministers would be
prepared to adjust the proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000071">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I want to explore further
the circumstances of making two major changes in the child maintenance
system at the same time, without waiting to see what impact one might
have upon the other. We spent considerable time on Thursday discussing
more widely the sort of child maintenance system we considered
appropriate and the shift in emphasis away from people using the
statutory service, unless it was a last resort. As we know, not
necessarily from the Bill, but certainly from the wider discussion, the
intention is not merely to apply the provisions to new applicants but
to phase out a system over a relatively short time, close down cases
that are currently being dealt with and require people to start again
effectively at the beginning, either to turn what they were doing into
a voluntary arrangement or to come back through the gateway.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So we have
the setting of the gateway, which some people consider a disincentive
in itself, whereby an applicant has to establish that he or she has
made every effort to reach some kind of arrangement with the
non-resident parent before an application will even be entertained. On
top of that, there is a suggestion that the applicant parent would have
to pay a fee for the use of the statutory service. Those are two major
changes to the way the system is working, and it is proposed to
introduce both at the same time.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not until we
see the impact of one change and the move to it, if the Government are
still minded to move to the gateway scheme for everyone, will we know
whether it acts as a deterrent without creating any further deterrents.
It may be that the gateway scheme works well, that the kind of services
that the Minister spoke about previously would be put in place and that
there will be sufficient support for people all over the country to
negotiate the kind of agreements that we would ideally like.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said before, as a family lawyer, I spend most of my time trying to
reach agreements, preferably legally binding agreements, on issues such
as maintenance to ensure that people do not have to go through court or
a statutory process if they do want to. I think that is what people
would like, but it is a question of whether the provisions will work
and whether the supports will be there. The Minister made much of
£30 million being put in by the Department of Education,
presumably for England and Wales. I am not sure what the position will
be in Scotland. However, £30 million over four years is not a
huge amount, even though it may sound relatively high. Rather than
introducing both changes simultaneously,

amendment 275, I want to say a word about domestic violence. There is
concern among those who have worked in the field for a long time that
we must be clear about what the clause includes. The last thing we want
is to go back to a situation where the only domestic violence that the
authorities understand is that which is highly visible, with people
needing some sort of physical injury to show that they had suffered
domestic violence. We have come a long way in the past 20 or 30 years;
we have moved away from that concept, and we understand that abusive
behaviour can take place in several different ways, not all of which
are highly visible.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000076">&#160;</a>

who make decisions about waiving fees in this context—there are
other, similar contexts—will be clearly guided from the outset

questions in support of their amendments. I hope that my comments can
provide the reassurance they are looking for, because it is vital that
we get the issue right. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dover pointed
out, amendments 272 to 275 and 289 are, as it were, Opposition
amendments to legislation that the Opposition introduced when they were
in government. That legislation was put in place three years ago as
part of a broader reform of child maintenance, which legislated for
wide-ranging powers to charge parents for maintenance services. The
then Government were clear that charging would form part and parcel of
CMEC’s approach, and that is why it is at the heart of the
proposals that we set out in our Green Paper.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to clarify for the Committee why charging was important for
the previous Government and why it is important for the coalition
Government, as well as the strategic role that it has in our strategy
to maximise the number of effective financial arrangements in place to
support children in separated families. First and foremost, we want a
system that supports parents to take responsibility. Lord McKenzie, who
was the Minister responsible for this policy area, talked about
charging as “incentivising” parents to make private
arrangements. I actually want them to take a balanced and rational
approach to financial maintenance that is in the best interests of
their child. I want them to consider what options they have open to
them, knowing that financial arrangements agreed outside the statutory
system are far more likely to be enduring and able to take account of
the very individual needs of each and every family.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000079">&#160;</a>

opportunity to clarify that. She is absolutely right: we are talking
about 75% of non-resident parents and just over 50% of parents with
care—in both cases, the majority of parents involved. That is
important, because if parents were given the right support, they would
not feel it necessary to be in the statutory system. This proposal will
give parents the opportunity to reappraise and change their behaviour
right at the start of their thoughts about child support. If we are to
be successful in enabling parents to reappraise the options open to
them, that re-appraisal must start at the beginning of the application
process. As Sir David Henshaw and the previous Government recognised,
both sides need an incentive to reconsider what has become the default
option in the statutory system.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000082">&#160;</a>

that it is there in the background. People might feel that, without

we included the charges in our consultation—I look forward to

been proved not to work for benefits in this country. That is why
Labour abolished the CSA when in government. I am sure that we can
learn much from international evidence, but as the hon. Lady rightly

believe that if we look at the situation in the UK as we find
it—many people who would prefer to be outside the statutory
system see no other option at the moment, and there is no opportunity

option—charging has an important role to

affordability, which three hon. Members talked about, it is important
that the Committee is clear about the Government’s intentions.
We absolutely understand that separated families might find themselves
under real financial pressure. Child maintenance will continue to be
fully disregarded for the purpose of benefit entitlement, which in
plain English means that parents with care can keep all their child
maintenance and 100% of their benefits as well. Child maintenance is
not taxable, which supports low-income parents on benefits as they move
into
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000093">&#160;</a>

                           </div>to recoup costs through the measure. The system currently costs the
taxpayer 40p for every pound that is moved between parents. Charging
has a far more important role to play in changing behaviour than in
recouping costs for the taxpayer, although that is not an insignificant
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is reasonable for parents to reprioritise their spending in the short
term to meet some of the costs of an application. An unemployed lone
parent with two children is entitled to a net income of £204 a
week, after housing costs and council tax benefit costs. Meeting the
cost of the application is a sensible option for parents, given the
significant ongoing financial benefit of child maintenance and the
strong enforcement powers that are available in the statutory system if
collaborative working is not possible. If parents are not nil assessed
on the current CSA scheme, the average maintenance assessment would be
£30 a week, which is an important contribution to the household.
We recognise the additional pressures on parents on benefits by heavily
discounting the up-front fee to just 10% of the actual cost to the
taxpayer. I hope that all those provisions reassure Opposition Members
that we take the financial pressures on families
seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000095">&#160;</a>

amendment 273, I can reiterate our intention to introduce charging only
after at least six months of live running of the new scheme. That is
precisely so we can be sure that the system works for clients before we
start to charge parents. Under the new scheme, we will calculate
maintenance using Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs tax systems,
which will allow us to start the flow of maintenance sooner in many
cases. The changes will also help to prevent non-resident parents
hiding their income. Members of the Committee will have had such
constituency cases themselves. For the first time, cases will be
reviewed annually to ensure that they are kept up to date, and the
statutory system will offer really significant improvements in the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000096">&#160;</a>

that charges will deter parents with care from going into the statutory

of charge will do. She preferred to talk about
“encouraging” parents with care to do something
different, but we need to be frank about the reality of the impact of
the proposals if they are taken forward. She has made it clear that she
wants to deter parents with care from using the statutory system. I was
not entirely convinced by her argument that an arrangement outside the
statutory system would inevitably be better for children and for
relationships between separated parents; one might hope that would be
the case, but it does not automatically
follow.</p>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am pleased that the Minister has told us that she has been listening to
what many people have said about the impact of the proposals. I was
struck by the collection of quotes that Gingerbread sent us all in its
briefing on these clauses. Many people made the point that they had no
choice but to use the statutory system. One of the numerous quotations
that Gingerbread sent us said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
reason I have had to use CSA service is that I have no idea where my ex
is. I have tried to make arrangements for payment without involving the
CSA then after 3 years with no joy he now has the money taken directly
from his wages. This is not something I could do without their help.
The charges would mean that he would leave his job and claim benefits
because he does not want to pay
anyway”.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is a real issue. The charges the Government have said might be applied
could force people such as that non-resident parent to give up their
jobs and go on to benefits instead.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
series of people argue that they cannot afford an application fee or
the loss of up to 12% of their weekly maintenance. One parent with care
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Being
charged to use the service would not make it worthwhile! He pays
£30 a week and only when threatened with court. I could not
obtain this money without the CSA. But taking a cut of the
money—which you may realise does not go very far—my son
and I would be in much greater financial difficulty, every penny
counts.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another
parent with care said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I am
on a low income and having money taken away from the maintenance would
be a harsh blow, let alone having to pay a fee for the service...If I
did not have the CSA to help me I would never have gotten
anything...Having the maintenance means I can buy my son what he
needs...so we don’t have to struggle to buy food and other
essentials.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000238">&#160;</a>

lot hangs on this issue. I hope the Minister will accept the force of
the argument presented to her that the charges the Government have
proposed are too high. She told us that she has been listening, and I
certainly hope that that listening will be translated into changes when
the Government respond to the consultation. I must say that we find
ourselves in a very unsatisfactory position, given that we are debating

277 to 279 would underline in primary legislation the importance of the
commission’s objectives when shaping child support policy.
Amendments 277 and 278 would ensure that while the Child Maintenance
and Enforcement Commission continues in its present form as a
non-departmental public body, it continues to aim to maximise the
number of effective maintenance arrangements that are in place for
children who live apart from one or both of their parents.
Amendment 279 relates to the situation after CMEC ceases to
be a non-departmental public body and becomes an executive agency in
the Department for Work and Pensions. The amendment reflects our view
that it is very important that the child maintenance body, whatever its
corporate status, continue to focus on its purpose to maximise the
number of effective child maintenance arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000117">&#160;</a>

is simple. It would insert into the Bill the commitment that no changes
under sections 129 to 131 would undermine the original objectives of
the commission, which are outlined in section 2 of the 2008

performance could be assessed. That business plan said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Commission’s success will be measured by its ability to increase
the number of effective arrangements in Great Britain. In order to do
this, it must first establish how many arrangements are in place at
present, to use as a baseline against which to measure future progress.
To do this, the Commission plans a large-scale survey of separated
families. The survey will cover all families where children live apart
from one or both their parents—those with private arrangements,
those who use the CSA, those with an arrangement facilitated through
the courts and those with no maintenance arrangement—and
establish the numbers and types of maintenance arrangements in place.
The survey will also provide a much deeper understanding of those
families and their
circumstances.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000243">&#160;</a>

commission has announced. Can the Minister confirm that that
“large-scale” and “baseline” survey is

provides the opportunity for us to debate the effects of the decision
to scrap the commission’s status as a non-departmental public
body as set out in the Public Bodies Bill, which has been to the other
place and reached our House, I think, a couple of weeks ago. Once the
commission becomes an executive agency, its objectives and functions
will no longer be set out in primary legislation. Amendment 277 aims to
secure the commission’s main objectives in the core Act of
Parliament that provides the framework for the statutory child
maintenance scheme: the Child Support Act 1991, which was enacted by
the previous Conservative Government 20 years ago. Amendment 277 would
ensure that, alongside the basic principles of the statutory child
support scheme, the commission’s main objectives, which I have
quoted, are set out in primary legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 277
is particularly important because it reflects widespread concern that
the commission’s core objective could be lost—probably
inadvertently—if the Government proceed as they have so far
indicated they will. When can we expect the reorganisation of the child
maintenance system into an executive branch of the Minister’s
Department to be completed? Does she expect the commission’s
objectives to change with the alteration in its status? Indeed, does
she believe it necessary for its objectives to change? I hope they will
not, and that she can confirm she envisages that the new executive
branch of her Department will have precisely the same objective the
commission has at the moment. Also, does she agree that the change in
status of the child maintenance body now requires a change to the
legislation, to ensure that the objectives of the child maintenance
system, as they

aim is to press the Minister to confirm that the central tenet of child
maintenance policy is that as many children as possible who are living
in separated families should receive financial support from both their
parents. Child support is of course about providing emotional as well
as financial support. The Minister is right to recognise and emphasise
the importance of the former type of support in the mandatory gateway,
but we all recognise that we need to acknowledge the latter
type—financial support—as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am glad to
be able to restate our continued commitment to maximising the number of
effective maintenance arrangements. We introduced the reforms precisely
because we want to do so. The current approach, with its reliance on
state involvement, is simply not working as well as we feel it should.
More than 3 million children live in separated families, as we
discussed in our debate on Tuesday, but only about 50% of them benefit
from an effective maintenance arrangement. We need a new strategy based
on promoting responsibility, helping parents to reach their own family
arrangements wherever possible and providing a statutory system for
those who cannot do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000132">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Absolutely; as I have said, our central purpose is
to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements. Child
maintenance is just one issue facing separating families. We want to be
able to put it into the broader context, because we believe that that
will help more families come to more effective arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That is why
we are working with voluntary and community sector organisations that
support separating families. We want to understand what support is most
effective for different people and how we can best join up the support
available. As I mentioned last Tuesday, from talking to the individuals
who run our Options service, we have learned that the ability to
download non-financial issues can help people to better face whatever
financial problems they may have following separation. At the moment,
the system does not really allow for that. We believe that broadening
the support services on offer will help families to secure better and
more sustainable financial arrangements. The briefing note that I
provided to the Committee supplies more detail on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000135">&#160;</a>

arrangements that suit their circumstances. Where a family-based
arrangement is not possible, we will provide a tougher, more effective
statutory scheme to replace the Child Support Agency. We will provide
improved support for those who choose

278, section 2 of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008
sets out objectives for the Child Maintenance and Enforcement
Commission. Nothing in clauses 129 to 131 removes the objectives
established in the 2008 Act—indeed, the clauses support the
planned strategy for meeting those objectives. The ability provided by
clause 130 to access an indicative calculation will be an important
additional tool for parents who want to make their own arrangements.
Clause 129 establishes an additional way to make an effective
arrangement without requiring either parent to pay collection
charges.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000137">&#160;</a>

the report to

currently have voluntary private arrangements. Some 1.3 million
families are not part of statutory schemes, of which 550,000 have a
voluntary private arrangement, with 520,000 of those likely to be
receiving some maintenance payments. That is a starting

                           </strong> For absolute clarity, the figure of 1.3
million families that are not part of the statutory scheme is somewhat
uncertain. The estimates are based on combining administrative CSA data
and survey data, which requires significant assumptions. The results
from available surveys do not accord well with known administrative
data. The right hon. Gentleman can deduce from that that we need to do
more work. Perhaps I could write to him with a little more detail, so
that he has the information he wants. He is right to say that it is
important that we know our starting point, and that we make as much
information as possible available to those people who are carefully
following these proceedings. I would be happy to write to him about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000146">&#160;</a>

being taken back within the Department. I can confirm that we
anticipate those changes taking place late this year—subject, of
course, to parliamentary process. As he mentioned, the Public Bodies
Bill is yet to be debated in this place. Until that happens, it is
difficult to give him a more precise answer to that

conclude, I challenge the view that the only way to have an effective
arrangement is to have the state manage it. That approach has been
shown not to work. Our proposals will provide more choice and support
to families in reaching the sorts of family-based arrangements that the
evidence we have suggests are more enduring and more effective for
children in the long term. I hope that, based on that assurance, the

His description is accurate circa 1995. I vividly remember sitting in
this room when the current Secretary of State was proposing some change
to the 1991 arrangements, which he had also taken through the House.
The hon. Gentleman is right; the CSA was a complete catastrophe at the
time. However, it is not a catastrophe today. In our constituency
surgeries, we have seen a dramatic improvement since that
time—in particular the big reduction in complaints in the latter
half of the past decade—so I do not agree with his description

                           </strong> I have certainly not said to the Committee that
everything is now fine and dandy. That is not my view and the hon.
Gentleman is right to draw attention to the continuing problems, which
I readily acknowledge, notwithstanding the big improvements over the
past five or six years. Amendment 277 simply seeks to make the purpose
of all these arrangements clear. What is the central purpose? The
Minister and I have agreed what that central purpose
is—maximising the number of children who live in separated
families who benefit from effective maintenance—and my argument
on this group of amendments is simply that that central, agreed purpose
should be in primary legislation and amendment 277 would amend the
original Child Support Act 1991 to place it in primary legislation. For
that reason, I would like to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me draw to
the Committee’s attention how collection works at the moment.
According to the CSA’s latest quarterly statistics at March of
this year, in just under three-quarters of cases, child maintenance is
collected by the commission and passed on to the parent with care. In
just over a quarter of cases, the commission does a full statutory
maintenance calculation but then allows parents to choose to make their
own payment arrangements directly between themselves, if they so wish.
Such a maintenance direct arrangement is dependent on both parents
agreeing to it. If a non-resident parent fails to pay, the commission
can take the case back into the normal collection
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
advantage of having the commission do the collection is that it
monitors receipt of payment and will contact the non-resident parent if
payments are missed. If a non-resident parent is unwilling to pay, the
commission will pursue the arrears and if necessary intervene and
insist on direct deductions from wages by an employer. If the
non-resident parent is self-employed, even stronger enforcement action
can be taken over arrears. Another advantage of having the commission
do the collection is that it enables maintenance to flow to children in
situations where, for example, parents find it difficult to communicate
or do not know, for a variety of reasons, where the other parent lives.
Under clause 129, maintenance will be allowed to be collected by the
commission only when either the non-resident parent agrees, or the
commission is satisfied that without the collection service child
maintenance is unlikely to be fully
paid.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would restore the choice that parents with care have under
the current arrangements. Non-resident parents whose child maintenance
payments are collected by the commission will be charged 20% extra for
every payment. If they choose to make payments directly to the parent
with care they can escape that substantial charge, and that is intended
to incentivise alternative arrangements. The Government’s
proposal is that the parent with care will no longer have the choice
whether to accept a maintenance direct arrangement. If the collection
service has to be used because of the situation into which the
separated parents have got themselves, the worry is that a significant
barrier is introduced. The Government’s proposal is that the
parent with care will not have that choice. If the collection service
has to be used because the commission accepts that the non-resident
parent will otherwise not make full payments, the parent with care will
be subject to a collection charge—a deduction from the
maintenance received. So far, we have been told that the charge will be
between 7% and 12% of the maintenance, but the Minister has encouraged
us by saying that the Government have listened to the representations
received about the high level of the charge. The charge obviously means
that children will be worse off as a result of the non-resident
parent’s failure to make regular
payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once
the non-resident parent has chosen to make direct payments to the
parent with care, there is a danger that the new charging system will
force parents with care to make do with reduced or irregular payments.
The parent with care will know that if she asks to use the collection
service at that stage, she will not only lose up to 12% of the
maintenance due—a proportion that is large enough to make a
considerable difference to someone struggling to raise children on a
low income—but

                           </div>the non-resident parent might well be antagonised by having to pay 20%
on top of the maintenance that the parent with care is due. Under
clause 129, access to the commission’s collection service by
non-resident parents, who are usually fathers, and by parents with
care, who are usually mothers, is
unequal.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000192">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think it is certainly the Government’s
intention that a 20% payment on top of the maintenance that is due to
be handed over could well encourage non-resident parents to become good
payers outside the statutory scheme. My worry concerns what happens in
the case of non-resident parents who are unwilling to be
helpful—we all know that there are quite a lot of those. The
particular concern arises from the risks, in a very difficult
relationship, of antagonising the non-resident parent by imposing this
significant cost on top, as well as the difficulty of taking a big
chunk out of the maintenance due to the parent with care. There will be
circumstances in which the 20% payment will indeed incentivise the
non-resident parent to enter into an arrangement outside the statutory
scheme, but there are some dangers that we need to be aware
of.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My concern is
the proposed unequal access between non-resident parents and parents
with care. The latter, unlike a non-resident parent, will not be able
to choose to use the commission’s collection service. Amendment
270 would allow them to have access to the collection service if they
think it is necessary to take that route. Clause 129, combined with the
proposal to charge non-resident parents who use the collection service,
means that all non-resident parents are likely to opt for direct
payment in the first instance, regardless of whether they intend to
make regular payments. A parent with care will not have the choice to
opt for the collection service unless she can satisfy the commission
that the non-resident parent is unlikely to pay reliably and in full.
At the beginning of those arrangements, it is clearly going to be very
difficult to demonstrate that. The Green Paper impact assessment
acknowledges that, as a result, the parent with care could lose out on
a period of child maintenance—the Green Paper speaks
about<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000195">&#160;</a>

                        <p>if
they are only able to persuade the commission, through a process of
experiencing non-payment, that the non-resident parent is an unreliable
payer and the collection service is necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Actually,
losing a month’s worth of liability is not such an insignificant
matter for a number of families. Although the Green Paper gives
assurances that the commission would<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p>the comments made in
our earlier debate by the hon. Member for Dover remind us of the
difficulties in moving swiftly that there have sometimes been with this

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1110<a class="bkMark" name="Column1110">&#160;</a>
                           </div>institution. In reality, it is very likely that the process of
satisfying the commission that child maintenance in future is unlikely
to be paid will take significantly longer than one month. For example,
the non-resident parent might give excuses about why a payment had not
been made, which the commission might decide to accept, or that parent
might contend that payments were in fact made, with the method of
payment making it hard for the parent with care to prove that they were
not. Even a month without expected child maintenance can create
problems for single parents struggling to bring up children with a
budget stretched to the limit. There is a variety of situations where
the collection service can be extremely useful. Rather than the
commission determining whether the non-resident is, or is likely to be,
a reliable payer, the amendment allows the parent with care to decide
whether it is necessary, since they are likely to be a better judge of
that than the commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000198">&#160;</a>

its present form, the clause gives undue power to the non-resident

feel a bit like a doctor who sees people only when they are ill. It is
true that we gain a slightly jaundiced view of human nature, because we
tend to see people who are not managing to make their own arrangements,
whether those are residence, access or financial arrangements.
Nevertheless, I do not have the rosy picture that the Minister appears
to have of how easy it is to secure maintenance

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth remembering that the CSA was set up in the first place because
of a widespread perception that insufficient money flowed from
non-resident parents to parents with care. That was a problem for the
state in the form of outlays in benefits, but it was also perceived as
a general problem in that, after separation, children were left to live
in greater poverty than would be the case if the non-resident parent
met their obligations. If they had already been meeting their
obligations, there would have been no need for the CSA. It has had many
problems over the years, but there have been several changes. In
particular, allowing people on benefit to keep maintenance was a huge
step forward. There was no incentive for many of my clients to even
want to go through the hassles before that if they were simply going to
lose the money that was collected.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are
difficulties in ensuring that money comes regularly and that people who
say they will pay do so. There are many people who say, “Yes, I
will pay” and then do not. We are perhaps putting in a further
difficulty for poor applicant parents here, remembering that in the
scheme that the Minister wishes to create there are already a number of
barriers and obstacles. The people who will presumably be going through
these statutory arrangements in the future, if the Minister is correct,
will be far fewer in number but they will almost by definition be the
ones who have the most difficult partners because, had they been able
to reach voluntary arrangements in the first place, that would have
been dealt with before they ever passed through the gateway.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000211">&#160;</a>

basis, I do not think it is necessary to put in a further obstacle
requiring the parent with care to prove that it will be difficult for
them to get the payments before the collection service can be used.
People who have good reason to use it, perhaps in the light of past
experience, should be able to do so. It should not be good enough for
non-resident parents to say, “Oh yes, I will pay”,
because my experience is that there were a number who would say that
but not do it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000212">&#160;</a>

people—those who change jobs, those who have an ability, often

Every time you managed to catch up with him—this was
pre-CSA—he would simply get another job because he was a very
skilled person. He was in great demand, but running around catching him
was extremely difficult. So it is not easy sometimes to get
enforcement. The collection service does appear to be doing a better
job in many cases than it used to, although I appreciate why some of
the cases still come to us because they are very difficult. The main
reason why this further restriction is unjustified is that if the
Minister’s view of how this will work in the future comes to
pass, we will end up only dealing with the hard cases

deny that choice and, furthermore, the choice to use maintenance direct
will only remain with the non-resident parent until they fail to live
up to their responsibility. I could not be clearer to Opposition
Members that this is about making sure that a choice is there for
individuals to be able to use maintenance direct. That is fair and
there are many non-resident parents out there who could well see this
as an opportunity to not be part of a system that would lead to a
charge and to put a successful arrangement in place. But if that is not
the case and if there are any problems, swift action can be
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000216">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again, to
allay the fears of Opposition Members, if there is more than one
month’s missed payment then it would be the case that the
commission could immediately come into play and make sure that that
payment is made or indeed that arrears are
collected.<a class="bkMark" name="11052457000217">&#160;</a>
