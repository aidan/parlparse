							<b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): I would like to start with the part
of the Bill concerned with biometric registration, and in particular
address Professor Anderson, with his expertise in the area. We heard
from witnesses this morning and in written submissions that there is a
widespread misapprehension that biometrics are 100 per cent. foolproof
and a perfect solution to the problems of identity management. I would
like your comments on how fallible they
are.</div>
					<a name="07030170000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Professor
Ross Anderson:
							</b>
						</i> The word &#147;biometrics&#148;
covers several different things. The Bill refers principally to three
biometrics, which will be facilitated by it. The first is a facial
image that is a digital 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>
						representation of the kind of photograph that you
have in your passport already. It is not very accurate. Randomised
controlled trials show that you can easily pass off someone
else&#146;s photo if you are allowed to choose from, let us say, a
couple of dozen photographs of people of the same sex and race. You can
get one that is a good enough match that it will fool almost anybody on
inspection.</div>
					<a name="07030170000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are fingerprints, which are significantly better but definitely
not infallible. There have been cases of misidentification recently,
most notoriously the McKie case in Scotland. We do not know for sure
precisely what the error rates of fingerprint scanners are because to
measure them one must consider the equipment, algorithm and actual data
that are used. If you take at face value the claim of the Metropolitan
police that the error rate is one in a billion, fingerprints are fine
for matching a crime scene print against the dabs of 100 known local
active burglars, but they are less satisfactory if you are trying to
match thousands of crime scene prints per year against a library of
millions of prints held on file. That is how advances in information
technology have led to more and more
misidentifications.</div>
					<a name="07030170000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fingerprint
technology is almost certainly not good enough if you are matching one
population against another, say 90 million people a year arriving at
Heathrow versus 60 million people in the UK. You will get absolutely
swamped by false
matches.</div>
					<a name="07030170000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
biometric that we are talking about here is iris codes. A declaration
of interest, I suppose, is that these were invented by my Cambridge
colleague, John Daugman. These give very much better resolution than
fingerprints. The error rate is very much lower and as far as we are
aware they are the only biometric whichis powerful enough to
be able to match a population against itself. If you are matching tens
of millions against tens of millions you have to go for iris
codes.</div>

							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I should like to ask you about your
last comment, particularly as it applies to children. What are the
particular problems in measuring the biometrics of children? What can
be used that is accurate and
reliable?</div>
					<a name="07030170000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Professor
Ross Anderson:
							</b>
						</i> I do not have deep expertise in this
specific field, but I understand from colleagues that iris codes are
stable throughout life, as they are formed in the womb in the second to
third month of pregnancy. Fingerprints are more difficult, because
children may not have as prominent fingerprints as adults. Even though
they may not change, they may have a higher error rate in measurement.
Fingerprint error rates also increase where people are manual workers,
where they are elderly and their fingerprints have been worn down, or
where fingers have been injured. I have a cut on one of my fingers with
which I managed to crash the fingerprint sensors initially put in at
the FBI in Washington. They have fixed that bug, but it is still the
case with most biometrics that some people are not measured as well as
the general population. That can affect
children.</div>

						<a name="07030170000354"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Iain Wright</b> (Hartlepool) (Lab): I understood you to say
that the error rate in terms of fingerprints was one in a billion. You
went on to say 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>that in terms of matching hundreds of thousands per population, against
another population, the frequency of misidentification is much higher.
I am not entirely certain how those two things marry up. An error rate
of one in a billion, given that we have a world population of 6
billion, does not seem a bad rate of accuracy to me. Could you just
clarify
that?</div>
					<a name="07030170000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Professor
Ross Anderson:
							</b>
						</i> I was assuming that we could use, for
the sake of argument, the Metropolitan police&#146;s claim that the
probability of a misidentification when you match on 16 points is 1 in
a billion. I do not believe that it is that good. It is perhaps in the
tens of millions, but that is something on which research is ongoing.
The problem that you get in translating a figure like this to
population against population matches is that if you match 50 million
people in England against 100 million people arriving at Heathrow in
four or five years&#146; time, the number of identifications that you
are doing, assuming thatyou are scanning one finger of each
person, will be50 million x 100 million. So it will be 5 x
10<span class="Sup">15</span>, if my mental arithmetic serves, which is an awful lot
more than the one in a billion error rate that even the Met would have
us believe. If the error rate, given the equipment that we are going to
use, is actually closer to one in 10 million, the number of false
matches that you will have will simply swamp the system. That is why,
for population-screening scale biometrics, iris codes are much better
than
fingerprints.</div>

irises, that should be a very strong means indeed, but then the
question arises of why you bother with the fingerprints since the

than five times better than fingerprints. They are many thousands of
times better than fingerprints.</div>

						</i> I suppose that from the point of view
of the management of the programme it makes sense. A number of things
proposed in the ID card scheme are open to technical criticism as well
as the political arguments with which I am sure you are all familiar.
It might make operational sense to test out the equipment and
procedures on a sub-group of the population, most of whom are extremely
unlikely to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>raise principled objections because they are not in a position
realistically to refuse to be scanned. As far as the ID card scheme is
concerned, I registered my scepticism when I gave evidence before the
Home Affairs Committee in 2004 on the Identity Cards Act 2006. I took
the view that, among other things, you are not going to get an awful
lot for a large amount of money, that other problems should be tackled
as a matter of priority and that many of the arguments that were
advanced in favour of ID cards, namely the rhetoric around identity
theft, missed many important points of policy and
engineering.</div>

						</i> I think the threat of that is fairly
clear. It has been clear in ministerial utterances, in the explanatory
notes to the Bill and in the excellent document produced by the House
of Commons Library. It is straightforward that this is a stepping-stone
towards an ID card scheme that Ministers envisage will at some future
time be compulsory and used by many other services: banks, insurers,
shops and so on to identify their customers. That brings us
tothe objections that I raised before the Home Affairs
Committee, and you can refer to the Committee&#146;s record if you
want the details.</div>

								Guy
Herbert:
							</b>
						</i> On the same point, it is explicitly part of
the plan. If you look at the identity management action plan published
by the Home Office at the end of the last parliamentary Session, you
will see that the scheme is intended to use the biometric database that
is being developed for immigration purposes as part of the national
identity register. It is therefore explicitly a stepping-stone in a
technological respect. It is also a stepping-stone in a legal respect.
The House was promised during the passage of the Identity Cards Bill
that there would be no compulsory element to the scheme and that that
would be left to future legislation. Many Members and many Members of
the public might have thought that that would be a new ID cards Bill to
make them compulsory. The legislation shows that it can be
salami-sliced. A section of the population is in effect being compelled
on to the ID cards register, on the same database, through this
legislation.</div>

								Phil
Booth:
							</b>
						</i> During the passage of the Bill there was an
exchange between the then Home Secretary and the Joint Committee on
Human Rights that pointed out that to salami-slice the population in
such a waywas potentially discriminatory. NO2ID is not aware
that those concerns were sufficiently answered oranswered to
the satisfaction of the Joint Committee. Furthermore, we would say that
there is an administrative thing going on here in that there is an
ongoing process by which the costs of the development of the ID card
scheme are reported to Parliament on a six-monthly basis. We would be
interested to see whether certain costs are now being hived off into
other Departments in that way. If the biometric 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>
						portion of the register is being built for that
purpose, will it be tagged as an immigration cost rather than as an
identity scheme
cost?</div>

						</i> Let us suppose thatone of my

happen to my students if this becomes law, and that while he was there,
there was a false positive that mistakenly identified him as someone

given the once-over and perhaps held overnight in the cells while
further inquiries are made. In the fullness of time, once you start
getting a large number of false negatives through the system, the
system will learn not to react so aggressively. But in the beginning,
at least, I can foresee that a number of individuals might have quite a
hard time of

almost out of the box. The reason for that is that they are working the
system in the United Arab Emirates, where their principal concern is to
stop people who have been deported, principally Pakistani prostitutes,
from re-entering the country under passports in different names, which
they get by bribing officials. Over the past few years, the United Arab
Emirates has scanned millions of people who have arrived in the country
and it has caught thousands of people trying to re-enter the country
illegally. A system like that can be stand-alone; you do not have to
spend years and billions of pounds integrating it with existing
technology. The possibility exists of carrying out that kind of entry
screening independently of any future fingerprint

						</i> There is a fundamental security engineering
problem with biometrics as opposed to, say, the cryptographic keys in
your chip and PIN card. Once your biometrics become compromised, you
cannot revoke them; it is not practical to do eye or finger
transplants. Therefore, once you start using biometrics on a very wide
scale, for all sorts of everyday transactions, the mafia&#151;for
want of a better word&#151;will also have your biometrics. You do not
know which shops are owned by the mafia, but if you end up having to
put your fingerprint on the glass every time that you buy a can of
Coke, sooner or later the mafia will have the biometrics of millions of
people.</div>
					<a name="07030170000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">What can you
do about that problem technically?We have conducted a line of
research at Cambridge whereby, instead of storing a biometric on a
database, you use it to generate a cryptographic key, which the user
can then carry around in a smartcard. So the system, instead of taking
a Big Brother approach, becomes an enabling technology, whereby the
citizen or customer can use their own biometric as a key to unlock
their account with a particular institution.</div>

require people to obtain biometric visas before they enter the UK,
which is part of the e-Borders programme, could cause us and the

problems. The Committee might find it useful to consider, first, the
Emirates&#146; approach, which is lightweight and aimed at a specific
purpose, namely keeping out deported bad people for public
healthand order reasons; and secondly, the US-VISIT programme,
which is a medium-weight programme whereby one is photographed and
fingerprinted when one visits the USA, although most people do not have
to be fingerprinted prior to boarding an aeroplane. Thirdly, the Bill

US-VISIT programmes perhaps gives us the biggest evidence base. The
deployment of biometrics in the United Arab Emirates is good for the
science, because it gives us a large database to look at. As far as
US-VISIT is concerned, the recent report from the US General Accounting
Office indicates that an awful lot of money has been spent and not an
awful lot of benefit has been received. The Committee and Ministers

more visitors than America&#151;tens of millions rather than

that when you talk about biometric schemes of identification, that is
as wide a term as &#147;books&#148;. It could mean anything. It is
a biometric scheme of identification when I have put my thumbprint on
my laptop and my laptop opens up, but it is only comparing one
thumbprint with one thumbprint model. It is not comparing millions with
millions. Equally, the purpose and the function of a biometric document
varies very widely. If you are worrying about the security of those
things it is not only the problems of false matches and false
mismatches that you have to worry about, but the question of fraud. The
Government have sought to address that in all their legislation
relating to biometrics. It has always been presented as a way of
dealing with fraud, particularly in the immigration context. We think

you made about the operation of the scheme in the US and also the
Emirates. I wonder whether you could elaborate a little on how the
Emirates scheme is operated and what practical difficulties you
envisage in operating a UK biometric visa document rather than just
using biometrics to secure our
borders.</div>

						</i> How the UAE scheme works is that when
you fly into Dubai you look into the camera and get your iris scanned.
If you are deported from Dubai you get put on the blacklist and if you
try again to enter Dubai they pick you up at the border and turn you
away. It really is that simple and straightforward. The US-VISIT
scheme, as anybody who has been to the US in the last four years will
know, involves a fingerprint scan, then a photograph which can be
compared with your passport and with photographs that you produce in
future, so that if you try to get in using a false passport there is
some possibility that you will be
detected.</div>
					<a name="07030170000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">A small
number of people have been caught thanks to the US-VISIT
scheme&#151;a handful of people with outstanding warrants for their
arrest. Overall, however, our assessment of the scheme is that it has
not provided any major benefits. It has brought what one might call
security theatre, rather than actual security. It reassures people that
the Government are doing something. We all know, of course, that if you
are worried about terrorism, things such as ID cards and fingerprints
are not the way forward because terrorist organisations have a ready
supply of people not known to the authorities and prepared to volunteer
for missions. None the less, it reassures people.</div>
					<a name="07030170000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">As always, the question is
about cost&#151;the cost imposed on those unwilling to go to the USA,
as well as that which would fall on universities, IT industries, the
City and so on, if it became more difficult for, say, a Chinese
scientist to come to a conference in Cambridge than to one in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Inevitably, that will make us a little less
competitive. We have to fight with places such as the Massachusetts
Instituteof Technology and Stanford for the best research
students. Everything that gets in the way of that is bad news for
us.</div>

						</b> Professor Anderson, I have two questions to
help me review the evidence that you have given this afternoon. First,
the United States and most EU states have either moved, or are moving
towards, biometric visas and ID cards. In your view, on balance, have
they got that wrong on the points that you have

						</i> I refer you to the evidence that I
gave to the Home Affairs Committee three years ago: if Britain decided
to have an ID card scheme, the least awful scheme, and the scheme that
we should be imitating, is the one in operation in Germany. Under that
scheme, a central database is avoided and population registers are kept
locally; details such as photographs are sent to the federal printing
works in Berlin from the local registration office; it is against the
law for an ID number to be used for any purposes so that if, for
example, your bank were to record your ID card number in its computer
database, it would be committing an offence; and ID card numbers are
not person, but document numbers and change every time the document is
reissued. That avoids the problems seen, for example, in the USA, where
the social security number is used as a universal identifier, which
leads to rampant problems for individuals. Although I am sceptical
about the value of ID cards in general, if we must have them there are
much better ways of going about it than those proposed in the UK
Borders Bill and, more generically, in the Identity Cards Act
2006.</div>

make a point of doing so. To be absolutely clear, is your scepticism of

themselves?</div>

						</i> It is based on both. I suppose that I
first became sceptical about ID cards as a student working in Germany
in the 1970s when there was a terrorist scare involving Baader-Meinhof.
I was for ever being pulled over by the police&#151;two or three
times a day&#151;because I had long hair. &#147;Ausweis
bitte!&#148; they would say. It seemed to me that the ability to ask
someone for an ID card had deprived the German policemen of the power
of observation and judgment. They had a formal procedure that they
could go through, whereas a British policeman would haveto ask
a suspect some questions and roll out his suspicions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>
					<a name="07030170000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the engineering point of
view, a quarter of a century or so of experience in engineering secure
systems has told me that it is a bad idea to try to put all your eggs
in one basket by trying to use the same token for too many systems. I
am sure that we all have bundles of cards&#151;library cards, store
cards, swimming pool cards, all sorts of things&#151;simply because
it is natural engineering practice and good business practice for
businesses to maintain their own customer lists and to have control of
them.</div>
					<a name="07030170000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I have
been involved in engineering projects in which people have tried to
aggregate identity&#151;by putting a prepayment electricity meter
functionalityon to a banking smartcard, for
example&#151;they have tended to run into trouble, because the
applications fight with each other, the complexity of the thing grows
out of control and you can find the business models at war with each
other. What happens, for example, if the bank wants to introduce a new
deposit account but the space that is needed for that is coveted by the
electricity company for a new night-time discount scheme? The
complexity becomes unmanageable. It is a good idea to keep your
identity and your authorisation systems separate, simple and robust

						</b> May I ask a supplementary question, which arose
from the anecdote of your experience in Germany? Is it not the case
that the cost of issuing biometric immigration documents and identity
cards will be received from fees? Although it may be preferable to have
police officers who would make a judgment, there is not a spare pot of
money available. It is not an either/or situation in which you could
spend the money either on ID cards or on more police officers. The
reality is that the ID cards proposed in the Bill will be paid for
through the fees of the people who use them.</div>

						</i> I might be able to offer a slightly deeper
answer than that. One of the things that we are now researching is the
percentage of large software projects that fail. We know that this is
due to socio-economic factors because 30 per cent. of large projects
fail now and 30 per cent. of large projects failed in 1970. That tells
us that it is not because of the technology&#151;we build much bigger
and better disasters nowadays&#151;but has to do with things like
risk aversion. </div>
					<a name="07030170000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
question then arises: why is it that the public sector is more likely
to suffer such flaws? Recently, people have been looking at laying what
we know of the economics of dependability alongside what we know of the
economics of organisations, public choice theory and so on. We find
that there is a significant mismatch. The things that you do to be a
good project manager and those that you do to be a successful Minister
are quite different. There are many examples but one should suffice: a
project manager is for ever trying to close down all options, to get
the specification as tight as possible, right at the beginning and then
not let things change for a few years as the system is developed. A
Minister, on the other hand, if he is wise, is going to delay hard
decisions and keep options open for as long as possible because
Ministers are fundamentally in the business of resolving societal
conflicts rather than doing
stuff.</div>
					<a name="07030170000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
beginning to understand that it is because of a mismatch in culture
between the operation of the Government and of business, that you can
always expect that with certain types of project there willbe
failures. Projects that have constantly shifting specifications are the
most likely to fail. That should be an alarm bell for the UK Borders
Bill, the ID card project and the e-Borders project because the stated
goals are shifting too much and too often for us to be confident that
robust systems will be built in time and on
budget.</div>

comments to Mr. Campbell about the anecdotal evidence
regarding being a student in Germany and the idea that we are not
giving the police the opportunity to observe and to make a judgment. Is
it not the case that a procedure processing systems in conjunction with
biometric passport information actually reduces the risk of corruption
because there is a process that the police officer, or immigration
officer in this case, has to go through? That actually reduces the risk
that certain racial groups will be targeted simply because they are a
member of that race. Conversely, is it not the case that the person
being questioned, because of the mass migrant movement, can provide
positive reassurance that they have a legitimate right to be here? In
both cases, it protects the immigration officer and the person being
questioned.</div>

temptation for police officers and others to stop people and say,

things that seriously concerns us is that in some places, particularly

else. The US went through the same thing when they introduced much
tougher visa restrictions. Our submission has an item from Bill Gates

						</i> I think the discussion is getting slightly
hung up on that point. What happens when a new system such as this is
introduced is that the cost of inspecting somebody&#146;s status is
shifted because it is easier and the balance of risk is shifted between
people whose status is checked. People run the risk that not having
their cards with them, or having false positives or false negatives on
their cards, are more serious matters than not having the correct
immigration documents on them happens to be now. That is simply because
it is less hassle to check under a new system. That is not a strong
point either way&#151;under the new system it is less hassle to check
but when one does check one is more likely to believe that the result
is certain. That impression of certainty in the new system is a risk
either way. It is a risk if one gets false negatives as well as if one
gets false
positives.</div>

						</i> I am not suggesting a student; I am thinking
of an academic who did not attend a conference that I was expecting to
see him at. The reason he gave was that he had
heard&#151;incorrectly&#151;that to come to Britain now he would
need to have his irises scanned and his fingerprints taken, and he
thought that was beyond the pale. So he did not come to a conference.
That is only anecdote, only my personal experience, but it indicates
the sorts of decision processes that people might be going through that
have nothing to do with the fees. The point was made that if it cost
&#163;10,000 for the course fees, &#163;200 for the visa is not the
problem. This is about the impression that people are getting and the
impression that is being given.</div>

excuse; it is not about that. People come to this country from abroad
to study because they want the quality of the research and the

an hour or so. Certainly once and perhaps more often than that, our
students will have to take a taxi to Bury St. Edmunds to have their
fingerprints done. Why? Because there is not going to be an ID card
centre in Cambridge. Why does that happen? I do not know, but there is
no convenient public transport. You cannot get the train from Cambridge
to Bury St. Edmunds any more. Thousands of students who are already in
the country will be put to considerable expense and personal
inconvenience. They will spend a day and perhaps &#163;100 on taxi
fares to go and get their fingerprints done. That will not make the
Government very popular among the student body. As people grumble in
the bar, students who have not made up their mind which party to vote
for may decide to vote for a party other than the one in power. There
are

						</i> I would not say that it is a particularly
concerning part of the Bill in that it is something that should not
happen. This is part of a general trend towards the devolution of what
are essentially policing powers towards non-policing agencies, in this
case towards immigration officers. Over the last few years we have seen
a number of legislative changes that have resulted in non-policing
bodies being given, to a greater or lesser extent, policing powers. The
Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 contained provisions that
specifically set out the carrying out of arrest functions by
non-policing bodies.</div>
					<a name="07030170000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am saying that that is
something that should not happen, and there may be very good reasons
why it is appropriate for immigration officers to be able to exercise
the powers that are set out in the Bill. What I would say is that the
tradition that we have in this country of having an accountable,
properly trained police force is there for a very good reason. The
powers in the Bill&#151;the powers of detention and
pursuit&#151;create an offence if you do leave, but the
accountability structure seems to be rather lacking. I am not
sure,for example, whether or not there will be any
accountability to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as I
believe has happened with asylum officials. As long as the proper
training and accountability are in place for these functions, I do not
see that there is a problem.</div>

something that is slightly concerning about the idea of immigration
officials, who obviously have a clear role&#151;they are there for
immigration purposes&#151;being given powers regarding
non-immigration issues over British citizens, which is what would
happen as a consequence of the Bill. If those powers are going to be
used against British citizens&#151;there might be reason to do so,
for example if someone involved in trafficking is a British citizen, so
I am not saying that that in itself is wrong&#151;I believe
personally that the Bill should make it very clear that those powers
are only to be carried out for immigration purposes and not for general
purposes, for example if someone has been shoplifting from the

but I imagine it to be the case that, if there is a problem with
illegal working, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>
						problem is more to do with unscrupulous employers,
who know full well what the immigration status of their workers is and
exploit their position, than with unscrupulous employees who are taking
advantageof benign employers by using false identification
documents. I am not saying that that does not happen or that it could
not happen. Given that that could happen, the existence of a biometric

that a passport or a similar document is, in that it is probably more
difficult to forge.</div>

that I do notbelieve that that is the basis of the problem. If
this Government and the enforcement agencies wanted to locate large
numbers of people in this country who do not have the right to remain

significant problem for them to do so. Take the case of Morecambe bay;
I would be surprised if the immigration officials were unaware that
there were problems with illegal work in that area.</div>

would enter this country&#151;they were hugely out; they said there
would be 13,000 and there are anything between 600,000 and
700,000&#151;that if you are tackling the issue of exploitative
employers, this is a red herring? Issues such as low wages, poor health
and safety, houses in multiple occupation and people trafficking are
irrelevant to the 600,000 people who have come in from within the EU

There is no statement on the extent of the conditions, on how far they
may go, or whether they could effectively amount to control orders.
There is nothing about that in the Bill. I appreciate that it could be
said that any legislation must be read in accordance with the
convention and so nothing too onerous could be placed on an individual.
However, there have been a number of occasions in which, such
protection having not been in a Bill&#151;it was just
inherent&#151;conditions have been struck down by the courts because
theywere oppressive. When the decision is made
aboutthe appropriate conditions, I would like it to be a
requirement in the Bill that when the immigration officer makes a
decision, the conditions are reasonable in all circumstances. That
would mean that there would be a prompt to realise that while you might
be doing something for a particular reason, you simply cannot place
excessive restrictions on where somebody can

In practical terms, the number of cases in which there will now be
deportation that would not have occurred before might not be huge; but
I do not think it is appropriate for this legislation to remove
whatever residual discretion there was. It is important that there be
some form of residual discretion to take into account those cases in
which a person, who might have been in prison for a very short period,
is not a risk to the community, as well as retaining the residual
discretion that would cover somebody with family ties that might result
in their not being deported under article 8. That is why I would say

						</i> I was talking about principle, but let me
expand on that slightly. I think that a message is being sent out. As a
nation, whatever administrative process we use, we work on the
principle that each case is decided separately, on its merits; even if
there is a presumption one way or another, you as an individual will
have your case decided on the facts. If we move towards a system of
automatic removal we will have moved away from that. We will be sending
out a message that the individual facts are not particularly relevant;
your case will not be decided on its merits or otherwise&#151;you are
subject to automatic deportation, therefore automatic deportation you
will have. I imagine that immigration is a difficult field to work in;
everybody who does so faces difficult decisions daily. When we pass
legislation that moves us away from the idea that cases are decided on
their merits, we send out an unfortunate legislative message to those
who work in the field.</div>

that it can be certified that one can be removed, on the basis that to

that pretty much anyone who has served a period of imprisonment will be

removed if they have served a custodial sentence for an offence that is
listed in the order, which ranges from messing with nuclear weapons to
shoplifting, means that people will inevitably be deported who have
served very short custodial sentences in circumstances in which that
was the only option, but who would not be suitable for deportation. Of

&#147;You can&#146;t do that because it&#146;s human

people being released on parole on an early date when clearly they

because it is not safe to do so. I am not quite sure how that sits with
an existing presumption that the person will be deported, if doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>so would be in breach of article 3. I have to admit that when I looked
at that, I was a bit unsure what exactly the purpose of this continuing
presumption might be. I have thought about this essentially in terms of
the Human Rights Act and the refugee convention; it might have more
applicability to some of the other exemptions in the Bill. Certainly,

						</i> Specifically, it would be in relation to
biometrics. What is created here? I said biometrics, but a lot is not
about biometrics, because the Bill is clear that it could be about
biometrics or about anything else that we might happen to want to make
it about, according to order. I do not think that it is too much of an
exaggeration to say that, for regulations about the biometric
identifiers in the Bill, any order could make information cover
whatever we want about whoever we want, within the scope of the Bill
obviously, and we can make that information available to anyone we want
and be forced to do with it pretty much whatever is
required.</div>
					<a name="07030170000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trying to
pin the tail on the donkey as to whether that is right or wrong is
impossible when you are talking about orders, because you do not know
the reasoning behind them. Over the last few years, there has been a
significant move away from the use of parliamentary order&#151;which
is of course an absolutely essential and fundamental part of the
law-making process&#151;as the way in which we flesh out the bones;
the policy is decided and the order is the way we put it into effect.
We are moving towards a situation that we are now seeing consistently
in legislation, as in this Bill, where the serious policy-making
decision is left to order. I do not think that that is an appropriate
way to
legislate.</div>
					<a name="07030170000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Okay, let
us say that an order is being passed and, if we are talking about
biometrics, it provides for 12 types of use that could be made of the
information. You, asa parliamentarian, are sitting there and
thinking, &#147;Well, 10 of these are fine and I do not have any
problem whatsoever with them, but I think that two are not
appropriate.&#148; Now, your power to do anything about that is to
let the order either stand or fall. You cannot really do anything about
it. If we are moving towards a world where the Government are removing
from parliamentarians the ability to make the proper policy decision
and to apply the proper level of scrutiny, which Parliament should be
entitled to give, parliamentarians ought to demand that, as part of the
order-making process, they should be able to say that those two uses
are not appropriate and, as a consequence, 10 are fine, but the two
will not do. I do not understand why that is such a terrible thing to
ask for. All that Parliament is saying is, &#147;Give us the level of
scrutiny.&#148; The level of detail which is in the legislation
nowadays, and the amount of it that we have to get through, is such
that we cannot fit it all on to the face of the Bill. If that is the
case, proper amendments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>should be able to be made to orders so that proper parliamentary

reason for this recent growth is that it removes the policy parts,
which now go into the order, from proper scrutiny in the House of
Lords. I think that that is the reason. However, it is also the case
that Ministers will recognise that passing bad legislation is worse
than suffering the embarrassment of minor amendments as the Bill goes
through in the first place. When they look back in the autumn of their

that it has the potential to happen, not that it will. My concern is
that if it is the case&#151;and it seems to be&#151;that it is an
accepted function for police and immigration officers to make random
checks to ascertain immigration status on people using public
transport, for example, issuing a biometric document might assist
that.</div>
					<a name="07030170000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I notice a
couple of shaking heads. A couple of years ago in <i class="I">The Guardian</i>,
Des Browne, the former immigration Minister said that it was a
perfectly legitimate use of the powers and resources of police and
immigration services to carry out spot checks on public transport. It
does happen. I am sure that the possession of a biometric immigration
document would be a helpful way of finding out whether someone is
entitled to remain in the country. The question is whether they should
be forced to carry it? If it becomes common usage, will we find that a
person who sounds a bit foreign, who does not sound like a European,
and does not happen to have their biometric immigration document on
them, will be considered a bit suspicious as a consequence? Would that
be grounds for further investigation of them? I believe that has the
potential to be racially
divisive.</div>

								Gareth

						</i> Yes, I absolutely agree. I think the
problem is that the intention of both Parliament and Government, at the
time legislation is passed, is removed from what happens when these
laws are put into effect. A good example of that is section 44 of the
Terrorism Act 2000. When passed, it was clearly intended to be used as
an extra tool to carry out stop and search, without suspicion, which is
normally the trigger requiring stop and search, the legislations says,
in terrorism-related circumstances.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>
					<a name="07030170000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">That power has clearly been used
consistently&#151;because most of the metropolitan area of London is
a designated zone&#151;as a stop and search mechanism against young,
male Muslims, to the extent that both the Metropolitan Police
Authority, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, and I
believe, Andy Hayman, a few weeks ago, have said that its use is
undermining community relations and becoming very divisive. I do not
believe for a second that it was the will of Parliament that that be
the use of section 44 and that that would be how section 44 worked out.
As a consequence, however, there is the potential, when there are
broad-ranging and ever increasing police powers, that the document
might become the one that people who do not look or sound European
might be expected to carry as a matter of course, and a failure to do
so might be considered
suspicious.</div>

broad. What you are talking about is the creation of a power that will
allow a police officer or an immigration officer&#151;on the
authorisation of a senior officer, I grant&#151;to enter
someone&#146;s home to locate an immigration document such as a
passport if they think that there is one there. Well, most people keep
their passports in their homes. The clause does not require that that
passport or passport application be anything to do with the offence for
which a person has been arrested. The potential is quite
broad.</div>
					<a name="07030170000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not going
to say that there are not situations in which it might be appropriate
to enter someone&#146;s property in order to locate a document if
they arenot an EEA resident, but you need something
inthe legislation to tie the exercise of that power to the
relevance of the document in the course of the investigation. That
could be either because it is relevant to the person&#146;s offending
behaviour or the allegation thereof, or because, as is required under
clause 41, the removal of the document is necessary for immigration
purposes.</div>
					<a name="07030170000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trigger
power to enter a property does not require finding the immigration
document to be relevant to removing it. You can remove the document if
you think it is necessary because it would facilitate the removal of
somebody without immigration status, but the power to enter the
property does not require any of that. It is sloppy drafting. If you
are doing this for a particular purpose, you need to ensure that you
limit it to that purpose, unless it is to allow people who are not
European citizens to have their homes entered every time they are
arrested, in which case it is a very good
law.</div>

will try to do so quickly, Mr. Chairman. It seems from these
non-points of order that perhaps a general point is emerging, which is
that were the Government to try to do what it is suggested they may do,
in other words introduce an order requiring compulsion, that would be
subject to the normal democratic process. We will certainly use the
later Committee stages of this Bill to ask the Government whether they
intend to do so. My understanding is that they do not, which will
perhaps alleviate your
concern.</div>

						</i> According to the Government it is not. I go
back to Des Browne&#146;s quote. He said that, as far as he was
concerned, it was a perfectly legitimate and proper use of powers to
stop people arbitrarily. When I say arbitrarily, there would have to be
a suspicion that a particular person might not have residential status.
I should perhaps be more cautious when I use the word
arbitrarily&#151;but to stop people on the basis of suspicion of
their nationality. I think this is with regard to your report which
said that carriages on London underground trains and buses were being
entered and people were being checked to see whether or not there was
anything that might lead to a suspicion that they might not be a person
who had immigration status.</div>
					<a name="07030170000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also say that there has
been a move in recent years towards more arbitrary policing powers.
This is very evident in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act
2005, which, for example, made all offences arrestable, and in the use
of the powers I have referred to under section 44 of the Police Act,
which require no suspicion whatsoever for stop and search. If these
powers are being over-used, is it that much of a stretch of the
imagination to say that, if you do not require any reasonable suspicion
to do a stop and search and you stop somebody, you might want to
inquire about the immigration status? If you are operating under
section 44, which says you do not need any reasonable
suspicion&#151;</div>

						</i> What I would be very careful to say is that
I do not believe there is a tendency in the police to misuse their
powers as a matter of course. What I would say is that there is a
tendency in this Government to draft laws and publish laws of such
broad scope that the grey area where the police are not exactly certain
about where their powers begin and end has grown to such an extent that
it is far more common for people to be stopped and searched and for
powers to be used.</div>
					<a name="07030170000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is something that the
police have occasionally expressed concerns about. Somebody coming out
of police college is not sure about the extent or otherwise of their
powers in a way that used to be the case when you had serious
arrestable, arrestable and non-arrestable offences. I realize I am
going off on a slight tangent here and I will let you continue with
your question.</div>

about what you are alleging, if you do not mind me saying so, because
the reason I came back to this line of questioning was that it seemed
there were allegations being made that the introduction of biometric ID
cards for foreigners would lead to the police stopping people because
of what they looked like. I do not think you are alleging that although
you have some broad concerns about the way that the Government are
drafting regulations on stop and search generally. Is that

						</i> If you create a document called a biometric
immigration document, which everyone knows is a document that people
who are not EEA citizens carry with them, you will also know that if
people who do not appear to be European citizens do not have such a
document with them it might mean that they are not in the country
legally. I am not saying that this will lead to improper use of power
as a matter of course, but that the creation and carrying of this
document might lead a police officer, who is stopping and speaking to
someone who is clearly not of European origin, to believe that an
appropriate question to ask is whether they happen to have any
identification with them.</div>
					<a name="07030170000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that if the identity
card is introduced people will be asked for it routinely whether or not
regulations can be passed and whether or not it is a requirement to
carry it. I am trying to draw a distinction between what laws are
passed and the operational use on the street. That does not mean that I
am saying that these powers will be used improperly. What it means is
that when you get to regular policing practices such as arresting
someone under section 21 of PACE, which says that one of the grounds is
to establish identity&#151;</div>

problem&#151;again this is my concern about what will eventually
happen with identity cards&#151;is that people are not in the habit
of carrying their passports around. People are not expected to do so.
Once the system is bedded in, both in relation to this document and to
the ID card, I would not be surprised if it became common practice for
people to carry them because it is convenient and easy to do so. That
is fine, as long as that does not lead to suspicion that failing to
carry the document is in itself suspicious.</div>

that to roll it out specifically to foreigners first will itself give
