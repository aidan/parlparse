<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce </B>(Ms Patricia Hewitt): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Electronic Communications Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I begin our proceedings by saying that it is an enormous pleasure to have you in the Chair, Mr. Maxton. With your experience of Committee proceedings, I know that you will guide us through our debates firmly, but with great humour. I also welcome your co-Chairman Mr. Gale to the Committee; we look forward very much to his guidance.
<P>
I shall say a few brief words about the Bill. We had a good debate on Second Reading, when it was clear--and has become clearer subsequently--that the Bill has been warmly welcomed by industry. As I said in that debate, the Bill is the product of extensive consultation and is all the better for that. It has been described by no less a company than Microsoft as a model for Europe. I do not doubt that the Bill will help to create the right conditions for electronic commerce in our country.
<P>
I wish to stress at the outset of our proceedings that, because technology and conditions for electronic commerce and communications are changing so fast, it is especially important to ensure that the Bill is, as far as possible, future-proof. We have therefore sought to make the Bill technology--neutral, and I am sure that Opposition Members support that. It is important that we do not tie ourselves to thinking only of technology's present conditions, but try to imagine conditions in which the Bill will operate in future.
<P>
I am glad to see that the Committee is being assisted by a Clerk using a laptop computer. I am not sure whether that is a first for Committee proceedings; however, it is extremely welcome and appropriate.
<P>
Finally, I draw Committee members attention to the progress being made in Parliament and the European Union. Last week, the electronic signatures directive was finalised at the Telecommunications Council. The Bill, of course, gives effect to provisions in that directive. At the Single Market Council on Tuesday, we finalised a common position on the electronic commerce directive based, crucially, on the principle of supplier's country of origin, We are therefore making progress in the United Kingdom and Europe in creating the right conditions for electronic commerce.
<P>
I am confident that, under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, we shall make speedy and efficient progress on the Bill in Committee, thus helping to secure my objective of making the Bill the first to be enacted in the 21st century.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): I echo the Minister's warm welcome to you, Mr. Maxton, and Mr. Gale, as Chairmen of our proceedings. We look forward to treating the Bill's Committee stage with responsibility and dispatch. We have no wish to play Parliamentary games or delay matters. However, we wish to ensure that the detail of the Bill be effective and, as the Minister said, future-proof.
<P>
You have a long-standing reputation as an enthusiast of electronic progress, Mr. Maxton. As the Minister pointed out, the Clerk has a laptop. I have carefully examined the House's Standing Orders, trying to find mention of the use of electronic equipment in Committee. We understand that certain things are forbidden in the Chamber. I therefore seek your confirmation, Mr. Maxton, that I shall be permitted to use my laptop if I need to, as long as it does not make any noise or interfere with the Committee's proceedings, but is merely an electronic aid to the making of good law. I look forward to your confirmation, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
Broadly speaking, we support the Bill. But we want measures that encourage electronic commerce and establish a proper framework of law for electronic signature. We believe that the Bill has some severe defects. Indeed, it was only the Opposition's attention that ensured that the Bill was published in draft form for consultation in the summer. What was then part III has been removed, so, fortunately, we will be considering a much slimmer Bill. I am pleased to say that all our proceedings will be on our party website, so, with a special click on e.commerce.latest, the good sense of the Opposition side of the Committee Room can be read by the entire world in record time. We look forward to proceeding constructively. We accept the terms of the Minister's proposed sittings motion. We repeat our welcome to you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton, and look forward to making good law that will be future-proof.
<P>
<B> Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I also express my appreciation of your chairmanship of the Committee, Mr. Maxton. Given your expertise, I shall welcome guidance from time to time as I become lost in the detail.
<P>
I am pleased to hear from the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) that he intends to go through the Committee's proceedings with haste and despatch, and to keep to the point. Having been a member of the Standing Committee considering the National Minimum Wage Bill, which went on at length and at times seemed to get rather off the point, I welcome that commitment. The hon. Gentleman has referred to the internet as being a week, as opposed to a decade, in ordinary time. I should be delighted to spend a decade with some colleagues, but of course that will not be necessary.
<P>
We welcome the Bill's light touch and the fact that the Government have responded to consultation, because business requires a Bill that, is constructive and helpful and does not impose bars to trading. On Second Reading, I commented that people outside the Committee also appreciate the Bill's importance. I said that it is important also to realise that electronic communication in commerce does not happen overnight. I look to the Government, via the Small Business Service, with small firms especially in mind, to consider the training that will be necessary to ensure that companies make the best possible use of electronic communications. It is important that they do not see this as a means of progressing immediately, because a great deal of work is required for that to happen.
<P>
The cost of call charges has always caused us concern. We have raised this issue with the Government many times, so we welcome BT's announcement this week of a flat-rate charge system. But we shall come back to that, because many people feel that it will not help electronic communications as much as it should. I look forward to the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): You and I, Mr. Maxton, have discussed electronic commerce and IT many times. May I take this rare opportunity to associate myself with the comment of hon. Member for Rutland and Melton about the desire to have IT in the Committee Room? For the record, I think it quite absurd that we cannot have clauses and amendments pasted together in front of us provided by the Clerks as we go through the debate. 1 hope that both sides will move rapidly to allow this resource in the House.
<P>
My hon. Friend  made an important point about the technology neutrality of the Bill. One of the weaknesses of much IT legislation in the previous Parliament was that it was technology specific. As a result, past and present Governments have had great difficulties with contracts that were locked into technology specific ideas, which in turn created logjams in delivery. That is not a particularly wise way to proceed, so the technology neutrality of this Bill is particularly welcome.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton believes that the Conservative party is leading the way in information technology he should reflect on the remarks of his hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) on Second Reading. He made it quite clear that he was on his own in the previous Administration in trying to drive ideas forward. I made some observations on Second Reading about the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) to illustrate the power of the internet. I had searched a site that seemed to be owned by the Conservative party or a close partner, and when I clicked on the button for the hon. Member for Aldershot, I got a photograph of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South, which seemed a slightly odd link. Perhaps that simply illustrates that the Conservative party does not have technology organised quite as slickly as it claims. I welcome the Bill and I wish it a speedy progress.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) wish to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): I was waiting to hear your comments first, Mr. Maxton, about the request that has been made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall deal with that. It is the first time that a Clerk has used a laptop computer. It was agreed some time ago as an experiment by the Chairmen's Panel that, if both the Clerk and the Chairman agreed, a laptop could be used. However, the ruling of the Speaker in the House, which extends to Committees, is that laptops cannot be used by hon. Members. I will not express a personal opinion but many hon. Members will know what it might be.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Electronic Communications Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I should also like to remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1 in page 1, line 14, leave out 'and' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", physical address, e-mail address and website".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I think everyone knows, we have severe doubts not just about the need for the clause, but the whole of part I. I intend to confine myself, as the Committee stage requires, to the detail of the amendments that have been tabled and selected, but I hope that I will have an opportunity during a stand part debate to put the wider case that part I is completely unnecessary.
<P>
The amendment seeks some necessary clarification. Anyone looking at past legislation will think that simply the name and address of a person should suffice. However, there is some uncertainty about the amount of detail that will suffice for the purpose of registering someone under clause 1. Moreover, are we not considering organisations as well as persons? The clause calls for a register, but that does not involve only individuals. Organisations, including directors who may not be resident in this country, are relevant, so I question the use of the word "person" and the adequacy of requiring only a name and address.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The existence of interact service providers and world-wide organisations with many world-wide directors means that registration is not as easy today as it once was. It used to be relatively easy to register a UK-limited company, but not so in a global world in which the components of a company or provider are much more varied and perhaps more difficult to trace. That makes the traditional sort of registration--of directors at Companies House, for example--more difficult.
The Bill requires the name and address "of that person", but that is not good enough. Our simple amendment is intended to elicit more details, which is in accord with the tenor of the Bill--finding modern ways of communicating with people, establishing who they are and looking at the details. Will the Minister explain what she means by "person" and what recording information she envisages. Will she add, as we request, much more than an address to the requirements? The address--a physical address and an electronic address--must be defined, which would help serve the purposes of this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman's remarks on the sittings motion, particularly his desire for an efficient despatch of the Committee's proceedings and his commitment to pay close attention to the detail of the Bill, which is precisely the purpose of a Standing Committee, and I have no doubt that we shall proceed accordingly.
<P>
I regret that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will not, thanks to the rules of the House, be able to use his laptop as he hoped. I share the desire of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) that, in the not too distant future, we will be able to use individual laptops and even benefit from a knowledge and information management system that would make our proceedings even more efficient and effective than they are now.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton raised an important point. May I begin by reassuring him that the "person" referred to in the clause is indeed the legal person who is providing the scheme. That will often be a company rather than an individual natural person. I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that his well-intentioned amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
We need to provide a register of participants in an approve scheme to serve as a record--available for public inspection by electronic or other means--of who has been approved and exactly what they have been approved for. For those purposes, a physical address is absolutely necessary. It may be necessary to consider for the purposes of clause 6(3)(a), which we shall reach in due course, whether the cryptography support services are provided from premises within the United Kingdom. That will require a physical address.
<P>
I have no doubt that most, if not all, of a trust service provider's routine business and communications with the approvals authority, with its customers and with other parties relying on the service will be conducted electronically. However, the physical address will sometimes be necessary. The approver will need to examine the original application for approval, and part of the ongoing compliance testing, as well as the original approval process, is likely to involve visiting the premises of the trust service provider who is seeking approval. Furthermore, in the event of any wrongdoing or of an allegation of wrongdoing, a physical address might be a more productive vehicle for making complaints or serving legal proceedings, should it come to that. We are all well aware, for instance, of the problem of a dubious mail order company using a box number to conceal its true location. An e-mail address or web address can give misleading information and can be rapidly changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I take it from the Minister's comments that the use of the word "person" is fairly well established in law and that "person" can also mean a company. I shall not press the point further.
<P>
However, the Minister said that part of the verification process might require a visit, which rather perturbs me. Given the nature of electronic communication, trust providers might not be just down the road; they could be in Tuvalu, which might be nice for a visit. Is the Minister saying that trust providers are likely to be approved under her scheme only if they are in Britain or Europe? Does she accept that some providers might be in esoteric locations and could not realistically be visited as she suggests?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> On the first point, I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he sought. The term "person" is perfectly normal in lawmaking.
<P>
The second point is important. We shall deal in greater detail later in part I with the location of trust service providers, from which they might deliver services to businesses or consumers in the United Kingdom. In the situation that the hon. Gentleman described, the appropriate authority would need to decide whether to pay a visit or whether to seek assurance in some other way that a trust service provider based abroad was a satisfactory person to be approved under the scheme.
<P>
My point is that the approvals authority must have the option of visiting the premises of a company or service provider that is seeking approval. To do that, it must have the address. It is also essential that individual Consumers or businesses that rely on an approved provider's services should know where that company or Organisation is based. As I said, and as we know from the abuse of box numbers, it is all too easy for organisations to conceal their real identity or the place of their operation by using a box number, website or e-mail address. The e-mail address, if that is all that is to be required, might not last beyond the initial granting of the approval and a subsequent complaint. We therefore need more permanent information about the physical premises at which the company is, for instance, registered and has its legal headquarters.
<P>
My other point comes back to what I said at the beginning about trying to future proof our legislation. There is a real danger in specifying an e-mail address that we tie ourselves to present technology. At the moment--and this might become more common--many websites have a link that enables people to send e-mail directly to the owner of the site. It might, therefore, he more useful to know a trust service provider's website than a specific e-mail address. We do not know how the use of the web and e-mail will evolve. I would much rather keep the broader term "address" than make the changes that are suggested in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> First, I apologise to you, Mr. Maxton, and to the House. I was so enticed by your statement about the Clerk that I recorded it on my handheld word pad. I assure you that I shall no longer make use of that facility, although I hope that 1 shall be able to do so soon.
<P>
If it is the Government's duty to facilitate new entrants into the market, is not it sensible for the Government to know the addresses of those new entrants?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It was helpful of him to underline why we believe that the clause is drafted properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Will my hon. Friend be kind enough to specify precisely what she means by "name"? I refer to the collapse of the company, H. H. Robertsons, one of whose parent company directors uses several names in Companies House. The ex-hon. Member for Tatton uses his middle name on registers there. Will the names under the Bill be traceable?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Subsection (3) sets out the particulars that must be present in the register. It would be possible for the register to contain other particulars. The approvals authority, business and other consumers must know with whom they are dealing. It is the purpose of the subsection to ensure that proper information is made available.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): The hon. Lady is being typically helpful, but I wish to pursue the point about the address made by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. That could mean virtually anything. Am I right in thinking that "address" in the clause means the registered office address--the one that would be filed with Companies House--when a person is a corporate entity rather than a partnership? Will she clarify the definition of "name"? Will it be the name registered at Companies House, which precedes "Ltd", or will it be possible for the person to use a trading name? We are familiar with letterheads that use X, Y, Z, for example, but without the word "Ltd" appearing in the name.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's intervention is slightly too long.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> None the less, it was an important intervention. We are trying to ensure that we have proper information about the identity and business base of organisations that are seeking approval to provide trust services. In the case of a registered company, under subsection (3) we would seek to obtain the registered company name. If I can supply the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) with further information on that point, I shall do so later in our proceedings.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that our intention is to obtain a permanent and accurate record of the people or companies that are seeking approval under the scheme, so that the approvals authority can undertake the necessary checks. If the service provider is approved, the public and other consumers can have access to a register that will enable them to know who has been approved and to whom they should go if there is a complaint or legal proceedings were to be brought against a company subsequently. The debate has raised important points of detail, but I hope that I have persuaded the Opposition to withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I thank the Minister for explaining the position. I refer to the nature of the services that are provided. Some companies would be obvious. If British Telecom were involved, for example, we would be familiar with it. However, if an entrepreneur, perhaps with the best of motives, set himself up as a trust provider and was able to invest in the equipment, it would be difficult to establish his bona fides. Even if a visit were made, the room could have nice flashing screens that appeared to be the basis of the business but, with wires going through skirting boards, it would be easy to disguise the source of the business and whether all the real equipment doing the work was connected somewhere else.
<P>
From what the Minister said, I am sure that other conditions will be made to try to get round those suspicions. I am grateful to her for her explanation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
3 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 20, after "register", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", including provision to ensure publicity is freely available by electronic means".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 23, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) In discharging his duties the Secretary of State shall ensure publicity is freely available by electonic means".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The amendments are on an allied point, and try to bring the legislation a little more up to date. We are conscious of technology moving apace, and therefore, when looking at the Bill's deeper elements, it seems sensible to recognise that the world may have moved on from the days when people went to a Victorian building to inspect the contents of a file. It also seems sensible to require the Secretary of State, if he has invoked this unnecessary scheme, to at least use modern methods to communicate what he has done. Subsection (4)(a) states that members of the public will be allowed to inspect the contents of the register, so there is a lot to be gained by specifying that they will be allowed to do so by modern and electronic means, rather than by traipsing along some congested high street to try to find the information.
<P>
The amendments would simply require the Secretary of State, when designing his unnecessary schemes, to ensure that people can gain the information by electronic means. By the same token, amendment No. 3 would require him when he is duty bound to publicise something, to make the information freely available by electronic means, and not simply put his thumb on a drawing pin on some parish notice board.
<P>
The amendments are a gentle plea for modernity in this part of the Bill. I can see no reason why the Minister could find an argument not to accept those few lines of sweet reason.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I see that we shall get along splendidly, and I admire the hon. Gentleman's determination to improve the detail of a scheme that he regards as wholly unnecessary. I hope that I can also persuade him that the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is concerned about the issue of charging and, of course, the Bill makes no provision whatever for any charging of fees. The register will therefore be freely available under part I, so there is no need for an amendment to say that it should be available without cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> When I tabled the amendment, I did not have in mind that "freely" would refer to fees. I imagined that the register should merely be open and available rather than without charge. That comes later.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that.
<P>
Nothing in subsection (4) says that the register must be physical and available only by walking along a congested high street to some parish hall notice board. If part I is activated, the Secretary of State, in making such arrangements as he considers appropriate to allow a member of the public to inspect the contents of the register, will want to use the most up-to-date electronic means. In the same way, we already ensure that information published by our Department is available through the world wide web. Therefore, there is no need to specify that the register should be made available electronically.
<P>
Under the clause, the arrangements will be such as the Secretary of State considers appropriate in order to allow members of the public to inspect the register and to ensure that any withdrawal or modification of an approval is publicised in a way that draws it to the attention of people who might be interested, which might be by adding the information to the register. Electronic publication, with or without additional physical publication, will clearly be appropriate in both cases. The form that it takes will depend on what is being publicised and on how the technology has developed and is being deployed at the time. Specifying the objectives, as the current drafting does, is more likely to stand the test of time. As the clause already refers to allowing members of the public to inspect the register's contents, and as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton seems to have accepted my point that there is no question of a fee being charged, I hope that he will accept that his amendment is unnecessary and will therefore agree to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): The Minister has helped us understand what she means by "technology neutral". Incidentally, Opposition Members are keeping a word count of certain buzz words that appear in her speeches. That is certainly one of them, and we are watching out for a few others, too. We can have a punt later about the number of times that Microsoft's name is dropped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> A sweepstake.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Yes, a sweepstake.
<P>
The difficulty with the hon. Lady's argument is that, taken to its logical conclusion, the entire Bill would be neutral in terms of technology, and would be impossible. At some point in the Bill we must refer to communication by electronic means, and we should not run away from that. I am slightly worried that in her every response the Minister will come up with such catch phrases, when it would be easy to accept the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton. It is an inspired suggestion that deserves to be taken on board. It would cost nothing to have such publicity on the Government's websites, for example, or to ensure that it is accessible through electronic means. Perhaps she is reluctant to embrace any of the new technology in case she breaches the artificial rule that she has invented for the purposes of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Based on what the Minister has said, once again we shall show our innate sense of decency. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It might be helpful if I briefly mentioned the progress being made with self-regulation and the Scheme that is being developed by the Alliance for Electronic Business. I seek your guidance, Mr. Maxton--
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. A few days ago, the Alliance for Electronic Business informed me that it was developing a scheme for self-regulation and that the tScheme prospectus had been presented to Ministers. Other Committee members have only just been given that document. It is a large document that is crucial to the debate on part I, and we have had no time to read it. The Minister is about to explain the scheme from the privileged position of having read the document. We have not. That makes a nonsense of our proceedings, and I respectfully request a half-hour adjournment to enable us to read it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not have the power to adjourn the Committee. That is not a point of order but a debating point.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have just ruled that it was not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On point of order, Mr. Maxton. I should like to know at which stage in our consideration of the Bill we might consider the document, As you will be aware, none of us apart from the privileged few, have had an opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It was just dumped in the corner.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As my hon. Friend said, the document was dumped in the corner. There was no announcement or pre-publicity. I seek your guidance, Mr. Maxton, but I note that we shall be considering clause 15 later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I thought that it was a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Given that we have had no chance to consider the draft prospectus here, when we come to the sunset clauses in part I, will we be given a full opportunity to debate the relevant points that will have by then come to light from this document?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. I am sure that all hon. Members will find opportunities to raise the matters that were in that report at different stages during our consideration of the Bill. That is a matter for members of the Committee. The document is available.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton. Perhaps I can seek some guidance. On Second Reading, I explained in some detail that it is the Government's preference to proceed by way of self-regulation. We have been working with the Alliance for Electronic Business to that end. I explained that we were making good progress and were awaiting the AEB's prospectus for the tScheme. I received that prospectus last night. I am glad to tell the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that the AEB made copies available this morning, and that there are copies for all members of the Committee this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It was made available to me at 2.20 pm--10 minutes before the Committee started.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. I misunderstood the position. I wonder whether it would be convenient if I were to circulate to all hon. Members a note setting out a comparison between the objectives that we have set for the scheme and the provisions in the draft prospectus. I shall be happy to return to the issue under clause 15 when we deal with the sunset clause in part I. If you feel that that would be satisfactory, I shall be happy to move clause stand part formally.

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, leave out lines 3 to 7 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are providing or seeking approval to provide cryptography support services, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 16, in clause 6, page 6, leave out line 8.
<P>
No. 17, in clause 6, page 6, leave out lines 9 and 10.
<P>
No. 18, in clause 6, page 6, line 12, leave out "or" and insert "and".
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I trust that we shall have the chance to debate the wider implications of this part of the Bill later.
<P>
The amendments go to the heart of whether this part of the Bill will be effected. The amendments pinpoint the crucial issue of whether anything that the Minister might be trying to do in setting up a register will be implemented. At present, the language of the Bill is pretty confusing. The provisions in clause 2(1)(a) and (b) overlap, They are almost nonsensical. Subsection (1)(a) refers to persons who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are providing cryptography support services in the United Kingdom or are proposing to do so".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (1)(b) states that the service providers must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"seek approval in respect of any such services that they are providing, or are proposing to provide, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (a) already uses the phrases "are providing" and "proposing to do so", so it is duplication in paragraph (b). The difference between paragraphs (a) and (b) is the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 4 would amalgamate paragraphs (a) and (b), and would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are providing or seeking approval to provide cryptography support services, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have grave reservations about this part of the Bill altogether, but in that it attempts to make it more understandable, my amendment is reasonable. Perhaps the Minister can decipher the difference between paragraphs (a) and (b) and tell us how they relate to each other. Although I have struggled to understand them, I still need counselling from the Minister on them.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 taken together are designed to deal with clause 6(3), which could result in massive problems of jurisdiction, such as the need to register every service or trust provider in the world. Clause 6(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"cryptography support services are provided in the United Kingdom if--
<P>
(a) they are provided from premises in the United Kingdom".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suppose that we can all understand that. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) they are provided to a person who is the United Kingdom when he makes use of the services".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could refer to almost any cryptography service in the world, because we all know that, in e-commerce and e-communications, where people use a service does not matter. If I were allowed to use my laptop, I could plug in to another part of the globe.
<P>
Clause 6(3) continues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) they are provided to a person who makes use of the services for the purposes of a business carried on in the United Kingdom or from premises in the United Kingdom."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could refer to almost any service provider in the world.
<P>
I am attempting to disentangle paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and to clarify them by replacing the word "or" with the word "and". We want to swap the words "or" and "and". Clause 6(3) essentially states that every cryptography service in the world must be registered with the British Government. Although that might provide many jobs at the Department of Trade and Industry, I am not sure that it is a practical suggestion. To be convincing in her response, the Minister needs to give some detailed explanation of how the ands and the ors connect in clause 6(3) and how paragraphs (a) and (b) overlap in clause 2(1).
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall do my best to provide the detailed explanation that the hon. Gentleman seeks. I regret that clause 2 has confused him somewhat, and I shall try to clarify it. I shall explain what the current construction of clause 2, taken with clause 6, will do in terms of the breadth and scope of an approvals regime. We are concerned with providers based in the United Kingdom who may wish to provide services to users either here or abroad. We are also concerned with users in the United Kingdom, whether they use UK-based providers or trust service providers based overseas. We are not concerned with a service that has no connection with the United Kingdom--in other words, a service based outside the United Kingdom and used only by people outside the United Kingdom. That intention is given effect under clauses 2 and 6.
<P>
Clause 2(1) will put a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that arrangements are in place for granting approval to those who provide services in the United Kingdom, or who wish to do so, and who seek approval for any such service that they are providing or wish to provide in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The arrangements that the Secretary of State is obliged to introduce cover the approval of services that a person is providing or may wish to provide. They do not cover the approval of those people.
<P>
In other words, the Bill is not intended to provide the Secretary of State with powers to prevent services from being provided. That is an extremely important point. Even if the statutory scheme under part I is put into effect, trust service providers, wherever they are based, will be under no compulsion to seek approval. They will be free to provide their services from the United Kingdom or to users in the United Kingdom without seeking any approval. The approval scheme is an optional extra that enables customers--businesses and individuals--to have the added assurance that the approved trust service provider meets certain criteria.
<P>
Clause 6(3) goes on, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, to explain that cryptography support services are provided in the United Kingdom in three sets of circumstances, the first being if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"they are provided from premises in the United Kingdom".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The second set of circumstances is when the services
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are provided to a person who is in the United Kingdom when he makes use of the services"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that could include the hon. Gentleman on his laptop accessing a service that is based outside the United Kingdom. Thirdly, the services are provided, whether from inside the United Kingdom or abroad, if they are rendered to a person who makes use of them for business purposes inside the United Kingdom.
<P>
The Bill is carefully designed to ensure that the approval scheme provides the maximum benefit to United Kingdom businesses and consumers. We have included specifically the ability for trust service providers located outside the United Kingdom to be approved, if they wish to make services available to people inside the United Kingdom, and for trust service providers based in the United Kingdom who wish to market their services abroad to do so, but with the added benefit of being an approved provider.
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton himself said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Britain can and must be the nerve centre of the worldwide business revolution."--[Official Report, 29 November 1999; Vol. 340, c. 50.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with him and, having heard him say that, I find it a little difficult to understand why he tabled the amendments. In striking contrast to what he said about his intention, amendment No. 4 would require approvals to be available even when the service provider was not proposing to provide services in the United Kingdom. In other words, the approvals arrangement that the Secretary of State would have to introduce would have to cover, for example, providers in Russia who wanted approval for services delivered only to people in Russia. We do not want that nor, do I believe, does the hon. Gentleman. Within both the European Union and the United Nations frameworks, we are pursuing arrangements for the mutual recognition of service providers who are located in different jurisdictions. We certainly do not want the United Kingdom approvals arrangements to claim a global monopoly.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 would have another unwelcome effect. When I explained our intentions behind clauses 2 and 6, I said that the arrangements that the Secretary of State could introduce under part I of the Bill were limited to the approval of services that people were providing or were intending to provide. Unfortunately, the amendment refers to people who:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are providing or seeking approval to provide cryptography support services, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would introduce the idea that our approvals arrangement should allow for bodies to seek approval to provide services and inevitably imply that, if approval was not forthcoming, those services could not be provided. That is not the intention of the Bill. As I said earlier--I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept it--providers will be free to provide services, whether or not they are approved. The scheme is voluntary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister used the word "allow", but she tried to rebut my argument on the grounds that the amendment would compel bodies to seek approval to provide services. It would not.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I well understand the difficulty of drafting amendments without the benefit of help from parliamentary counsel. Labour Members are all too familiar with that. I understand that the hon. Gentleman does not seek to achieve the end that I described, but the unfortunate implication of his drafting is that approval would be necessary to provide any services at all. That is not the Bill's intention or effect. I accept that the hon. Gentleman does not want a mandatory approval scheme any more than we do, but the danger of amendment No. 4 would be to introduce uncertainty on the matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 16 would reduce the scope of the approvals mechanism by removing the first of the three qualifications for services to be treated as having been provided in the United Kingdom. It would remove the condition that services can be deemed to be provided in the UK irrespective of where they are provided. A business operating, say, from Germany but supplying services to UK consumers and businesses should have the opportunity to demonstrate that it meets the standards required by the UK scheme, and we have provided for that.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 removes the second condition under the subsection, namely that services can be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided to a person who is in the United Kingdom when he makes use of the services".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would have the undesirable effect of requiring that the scheme cover only those services provided in the UK to people using them for business purposes. I doubt that the intention of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton was to limit the approval scheme to people providing services to businesses, as distinct from individual consumers. That would be a pity.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would replace the third provision, which requires that people who make use of the services will do so
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for the purposes of a business carried on in the United Kingdom or from premises in the United Kingdom",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with a provision that they have to do so
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for the purposes of a business carried on in the United Kingdom and from premises in the United Kingdom".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that would narrow the scope of the approval arrangements undesirably. It would prevent someone from being approved for offering services to a business operating in the UK that had its premises in another country. More than once, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton has rightly said that one consequence of electronic commerce is that services can easily be provided from a base in one country to businesses and individual consumers in other countries. I see no reason to reduce the scope of the approval scheme, as amendment No. 18, possibly unintentionally, would.
<P>
It is not clear whether the amendments are designed to deny approval to people based overseas who provide services to the UK, or to cast the net of the approval scheme wider, which I think and hope is not the hon. Gentleman's intention. Either way, they would not improve the Bill. I hope that my necessarily detailed explanation of what we seek to achieve will satisfy him, and that he will kindly agree to withdraw the amendment. If he does not do so, I ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, and I hope that she can clarify a few points. She made it clear that becoming approved members would be optional. Will she tell us more about the criteria that she envisages being used to determine whether someone should go on the list? Also, if people who have met those criteria and are on her list are subsequently found to be deficient or to let customers down, how will she prevent the dissatisfied customers from knocking at her door and demanding compensation? They will assume that an operator must be up to scratch if it has the imprimatur of a Government scheme. Secondly, in those circumstances, how will she avoid the scheme being discredited by members of the approved list who let down not only themselves but everyone whom she has approved?
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the scheme is optional, can the Minister assure the Committee that no political pressure to become members will be put on the major players in the business. They may be dissatisfied with her choice of criteria. It is for the Minister to decide what the criteria will be; no reference back to the House or any other test of opinion will be involved in determining them. If major players in the field are dissatisfied with the scheme, can she guarantee that no political pressure will be put on them to join it, and that no disparaging remarks or implications will be made about those who do not join it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Minister has made a fair stab at disinterring the real meaning of these rather confused clauses, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton has rightly drawn attention. If I understand her correctly, she is saying that foreign service providers will be at liberty to choose whether to seek approval under the voluntary statutory scheme. To put my mind at rest, will she explain what form of publicity the Department envisages it will use to advertise the benefits of statutory approval to those foreign service providers who want to take advantage of accreditation or approval under the scheme? Will she tell us how she believes foreign service providers will find out about the scheme?
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Amendment No. 16 would breach the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> What is left of it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> What is left of it. The amendment would breach those rules, because foreign service providers would be excluded from the scheme, which would be held to benefit providers.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) is right on that last point, and I am grateful to him for drawing our attention to it.
<P>
On the points made by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), the criteria for approval under the scheme might be similar, if we activate part I, to the criteria for the self-regulation scheme that we have already published and about which I shall circulate a note. Those criteria will include matters such as competence and technical and management ability. Later in the clause, we shall deal with the requirements and conditions that can be imposed under the approvals scheme as well as to provisions on the withdrawal of approval from a provider who is found wanting. If a provider misbehaved, approved status could be withdrawn and publicity given to that fact.
<P>
Let me stress that the scheme is entirely voluntary, whether it is self-regulatory or whether it is put on a statutory basis under part I. There will be no pressure to join and no disparaging remarks about any provider who does not join, but it will be clear who has the status of an approved provider and who does not because the scheme will be publicised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister may be able to allay my fears. What the clause really means depends on which end of the telescope is used to view it. At present, given her explanation, it essentially means that anyone who falls into the categories defined in clause 6(3)(a), (b) and (c) will qualify for the voluntary registration scheme. I am concerned that that might be inverted, so that anyone who falls within clause 6(3)(a), (b) and (c) might be sucked into the scheme and compelled to do certain things, in which case the whole area of jurisdiction becomes impractical and totally undesirable.  Will the Minister confirm that by qualifying under clause 6(3)(a), (b) or (c), the provider may be deemed to qualify for the ridiculous voluntary scheme that the Minister proposes in part I, but that no other kind of arm-twisting or obligation will ensue? Is that a fair summary?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Leaving aside the hon. Gentleman's aspersions on the scheme, the answer is yes. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred to a German provider who supplies services to businesses and consumers in the UK being able to apply for approval under the scheme. A British provider who provides services to consumers and businesses in the UK would likewise be able to do so, as would a British-based provider who wanted to market services to German businesses and consumers. A German-based company, which marketed services only to German businesses and consumers could not apply. I have no doubt that under a statutory but none the less voluntary scheme or the self-regulatory scheme that has been developed by the Alliance for Electronic Business, there will be ample publicity to ensure that any company, wherever it is based, that supplies services in this marketplace is aware of the availability of the approvals scheme and will be able to judge whether there are business benefits in seeking approval under the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I benefited from the Minister's earlier explanation--which was crystal clear--about a service provider in Germany who might seek to supply services within the United Kingdom, but who would not be compelled to sign up to the scheme. What manner of publicity will there be? How would that hypothetical German service provider discover the benefits of the scheme, which is the subject of the clause?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That will be a matter for the Alliance for Electronic Business. I have no doubt that it will ensure effective publicity for providers who wish to take advantage of the scheme, not least because of the range of businesses that are already involved in developing it. If a statutory but still voluntary scheme were to be created under part I, we would ensure that publicity was given to it.
<P>
I have dealt with the group of amendments and I trust that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will feel able to withdraw amendment No. 4.
<P>
<B> Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> One question, which the Minister did not answer, gives me the greatest concern. Throughout our debate, analogies with the world of financial services will be drawn. It is because of the expertise and skill that we have in such matters that we feel confident that we can gain our fair share of the world of e-commerce and the services that it will require. I am thinking, in particular, of the Bank of England and its past experience.
<P>
The Bank of England used to have an approved deposit takers list, which included Bank of Credit and Commerce International. When BCCI went bust, some local authorities, which had deposited money and lost tens of millions of pounds, complained that they had assumed that it was a worthwhile Organisation because it was included in the Bank of England's list. The Governor said that they had all known for years that it was not a bank in which one should deposit money. The approval of the deposit takers list does not mean that we guarantee the deposits.
<P>
Obviously the Bank of England suffered a considerable loss of prestige. Will the Minister now answer the question that I asked earlier? If, after having met the criteria, those on the list nevertheless let their customers down, how will the Minister avoid her Department and her scheme suffering the same fate as ultimately befell the deposit takers scheme?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I have made it clear that it is a voluntary scheme, and that under part I, there is no provision for it to be made mandatory. We shall not follow that course, unlike the previous Government. Whether the scheme is self-regulatory or statutory, it will be clear what criteria approved service providers are judged on, and what conditions or requirements they must meet to be approved.  We have also made it clear under what circumstances approval would be withdrawn. It would be a requirement of the approval scheme to ensure the compatibility of the service providers with the criteria, which would be monitored so that people would continue to trust the providers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Once again, the Minister has helped by deciphering some of the more complicated parts of the Bill. A plea for plainer language would be supported by both sides of the Committee. Too many of the Bill's provisions overlap. They are difficult to understand and unnecessarily complicated. We shall be coming to some of them in a moment, but in the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 2, leave out lines 14 to 17.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 21, in page 2, leave out lines 34 to 36.
<P>
No. 8, in page 2, leave out from line 43 to end of line 6 on page 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The amendments are intended to probe the Government's intentions on one of our major causes of concern, which is the extensive reservation of secondary powers. I spoke about the Bill's light touch, but we are concerned about the secondary powers. The Government's summary of responses to the draft Bill acknowledged that there was much concern that the Secretary of State's powers under secondary legislation were very wide and potentially incompatible with the desire for a light-touch approach to regulation. I share those concerns and I am especially worried by the subsections, which the amendments would delete.
<P>
The Secretary of State is being given the power, without the need for further legislation, to impose conditions on the granting of licences or approval, which need not be related to the provision of services. Clause 5 defines more clearly the conditions that may be imposed, but does not seem to constitute significant limits on the extent or relevance of the conditions. The Secretary of State has been given a free hand to impose any condition that seems appropriate to him. I am sure that the Minister will understand our concern about the ex tent of the Secretary of State's potential grasp. In view of the slight misunderstanding earlier, I do not mean understanding when I use the word "grasp".
<P>
Given the history of proposals for regulation of cryptography in the past, such wide powers are alarming. I seem to remember that the notion was floated of making a governmental crypto-technology called cloud cover which has since been abandoned. Although such an idea has been rejected, along with the proposals for a mandatory scheme, my reading of the Bill is that the powers conferred on the Secretary of State could make the introduction of similarly restrictive and commercially damaging conditions for approval possible without the need for further legislation.
<P>
Does the Minister agree with my interpretation of the Bill about the wide-ranging powers that are being given to the Secretary of State? If so, it is not likely to inspire business confidence or make a voluntary scheme as good as it should be. I look forward to the Minister's giving us at least some clues about the sort of conditions that the Secretary of State had in mind when drafting the clause.

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I thought that we would discuss amendment No.8, too.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I mentioned amendment No. 8 at the beginning. The amendment that has been moved is No. 20.
<P>
3.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Shall I speak to amendment No. 8 now, or are you soliciting the Minister's response to amendment No. 20?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 8 has not been moved. It is grouped for debate with amendment No. 20. The hon. Gentleman may speak to amendment No. 8 at any time during the debate on amendment No. 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
Subsection (5) is almost nonsensical. It is otiose. The description of what the Secretary of State might do if he were to invoke part I is extremely long winded. The subsection is unnecessary. It is covered in other parts of the Bill that allow the Secretary of State to create an approvals system. It is an example of the unnecessarily cumbersome language of the Bill, and I do not understand what it adds to the Bill. The Secretary of State's powers provided elsewhere in part I pretty much cover this power. I should like the Minister to give a proper explanation of what subsection (5) adds to the Bill, in the absence of which we shall vote to remove it.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I apologise for my confusion about procedure a moment ago.
<P>
I have considerable sympathy with what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said about complex drafting. We would all like the drafting to be much simpler, but this is, unfortunately, a complicated and technical issue. The amendments would severely limit or remove the Secretary of State's ability to impose specific conditions on an approval in addition to the need for the applicant to meet the technical and other general requirements specified in statutory instruments.
<P>
The scheme under part I will be voluntary. Service providers will not seek approval unless they consider it worthwhile and believe that they will derive some business advantage from doing so. Subsection (2)(d) will allow an applicant who has applied for approval to refuse an approval that is offered if it is in different terms from that for which he applied. In other words, if conditions are imposed on the approval that differ from those that the applicant expected or considered reasonable, he will not have to proceed with the application.
<P>
The conditions referred to in the clause include requirements to provide information, other forms of co-operation with the approvals authority or other relevant authorities such as, for example, the Data Protection Registrar, the operation of a complaints procedure and the deployment of same general information security requirement, which might be extremely pertinent in the case of commercially sensitive data. Subsection (5) specifies in some detail the nature of the conditions that might be imposed, and it is that detail that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton wants to delete.
<P>
The subsection specifies how approvals authority and its agents will be given the power to obtain information from approved service providers. Clearly, they need that power. Information needs to be supplied as specified in the conditions. The subsection also provides that the conditions can continue even after an approval has been withdrawn. Given that the scheme will be voluntary and a service provider is free to leave it at any time, such a condition is essential to prevent a provider from evading his obligations under the scheme by simply withdrawing from it.
<P>
In other words, a customer of an approved service or someone else who is relying on that service rightly, expects certain standards and rights of redress, because the provider is approved. It would not be right if those expectations could not be met simply because the provider withdrew from the scheme--for example, soon after a complaint was made.
<P>
As for the self-regulatory scheme, the Alliance for Electronic Business proposes to deal with that problem through a provision in the contract between itself and the approved provider. Therefore, requirements to provide information that is relevant to approved services could still continue under the subsection after withdrawal of the approval for those services. Similarly, complaints about the services that were approved at the time that the alleged problem occurred would still have to be dealt with, even if the provider had withdrawn from the approvals scheme.
<P>
The subsection provides also for further delegation. Any approvals authority, whether Oftel or the Alliance for Electronic Business's tScheme will not carry out all the work itself. Specialised aspects will be delegated further to specialised bodies. It makes sense, for example, to allow for conditions to be imposed that require information to be given directly to such bodies, rather than being routed by the approvals authority.
<P>
In response to the hon. Members for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) and for Rutland and Melton, I am happy to look further at the wording of the subsections to see whether they can be simplified without reducing the necessary power of the approvals authority under the scheme to obtain information or impose appropriate conditions upon those seeking and gaining approval. In the light of both my explanation and assurance, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said that he wanted to press amendment No. 8 to a Division. However, it has not been moved because it is grouped with another amendment. If members of the Committee really wish to push an amendment to a vote, it is at my discretion to allow it to be put formally at the point in the Bill to which it pertains, and I am happy to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton, for your guidance. It certainly was our intention to press the amendment to a Division. However, what the Minister said was music to my ears and, I think, to other members of the Committee. Her readiness to table some amendments that might simplify the language used in the Bill is welcome. It is an offer that I invite her to extend to a large portion of part I of the Bill, but I sense from her smile that that might be pushing my luck. I shall not press amendment No. 8 to a Division if I can elicit from the Minister--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) cannot enter the Room as she is not a member of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I shall reconsider my wish to press the amendment to a Division if I can push the Minister a little further and receive her confirmation that she intends definitely to table an amendment that would simplify this part of the Bill. On that basis, or if she notifies Opposition Members that that will be the case, I shall not press the amendment to a Division. In the absence of such confirmation, I shall consider what action to take at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It may assist Opposition Members if I repeated my undertaking. I shall reconsider the wording of the subsections to see whether they can be simplified without damaging the necessary powers of the approvals authority. In the light of that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I, too, thank the Minister for her undertaking. The two words that are needed in Bills, especially this one, as we do not want to discourage electronic communication and trading, are "clarity" and "simplification". Given that the Minister is prepared to consider the matter and perhaps the whole Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 36, leave out from "approval" to end of line 38.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 22, in page 3, line 12, leaveout "(d)" and insert "(c)".
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Our purpose in amendment No. 5 is, once again, to remove duplication. If I can live up to my own standards, I shall explain it in plain English. We believe that subsection (3)(d) repeats subsection (3)(b). They are certainly similar, and as they set the same condition, paragraph (d) is not needed. At the moment, the clause requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied that the person is, according to paragraph (b),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a person in relation to whom such other requirements as may be prescribed are, and will continue to be, satisfied".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a catch-all provision by which the Secretary of State can set certain standards and demand that they be met. Paragraph (d) states that the person must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise ... fit and proper ... to be approved in respect of those services".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems incomprehensible that the Secretary of State, when considering paragraph (b), would not want to satisfy himself that the person was fit and proper. What is outlined in paragraph (d) should already be satisfied in the normal course of events by the terms set in paragraph (b). I cannot see that that repetition adds a lot. In the interests of brevity, simplicity, plain language, clarity and all those standards that are so dear to my heart, we should drop paragraph (d).
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The interpretation by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton of the paragraphs is plausible, but I would like to venture another. My reading of subsection (3) is that paragraph (a) ostensibly refers to technical requirements, while paragraph (b) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such other requirements as may be prescribed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (d), however, establishes another category of fitness and properness relating to the person that is not picked up by paragraphs (a) and (b). What is the meaning in paragraph (d) of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise a fit and proper person"?
<P>
To wit--to what--[Laughter.] Let the record show that I said what. Amendment No. 5 seeks to remove the words in paragraph (d), because what they refer to is unclear. I want enlightenment on them, given what is referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I should like to speak to amendment No. 22 with wit, if not what, on the issue of a fit and proper person. The amendment would remove from the Secretary of State the power to require information relating to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be approved as a supplier. The clause could be another example of the Government's awarding themselves more powers than would be proper for them to have, but perhaps the Minister can put me wise on that. I am not attempting to be difficult; I just want to pursue and probe the point a little further.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The explanatory notes refer to relevant factors, including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any known contraventions of provisions of this legislation, and convictions for offences involving fraud or dishonesty, or engaging in discriminatory practices, or engaging in deceitful, oppressive, unfair or improper business practices."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is reasonable that someone with a history of fraud, for example, should be barred from gaining a licence that would help him gain access to potentially sensitive, personal material. However, the Bill allows the Secretary of State too much scope. Different Secretaries of State are likely to have a different opinion of what is fit and proper. The amendment deals with not particularly the fit and proper condition but how the Secretary of State can proceed towards a decision.
<P>
Subsection (6) properly places limits on the information that can be asked for legally when the Secretary of State is making a decision. Notwithstanding that, the Secretary of State is still entitled to ask for information relevant to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person. The precise wording that is used in that context is crucial. Who can say what information relates to being a fit and proper person? Will the Secretary of State be entitled to inspect criminal records, bar bills, school reports or to ask the wife about the husband or the husband about the wife? It could be claimed that such information was relevant to a person's character, depending on how far one was willing to stretch the definition. I should be grateful to the Minister if she could elucidate the type of information that would be needed. Will she consider tightening up the wording of the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I read the Bill carefully and first shared the concern of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton about its use of English. I thought that that was because of my secondary modem education, but now that I know that that worry extends to ex-pupils of Merchant Taylors', too, I am satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> And Oxford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> And Oxford, and elsewhere.
<P>
I cannot envisage an immediate solution to the problem under the rules that currently govern the House. We are trying to legislate for a technology that is moving at a pace that we do not understand. If we removed the catch-all phrases, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton rightly described them, we might be leaving ourselves wide open to abuse from an application of technology that we have yet to envisage. Will the Minister confirm that part of the logic behind the drafting of the provision is an attempt to maintain technological neutrality?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall begin by referring to amendment No. 5. It seems straightforward that the fitness and properness of a person applying to be an approved provider should be a criterion that the approvals body must take into consideration. The propriety, honesty, competence and integrity of a person or body should be assessed in determining whether they should be approved as a trust service provider. We are dealing with the competence of individuals who have responsibility for the provision of services and that of the company or Organisation itself. In dealing with individuals, the Secretary of State may well want to take into account the competence and ability of a company's directors and key employees.
<P>
The phrase "fit and proper person" is not unusual in our legislation, and I am surprised that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton wants to remove it from the Bill. It appears in section 27(2) of the Financial Services Act 1986--a previous, Conservative Government understood its important in relation to financial services--and in clause 37(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Bill. It is clearly important that fitness and propriety are taken into account.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton seemed to be arguing that the matter could be dealt with under paragraph (b), instead. However, the two provisions have different functions. Paragraph (b) is designed to ensure that the approvals authority is satisfied that specific requirements, including, for example, technical requirements, can be met. Paragraph (d) is designed to ensure that the requirements that must be met include the requirement that a person should be fit and proper. It would be possible through a statutory instrument to include fitness and propriety in the requirements under paragraph (b), but that would mean that it would be up to the Secretary of State, not the House, to decide whether the test of being a fit and proper person was a requirement to be taken into account. It is right to specify that in the Bill, and for Parliament to specify that being a fit and proper person must be a requirement for someone who is granted approval. It should not be left to the Secretary of State's discretion in making provision under paragraph (b).
<P>
Amendment No. 22, which the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare tabled, would, as he said, remove the Secretary of State's ability to impose conditions on a person in relation to the provision of information or the imposition of a complaints procedure in matters relating to whether a person is fit and proper. That, too, would have some rather undesirable consequences. It would mean that the Secretary of State would not be able to make it a condition of approval that a company such as a bank should provide information to the approvals body about its competence or professionalism. Indeed, information relevant to deciding whether someone is a fit and proper person might include previous criminal convictions of directors or of the company itself. Under our proposals, the seriousness of the convictions would be taken into account in deciding whether the applicant is a fit and proper person. However, if that is to be done, the Secretary of State must be able to impose, conditions requiring the provision of information that will enable that judgment to be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> What is the Minister's opinion of "fit and proper"? Is there a well-established understanding of exactly what that expression encompasses? That is at the heart of what I was worried about. Perhaps she will tell me that it is clear what that means from established practice.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As "fit and proper person" is a well-known legal concept, especially in the regulation of financial services, a body of established cases and practice exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Can the Minister help me on that point? She said that the phrase "fit and proper person" is defined in financial services legislation. However, would a service provider who had been convicted of a serious sexual assault fall outside that definition?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I confess that that example had not occurred to me, so I shall need to consider it. The Secretary of State would consider such matters, as would the approvals body, if part I were activated. Under a self-regulatory scheme, the Alliance for Electronic Business would consider which criminal convictions should exclude someone from being defined as a fit and proper person. I agree with the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare that someone convicted of serious fraud would not be a fit and proper person in that context. Clearly, convictions relating to data protection or commercial confidentiality would be directly relevant to whether it would be appropriate to approve a person under the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> In everything that the Minister has said in the past few minutes, her use of the word "person" seems to apply only to an individual, yet it has been said that it refers to a corporate body. Does the word "person" refer to a corporate body as well as to an individual? In considering whether someone should be deemed fit, would lack of experience in the field risk exclusion from approval?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Throughout the Bill, as in other Bills, the word "person" refers to both a natural and a legal person. If the provider were a company, the fitness and properness test could be applied to the company and to its directors and key employees. It is important to assess both the company--the legal person--and key individuals in it. Assessing the fitness and properness of individuals will be part of determining whether the company is fit and proper.
<P>
The approval authority will consider the knowledge that an individual or company, through its employees and directors, must have. Clearly, someone who had bought a computer off the shelf and decided to set up a trust service provider would be unlikely to meet the technical requirements for approval under the scheme.
<P>
I want to make one other point. I hope that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare will forgive me, but I noticed that he used the word "licence" in this and earlier debates. To avoid doubt, I stress that we are dealing with a voluntary approval scheme. People will not have to apply for a licence before providing a service. That would be a mandatory requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I understand the point that the Minister makes. I hope that, if I used that word, she will give me licence for doing so.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I simply wanted that point to be made clear for the record. I hope that I have dealt with all the points that have been made, and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have listened carefully. As in other clauses, an unnecessary overlap exists between paragraphs. It is difficult to imagine what "other requirements" might be requested under subsection (3)(b), and why that is not covered by subsection (3)(c), in which the person must continue to be able and willing to comply with any requirements that the Secretary of State proposes. That strikes me as being complete duplication, and further tidying up would have been preferable. I accept what the Minister told the Committee: a trust service provider must be a fit and proper person. It is no part of our case that there should be any risk that a person should not be. We want the provision to be drafted in the best possible way to ensure clarity and simplicity in such an important area of law. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 42, after "regulations", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ", which shall include a procedure for appeal to an independent party who shall not be an employee of the Crown".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 9, leave out from 'information' to end of line 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We have been discussing the need for someone to be a fit and proper person. An appeals procedure is important because, by being refused permission to be a trust service provider, someone will have been deemed not to be a fit and proper person, which might have far-reaching consequences for his or her public reputation. In a democracy with all the procedures that have been laid down for it in law, it is damning formally to deem someone not to be fit and proper. There is no adequate appeals procedure in the Bill for such a person to complain about that decision. That is unjust, and Members of Parliament should enact laws that are just and do not give rise to injustice.
<P>
Later in our proceedings, we shall consider setting up a separate body to administer regulations that are designed never to be used, but if they are invoked--we hope that they never will be, as I am sure does the Minister, although she is determined that such provisions remain in the Bill--someone may be maligned, without having any redress.
<P>
The amendment would remove from the ministerial structure a provision that risks being some kind of cosy, friendly arrangement that will never be aired properly and place it under the responsibility of an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"independent party who shall not be an employee of the Crown".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is always a risk that the person might be a good chum of the Prime Minister, but at least the whole process would be more open. It should be put out to a third party. If it is not, there will be cover-ups, things will be kicked into the long grass and someone who has been refused approval will not know why. He will not have any right of appeal. He may be unable to penetrate the governmental system to find out why he was refused approval. Parliamentary questions might not elicit the details necessary to find out why such a decision was made. If the person was a foreigner, he might find it more difficult to discover the reason for his refusal. The amendment would set in place an appeals procedure that is outside the system, which otherwise could end up cosily administering this voluntary, compulsory, regulatory, statutory, ridiculous scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Under that innovative proposal, does my hon. Friend envisage the Commissioner for Public Appointments overseeing the appointment of that third party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It might not be an immediate Parliamentary matter, but it is important that such a person should be outside the immediate bailiwick of the Department. He or she could be a recognised expert, a judge, a professor or an academic who understands such matters, but not a cosy employee of the Crown. If there is to be such a voluntary, statutory, regulatory scheme, it is important that someone should not be slurred inadvertently by being deemed not to be fit and proper. I urge the Minister, on the grounds simply of justice, to analyse how such a system would work, to consider the amendment and to reflect on whether it is quite simply a matter of fairness.
<P>
I am speaking to amendment No. 6. I am less concerned about amendment No. 9, which can be regarded as a consequential amendment. I shall not press it because it only half links with what I am saying. I feel strongly about amendment No. 6 and hope that the Minister will react to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support my hon. Friend's timely amendment. In the construct of the clause, under the cosy word "voluntary", the Secretary of State is being allowed a tremendous and unhealthy amount of discretion. That goes to the heart of why this part of the Bill is wrong. It tries to predict what we cannot predict and pre-empt problems that may arise. As was said on Second Reading, the problem with part I is that we are having a virtual debate because all the problems have yet to occur.
<P>
The Bill is too incestuous, but we are trying to break the chain. The Minister may tell us that the decisions about who is a fit and proper person, the other requirements and the determinations that may be prescribed under clause 2(4) will all be subject to judicial review. If the Minister agrees that that is the case--I shall be even more worried if she does not--surely it is better  to provide a mechanism in the Bill for review of ministerial decisions rather than to rely simply on the common law.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton for agreeing not to press amendment No. 9. 1 agree that is not particularly important and it does not relate closely to amendment No. 6.
<P>
Our policy is to promote the availability of high-quality services to the public by encouraging the development of a kitemark. The Government hope for, and actively encourage the development of, a self-regulatory scheme to deliver that objective. If part I were enacted and a statutory scheme were set up, it would still be a light-touch scheme. Most important, it would be a voluntary scheme. The Government have always been committed to voluntary regulation in this sector.
<P>
It is important to understand that the Bill does not provide for any specific legal consequences to flow from being approved by the scheme. Equally, no legal consequences flow from not being approved by the scheme. Parties to transactions may place a higher weight on electronic signatures backed by certificates issued by approved service providers. That decision would flow from the value that the market places on the kitemark, not from statute. The scheme would be genuinely voluntary and providers would apply to be approved only if they assessed that the benefits of being approved outweighed the costs. The scheme's value comes from setting standards at an appropriate level and rigorously assessing compliance against them; it does not come from statutory privileges.
<P>
I have set out that background because, while I can see that there might have been a case for creating a special appeals system in the case of a mandatory statutory scheme, which the previous Government proposed, there is no case for creating a special appeals system for the voluntary scheme that we are putting in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister, who is very free about giving way. Does she think that because the scheme will be voluntary rather than mandatory, no disappointed applicants will seek judicial review to challenge a decision refusing approval? Is that what she is saying?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> There may be disappointed applicants. Because it will be a statutory function under part I, the decision on whether to approve an applicant will be subject to the usual procedure of judicial review. I am happy to confirm that to the hon. Member for Guildford. An unsuccessful applicant for approval could apply for judicial review, and the court would be able to examine whether the approvals authority had acted reasonably in coming to its decision. Given the voluntary nature of the system, I believe that that is all that is necessary to ensure that the approvals authority acts fairly. The amendment would simply make the system more complicated and would add no real benefits to the scheme. I am a little surprised to hear the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, normally such a ferocious opponent of unnecessary regulation, seeking to make quite unnecessary additions to the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again. It seems bizarre that she admits that the process of judicial review will be available and denies the possibility of a simplified procedure. That is precisely what should apply to her so-called voluntary scheme, without statutory backing. That is exactly why we want an alternative, simplified and cheaper procedure.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am sorry, but I do not accept that point. The scheme is voluntary and will be subject as a voluntary, statutory scheme to judicial review in the normal way. Nothing else is needed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton has done well at withdrawing amendments in this sitting. I hope that he will withdraw this amendment but if he does not, I must ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I want to pursue the point. If someone is disappointed under the voluntary scheme, there will be no choice. There will be a challenge under order 53 in judicial review at great expense. Would it not be fairer, more cost-effective and more just to enable disappointed applicants to challenge such decisions through an appeals mechanism such as that proposed in the amendment, rather than ask them to go through the time and expense of clogging up the civil courts with judicial review applications?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As I have said, I do not accept that point. Even under a statutory scheme, what we put in place when part I is activated is designed to be a light-touch, voluntary scheme. I see no basis for an additional appeals mechanism in a voluntary scheme when providers have the choice to apply for approval anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> What is light touch about telling someone that he or she is not a fit and proper person?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for saying such nice things about me. I walked into the Committee a terrier, but it seems as though I am in grave danger of walking out of it appearing to be a softie. That would never do.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Bury St. Edmunds and for Guildford have put their fingers on the problem. It is unrealistic to suggest that a process of judicial review is less burdensome and an easier form of redress than the simple appeals procedure proposed in the amendment. It would be much better to enable people who are disappointed to appeal to a professor or judge appointed for the purpose than to require them to go through the expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming process of judicial review to prove that they are fit and proper and have been unfairly excluded from the scheme.
<P>
I respectfully suggest that it is not reasonable to say that the amendment proposes a regulation that is worse and heavier than the Minister's chosen route of judicial  review. That argument does not stand up. Of course, the amendment proposes not a regulation at all but merely a form of redress, and we are in the business of ensuring that justice is done.
<P>
Normally, judicial review is used to prove a category of argument as a sort of--what do they call it in America--collective action rather than a specific issue of redress. More often than not, it is a class action.
<P>
The amendment has flushed out, as have my hon. Friends, the absolute absurdity of part I. The Minister has said, as she does whenever she is in a box, that the scheme is voluntary, so hon. Members need not worry. On the other hand, she says that we can have confidence because the scheme is statutory, giving us the absurd confluence of the statutory and the voluntary. The purpose of a law is usually to make something mandatory. More often than not, that is what laws do. However, the confused nature of part I--in that the scheme is both voluntary and statutory--explains why so many people in the industry have found it so utterly unsatisfactory and want it removed.
<P>
4.30 pm
<P>
The clause presents the risk that people will be told, even though the scheme is voluntary, that they are not fit and proper. As they would be told that within the statutory framework of a voluntary approval system, so it would mean that the force of the law and the authority of Government deemed them not fit and proper. That is tantamount to a conviction, yet the Minister is saying that my simple request for an appeals procedure is unacceptable.
<P>
If all that the Minister wants to be able to do with this voluntary-statutory nonsense is suggest that someone might not be an appropriate person--that he might not have the required skills, resources or credibility for other commercial or technical reasons--all hon. Members would admit that that is fair and reasonable. But to suggest that such people might be deemed neither fit nor proper is completely different. That would suggest that they were somehow on the wrong side of the law and that their reputation did not equip them to be a voluntary provider. It would constitute an attack not on their capacity to be a provider but on their reputation.
<P>
Even though the Bill will allow the Secretary of State--with no proper requirement for justification--to attack a person's reputation, the Minister is declining to allow a procedure for appeal. That is a disgrace, and it is unjust. If it is in the Bill, in black and white, in a regularly used turn of phrase, that people can be deemed not to be fit and proper, there should be an opportunity to appeal against that judgment. Our amendment proposes a simple, straightforward appeal process so that such people have a second chance to prove themselves and avoid being labelled in this way. I should therefore like to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) Regulations made under this section shall be laid before Parliament in draft and shall be subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 13, in clause 5, page 5, line 28, at beginning insert "Except where otherwise provided,".
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Amendment No. 7 goes hand in hand with my constant cry for plain language. By the same token, we want proper scrutiny. The amendment continues the theme of justice and scrutiny that we discussed earlier. There should be proper scrutiny of those referred to in the clause before granting approval. We would go so far as to ensure that they were approved by both Houses of Parliament. Under the amendment, if taken hand in hand with amendment No. 13, we would establish a leaning--bias would be the wrong word--towards stating that one House could remove regulations but both Houses should be consulted, under the statutory instrument procedure, before implementing them. The result would be less regulation and less of a burden on the industries affected by the Bill.
<P>
Any such regulation should be laid before Parliament in draft. All hon. Members like being consulted for so long as possible, as that allows us to consider details and perhaps, Select Committees to question witnesses. Indeed, the fact that the Bill was published in draft led to some dramatic changes in the text. By the same token, consultations should take place on less important matters. I urge the Committee to accept that both Houses of Parliament should agree to the regulations and that such proper scrutiny should be required under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am afraid that I shall disappoint the hon. Gentleman again; I cannot commend the amendment to the Committee. It is important that legislation is compatible with the terribly fast-moving marketplace, and there was general agreement when I said that earlier. The pace of change in the technology market is extraordinary. Cryptography services are already in use in several large companies. Some service providers offer them, mostly to the business market, but even that market is immature. The market for providing such services directly to individuals is even more immature.
<P>
A combination of several conditions and requirements must be met to achieve the standard necessary before being awarded the kitemark for the statutory approval scheme, if one is created. Those factors will include the financial standing of service providers to ensure that they can cover their liabilities. Technical standards will be considered. Of course, those standards will change quickly as computing power continues to grow, as memory capacity increases at reduced cost and as people use a greater variety of devices to gain access to the internet. We may find that different standards must be developed to cope with a range of transactions, from electronic signatures on large property deals to paying a couple of pennies, perhaps less, to view an on-line archive or other information. Those standards may require different checks on the signatory's identity or ability to pay or on whatever attribute is important to the transaction.
<P>
We might find that different business models spring up because of the changes in technology. A few years ago, no one would have predicted the range of different pricing models that exist for internet access. The technology is changing significantly and unexpectedly, so we must build into legislation the flexibility that will allow us to cope with utterly unpredictable change. Flexibility will be needed for the fees as well as the standards, because we must assume that service providers will offer their services in different ways. It is essential that the approval system can respond to any innovation that service providers introduce.
<P>
If a statutory scheme were created, it would not mean the Government saying, "This is how these services must be provided. You have to measure up to our standards if you are to get the kitemark." It is about asking service providers to come up with innovative ways in which to provide high-quality cryptography services, which we can then examine to see whether they are good enough and whether the organisations that are providing them meet the criteria required for approval.
<P>
However, the difficulty from Parliament's point of view is that flexibility can come from only the negative resolution procedure and it has wisely recognised the appropriateness of allowing for both negative and affirmative resolutions. If we were to tie ourselves under the Bill to the affirmative resolution procedure, we would be restricting ourselves to a slow and inflexible system that, for example, would make it impossible to introduce new regulations during a party recess. It would be impossible to keep up with what we all agree are fast changes that could require equally fast changes in the regulatory environment. We need proportionality, and what is appropriate for approval for the statutory instruments that might be made under part I of the Bill is the flexibility that comes from the negative resolution procedure. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Given that the technology is fast moving, it is important for Parliament to scrutinise the regulations that the Minister might want to apply. Once again, that reinforces the fact that part I is totally unnecessary and that the regulations will be overtaken by events. If the Minister thinks that Parliament will keep up with them, she is probably wrong, whether the affirmative or negative resolution procedure is used. We, therefore, wish to press the amendment to a Division.

</FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton wishes to press amendment No. 8 to a Division, this is the point at which he should move it formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Maxton, for pointing that out. Given what the Minister said earlier, which we are willing to accept in good faith, I do not wish to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, leave out lines 16 to 25.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 23, in page 3, line 20, leave out from beginning to "or".
<P>
No. 24, in page 3, line 23, leave out "shall" and insert "may be required to".
<P>
No. 11, in page 3, leave out lines 26 and 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Oppositions Members feel strongly about amendment No. 10. It would delete that part of the Bill which would allow the Secretary of State to charge. Amendment No. 11 is a consequential amendment, because subsection (9) says that those sums received by the Secretary of State go to the consolidated fund. Obviously, if no funds are received, that will not happen.
<P>
I can think of only one argument for wanting to include a provision for charging fees--that the private sector will ensure that the voluntary scheme works so well or is so good that people do not have to have the fees imposed on them. Why is a fee necessary? I cannot see that it is when a voluntary system--be it statutory or free-- will, we hope, be put in place. the charging of fees will only deter people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> It is a fast-moving field.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Everything is fast-moving. The Minister has said many times that it will be a voluntary scheme, even though it is a statutory one. Designing a scale or a level of fees would be futile and completely unnecessary, but it may put smaller, innovative, start-up companies, and which are typical of the sector being discussed, at a disadvantage. I am seeking to do more than probe, but in probing, perhaps the Minister can say what scale of fees she envisages. Are we talking about tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds? What costs is she trying to cover by charging fees? Does she envisage that the fee structure might somehow relate to the scale or level of business? Will it be a pro rata fee, or simply 50 for the paperwork, as the applications process is scrutinised by the system that part I will set up?
<P>
This is an open-ended, ill-defined, catch-all electronic tax. There is no need for a fee. Why do the Government need to charge for such a scheme? How many people does the Minister think might register under a voluntary scheme? Given that most companies will be paying their taxes anyway, why should they be further charged for such a scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton is going soft in his old age. I thought that he would have made more of the point about fees. When fees are mentioned, what is really meant are taxes. This is an e-tax; it is another new Labour stealth tax. The Minister, who was widely admired by the Treasury officials who worked with her in her previous incarnation, might see the evil hand of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is clear that he runs a Treasury that is addicted to raising revenue in all sorts of sly and underhand ways. [Interruption.] I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) wants to intervene, but he is welcome to do so. This reference to fees reminds me of the fees that were suggested to fund the Food Standards Agency. There was the great Conservative campaign to stop the food shop tax. It was described as a fee or a charge, but it was nothing of the kind. It was a tax. The Government responded to public pressure. For once, they listened to what the public said and they back-tracked.
<P>
The Government have form on raising fees in a sly, back-door way--they have a bit of previous. This is another example of such a strategy. It is bad enough raising fees in that way for the agencies that exist, but it is even more sly for the Government to talk about raising taxes and fees for regimes that do not yet exist. This is a future stealth tax that has yet to be born. It is between two worlds. We have to be deeply suspicious of references to e-taxes. What is the Minister's estimate of the scale of fees? I am a generous man--I do not necessarily want her to be definitive about it--so ball-park figures would suffice. I ask that in a deep spirit of honest inquiry. The Government were not definitive when they aired the FSA's level of fees, but they said that it would be about 90 per food outlet. If they were prepared to put a number on that, they owe it to the Committee to suggest the fee for the service provider who chooses to seek approval under the statutory regime.
<P>
I am a mere, humble seeker after truth. I make the points genuinely about the stealth-tax nature of the clause, and seek some enlightement as to what it might mean should this part of the Bill ever be implemented.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I want to add to the powerful points made by my hon. Friend. We constantly hear that the scheme is voluntary, but when we discuss part II we shall see how the Minister has the power to change legislation. We know that changes will have to be made to ensure that new forms of signature and of validating documents for e-commerce are enforceable in UK law. The Minister holds the industry in the palm of her hand. If part II remains unamended, the industry will be in no position to negotiate with her about fees. It will not dare upset her about them.
<P>
There is clearly a conflict of interests between the Minister's duty to the industry to respond to the need for legal innovation, as is recognised in part II, and her power to demand what sums she chooses from the people in that industry as and when she chooses. Does she recognise that large and small players should be charged much the same fees so that she does not hold the big players to ransom by demanding disproportionate, unreasonable sums for joining her scheme?
<P>
Has the Minister considered that, if a service is charged for, the obligation on the person or Department providing that service is much greater? All the fees that she might obtain could be nothing compared to the costs that her Department has to bear as a result of a subsequent failure of that service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I should like to speak to amendment No. 23 rather than amendment No. 24. I shall not speak against the principle of fees, but the amendment No. 23 is designed to ascertain whether there is a problem. It relates to subsection (8)(c), which will apply charges to a person who is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for the time being approved under the arrangements".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I may be wrong, but that does not seem as clear as it might. It could refer to a one-off charge levied at the time of approval or could be a way to introduce an annual charge for continuing approval. That may seem trivial, but the summary of the regulatory impact assessment in the explanatory notes estimates a total cost to industry of 500,000 and of between 10,000 and 30,000 for a medium-sized company seeking approval. I am trying to establish whether, as the provision lacks clarity, it will be a one-off charge, as opposed to an on-going one?
<P>
Bearing in mind the regulatory impact assessment, I would not equate this fee with that imposed by the Food Standards Agency, which involved many small businesses, and about which I, like many others, was extremely worried. A case can be made--and I would expect the Minister to make it--for reasonable fees that involve a limited number of people. I look forward to clarification on that point, but my main point is whether the provision lacks clarity.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As I have repeatedly said, even under statutory provision, the scheme will be voluntary and, as I have tried to emphasise, light-touch. None the less, it will need to be funded, and we have made it clear that we believe that such schemes should be self-financing. The costs that need to be covered include those relating to administration, technical assessment, maintaining the register and ensuring on-going compliance with the scheme's requirements and conditions.
<P>
I do not understand why, from what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton has said so far, such a scheme should be financed from general taxation rather than simply being funded through fees, as we propose. It is right that the scheme should be self-financing and that the businesses and, ultimately, the consumers who will benefit from the scheme should cover its costs. As the hon. Member for Guildford rightly pointed out, if the scheme is self-financing and funded from fees, it will in itself put a downward pressure on fees and ensure that the approval scheme is run in a cost-effective way.
<P>
The hon. Member for Weston-Super-Mare asked about on-going approval fees. The intention is to share the costs of the approval scheme among those who will benefit from it. New approvals, followed by modified approvals, are likely to incur the largest cost, but there will none the less be an on-going element of administrative costs, in particular so that the approvals authority can satisfy itself that a service provider who is approved for particular services continues to meet the necessary requirements. A more modest on-going fee might well be necessary to cover those on-going costs, which is, as he rightly said, allowed for under subsection (8)(c).
<P>
An estimate of the possible costs involved for a medium-sized company that is seeking approval for the issue of certificates would be between 10,000 and 30,000. The 500,000 figure that we have published represents an estimate of revenue from the scheme for approving providers in the first year. The on-going charge will of course depend on the exact nature of the service, but it seems most unlikely that it would be more than a few thousands pounds a year for a medium-sized provider.
<P>
The scheme will be voluntary. Whether it is provided for under statutory authority or through the self-regulatory scheme, it should be self-financing. The fees that might be charged under a statutory scheme will be about the same as those that would be charged under a self-regulatory scheme. The fact that the scheme will be funded by fees will itself create a highly effective incentive to ensure efficient administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> We have not had the benefit of reading in detail the Alliance for Electronic Business document, to which the Minister referred earlier, although we shall tonight. Does it refer, under the self-regulatory scheme, to figures of the magnitude that she has been describing under the statutory scheme?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I do not believe that it does. 1 am referring to our own estimates that we have included in the regulatory impact assessment on the Bill. We are proceeding sensibly. It will be up to service providers in the marketplace to judge the benefits to be gained within the market from seeking approval under the scheme, and to Weigh them against the costs involved in seeking approval and paying the fees. That is a sensible way in which to proceed, and we should not be seeking to subsidise even a statutory scheme from general taxation. I urge the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I was planning to withdraw it, but I am so astonished by the magnitude of fees that the Minister has mentioned that I am now not prepared to do so. I wish to press the amendment to a Division.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee for long, but it is important for me to reiterate that the pretended support of the industry for the clause and for this part of the Bill, as distinct from its wish for a voluntary scheme, has become absolutely clear. It wants a voluntary scheme, The Minister said that she wants a voluntary scheme. We all do. But the absolute nonsense of a statutory, voluntary scheme in this part of the Bill does not deserve to be supported.
<P>
One of the most significant organisations in favour of electronic commerce is InterForum. Only yesterday, the Secretary of State advertised the importance of electronic signatures. We at least agree with his objectives. I am referring to a group of companies whose turnover is about 72 billion a year. In its letter to me, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We would prefer to see Parliament giving its wholehearted support to this industry-led scheme."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At least the Committee agrees on that. It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For the Government to reserve powers to introduce an alternative scheme at any time undermines confidence and injects an element of risk into our business planning--just at the moment when we should be doing everything possible to increase our investment.
Therefore we would recommend that you remove Part I and take forward a simplified Bill."
