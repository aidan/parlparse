the proceedings shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought
to a conclusion at 4.00 p.m. on Thursday 25th
January.</div>
					<a name="07011685000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome you
to the Chair, Sir John. I have had the privilege of serving under you
on the Finance Bill Standing Committee, as have a number of members of
the Committee. For those who have not, I recommend it as the usual
channels are always looking for new recruits. Sir John, you take a
close interest in general in Treasury matters, but specifically in the
Chair you are always fair, and firm only when required. We look forward
to your wise guidance in our deliberations on this Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011685000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also welcome all members of
the Committee, particularly those on the Opposition Front Benches who
have already taken a close interest in the subject, not just on Second
Reading but in tabling a number of parliamentary questions to me and to
the National Statistician. I am sure that they will contribute
significantly to the scrutiny and debate on the Bill&#146;s
provisions.</div>
					<a name="07011685000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an
important Bill. Following the independence of the Bank of England, the
independent competition authorities, the Debt Management Office and the
Financial Services Authority, this Bill forms the next move in the
Chancellor&#146;s reforms to set up a system of modern economic
governance.</div>
					<a name="07011685000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">On this
day, which marks the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union between
England and Scotland, I am particularly pleased that this new statutory
system, with the independent statistics board at its heart, will
include Scotland as well as Wales and Northern Ireland. That is
something that all in the statistics world, the Treasury Select
Committee and others in the House had urged us to try and secure, but I
think few believed we would manage to secure it. I pay tribute to those
in Wales and Northern Ireland who have made the decision to participate
fully and, in particular, to Tom McCabe and other Scottish Ministers
who have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div>decided that they too want to see these measures and this system to help
improve the credibility, integrity, quality and consistency of
statistics across the United Kingdom. That is what the Bill is designed
to do.</div>
					<a name="07011685000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad that
we reached agreement on the days needed when we discussed them in the
Programming Sub-Committee. I know that those on the Opposition Front
Benches and some Back Benchers on both sides will ensure that the Bill
gets its fullest possible scrutiny. I am particularly pleased to have
two members of the Treasury Select Committee also serving on this
Standing Committee; they will bring their expertise to it. Committee
members will notice that we are not proposing knives in the programme
motion to dictate the progress, but I am determined to do justice to
the full Bill, including part 2. Therefore, I and the Lord Commissioner
of Her Majesty's Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West
will ensure that the Committee will sit late should that be necessary,
although I hope that it will not.</div>
					<a name="07011685000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I point out to the
Committee that, contrary to customary practice, the programme motion
proposes that we deal with new clauses and new schedules at the point
in the Bill to which they relate&#151;rather than after going through
all the clauses. I hope the Committee will agree to that element being
most sensible, and to the programme motion in
total.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011685000369"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): Itoo am
delighted to serve under your chairmanship,Sir John. I propose
to confine my remarks to the minimum here, since there will be ample
opportunity when considering the lead amendment in the first group to
look at some general themes in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011685000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is cross-party agreement
that this Bill is important. If we do this right and amend the Bill
appropriately, we could contribute significantly to the strength of,
and confidence in, statistics. We will approach the scrutiny process
conscious of that importance and in a constructive spirit. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Sevenoaks recently pointed out, the motto of the
Italian statistical office is &#147;Statisticum republicae
fundamentum&#148;&#151;that is, &#147;Statistics are the
foundation of the state&#148;. The Opposition will be working with
diligence and determination to strengthen the Bill to ensure the
integrity and trustworthiness of those
foundations.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011685000370"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Vincent Cable</b> (Twickenham) (LD): It is a great privilege,
Sir John, to serve under your chairmanship. I think that we all start
from broadly the same position on the philosophy of the Bill. We want
the quality of statistics to be maintained and improved and the
independence of statistical production strengthened. There are a great
many areas in which the Opposition parties see scope for improvement
and strengthening, so we, the Conservatives, the nationalists and the
chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, have
tabled a substantial number of amendments. We need proper time to
consider them.</div>
					<a name="07011685000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no controversy about the programming. I think there was an amicable
understanding that the Government are proceeding in a perfectly correct
way; no knives are being imposed. I am sure that we will be able to
conduct our business speedily but amicably.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>
					<a name="07011685000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011685000371"></a>
							
							<b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I add my voice to those who
have already spoken. The Bill is very important and has real potential
to improve confidence in and remove the perception of political
interference in the production of statistics.</div>
					<a name="07011685000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am relaxed that nine sittings
will be more than sufficient. There are no knives in the motion and
that is welcome. I was taken by the Financial Secretary&#146;s
comments about the 300th anniversary of the Union; this is the
Statistics and Registration Service Bill&#151;one would never have
imagined that there was a Scottish election just around the corner. It
is a pleasure to serve under you again, Sir John, and, mercifully, on a
rather shorter Bill than the Finance
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011685000372"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Michael Fallon</b> (Sevenoaks) (Con): I, too, join in
welcoming you to the chairmanship of the Committee. I convey the
apologies of two of our colleagues, who are currently serving on the
Select Committee on Treasury down the corridor. I hope that my hon.
Friends the Members for Braintree and for South-West Hertfordshire will
be joining us shortly. That will give us three members of the Select
Committee serving on the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07011685000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the programme motion will be sufficient. Such things are always
difficult when drafted by the Programming Sub-Committee before any
amendments are tabled and before the sub-committee is aware, as it
cannot be, exactly how many amendments there are likely to be. If we
have to run a little longer sometimes, I hope that we will do so,
because I think that the Bill is generally recognised to be very
important. A Bill to reform statistics does not come round that often
and it is important that we get it
right.</div>
					<a name="07011685000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
encouraged, however, by the approach of Ministers throughout the
process. They have been reasonably open-minded. I was a little puzzled
by the letter that the Financial Secretary sent to my hon. Friend the
Member for Chipping Barnet, in which he
said:</div>
					<a name="07011685000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
looking forward to Committee, which I am surewill prove
invaluable in furthering understanding of the Government&#146;s
position&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011685000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is one
function of the Committee, but not the sole function. One might argue
that one of the purposes of the Committee is to further understanding
of the Committee&#146;s position so far as the proposals are
concerned. We look forward to considering them in greater
detail.</div>

might be a surprise. Clause 1 simply establishes the statistics board,
and we do not discover until we reach clause 7 or 8 what its objects
are and what its functions are to be. That is a mistake. This is a big
Bill, and an important one, and it is rather dull drafting that it does
not set out what the purpose of the new statistics board is to be. I
rather regret, given the historical importance of the Bill and the
infrequency with which we update statistical legislation, that it does
not have a preamble. Other statistical laws around the world have
preambles, and we could easily have incorporated one here. However, I
am advised that, as a preamble has not been tabled by the Minister as
part of the drafting, it is now too late to incorporate one.</div>
					<a name="07011685000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can and should set out up
front the purpose of the new statistics board, and I hope that the
Minister will concede that it is important to do so. This is not simply
a Whitehall rearrangement. He has made it clear&#151;as was stated
explicitly in the Queen&#146;s Speech&#151;that this is a
worthwhile attempt to enhance confidence in statistics by strengthening
the independence with which they are collated and published. In other
words, the new statistics board is avowedly a public good&#151;that
is the intention of the Bill&#151;and I believe that we should affirm
that loud and clear.</div>
					<a name="07011685000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have drafted a declaration in
three parts: first, to ensure that the board upholds the quality of
statistics; secondly that it should have the overarching duty of
supervising their dissemination; and thirdly that it should perform
both those tasks for the public good. There is a reference to quality
in clause 7, but there the definition is more restrictive&#151;it is
to promote and safeguard the quality of official statistics. My wording
is much more general, namely that the board should have an overarching
duty to enhance the quality of all statistics&#151;I have not said
&#147;official&#148; or &#147;national&#148; or anything else.
I have used tighter drafting, using the word &#147;uphold&#148;
rather than &#147;promote&#148;, and I have widened it so as to
refer to official, national or other statistics.</div>
					<a name="07011685000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about supervising
dissemination is self-evident: statistics belong to all of us. The
board should be under an overriding duty to be involved in their
dissemination and to supervise them because, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Chipping Barnet said, statistics are a key part of
democracy. If we believe in more active citizens and in empowering
people to participate more fully in democracy, they should have a right
to statistical information, which was once the sole preserve of
Ministers and
Governments.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07011685000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the new board to adopt a motto rather like that of the Italian
statistical office, but we cannot put that into the Bill. The point of
that motto in Italy is its recognition that information is one of the
cores of the state and that statistics are a key part of democracy. If
we believe that we should say so loud and clear.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>
					<a name="07011685000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 17 strengthens
clause 7. One of the fundamental criticisms of the Bill, outside and
inside Parliament, is that nowhere does it give the new board the duty
or the power to supervise the statistical system as a whole. That is a
weakness; the board should enforce high standards throughout the
system. It is not enough for it simply to be given the power to
monitor, to get reports or to publish commentary. We want the new board
to be more than a commentator; we want it to have real teeth in all
Departments to supervise the high standards that we require and if
necessary to intervene to secure them.</div>

						<a name="07011685000381"></a>
							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I am
grateful to have the opportunity to speak to the amendments in my name.
I echo the commentsof others in welcoming your benign but firm
chairmanship of the Committee, Sir John.</div>
					<a name="07011685000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am passionate about taking an
evidence-based approach to the development of public policy down to the
most local level. The amendments are consistent and support the
Chancellor and the Government in creating an independent statistics
system. However, it is important to make explicit the need for
information to be available locally. On the day when we celebrate the
Act of Union, it is important to remember that very few policy areas
make sense if they are considered on only an England-wide basis. One
has to drill down to regional and local level to understand what is
really happening.</div>
					<a name="07011685000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a Welshman, I underline the fact that it does not make sense to
consider policy for Wales on average either; statistics for Wales only
are not terribly helpful in developing policy and service delivery, nor
are they very helpful in ensuring that good intentions, at Government,
Assembly or local level, match the reality. That has been recognised by
many organisations throughout the country, by the Office for National
Statistics, the national statistician and Ministers and officials in
many Government Departments.</div>
					<a name="07011685000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">During my time as a Minister, I
have been involved in discussions that have acknowledged the importance
of making that detailed analysis in order to ensure that public policy
is appropriately delivered at the most local level. The problem is that
it is easily overlooked. It is very easy for statistics to be produced
in a way that informs the general understanding of what is going on,
but does not allow targeted action in order to make a difference. I
would illustrate that from my own experience in a number of different
ways.</div>
					<a name="07011685000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some 25 or 30
years ago I worked in the Ely areaof Cardiff, which is
represented by the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury,
my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan). It is an
area with considerable social problems. Those of us who worked there
thought that we understood the area. It was only when we undertook a
major project of research, kindly paid for by the Welsh Office, and
analysed what was happening right down to the most local area
statistics, that we realised that there were big variations within the
area. We had to produce an overlay of acetates, rather than the
computer-assisted graphics that are now available through geographical
information systems, and we realised that the way that we delivered
services, worked with young people and produced diversion to try to get
young 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div>people out of criminal activity needed to be much more finely tuned and
targeted within the area if the resources available were going to help
to deliver the right
results.</div>
					<a name="07011685000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
many other systems around the country now, such as those used by the
police to identify the needs in their area and to identify criminal
activity. One needs to overlay that with the structure of an area and
detailed information to understand what is happening and to tackle the
causes through policies such as the crime reduction partnerships, as
well as identifying what is happening in terms of the economy, criminal
activity, social problems and so on. That is why it is important to
write in the sort of amendments that I have proposed
here.</div>
					<a name="07011685000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7 deals
with the objectives of the new board. Amendment No. 191 would add a
fourth element to that important list of objectives that have to be
promoted and
safeguarded:</div>
					<a name="07011685000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the quality
of official statistics, good practice in relationto official
statistics, and the comprehensiveness of official
statistics.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board
would also have to promote and
safeguard</div>
					<a name="0701175000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the effective
use of official statistics to inform local and regional public service
delivery.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly
Amendment No.192, which is also in line with the Government&#146;s
objectives and what the hon. Member for Sevenoaks sought, would
insert:</div>
					<a name="07011685000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and effective
use in the public
interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
point having statistics unless one enables and promotes their public
use. I am certain that this was in the mind of the Chancellor and the
Government in introducing the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011685000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going forward as
a Member of Parliament&#151;I am sure that many colleagues will have
shared this experience&#151;one looks to understand the problems in
one&#146;s own area. Very often it is not possible to get the
information in the form that one wants it. Where that information is
available, such as in the House of Commons Library and Government
Departments, the staff do an excellent job in providing the analysis.
But sometimes the information has not been gathered in a way that
allows it to be aggregated to the level of the local authority, the
local ward area or to overlap with school catchment areas or with
specifics where the comparison is important for those of us who are
trying to improve the quality of life for the people in our area. I
have already referred to the importance of using statistics
intelligently to understand what is happening in an area in relation to
matters such as crime
reduction.</div>
					<a name="07011685000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a
meeting with the police in my area lastFriday specifically to
discuss that issue. Despite the improvement in the way that statistics
can be handled and manipulated through the development of
computer-assisted systems, we are still not using them effectively.
Frankly, I know less about the statistics and the link between crime
and other figures in my constituency than I did when I first became a
Member of Parliament. That is because the opportunity offered by the
techniques is not being developed adequately and because there is
insufficient focus on the all-important local information, which can be
aggregated up to inform wider public policy.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>
					<a name="07011685000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue came very much into
focus when I became Minister for Rural Affairs in the later part of the
foot and mouth disease outbreak. As we looked at policy on the issue, I
discovered that we did not have information at a sufficiently local
level to tell us what was needed in the very local economies of
villages or rural areas. A lot of that information exists now, and some
excellent work has been done by the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs and Professor John Shepherd, who undertook detailed
academic work for the Department. That means that there is a much
better fit and that organisations such as local authorities and
regional development agencies have a much better understanding of what
is needed area by area. Some of that statistical information enables
us, for instance, to look at the location of post offices in a rural
area and to ask whether they are in the areas of greatest need, where
closures might cause reasonable hardship, or in better-off areas, where
people would, by and large, have the facility to drive to a nearby post
office. Those are very much the practical stuff of delivering policy,
and the illustration that I gave will be of interest to voluntary and
community organisations, as well as to central and local
government.</div>
					<a name="07011685000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I am making also applies to amendment No. 194 to clause 9, which
states that the board
should</div>
					<a name="07011685000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to
their usefulness at a local level and the importance of coterminosity
of data.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the basic
raw data is not collected coterminously at the most local level, we
cannot aggregate up. At that local level, the raw data might have to
remain confidential, because individuals might otherwise be identified,
but there are ways of handling that through professional scrutiny and
data protection methodology. The point, however, is that if the data
are collected and coterminous at the most local level, it will be
possible to aggregate up to where they will make sense and enable
policy decisions to be taken at the most local levels, whether at ward
level or within a ward. It would be a missed opportunity if we did not
make it explicit that that is the intention and that the board, in
looking at quality at a Scottish, Welsh, national and even regional
level, needs to ensure that there is an understanding of variations
right down to the most local level.</div>
					<a name="07011685000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to be a most basic
point, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the
Treasury will indicate sympathy and support for it. It certainly fits
with the Government&#146;s wish to ensure that delivery is focused
and effective at the most local level. I very much hope, therefore,
that I will have a sympathetic response to my amendments, which, as I
said, look fairly innocuous, but which could make a big difference to
the effective use and the good design of statistics if the requirement
that they propose is built in from the commencement of the new
structure&#146;s activities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000382"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the hon. Member
for Sevenoaks for tabling amendment No. 152, because, as he said, it
goes to the heart of the whole discussion that the Committee will have
over the next two weeks. It allows us to address the question of how we
set up structures to ensure that statistics are high quality and
produced according to a sound and reliable methodology. It also gives
us the chance to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>consider how we ensure that statistics are produced and disseminated in
a way that serves the public good, not the political ends of the
Government of the day. It is important that we do not conflate those
two distinct issues. Both, including working to improve the quality,
accuracy and reliability of official statistics, are important, but as
former national statistician Lord Moser said, it is often not the
figures that people distrust, but the people and institutions that use
them. The most pressing issue relates not to quality and
accuracy&#151;important though they are&#151;but to how statistics
are used, released and interpreted. The key problem that we need to
address is ministerial spin.</div>
					<a name="07011685000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We must
ensure that statistics are produced and released according to
principles of integrity and impartiality, and seen to be so. As Bill
McLennan, former head of the Government Statistical Service and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics, has stated:</div>
					<a name="07011685000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is essential of
course for integrity to exist, but it is also important for it to be
perceived to
exist.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tackling the
perception of political interference is as important as tackling the
interference itself. Along the same lines, the Audit Commission
recently
stated:</div>
					<a name="07011685000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A new
statistical system needs to ensure robust methodologies to produce
statistics, and also ensure that the perception of political
interference in the publication of statistics is
minimised.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That trust
will never be restored unless we can secure real independence for
statistical
services.</div>

Marris:
						</b> The hon. Lady appears to be speaking to an
amendment on the use of statistics, not the amendment before us, which
is to do with the quality and dissemination of statistics. She is
talking about the use of statistics&#151;a completely separate
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000385"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The term &#147;dissemination&#148; covers
the use of statistics broadly, and embraces the points that I have
made. We need to discuss the crucial issue of the dissemination of
statistics and the interpretation put on them.</div>
					<a name="07011685000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another former National
Statistician, Len Cook, emphasised the important role that statistics
can play in democracy and in influencing political change. Professor
Sir Denis Pereira Gray, of the university of Exeter, has stated that
lack of trust in statistics</div>
					<a name="07011685000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is a tragedy and seriously
undermines democracy and all governments of all
parties.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
agree that statistics are part of the essential fabric of democratic
debate, as has been adverted to this morning. That is a key reason why
reform is so
important.</div>
					<a name="07011685000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Professor
Pereira Gray went on to talk of the economic benefits of reform in
terms of the international reputation of the UK and inward investment.
Distrust in official figures is not only damaging to democratic debate
but can cause grave practical and economic problems. The Statistics
Commission has pointed out:</div>
					<a name="07011685000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Decisions affecting our
lives are driven by official statistics including allocation of public
money, operational decisions, policy intervention, policy evaluation,
assessment of public service performance&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>
					<a name="07011685000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wisely, it goes on to warn:</div>
					<a name="07011685000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Unless the
decision-makers trust the statistical evidence, they will ignore
it&#151;potentially at a high economic
cost.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would do well
to heed that
warning.</div>
					<a name="07011685000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">If decisions
are taken on the basis of incorrect statistics and if a Government make
the mistake of believing their own propaganda, they are likely to take
the wrong decisions, with damaging consequences for the quality of
public services and the stability of the economy. That is one of a
number of reasons why for some years the Opposition have been calling
forthe independence of statistics and why we have made the
independence for statistical services a key part of our triple lock to
entrench stability into the economy. That is also why we have tabled
amendments to strengthen the Bill and achieve the overall goal set out
by amendment No.
152.</div>
					<a name="07011685000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment No. 17. The Opposition believe that it is vital to ensure
that the reforms encompass not only the ONS but the decentralised
statistical activities in the different Departments. If they do not, we
will not have secured genuinely independent statistics, nor addressed
the problems that I have outlined. One of the weak spots of the Bill is
that the reforms are insufficiently rigorous on departmental
statistics. The new board is given the obligation to oversee statistics
that fall outside the scope of national statistics, but insufficient
power and authority to live up to that
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07011685000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 would go some way to remedying that problem by giving the board
explicit authority to supervise production of all official statistics
and require improvements. However, we need to go further than that and
seek to apply the code of practice across the range of official
statistics. Only then will we have a reform of the strength and scope
necessary to restore trust in Government figures. I look forward to
discussing that matter in detail when we get to clause
10.</div>
					<a name="07011685000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 192,
tabled by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth,
provides us with a useful opportunity to look in more detail at the use
of statistics. If we are to have a world-class statistical system, we
need to have regard to the use to which those figures are put.
Therefore, it is important that the new structures set up by the Bill
are responsive to the needs of users, both from inside and outside
Government. Clearly, there will be necessary constraints on meeting the
needs of users dictated by the availability of resources allocated to
statistical services. However, within those inevitable constraints, it
should be the goal of the new reform system to produce statistics that
are relevant to important policy areas and statistics that people want
to use.</div>
					<a name="07011685000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
doubt that whatever problems there are with trust in official
statistics, those statistics are still used by many thousands of
people, businesses, charities and other organisations both within and
outside Government. The Treasury Select Committee heard evidence that
the ONS website received, on average, 700,000 visitors per month
between April 2005 and January 2006.</div>
					<a name="07011685000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National Statistician, in
planning and co-ordinating statistical services, should have user needs
at the forefront of her priorities. It is important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div>that those needs are identified and evaluated in running the system. It
is also essential that both the National Statistician and the board
engage in frequent and productive consultation with the user community
to ensure that this comes about. I welcome the amendment proposed by
the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I also welcome
the fact that accessibility is explicitly recognised as important in
clause 7(3).</div>
					<a name="07011685000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics users forum has highlighted the important contribution that
users can make in ensuring that statistics are relevant, effectively
distributed andof good quality. It acknowledged that the
interaction between Governments, statisticians and usergroups
have proved to be productive but feels that further work needs to be
done and that there is insufficient non-governmental user input into
high-level planning.</div>
					<a name="07011685000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with much of the sentiment behind amendments No.191 and 194.
Statistical services should take into account the requirements and
concerns of local government. As we have heard from the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, the London Government
Association, in a helpful note circulated to the Committee, state that
it would like to see further
standardisation,</div>
					<a name="07011685000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;collection
and presentation of statistical information&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to facilitate comparison
of information at a local level so that we can create meaningful local
profiles of service needs and meaningful performance standards and
indicators.</div>
					<a name="07011685000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such work
will inevitably be subject to the constraints of the resources budgeted
for ONS and the Government&#146;s statistical services. Nevertheless,
within these constraints, it is important to ensure that local
government concerns are recognised, particularly given its role in the
collection of data and provision of public services, the measurement of
which is a significant function for the statistical
services.</div>
					<a name="07011685000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Government will take notice of the concerns expressed by the Local
Government Association and those outlined by the right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth. The amendments also refer to the regional
use of statistics, and perhaps this is where I have a different view to
that of the right hon. Gentleman. As I strongly oppose English regional
government and regionalisation, I am sceptical about this aspect of the
amendments. However, the moves in the Bill, which I am sure we will
have the opportunity to discuss at a later
stage&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000386"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> Does the hon. Lady recognise that whether or not
there should be any elected regional government in English regions, a
great deal of activity takes place at a regional level? Economic
development, transport considerations and a whole host of activities
take place at a regional level. Therefore, governance, whether by
officials or combinations of local authorities, needs to be well
informed.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000387"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I acknowledge that a lot of policy making goes
on at a regional level, and that should be supported by reliable
statistics. However, I would challenge the extent to which policy
making should be
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>going on at a regional level, and would like to see more of those policy
issues determined at a local rather than regional level. That is in
many cases the better level at which to take such decisions.</div>
					<a name="07011685000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that, I will draw my
remarks to a close. As I have said, I look forward to discussing
similar issues later in relation to reconciling differences in
statistical collection in the different nations of the United Kingdom,
when important issues arise that I hope will be tackled by the Bill and
the Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000388"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> I just wanted to say a few words in support of
amendment No. 152, and the consequential amendment No. 17. The right
hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth also made some compelling
arguments in favour of his own amendments, which persuaded me. I want
primarily to address amendment No. 152. I do not think that there is
anything contentious in it. The issue is about having a simple, clear,
pithy statement from the outset about what the board is for,
emphasising quality dissemination. In the modern jargon, that would be
called the mission statement for the board. It is true that further on
in the Bill, there is a more complex description of the board&#146;s
purposes. Clause 7, in particular, sets that all out in some detail,
but it is rather cumbersome and not easy to get one&#146;s head
round. I would have thought that in order to save the future board the
small consultancy fee that it would probably have to pay to get its
mission statement clarified, it would probably be useful for us to do
that.</div>
					<a name="07011685000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reasons for
emphasising quality and dissemination were eloquently set out yesterday
in the press coverage about Home Office statistics. In a remarkable
report by the permanent secretary to the Home Office, he acknowledged,
rather contritely, in front of a parliamentary Committee, that one in
five of his Department&#146;s statistics were seriously defective. He
acknowledged that 30 data sets received a zero rating for reliability.
What was remarkable about that was, first, the positive point that our
system is sufficiently transparent and accountable that the Home
Secretary can acknowledge such defects, but what was also clear is that
a major Department of State is producing statistics&#151;it was not
clear whether they were official or national&#151;that are of such
poor quality. They have been reproduced for a long period and used in
political debate without any correction. There is also an absence of
any mechanism in government for ensuring that that is stopped and
corrected. We hope that after the Bill is passed such activity will not
continue, and that there will be a much greater emphasis on quality in
Government statistics, and better accountability for them all
round.</div>
					<a name="07011685000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
absolutely right for the hon. Member for Sevenoaks to suggest that we
set out clearly from the outset what the board is for. There are
primary and secondary purposes, but the quality of Government
statistics as a whole, whether official or not, must emphasise the
dissemination and the wider public interest, not the internal purposes
of the Government. That is essentially what it is all about, and no
harm and potential good is done by setting that out clearly in the
first clause of the Bill, in a clear and simple statement of one
sentence.</div>

Mactaggart</b> (Slough) (Lab): I want to speak to amendment
No. 17. Although I suspect that its requirement for improvements and
corrections is implied in the existing clause, it is important to dig
into the issue of accuracy, and the ability to change where statistics
are inaccurate. Much of the debate on the Bill has focused&#151;as
did the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet in her remarks today&#151;on
how people use statistics. There is an implication that it is only the
Government who spin statistics. We all know that that is not the
case.</div>
					<a name="07011685000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other members
of the Committee will have heard, as I did, an argument about
immigration statistics on the &#147;Today&#148; programme this
morning between my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead
(Mr. Field) and somebody from some pressure group. We are
used to people using statistics in ways that are convenient to them. We
require from the Bill an ability to ensure that the statistics that the
Government publish are accurate, and that they are corrected when they
are not. Some ability to be confident that their statistics are above
that kind of argument is one thing that I believe everybody in the
Committee seeks to
achieve.</div>

illustrate with an example that I used in my speech on Second Reading.
The census figures for the town that I represent are wrong. By quoting
from a campaign postcard, I shall show how my local council is spinning
the figures. The council&#146;s postcard
states:</div>
					<a name="07011685000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example, in 2004 the government said only 15,000 people a year would
migrate to the UK from Eastern
Europe.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
is based on a letter from a Minister that referred to the only research
that had been done at that point. There is a question about whether
such research ought to be commissioned by the Government. It was
undertaken as part of an academic study, and it predicted incorrectly
that the figure would be 15,000. The Government did not say,
&#147;Our statistical predictions are&#148;, but they referred to
the
research.</div>

claimed as a Government statistic. The postcard
continues:</div>

					<a name="07011685000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
August 2006 official statistics found that the number was only 74,000

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>
					<a name="07011685000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, that relates to how long people
have stayed.</div>
					<a name="07011685000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
an example of spinning. It is a perfectly responsible piece of spinning
because it is done in the context of my local council&#146;s feeling
reasonably aggrieved by the fact that the ONS calculation is
inaccurate. In fact, it does not refer to the case that the major
source of inaccuracy is not international migration, but internal
migration, because ONS counting in relation to internal migration is
based largely on registrations with GPs, and in Slough, 17 of our
GPs&#151;nearly all of them&#151;have closed lists and have had
closed lists for a long time because they are full. We have a walk-in
centre that takes up the slack and treats 200,000 patients a year. In
addition, we have a large number of young single men in our population
and, as we all know, young single men are more unlikely than other
parts of the population to register with a GP. All those factors mean
that there is an error in the
calculation.</div>
					<a name="07011685000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone
with an iota of sense would recognise that statistics that say that
everywhere in the south-east except for Slough, one of the most booming
economies in the south-east, has a growing population do not
compute&#151;they do not make sense. It does not require a
sophisticated statistician to work that out, yet Slough council,
despite all its efforts and the lobbying that I have done with it, has
failed to persuade the ONS or anyone else to correct the errors in the
statistics. The campaign postcard goes

						</b> You interrupted me just as I was bringing it
all to the point, Sir John, using the same examples but focusing on the
amendments. The final paragraph of the campaign postcard
states:</div>
					<a name="07011685000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Despite
this huge discrepancy the government still refuses to change
Slough&#146;s funding saying it is using &#145;the best available
data&#146; to count our
population.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">They are
indeed the best available data. That is the point. The data available
from the ONS mid-year estimates are flawed, but there is no independent
mechanism to drive change when figures are inaccurate. Amendment No.
17, tabled by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, would specifically give
the board the responsibility for correcting inaccuracies.I
urge my hon. Friend the Minister to eitherreassure us that the
Bill will do that or accept the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07011685000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The census is not a minor
statistical series: it counts the population of Britain and is the
spine of many of our other official statistics. If we do not have a
mechanism to correct gross errors swiftly, that will undermine public
confidence in our statistics. The current arrangements, which are slow,
bureaucratic and unresponsive, and which insert the Government between
the public and the statisticians, are inadequate.
The amendment is one way forward, although whatever
happens under the Bill will not be fast enough 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>for the people of Slough. I will not go down that road as you have urged
me not to, Sir John. Nevertheless, we need a mechanism to correct

it.</div>

Healey:
						</b> I was intrigued by the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet citing the Italian statistical service&#146;s motto,
&#147;Statistics are the foundation of the state.&#148; I am glad
that she translated it for me. It is absolutely true, but statistics
are not the property solely of the state. As the hon. Member for
Sevenoaks said, statistics belong to us all. I therefore hope that all
members of the Committee will welcome the initiative launched by the
ONS last week of a website that gives individuals access to their own
inflation calculator. That is the sort of popularising and greater
public access to statistics that increasingly characterises their use
and the interest in
them.</div>
					<a name="07011685000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Twickenham might have been persuaded by the amendments, but I am
less so. I was, however, persuaded by the succinct point made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West about
dissemination. The hon. Gentleman was right to draw our attention to
the importance of the quality of official statistics. The Bill is not
just about confidence in Government statistics, or Government spin, as
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet called it. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Slough eloquently explained, we have concerns about the
quality and accuracy of statistics and the need for corrections to be
made properly when the required standards are not met. I draw her
attention to clause 7(1)(a), which specifies the board&#146;s first
objective and provides the mechanism that she wants. I shall explain in
a moment why amendment No. 17, tabled by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks,
which would give the board power to direct Ministers and Departments,
is not the right way to meet his concern. I expect to hear further
telling examples from Slough to help illuminate the later stages of the
discussions.</div>
					<a name="07011685000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth. He speaks from a position of experience of
use work and constituency work in Cardiff, as well as ministerial
experience at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,
the Department of Trade and Industry and the Home Office. I will give
him a sympathetic response, but I hope that he understands my
reluctance to accept his amendments.</div>
					<a name="07011685000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now deal with the
amendments and the arguments that were put before the Committee by the
hon. Member for Sevenoaks. I pay tribute, as I did on the Floor of the
House last week, to his chairmanship of the Treasury Sub-Committee. He
self-effacingly waves me away, but the Select Committee on the Treasury
has taken a consistent interest in the quality of statistics. It
produced an important inquiry and report in the run-up to Christmas,
which has helped to inform the Government&#146;s approach to the Bill
and I know will do the same for the deliberations of the
Committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>
					<a name="07011685000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that the Bill is not simply a Whitehall
rearrangement. He is right to say that it is a public good. He
encourages the Committee to consider the purpose of the statistics
board, but I point out to him that the board&#146;s core objectives
are set out in clause 7. In dealing with the amendments, it may help
the Committee if I set out the reasons for the objectives being drafted
as they are. Clause 7 is the cornerstone of the Bill. It is
appropriately succinct, broad and high level, stating that the board
should promote and safeguard the quality, comprehensiveness and good
practice of official statistics. From that core objective flow the
board&#146;s functions in relation to the production and assessment
of statistics, which will allow it to deliver. The board will report on
and be judged against the extent to which it delivers on that
objective, with Parliament playing the central role in holding it to
account, supported by the annual report of the board, which it will be
required to lay before Parliament and publish at the end of each
financial year.</div>
					<a name="07011685000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 152 seeks to add
to the purposes of the board as set out in the objectives in clause 7.
As I have argued, clause 7 already captures the essence of what the
board has been established to do. It states that the board should
promote and safeguard the quality, comprehensiveness and good practice
of official statistics. I believe the objective to be appropriate as it
stands. The additional statements proposed in the amendments are
unnecessary. I think that if Committee members pause to reflect on what
is in the Bill, they will accept that it is appropriately succinct,
wide in scope and sufficiently high level to serve as the core terms of
reference for the board. Having prompted a useful debate at the start
of our deliberations, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07011685000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 is more substantive. It would provide the board with the
authority to</div>
					<a name="07011685000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;supervise
the production of any official statistics;
and</div>
					<a name="07011685000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) require any improvements
and corrections that it considers
necessary&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011685000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 8, 12
and 13 already give the board wide monitoring and assessment functions,
but as we have heard, the intended effect of the amendment is to enable
the board to compel action in Departments. That would turn the board
into a directional body, and go against the decentralised system of
statistical production that we have established and chosen to retain in
this country. The decision to retain that system was supported by most
of the respondents to the consultation and, indeed, by the Treasury
Sub-Committee under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for
Sevenoaks.</div>

							<a name="07011685000397"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> Clause 29 gives the board a directional power in
relation to the National Statistician. If that is right for the
National Statistician, why is it not right for other Departments? What
practical problems will arise from giving the board more effective
authority to comply with the duties imposed by the
Bill?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000398"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The provision is appropriate to the National
Statistician&#151;this is dealt with in clause 29&#151;because
under the terms of the Bill, she will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>accountable to the board and not to Ministers. That is one way of
putting the statistics system on an independent footing and of removing
the board from direct accountability to Ministers. The power to compel
Departments and Ministers is of an entirely different order. In our
democracy, Ministers are responsible and accountable for allocating the
resources of their Departments, including those resources devoted to
statistical production. Decisions on how to manage the resources and
operation of Departments are&#151;properly&#151;taken by Ministers,
who are answerable to Parliament for those decisions. Giving the board
the power to compel Ministers to take decisions about their
departmental resources and functions would fundamentally change those
relationships of responsibility and accountability.</div>
					<a name="07011685000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady and other
Opposition Members are very interested in the model of the National
Audit Office in relation to potential reforms. The NAO does not compel
Ministers or Departments to act. It advises, audits, reports,
challenges and generally equips Parliament better to fulfil its
function of holding Departments and Ministers to account. The NAO does
not direct Ministers or Departments. In the same way, it is
inappropriate to suggest that the statistics board should direct
Ministers, as amendment 17 proposes. Rather than compelling action, the
transparency of the board is one of the key ways in which it delivers
on the objective. It will be the actions and interests of Parliament in
following the work of the board by examining its reports and in holding
Ministers and Departments to account that will play a crucial role in
the development of the system. Those actions and interests will also
play a part in the impact that we have designed the system to have on
the nature and quality of, and confidence in, official statistics in
the long run.

							<a name="07011685000399"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The Minister makes a good case on the problems
of giving a body the power to compel Departments to make particular
decisions and to have particular practices. Does that case not apply
equally well to the National Statistician? Is there not a case for
amending clause 29, so that the board&#146;s focus is on
transparency, holding to account, and reporting to Parliament, rather
than on seeking to take decisions for the National
Statistician?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000400"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I am sure that we will deal with this issue when
we get to clause 29. One of the functions of the National Statistician
will be to head the executive office&#151;currently the Office for
National Statistics. As chief executive of that body, as well as the
Government&#146;s lead professional adviser on statistical matters,
he or she will report to the board. Therefore, it is entirely
appropriate that the National Statistician is made accountable to the
board by the Bill. We are legislating because it is not appropriate for
the National Statistician to be accountable to, and therefore under the
general direction of, Ministers, as she is at the moment. I expected
the hon. Lady to welcome that element of the reforms.</div>
					<a name="07011685000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make similar but less
forceful comments in relation to amendments 191 and 192, which were
tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>
						and Penarth, as I did for amendment 152. Both the
amendments would add to the board&#146;s objectives, but, although I
agree with my right hon. Friend that official statistics have an
important role to play in informing local and regional public service
delivery, I do not think that it is sensible to specify that among the
Board&#146;s core objectives. The important uses to which official
statistics are put are extremely varied, ever increasing and rapidly
changing. It would not be helpful to specify some and not others in the
legislation, not least because&#151;as my right hon. Friend would
accept&#151;we cannot hope for primary legislation to be
exhaustive.</div>
					<a name="07011685000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the core objective that is set out in the Bill, I expect
the independent board to set out its own, fuller, statement of aims,
objectives, priorities and goals in the medium and short term. That
would give some of the core uses to which it expects official
statistics to be put. I am sure that, in preparing and consulting on
its code, the board will take careful note of the comments and debates
made during proceedings on the Bill.</div>

that objective is made explicit as the expectation of Government and
Parliament, competing pressures&#151;for instance for academic use
rather than for practical public policy use&#151;may push aside the
importance of statistics being available for local purposes. Surely
that should be at the core of anything that the board sets out. Is that
his
expectation?</div>

needs of users will be at the core of the direction and decisions that
the statistics board takes. I foresee no circumstances in which a
strong concern for public policy and public service delivery at
national, regional or local level, as appropriate, will not be
fundamental to the concerns that the statistics board reflects when it
draws up its code, goes about its operations or&#151;as we will
discuss later in the Committee&#146;s proceedings&#151;appoints it
members, particularly non-executive
members.</div>
					<a name="07011685000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make the
same point on amendment No. 192. The proposed objective does not list
exhaustively all the aspects of quality, comprehensiveness or good
practice that the board will exist to promote and safeguard. It would
not be sensible to include some rather than others, or to believe that
it is possible to construct an exhaustive list for inclusion in the
Bill.</div>

regards the subject of the amendment as part of a list. It seems to me
that it is central to the Bill. If the board is not to promote
effective use in the public interest, who is to do
so?</div>

once it is set up independently, will be the uses to which statistics
are put and the users of those statistics. The desire to see public
service policy and delivery reflected in those concerns is inevitably
going to feature strongly. However, as I have suggested, to specify
that in the Bill&#151;to elevate it above a rapidly changing, ever
evolving, increasing sources and uses of data&#151;is not sensible at
this point. I hope that my right hon. Friend will reflect on
that.</div>

official statistics in the public interest? If he is indicating that
that does not need to be made explicit in the Bill because it is

right hon. Friend that, at this point, it is more sensible not to
legislate for that matter in the Bill, but to leave it to the judgment
of the board, which will, as I have explained, amplify in a number of
ways the core objectives and standards set out in the Bill. In setting
up this powerful and independent statistics board, it is appropriate to
leave such matters finally to its judgment and to the judgment of those
who are holding the board to account for the code that they devise and
for the discharge of their objectives&#151;in other words, to leave
it to hon. Members and Parliament to scrutinise and hold the board
accountable.</div>
					<a name="07011685000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 194 would ensure that definitions, classifications, standards and
methodologies that are developed by the board are useful locally. In
many ways, the same arguments apply. Again, under clause 9 the
board&#146;s duty is wide, so it is not necessary to specify now the
specific ways in which they are to be used. The board will develop
those as appropriate and will be able to promote them widely. In
developing and promoting the definitions, once again I would expect the
board to provide contextual information about how and when to use them,
including their appropriateness at local level. I have no doubt that
the board will wish to develop definitions and classifications on local
and regional issues, such as the regional classifications that my right
hon. Friend is interested in, and will wish to develop ones that can be
applied and used locally. However, at this stage it is not sensible or
right to over-specify such matters in primary legislation. Therefore I
hope that he will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> Order. Can I just say to the Minister, probably
for the benefit of the whole Committee, that in respect of amendments
Nos. 17, 191, 192 and 194, it will not be necessary for the right hon.
Gentleman or any other hon. Member to withdraw his amendment, because
they have not yet been moved? However, they have been debated, so if
hon. Members are minded not to press them to a Division they can simply
not move them at the appropriate time when we are discussing the
relevant clauses. We have discussed those amendments with the lead
amendment in the group, but they have not yet been
moved.</div>

Michael:
						</b> I just want to make one point in concluding the
consideration of the amendments, which have not been moved but have
been discussed as part of this group. My concern about the points made
by these amendments have partly been answered in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div>Minister&#146;s response; none the less, I encourage him to strengthen
the words that he uses about our expectations of the
board.</div>
					<a name="07011685000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
we do not want the Bill to contain forms of words that are too
prescriptive or that, by specifying one requirement, imply that other
requirements are not necessary. I understand the Minister&#146;s
reluctance to accept the detail of my amendment. However, unless the
board is clear that the statistics are going to be used not only by
Government departments or people operating nationally or regionally,
but locally, it could wander away from the expectations of Ministers
and
Parliament.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07011685000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07011685000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point
particularly relates to amendmentNo. 194 because it is surely
a matter of political judgment and generally the expectation of MPs
that statistics are collected in a way that allows aggregation that
makes sense in terms of analysing what is going on in the communities
that we represent not only at a constituency level but at a much more
local level. The figures are useful in terms of small area statistics
and the sort of work on rural development that I referred to earlier.
What is going on under the surface in urban areas is also very
important.</div>
					<a name="07011685000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
hope that what is spelt out in my three amendments in this group is
something that we as Parliament should make clear that we expect from
the new board. I do not necessarily think that these particular
amendments are necessary, but I found the discussion useful.</div>
					<a name="07011685000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may find one or
two of my other amendments more acceptable. I want to make sure that
this local element is appropriately spelt out and explicit. I shall not
press these amendments to a vote, but I hope very much that during our
discussions the necessity of ensuring the coterminosity of raw
data&#151;allowing proper analysis of statistics in a way that is
useful at a local level to local authorities, to decision makers,
including ourselves, and also to local voluntary organisations, for
instance non-governmental organisations&#151;is made explicit. I hope
my hon. Friend the Minister will reflect on those points. I might push
him a little further when we come to other
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000409"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> We have had a wide-ranging debate. It is obviously
up to the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth to deal with
his amendments when we reach them.</div>
					<a name="07011685000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for the support
that amendment No. 17 has had from hon. Members across the Committee.
The hon. Member for Slough was right to draw our attention to the need
to deal somewhere with the accuracy of statistics, not least because we
have had a whole series of corrections and revisions to official
statistics over the years. Poor statistics, somebody once said, are
rather like the 13th stroke of the clock, which is not only misleading
in itself but casts a shadow of doubt over what has gone before.
Obviously there is updating, and there are revisions and so on, but
there are also corrections and that is why I felt that it was important
to put into the statute some power and authority for the board to
supervise accuracy.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>
					<a name="07011685000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">What strikes me is that we are
setting up this board and giving it responsibility without giving it
authority. The way in which the Bill is drafted means that the board is
not able to enforce standards. That applies to the code of practice, to
the collection of statistics and so on. In response to this amendment,
the Minister said something very important. He said, &#147;This board
is not to be directional&#148;. That causes me concern. If the board
is not to be directional, the only conclusion that I can draw is that,
so far as departmental statistics are concerned, we will still have a
system run by Ministers.
</div>
					<a name="07011685000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister tried to
pray in aid the Treasury Select Committee report. I have a copy of it
to hand. One of the things that we recommended was:</div>
					<a name="07011685000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although departmental
statisticians should remain close to policy colleagues in departments,
they should have formal responsibility to the national statistician for
any statistics they produce which are intended for the public
domain.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the
conclusion in paragraph 7. In paragraph 10, on the designation of
systems, we said:</div>
					<a name="07011685000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are nevertheless
concerned that retention of this control by Ministers would undermine
the perceived independence of the
system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the Financial
Secretary&#146;s reply gives us concern that a system will be
perpetuated, for departmental statistics at least, which is still
ministerially run. I am disappointed, because I thought that the whole
point of the Bill and of setting up the board was to get away from the
idea that Ministers were responsible in the end for Departments&#146;
statistics. That is why I want the board to be given the overarching
power where necessary, not to direct or boss around statisticians in
Departments, but to put things right where they believe that there is a
lack of consistency or a series of poor data. I was very disappointed
by the Minister&#146;s response. Amendment No. 17 is to clause 7, so
we shall doubtless return to the matter when we reach that
clause.</div>
					<a name="07011685000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
encouraged by the support that amendment No. 152 has received from
members across the Committee. The wording could of course be polished.
In designing a motto or purpose, we all come up with our own drafting.
I found the Minister&#146;s response to the amendment rather thin. He
said that we did not need to state the board&#146;s purpose in clause
1 because clause 7 set out objectives. Objectives are not quite the
same as purpose; a purpose is a higher aim. Clause 7 is also limited to
official statistics, which is precisely why I did not include the word
&#147;official&#148; in my definition.</div>
					<a name="07011685000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall press the Financial
Secretary one more time. Is he really suggesting that we should vote
out of the Bill a reference to the public good? That is what lies at
the heart of my amendment. It is the idea that we should put it in
statute that the purpose of the board is to act for the public good,
not for the convenience of Ministers or even for the benefit of
Parliament. I cannot believe that he really wants to reject an
amendment that would simply insert the words &#147;for the public
good&#148; into the statute. I want to give him one more opportunity
to explain why he
should.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000410"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> We propose to continue the system for statistics
established in this country for 400 years, since the Government first
started collecting data on imports 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>
						and exports. The UK&#146;s decentralised system is
overwhelmingly and widely recognised to have great strengths.
Statisticians are kept close to data suppliers and customers, which
gives them a good understanding of their data. They have good working
links with policy makers and are given necessary insights into
developments and future needs. The system also maintains professional
statistics and expertise across government. That is the decentralised
system thatwe proposed in our consultation. It attracted
overwhelming support, including the Treasury Committee&#146;s
endorsement, and we wish to continue it in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011685000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I said that
directional powers were inappropriate for the statistics board, I drew
an analogy with the National Audit Office. It is an authoritative body
that no one seriously doubts is manipulated by the Government. It does
not have the power to compel Departments and Ministers in the way that
amendment No. 17 suggests. Therefore, it is not appropriate to suggest
that we should seek such powers for the statistics
board.</div>
					<a name="07011685000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have told
the Committee, the board&#146;s central objectives as we have set
them out are succinct, wide in scope, high level and likely to be
independently developed further by the board, when it has been
established and is up and running. That is the right approach. The
amendment would not contribute significantly to setting out the
direction and purpose of the statistics board. If the hon. Member for
Sevenoaks presses the amendment, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000411"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary to the
Treasury for trying one more time to persuade me. We shall of course
return to the issue dealt with by amendment No. 17 in clause 7.
However, I emphasise that I am not suggesting that we should
centralise; rather, I suggest, as many outside the House have
suggested, that the board needs an overarching supervisory duty. If I
may say so, it is slightly disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that
I did not say that the current system should continue. Of course we
believe in a decentralised system of statistics, but if we are to put
the proposals on to a better statutory basis, there must be somebody
with the overarching power to supervise the
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000412"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> Amendment No. 152 is too vaguely worded. It refers
to supervising</div>
					<a name="07011685000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
dissemination of statistics for the public
good&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07011685000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">but, although the
hon. Gentleman pointed out that it refers to &#147;statistics&#148;
rather than official statistics or national statistics, it could drag
the board into a role that was something akin to that of the
Advertising Standards Authority. If a product was perceived to be
better for the public good, say, because it used less energy and the
producers of that product wished to say that in a newspaper, the board
would have to decide whether that statistic should appear in a
newspaper, because a newspaper is a means of dissemination. I am sure
that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it would not be in our
interests to include that in the Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000413"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> Yes, of course it is possible to pick holes in the
drafting of the amendment, and perhaps legal training helps with that.
If the hon. Gentleman wants to offer an improvement to the word
&#147;dissemination&#148;,
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>I shall be perfectly happy to accept that. However, the core issue is
why we should not specify in statute that the purpose of the board is
for the public good. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury is a
generous man, so I wonder whether I could try him one more
time.Is he suggesting that clause 7 could not more
appropriately contain a reference to the public good? Is he saying that
nowhere in the Bill would he accept a reference to the phrase
&#147;the public good&#148;? Is that his
position?</div>

							<a name="07011685000440"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> This group of amendments brings us to consider the
size of the new board. We should recognise that Ministers have moved
their position on the issue, as they started from the point of view
that there should be a substantial number of non-executive board
members, but such members will now constitute a majority. That did not,
of course, satisfy the Treasury Committee, which was adamant that the
board should be fully non-executive for lots of reasons&#151;for
example, to ensure that the National Statistician will be properly
accountable to the board as the chief executive officer and that the
supervisory and production functions of the new board will be properly
separated. We may return later in the Bill to consider how we separate
those functions, but for today&#146;s purposes I must accept that the
Government have made their decision and that the board will have a mix
of executive and non-executive members. The issue before us now is what
the exact balance should
be.</div>
					<a name="07011685000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill proposes
a board of nine members, of which six will be non-executive and three
will be executive. Of the six non-executive members, three will be
territorial&#151;I hope that I have used the right term; perhaps
national and territorial might have been a more appropriate phrase.
Therefore, apart from the chairman, only two of the non-executive
members, if they do not represent England, will be properly
non-executive for the United Kingdom as a whole.</div>
					<a name="07011685000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thoroughly welcome the extent
to which the Financial Secretary has ensured a more consistent coverage
across the United Kingdom. That is a good thing, and far more progress
has been made on that during the past year than I thought possible. I
commend him and his team on that, but I shouldlike to raise
the issue of the overall balance with him and the Committee. If only
two of the board&#146;snine members are non-territorial,
non-executive members&#151;if I can describe them in that
way&#151;that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div>both too few and too small a proportion of the board, and it will get
the board into difficulties.</div>
					<a name="07011685000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board must be credibly
independent. If the Governor of the Bank of England complains, as he
has done, about the quality of immigration statistics and the effect
that they have on policy decision makers in measuring the spare
capacity in our economy, he will blame the board under the new system.
Equally, however, the part executive, part non-executive board might
well want to blame the Home Office or some other Department that has
collected the statistics. If only three members of the board are
properly non-executive, they may well be asked by the public,
&#147;Why didn&#146;t you ensure that these statistics were correct
at the time?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an issue arose because of
the quality of the statistics produced by one of the devolved
Administrations, the three territorial non-executive members of the
board might well be inhibited from criticising the quality of the
statistics or the decision to publish or not to publish them by one of
the Administrations, because they rely on them for their appointment.
That is unsatisfactory; the way to deal with it is to enlarge the
board. My amendment would enlarge the board from nine overall members
to 12, which would enable us to have five non-territorial
non-executives. That is a better number, and it would give a better
overall balance without extending the total membership of the board to
a point at which it is unmanageable. Twelve is a perfectly manageable
number.</div>
					<a name="07011685000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
14, which I also tabled, is a probing amendment. I cannot really
believe that the drafting of clause 4(4)(d) is as loose as it appears.
I have looked in other statutes and found no reference to misbehaviour,
which is incredibly difficult to define. In the Ofsted legislation, I
found a measure under which Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of
schools could be dismissed on the grounds of misconduct or incapacity,
which are slightly easier to establish.</div>
					<a name="07011685000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under paragraph (d), a
non-executive member of the board could be dismissed for virtually any
reason at all. He could be dismissed for a traffic violation, because
there is no objective qualification of what could constitute
misbehaviour. There is not even a subjective qualification, such as
that it should be misbehaviour in the eyes of the person who made the
appointment. That needs to be tightened up. If we are talking about
summary, on-the-spot dismissal, the behaviour clearly needs to relate
to gross misconduct rather than a traffic violation. If it means
misconduct, the definition needs to be
tighter.</div>

Hosie:
						</b> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 5 and 6, which
concern the appointment of non-executive members to the board. The hon.
Member for Sevenoaks described the three board members appointed under
clause 3(4) as territorial and said that they might fail to criticise
statistics from the devolved Administrations because they will rely on
them for their appointments. The whole point about the way in which the
clause is drafted is that they should not be territorial and should
rely not on the Administrations but on the Treasury for their
appointments. I shall come on to that later.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div>
					<a name="07011685000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn first to the helpful
summary briefing provided by the Financial Secretary. It begins with a
rather short sentence: &#147;Statistics matter.&#148; It goes on to
say that they should allow</div>
					<a name="07011685000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people to judge whether the
Government is delivering on its promises. High-quality statistics are a
key resource for government, business, academia and the wider
community.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
entirely. Indeed, on Second Reading, I explained that our difficulty in
Scotland with some statistics, particularly some of the economic ones,
is that we cannot trust much of what we see. The general expenditure
review for Scotland, designed as a political initiative, is fatally
flawed. Information is often wrong and can come with so many caveats
that a new analysis of the economy is almost impossible.</div>
					<a name="07011685000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is essential that statistics
are accurate and based on complete information&#151;I agree entirely
with what the hon. Member for Slough said today and on Second
Reading&#151;as well as impartial, and seen to be so, as I have said
previously. That is why the provision in the Bill for the appointment
of the non-executive members of the board remains of some concern to
me. Clause 3(2) describes non-executive members as</div>
					<a name="07011685000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the chairman ... and at
least five other persons&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011685000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3(4) describes what appear to be
territorial representatives, but they are not. It
reads:</div>
					<a name="07011685000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one person who is
appointed by the Treasury after consulting the Scottish
Ministers&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07011685000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">another</div>
					<a name="07011685000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;after consulting the Welsh
Ministers&#148;,</div>

another</div>
					<a name="07011685000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;after
consulting the Department of Finance and Personnel for Northern
Ireland.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
intention is that they be territorial representatives&#151;someone
from each of the devolved Administrations&#151;but the Bill does not
say that. It states specifically that the appointments will be made by
the Treasury.</div>
					<a name="07011685000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
improve the perception of impartiality and to rebuild trust&#151;we
have heard in many debates about the lack of trust and confidence in
statistics&#151;I believe that it would make far more sense to allow
the devolved Administrations to appoint members. We should also remove
what might be perceived as a blocking mechanism&#151;the Treasury
appointments. For statistics to be impartial, and seen to be so, the
fundamental underlying structure of their production must be beyond
reproach. I cannot identify a reason for the provision of Treasury
appointments other than Treasury command and control. I spent the
weekend trying to work out why it is there. Does it represent a lack of
trust in appointments by the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and
Northern Irish Assemblies? I find that hard to believe. They are made
up of elected politicians with a mandate and Ministers with
responsibility for their nation or
province.</div>
					<a name="07011685000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
statistics are to be impartial, and seen to be so, the means of their
production must be beyond reproach and any accusation or allegation of
political interference. I look forward to the Financial
Secretary&#146;s justification for retaining what appears to be an
overweening Treasury command and control
mechanism.</div>

board is appointed by the Treasury&#151;a single source&#151;one
might be left with the impression that it was simply refusing to let
go. For the purposes of debate, my proposed mechanism applies only to
Scotland, but if territorial representatives were appointed by
Ministers from the relevant Parliament or Assembly, there would be a
counterbalance and a removal of the perception of a merely Treasury
appointment
mechanism.</div>

narrowness of the Treasury, which seems to have a vice-like grip on
appointments throughout the system. The proposal is a step in the right
direction and supports the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Sevenoaks. We need to broaden things out and weaken the
Treasury&#146;s grip in that regard. It would be interesting to hear
from the Financial Secretary the flaw in that
argument.</div>

Hosie:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I am not sure whether I
am really his hon. Friend, but I know what he means. He said that the
amendment would broaden the scope. My intention was to define the scope
more clearly by ensuring that the Treasury could appoint its
representatives, that the territorial representatives could be
appointed by the devolved Administrations and that there was a clear
balance between those who were appointed centrally by the Treasury and
those who were appointed from elsewhere, which I think is the
intention. The amendment would simply ensure a degree of fairness and
equity in the composition of the new board and remove any perception of
lack of impartiality in the production of statistics
thereafter.</div>

							<a name="07011685000446"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to enter
the debate. My amendment goes in a somewhat different direction from
the ones discussed. I seek to add to subsection (4) paragraph (d),
which says that</div>
					<a name="07011685000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at least
one person with knowledge and experience of the use of statistics to
inform local service
delivery&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011685000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">should be
appointed to the board. In an earlier contribution, I made some of the
points about the importance of local statistics and I do not want to
labour this point. However, I do want to ensure that it is built into
the expectation that Parliament is setting on the board for the future,
because I believe that the point I am making is shared by all
parliamentarians on both sides of the House.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>
					<a name="07011685000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is, once more, that
official and national statistics are important to effective
parliamentary scrutiny and to the development of central Government
policy. That is rightly recognised by the Bill. It is explicit; it is
there. However, official and national statistics are equally crucial to
the effective targeting, delivery and performance management of
substantial public resources, delivered and accounted for
locally&#151;for example, through local government. Actually, that
involves not just local government but local bodies of central
Government, such as parts of the national health service or agencies
such as the police
service.</div>
					<a name="07011685000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I referred
earlier to a variety of issues such as crime reduction, but
neighbourhood renewal is also a good illustration in this respect. As
Ministers across Departments, including the Treasury, have recognised
repeatedly, policy objectives for neighbourhood renewal and community
cohesion can be achieved only if local public and other services can
identify who needs help, where they are located and where there are
pressure points. I have sat in many meetings of Ministers and many
meetings of this House at which discussion of how we ensure that we
properly target resources has been right at the heart of how we have
debated national policy, so what I am saying does not run counter to
the use of statistics for national purposes. It is an essential
building block of effective national Government policy and
accountability to
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07011685000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed to ensure effective local user representation. In
other words, there should be someone on the board who understands how
proper analysis can be used to inform health services, the organisation
of emergency services&#151;indeed, a range of issues that are crucial
at the most local level. The amendment would also aid the
Government&#146;s objective of keeping statisticians close to data
suppliers and
customers.</div>
					<a name="07011685000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge my
hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to look with sympathy on that
point. I am sure that he shares my experience of hearing many people
who have an excellent understanding of research needs and statistics
for a variety of purposes&#151;understanding overarching national
priorities, looking for international comparisons&#151;but who
overlook the importance of local data, simply because such data are
outside their experience, not in their area of academic research or not
at the forefront of their minds. As I mentioned earlier, the ONS has
moved in that direction and is, like Ministers and Departments,
conscious of the importance of soundly based local statistics and
information.</div>
					<a name="07011685000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has
almost seemed as if the Financial Secretary were speaking in favour of
the amendment, especially in the light of his comments in response to
the earlier debate. He said that the board should be able
tomake appropriate judgments about the objectives. I
understand his point; it is important for there to be flexibility and
for the board to take control of how statistics are developed and their
quality and excellence. If that is the case, it is important that the
board should have something repeatedly acknowledged by Ministers and
also important for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland&#151;an
understanding of local statistics.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div>
					<a name="07011685000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">We often end up with lots of
discussions about comparisons between English regions, or between them
and what is happening in Wales and Scotland, or between local authority
areas up and down the country and those across the boundaries. I
underline the point again: there is no conflict. All the local
government area statistics, regional statistics and territorial
comparisons operate well as an aggregation of local statistics. If we
get the local ones right, everything else will fall into place.
However, it is easy to overlooksuch local statistics; the
board could, with the responsibilities that the Financial Secretary has
rightly suggested it should take on, overlook the importance of the
very local level.</div>
					<a name="07011685000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
do we need to make the issue explicit? All too often when it comes to
dealing with data, important issues are overlooked. That is true of the
exchange and sharing of information, about which we shall no doubt talk
later. At the end of the day, there will be a danger if the information
has not been collected at the raw-data level on a basis that makes
sense, as could happen if the board did not understand the importance
of very local statistics at neighbourhood renewal level.
</div>
					<a name="07011685000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Financial Secretary will acknowledge the importance of local data, and
of building them into how the whole system works and into the
board&#146;s work. There should be proper accountability for what
will no doubt concern parliamentarians, individually and severally, in
the coming years, and it should be built into the operation and
composition of the board.</div>
					<a name="07011685000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, I do not seek an
increase in numbers; the amendment does not propose an additional board
member specifically for the purpose that I have suggested, but that the
membership of the board should include an individual with the relevant
experience. I hope that the Financial Secretary will either accept my
amendment or give an assurance that consideration of my point will be
built into how appointments to the board are made. We should be certain
that in its deliberations such local issues are fully taken into
account and cannot be
overlooked.</div>

						</b> I will address the two amendments later, with
amendment No. 176, but I will make one brief point on amendment No. 14,
which is in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks. I
agree with his concern about &#147;misbehaved&#148; in the context
of what may cause the dismissal of non-executive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>members. I agree that &#147;misbehaved&#148; is somewhat
inappropriate. I would be grateful to know whether there are other
circumstances where the concept of misbehaviour is used. It sounds more
like something that one would say when admonishing a small child. At
least in my own household, the sanction for misbehaviour is usually two
minutes on the naughty step as opposed to summary dismissal from the
statistics
board.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000450"></a>Dr.
Cable:
						</b> I want to say a few words in support, particularly
of amendment No. 13. I also agree with writing out misbehaviour as a
criterion; such language being used in legislation is rather absurd. On
amendment No. 13, there are two reasons why expanding the number of
non-executive members in the way that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks was
suggesting is important. One is maintaining the appropriate balance
between the non-executive and executive members, for the reasons set
out. It would be completely wrong to have a situation where, either by
intention or inadvertently, the executive members, who have a vested
interest in defending the policy of their own product, could outvote
non-executives, who have been brought in to supervise and oversee the
process. Clearly the intention is not that they should be outvoted, but
the risk applies, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman, because three of
the non-executives are in a slightly separate category. Whether we
describe them as territorial or in some other way, they are clearly not
open-ended non-executives in the way that one would
expect.</div>
					<a name="07011685000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
there is another, rather stronger argument, which is the importance of
diversity among the non-executive directors. To have six would seem
quite generous, but since three are pre-empted for appointments by
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we are effectively talking about
three non-executive directors with a broad background. I am not trying
to appoint the board, but I can think of categories of people that it
would be highly desirable to have on the board. It would be desirable
to have somebody from the commercial sector, who is a major user of and
familiar with the requirements of statistics from a commercial
standpoint. It would be desirable to have a top-class academic, who
understands the methodology and the new ideas in statistical method. It
would be desirable to have, as the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South
and Penarth said, somebody who sees statistics from a different
standpoint&#151;that of community use. It would be desirable to have
somebody with overseas experience; we have seen the considerable
contribution of DeAnne Julius and, latterly, Prof. Blanchflower to the
Monetary Policy Committee; they bring to bear a different perspective,
whether of the United States and the Anglo-Saxon countries, which are
similar in their approach to statistics, or of western Europe. That
dimension is desirable. It would also be desirable, in principle, to
have a former head of statistics, maintaining continuity, institutional
memory and an understanding of the
issues.</div>
					<a name="07011685000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
pursuing the issue far, I can think of five potential categories that
it would be useful to have on the board as non-executive
directors&#151;maybe one or more of each. It would be in all our
interests, including 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>the Government&#146;s, to err on the side of generosity with the
number of non-executive appointments, partly to preserve the balance
that the hon. Gentleman was concerned about, but also to ensure a
proper diversity of opinion and
background.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I add my welcome, Sir John,
and I look forward to serving under your chairmanship, as I did on the
Finance Bill Committee last year. I want to add a little to the remarks
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks on amendment No. 13, to
which I and my Front-Bench colleagues have added our names. When
considering an increase in the number of non-executive members on the
board, it is important to reflect not just on the diversity of their
backgrounds&#151;to echo the remarks of the hon. Member for
Twickenham&#151;but to think in this context about the functions of
the board and its responsibilities, and therefore what input the
non-executive directors need to give.</div>
					<a name="07011685000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, just to tie this back
to the basis of how many non-executives there should be, there are
three things the board will have to do. It will monitor compliance with
the code of all designated national statistics, whether produced by the
ONS, Government Departments, or devolved Administrations. Secondly, it
will have responsibility for the production of UK-wide statistics where
the National Statistician produces them. Thirdly, it will have
responsibility for the production of English statistics from the ONS,
which may relate to matters such as internal population trends and
health care. So, the non-executive directors will need to supervise a
wide range of different responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="07011685000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me also make it clear in
this context that, since the Financial Secretary referred in his
opening remarks to the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union, it is
good to see that the fragmentation that devolution has led to in the
production of statistics has, to an extent, been healed in this Bill.
It is therefore right, given the board&#146;s oversight and UK-wide
scrutiny, that non-executive members are appointed in consultation with
the devolved administrations. I suspect that if the board&#146;s
responsibilities were purely UK-wide, we might have a different debate
about the representation and number of directors. Yet, given that the
National Statistician has particular responsibility for the production
of statistics in England, setting aside the executive directors, were
the non-executive directors on the current composition to vote as one
group on a particular issue there could be deadlock. Three
non-executive directors could vote on UK-wide or English
responsibilities, and three could take a contrary view, reflecting
their roots in the devolved Administrations.</div>
					<a name="07011685000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to move away from that
possibility of deadlock between three non-executive directors, who
might have a wider perspective, and three appointed in consultation
with the three devolved assemblies. I am conscious that the Financial
Secretary has said before that it is important that the board does not
become too unwieldy, but it is equally important to get the territorial
balance right between members. So, as my
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div>hon. Friend has suggested, it is appropriate to move from at least five
non-executive directors to eight, in addition to the non-executive
chairman.</div>
					<a name="07011685000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendments Nos. 5 and 6, the hon. Member for Dundee, East, expresses
his concern about the status of the appointments made by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, or the Treasury, and the method of consultation. He
proposes that, in the example of Scotland, the board member should be
appointed directly by the Scottish Ministers. I am not sure whether
that more fragmented appointment process would help resolve some issues
about the production of statistics and their comparability across the
UK. I am sure it is also the case that if the Treasury did not appoint
the person recommended by Scottish Ministers, they would be quick to
highlight that. Such political transparency might perhaps achieve the
same ends that the hon. Gentleman, has
highlighted.</div>

is making, but I just want to make sure he understands the argument

Treasury command and control. This was merely a mechanism. I would just

board.</div>

reduce the Treasury&#146;s influence over this process. I understand
that the hon. Gentleman is recommending one way of doing so and there
are others, which we will explore in more detail later. It is important
to get this issue right and I am not sure that the amendment is the
best way of doing so, but I acknowledge the validity of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s arguments.</div>
					<a name="07011685000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth made an important comment about the
experience and background of the non-executive directors. I hope that
the Financial Secretary will reflect on his plea for a variety of
experience. The hon. Member for Twickenham also said that we need to
ensure that the non-executive directors appointed to the board reflect
a wide range of expertise and experience. Given the three territorial
appointments that have been made, I am not entirely sure that simply
limiting to five the number of non-executive directors in addition to
the chairman, will enable the board to reflect the expertise and
experience to which the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for
Twickenham referred. There are some persuasive arguments for increasing
the number of non-executive directors from at least five to at least
eight.</div>

Healey:
						</b> This has been a useful debate, as we have examined
the detail of the proposals. I hope that I can explain some of the
thinking behind the size and membership of the board.</div>
					<a name="07011685000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principles we have tried to
follow have been clear from the outset: first, sharing accountability
acrossa group of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds
and with a wide range of expertise will produce better results than
vesting all authority in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>single individual, which some have argued for. Secondly, we have been
clear and consistent in wanting the board to carry out independent
scrutiny of the statistical system; there should therefore be a
majority non-executive board.</div>
					<a name="07011685000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in keeping with the
practice of good corporate governance, and given the board&#146;s
governance role in respect of the statistical office, there should be
an executive presence on the board, including the national statistician
as head of the executive office who would be the board&#146;s chief
professional adviser and the chief executive of that office on the
board.</div>
					<a name="07011685000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
given the desire to maintain a small, fixed number of executives on the
board&#151;three&#151;and then to ensure that there is always a
comfortable, non-executive majority, we concluded that we should set
the minimum number of non-executives at six, bearing in mind that it is
also good practice to maintain an odd number on boards to allow votes
to be conclusive. In other words, there will be six
non-executives&#151;one executive chair and five non-executives. We
also bear in mind that it is common practice in good governance to
ensure that boards do not become too large or unwieldy.</div>
					<a name="07011685000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make it clear to the
hon. Member for Sevenoaks that the Bill does not specify that the board
will be composed of nine members, but that it will have at least nine
members. Should we deem it appropriate following the consultations and
in order to meet our aims, it would allow us to err on the side of
generosity as the hon. Member for Twickenham put
it.</div>

							<a name="07011685000455"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> I want some clarification, please. Yes, there is a
minimum size, but is it correct that it is the Treasury that would
allow it to be increased, not the board
itself?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000456"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The board will be appointed on Ministers&#146;
advice. The Treasury will co-ordinate that advice and will consult each
of the Administrations in the devolved countries on at least one of the
board members. It will take into account the wide range of experience
and skills we are seeking from academia, from business, from the public
sector at local and regional level, from people with experience of
running organisations and from those who can assess user needs and act
and take decisions in the public interest. That combination of wide
experience and expertise will give the board its complexion and its
strength.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000457"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I understand exactly what the Financial Secretary
says, but unfortunately he is not answering a discrete and distinct
question from the hon. Member for Dundee, East. In order to restore
public confidence in statistics, admittedly through the board, will the
Treasury or the board itself be the ultimate arbiter of whether the
board increases?</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000458"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The Bill is clear that one residual Government
function must inevitably be the conduct of the public appointments. If
the hon. Gentleman reads clause 3(5), he will see exactly what is
proposed and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>Treasury&#146;s role in it. It will be possible to increase the number
of non-executives on the board, but the Bill provides for the minimum
number that would allow for the range of experience that we
want.</div>
					<a name="07011685000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that the board takes proper account of the circumstances and needs of
each country in the UK, not just of England. We have been working
closely with each devolved Administration to prepare the proposals in
the Bill. As the Bill says, each Administration will be consulted on
one board appointment to help to ensure that the board can take proper
account of devolved circumstances and needs.</div>
					<a name="07011685000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be a balance between
ensuring that the board can collectively represent the needs of all
users and ensuring that it has an understanding of the specific
circumstances and needs of the devolved countries. Let me be clear that
such members will not be appointed to the board as territorial
representatives. It is slightly insulting of the hon. Member for
Fareham to imply that those appointed in consultation with the devolved
Administrations may have a narrower perspective than their board
colleagues.</div>
					<a name="07011685000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
the hon. Member for Sevenoaks for his comments on amendment No. 13 and
his recognition of the way in which the Government&#146;s thinking
has developed in the territory under discussion. The board may be able
to conduct its business with a cohesive range of members, the group of
nine people; but the power to appoint more non-executives will remain
to provide any flexibility required to adapt to changing circumstances
and to respond to any strong views that the board, in light of
experience, or that Parliament, in light of examining and holding the
board to account for its conduct and operation, may take. I hope that
on that basis, he will not press the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07011685000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two amendments that the
hon. Member for Dundee, East tabled would allow Scottish Ministers to
appoint one member of the board, rather than be consulted on the
appointment. In keeping with the proposed legislation, the board will
be a UK-wide body, it will represent the widest range of users and its
members will be appointed to do that collectively. They will represent
users who may be interested in a particular statistical sector, or in
local and regional statistics, and users may come from the public or
the private sectors, or they may be citizens, the Government, or
indeed, Parliament. The board will exist to represent the public
interest as a whole. Those members who are appointed after consultation
with the devolved Administrations will not be on the board simply as
territorial representatives of those
countries.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07011685000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we want the
board to be small and cohesive, it is ultimately dictated that one
authority should be responsible for all appointments, as the Bill
proposes. That is emphatically not a Treasury blocking mechanism. It is
of course right that Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers and, in due
course, I hope, Ministers in Northern Ireland should be consulted on
appointments to ensure that the board has sufficient understanding of
the devolved need for statistics. Let me tell the hon. Gentleman that
Scottish Ministers have agreed to that role in appointments to the
board. They have agreed that it is appropriate that they should be
consulted before the appointment of the relevant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>non-executive member. They are content with the Bill and with the fact
that it offers the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament
safeguards in relation to their role in devolved statistics. I
therefore encourage him to refrain from pressing his
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07011685000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth, I have said a couple of times that we want the board to be
appointed in such a way that it can represent the widest range of
interests in statistics. Its members will do so collectively and by
including the interests of those who are concerned about local and
regional statistics, and I repeat that the board&#146;s job will be
to represent the public interest as a whole. If my right hon. Friend
has not already studied clause 32 carefully, he might be interested to
hear that it enables the board to establish committees, including
advisory committees, on which further external members can sit. Those
committees, and the power to set them up, will be important in helping
the board to deliver its statutory functions. I would expect it to
establish committees and other mechanisms to ensure that it can fully
assess the widest range of statistical users&#146; needs and deal
with the concerns that those who rely on statistics, including for
local policy making, may have. I hope that my right hon. Friend will
accept that, in rather the same way as on the previous group of
amendments, it would not be appropriate or sensible to specify in the
Bill the requirement for one particular interest group. I therefore
encourage him not to press his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07011685000459"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, and he
is close to satisfying me. It would be some reassurance if he
suggested, as I believe he has, that it will be essential for board
members to have a knowledge of, and to deal with, the local and very
local use of statistics&#151;the fine-grained use of statistics that
I described earlier. My concern is that he referred to that in terms of
one group of users, as if everybody is the same. My key point is that
local statistics are the essential building blocks; if we get them
right, everything else can be aggregated for the benefit of every other
user. Does the Minister expect the importance of that point to be
understood by those dealing with appointments? Should the Bill not be
amended in the way that I suggest, with the essence of what I propose
being incorporated in the appointments process, although not quite in
the way that I
suggest?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000460"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My right hon. Friend is right to remind me and the
Committee that the value of local, neighbourhood statistics applies not
only to the interests of a single group of users. He also raises an
important issue. Over the past five or six years, we have seen a
significant increase in the demand for such data and a significant
change in the view of how it canbe used. Indeed, the ONS and
statisticians in Departments have started to respond well to improve
our ability to collect statistics on a local and very local basis. That
trend will clearly continue. The quality in that area of data is still
not good enough. The statistics board will be set up independently to
discharge the functions set out in the Bill, and the Committee and my
right hon. Friend can confidently expect it to ensure that it is aware
of that trend and the developing requirement of such data.</div>

					<a name="07011685000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Sevenoaks
made it clear that amendment No. 14 is a probing amendment, and the
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire had some concerns on the same
matter. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks said that he had been looking for
precedents of our proposed formulation in bodies with which he was
familiar and had not found it. We were working on the basis of
precedents in drafting this part of the Bill, and if members of the
Committee wish to consult other legislation that adopts the same
approach they could look at the provisions of the Energy Act 2004 on
the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority or those in the Railways and
Transport Safety Act 2003 on the Office of Rail Regulation. Both
contain lists aligned to the one set out in the
Bill.</div>

the use of the word &#147;misbehaved&#148; is different from the
use of the word &#147;unfit&#148; in paragraph (f), two lines
later? As a lawyer, I share the reservations of Opposition Members, and

appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07011685000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">If my
hon. Friend is looking for a parallel to the serious potential
misconduct and misbehaviour in question and a definition of
misbehaviour, he would do better to consider the concept of misconduct
rather than of unfitness. Misconduct might principally be held to be
connected with the office held. In this case, for instance, it could be
interference with statistics produced by the board or covering up
information relevant to an assessment decision made by the
board.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000463"></a>Mr.

						</b> I totally agree with the Minister on that point,
but could not the matter be integrated within the reference in
subsection (4)(e) to the &#147;terms of his appointment&#148;? It
could be clearly laid out in those
terms.</div>

Healey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a weaker argument than
other members. The terms of employment might be much more specific and
notdeal with the unlikely and almost unthinkable circumstances
that we must nevertheless consider.The essential difference
between misconduct and misbehaviour is that misbehaviour can be not
just activities related to holding an office but behaviour that could
be sufficiently infamous as to render someone unfit to continue to hold
office&#151;perhaps serious corruption or
violence.</div>
					<a name="07011685000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
that our concept is not novel and that I have given him at least two
precedents, I hope that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks will regard that
as satisfactory explanation of the
drafting.</div>

							<a name="07011685000465"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> I can agree with the Financial Secretary that the
board should represent the widest possible range of people and that it
should fully represent the public interest. I have no quibble with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>that, but I am disappointed that he suggested that the people appointed
under clause 3(4) will not effectively be appointed by the devolved
Administrations. My concern is that it appears that the Treasury
intends to keep the control mechanism firmly in its grip by controlling
all the appointments and the size of the board. He referred to
agreement by Scottish Ministers. It would be surprising if
Labour-Liberal Ministers did not agree with this Administration at this
time.</div>
					<a name="07011685000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
my amendment is to try to release and remove the Treasury grip on the
board, to free it up and ensure that there is a perception of
impartiality, but there may be other ways in which to achieve that, so
I shall not press my amendment to a
vote.</div>
					
					<a name="07011685000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011685000466"></a>Mr.
Fallon:
						</b> I sense that the Committee may want to deal with
this matter before it adjourns. On amendment No. 14, I challenged the
Minister to provide examples, and he gave some, so I cannot question
them although I note that they are from the later period of this
Government. However, it is rather odd that he talked first about
misbehaviour in terms of misconduct, but when he suggested the sort of
misbehaviour he talked about corruption or violence. I do not think the
provision is well drafted, but we may come to that
later.</div>
					<a name="07011685000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 13, I want to make it clear to the hon. Member for Dundee, East
that I do not like the concept of territorial membership of the board.
If I were a Scottish nationalist and a Scottish member were appointed
by the Chancellor, I would find that just as offensive as him. I do not
like it because it is a corporatist model. When territorial
distinctions are introduced, England always ends up being underweight
in population terms. If England had the right number of members in
population terms, it would have 18 or 19. It seems to replicate the BBC
model and there is no transparent evidence that the BBC has been well
governed on that
principle.</div>
					<a name="07011685000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary&#146;s basic response was that the board is small
but can be increased. However, he then revealed that under the
legislation it is the Chancellor who will be able to increase its size.
That again perturbs 
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div>me, and there may be a link between amendmentsNos. 14 and 13.
If the Chancellor does not like the way in which a board member is
behaving&#151;perhaps because they are being critical, and issuing
press releases and so on&#151;he can simply appoint two or three more
people to the board to redress the balance. That alarms me, and I am
not reassured by the fact that the Chancellor can increase the
membership.</div>
					<a name="07011685000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments are fairly simple. First, increasing the board from nine to
12 would not undermine its manageability. A board of 12 members is
perfectly manageable. Secondly, the Treasury Committee recommended a
fully non-executive board. All Iam trying to do is to increase
the proportionof non-executives. Thirdly, increasing the
proportion of non-executives would send out an important signal of
reassurance as the current watchdog&#151;the Statistics Commission is
fully non-executive&#151;is wiped away by the Bill that the new board
is sufficiently
independent.</div>
