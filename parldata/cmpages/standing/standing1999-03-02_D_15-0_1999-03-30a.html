<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford (Mr. Davies) I should mention that divisions are likely
this evening. If it is a single division, I intend to suspend the
Committee for 15 minutes. I understand that later there may well
be a double division; if hon. Members find that out when they get
downstairs, although I will have suspended for 15 minutes, they
should understand that it will then become 30 minutes.
<P>
 wink
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies (Grantham and Stamford):</B> It is no good the
Government trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Committee
or the general public. Two inescapable facts have emerged from
this discussion: the Government are taking money away from widows
and are destroying the national insurance contributory principle.
The Conservative party has been discussing this for some time in
different contexts. We have attempted to draw it to the attention
of the House and the public, and the Minister has now confirmed
it today.
<P>
The agenda here is not to create greater justice, to bring
the welfare system up to date and to provide equality for women
or any of those grand high-sounding phrases to which we have been
treated. That is poppycock. The intention is take money from
widows. Why widows? Because they are a particularly soft target
and because, by definition, people do not know in advance that
they might be victims of this measure. The Labour party therefore
think that the political impact of getting &#163;500 million out
of this category of people will be less than getting it out of
other categories. They are in a true sense a soft target.
<P>
It would have been open to the Government to have decided,
in the light of the need, either for its own sake or to meet what
may be the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, to
treat men and women equally for the purpose of bereavement and
widows benefit. The Government could have come forward with a
revenue-neutral proposal taking from the one and giving to the
other, and leaving the net contribution of the national insurance
fund for those who are bereaved the same as it is today. That
approach would have been perfectly possible.
<P>
I am quite certain that the Minister is intellectually
capable of devising an even-handed approach that would be cost
and revenue neutral, but he did not bother to do that. What he
has done, doubtless on instructions from on high and from the
Treasury, is to find a lot of increasingly shopworn excuses for
abstracting &#163;500 million from widows. That is quite
different.
<P>
Had he gone down the route that it would have been useful to
have explored, of a revenue-neutral proposal ensuring that the
total sum made available for bereavement benefit was the same as
it is today, he could legitimately have talked about a reform.
That would have been a reallocation between men and women. It
might, by definition, have reduced the generosity of the existing
benefits for women and there could have been some time limits.
<P>
Several possible approaches along those lines are expressed
in the amendments. There could have been corresponding advantages
for men who are bereaved. That would certainly have been a
reallocation. It would have been an even-handed reallocation and
it could have been dignified with the term ``reform'', but under
no circumstances can the Government's proposal be so dignified.
Today's debate thoroughly confirms what I have said before. This
is not a welfare reform Bill, it is a welfare reduction Bill.
<P>
The arithmetic has been well set out in the excellent
research paper produced by the Library. I refer Committee Members
to page 40, which clearly states that the increase in the lump
sum payment from &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000 will cost &#163;50
million a year. The measures to introduce a widowed parents
allowance, which will allow men to benefit for six months and
will replace the widowed mothers allowance, will cost a further
&#163;50 million a year.
<P>
The abolition of the widowed mothers benefit, and the
means-testing of payments to widows after they have claimed
benefit for six months, will yield the Treasury &#163;575
million. A child of five with the most elementary knowledge of
arithmetic could work out the figure that I gave the Committee
earlier. The net take by the Treasury at the expense of the
bereaved&#151;it is nothing more or less than that&#151;will
be &#163;475 million. This is not welfare reform; this is
welfare reduction. Let us call a spade a spade. If the Government
are embarked on a course that is less than edifying, let them at
least have the courage and honesty to recognise that.
<P>
The Government are the first in at least 60 years not to be
committed to the principle of national insurance. That was made
abundantly clear earlier by the Minister's remarks. He clearly
said that the Government wanted to change the incentives and to
push people back to work. He treated a national insurance benefit
for which people have contributed as if it were a means-tested
welfare benefit.
<P>
We shall come to a Government amendment that will make what
I thought was a minor technical change when I first read it. I
had not seen its deep significance. It will amend the clause so
that the reference to widows pension becomes widows allowance.
``Allowance'' is presumably new Labour-speak for handout. I
realise now the amendment's significance: Ministers do not like
talking about the widows pension. They consider it to be an
allowance or handout. On that they differ fundamentally from us.
<P>
There is no doubt that the concept of widows pensions was
introduced in 1925 as a piece of social insurance&#151;a way of
protecting people against actuarially predictable hazards of
life. Those hazards might not be predictable on an individual
basis, as we have already discussed and all know, but they are
actuarially predictable. It is possible to provide such
insurance, and it is much cheaper and easier to provide it on a
universal and compulsory, rather than on an individualised, basis
because of the risk to insurers of self-protection, by which
people take out their own insurance.
<P>
There is a strong economic case for social insurance, which
was accepted by the Conservative Government when they introduced
the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act 1925.
That has been the principle behind our system for the 74 years
since then, but it is being changed fundamentally now. The
Government well know about that change, and they find themselves
slipping, as the Minister did earlier, into a vocabulary that
implicitly recognises it. The Minister talks about widows
pensions as a benefit, an allowance and a handout. That is how
the Government look at the subject. If they want to make money
quickly, the Minister thinks that it is perfectly legitimate for
them simply to withdraw pensions to which people have
contributed, and insurance payments to which they are entitled
on account of the contributions that women or their husbands have
made.
<P>
There is no doubt about it: the insurance principle has gone
both in reality and from the vocabulary used by new Labour. The
clause represents two vital and inescapable facts. The first is
that it will involve welfare reduction by the quantifiable sum
of &#163;475 million a year. That will be at the expense of
people who find it difficult to defend their own interests. The
Government have cynically and ruthlessly recognised that and
muscled in on an opportunity.
<P>
The second fact that the Government cannot get away from is
that they are moving away from the insurance principle. Indeed,
they have abandoned it and left it way behind. That is thoroughly
regrettable, but it will not be long before the country as a
whole wakes up to the essential facts that the Government are
doing so much to disguise.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): Two Labour Members spoke in
favour of the proposal to remove widows pensions. That leads me
straight to a point on which I differ from the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford: I regard this not as a welfare reduction
Bill, but as a welfare removal Bill. Widows pensions and the
severe disablement allowance will disappear completely. In some
cases, benefits will not simply be reduced, but will be removed
altogether.
<P>
I did not find either of the two speeches made by Labour
Members in any way persuasive. The hon. Member for Colne Valley
(Kali Mountford) said that the men on the Opposition Benches had
produced no evidence and that their views on women were wrong.
She said that women were extremely strong and that they were able
to return to work as soon as they had been bereaved. That seemed
to be the her thesis. She may be right. Men may take rather
longer to recover from bereavement than women, but I have no
evidence to support either view. However, we do not need to know
that men may take longer to recover from bereavement, because the
evidence shows that women need time, too. Had she been listening
to the earlier speeches on the amendment, she would have heard
that evidence.
<P>
The hon. Lady's view is not shared by women such as Mrs.
Patricia Thomas of Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide, Mrs.
Sylvia Chimicz who speaks on behalf of 150 widows from Coventry
or Miss Jo Warlow of the Widows Advisory Trust. Her view is not
shared by the National Association of Widows or by Age Concern.
Those groups have written to all members of the Committee to make
the evidence clear, and Opposition Members have referred to their
letters in their speeches. If she was not listening to the
evidence, I understand why she thought that it did not exist. I
hope that in future she will listen to the speeches, so that she
will realise that there is abundant evidence to show that many
women do not recover from the bereavement of their spouse within
the six-month limit that the Government want to set.
<P>
In its response to the document ``Support in Bereavement'',
the National Association of Widows and the Widows Advisory Trust
said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``To pay this benefit for 6 months only makes a mockery of
the title of this document. To assume that this `transitional
benefit will help them adjust to their new circumstances' shows
a total lack of knowledge of the devastating and long lasting
result of such a bereavement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many women, if not the hon. Member for Colne Valley, are
concerned by the six-month limit that the Government are putting
on the bereavement allowance.
<P>
The Minister asked how we would pay for our proposals. As
several Opposition Members have said, the answer is clear; there
is nothing to pay for. All we are trying to do is prevent the
Government from cutting what is currently being paid.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr.</B><P>
Stephen Timms): Under the proposals, there will be an increase
on spending on bereavement benefits in the first year. The hon.
Gentleman must explain from where he would obtain the extra
resources to pay for what he advocates should be spent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> If the Government are talking about the first
year only, they are taking a very short-sighted view. The amount
for the first year is peanuts in relation to their overall budget
and, frankly, could be hidden in the reserves with no problem at
all. It is abundantly clear that changes in the recent Budget are
far greater than those appearing here. It is not sensible to
change everything for the sake of a one-year offset. We are
talking about the overall effect, which means a cut in
bereavement benefits of around &#163;500 million a year. That
is what we object to.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have been careful&#151;I cannot speak for Conservative
Members&#151;not to suggest that overall bereavement benefits
should necessarily increase. I have carefully explained that we
propose a fiscally neutral change, which would include payments
for widowers, some reduction in payments for widows, but would
not include the overall reductions sought by the
Government&#151;some &#163;500 million.
<P>
We do not understand why, if the Government need more money,
they need to target widows for higher taxation. We do not
understand why widows are assumed to be those who can most easily
afford the extra taxation desired by the Government. We object
most strongly to what the Minister said&#151;I do not have an
exact quote because he spoke too quickly&#151;about people not
being allowed to think that they can wait for two or three years
before being expected to go back to work. That strikes me as an
appalling nannyish statement about what the Government believe
is good for people. The Government are imposing their own view
of life on individuals and I strongly object to that.
<P>
Of course, some people are sufficiently wealthy to live
without widows pensions, but that is no reason for saying that
all widows must do without their pensions, any more than the fact
that some people can do without child benefit is a valid reason
for abolishing it across the board. Exactly the same argument
applies to personal tax allowances. The illogicality of the
Minister's argument is plain for all to see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): That argument may be
right, but the widows pension is subject to taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I think that I understand the hon. Gentleman's
point&#151;that those who are receiving widows pension would not
need it if they were well off, but that they would be taxed on
it. That is also true, but it is not the point that I was making.
Even if they are taxed, it does not justify abolition for
everybody else, any more than the fact that some people do not
need other allowances and benefits justifies abolishing them
across the board. The Government have failed utterly to justify
their cutting of benefits for widows. They should think again
quickly and make some changes to the Bill on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> rose
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have listened carefully to what the Minister
said and he raised several important issues&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was starting to put the motion. I will
allow the hon. Gentleman to speak, but could he be faster on his
feet next time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Sorry. I shall endeavour to be rocket-powered
next time.
<P>
As I was saying, the Minister raised some interesting issues,
particularly on the contributory principle. Conservative Members
would like some time to reflect over the coming weeks, so it
would be sensible if I begged to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 42, line
25, leave out from first `pension' to end of line 27.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
No. 113, in page 42, leave out from beginning of line 47 to end
of line 4 on page 43.
<P>
Government No. 128.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The amendment would allow the restoration of
payments due to SERPS contributions to the bereavement allowance.
This takes us back to a previous argument about whether a person
who has made a contribution should be allowed the results of it
when the time comes to gain the benefits for which contributions
were paid. It seems wrong that people who contributed to SERPS
during their working life&#151;on the basis that any widow's
pension or replacement of it that they receive would include an
enhancement because they had contributed&#151;will not receive
those payments. The amendment would allow an additional amount
to be paid on account of the SERPS contributions.
<P>
The SERPS payment previously paid with a widow's pension made
up an average of some 24 per cent. of the total weekly
entitlement&#151;approximately &#163;14.36 per week. Although
payments will resume when a person reaches pensionable age, the
loss of payments for people without dependents and children seems
unfair and unnecessasry, as, indeed, the erosion of the
contributory principle that we discussed on the previous
amendment seemed wrong.
<P>
I am not sure whether the Government properly considered this
when they drafted the Bill, so I ask them to reconsider. It is
essential that the actual amount of SERPS contributions be
included with the bereavement allowance if the Government plan
to replace the widow's pension with bereavement allowance. I hope
that the Minister accepts that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> First, I apologise to the Committee for the small
drafting error in line 49 of the clause&#151;the part to which
amendment No. 101 refers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, who is not
present, attempted to make something of that. The clause refers
to the,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``weekly rate of the pension''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but ``pension'' should read ``allowance''. There is no great
significance in the change of terminology, as the hon. Gentleman
said. The previous Government introduced a jobseeker's allowance,
disability living allowance and attendance allowance. I do not
know whether the strictures that the hon. Gentleman applied to
the term ``bereavement allowance'' would have applied to those,
or whether it is merely part of the catalogue of errors made by
the previous Government to which the hon. Gentleman referred. We
are using the term ``bereavement allowance'' to correct the
error&#151;hence amendment No. 128.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 would remove the age-related scale from
bereavement allowance. Amendment No. 101 would allow the benefit
to be paid with an element of inherited SERPS&#151;the point
made by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel).
<P>
The age-related scale is a long-standing arrangement that was
first introduced in 1971. Those aged 55 on bereavement get the
full rate of widow's pension, subject to the entitlement
conditions being met; those aged 54 on bereavement receive a
percentage of the full rate. Those younger than 45 do not receive
any widow's pension. This follows a principle that has long
underpinned the widow's benefit scheme, which is that people
later in life have less opportunity to build provision for
retirement, and so need more financial help than those widowed
at a younger age. We considered the options carefully and felt
that it was right to carry over this arrangement to the new
bereavement allowance.
<P>
 Therese
<P>
We shall also protect the position of widows&#151;and now
widowers&#151;at pensionable age. Any SERPS inherited from a
spouse that would otherwise have been paid with the allowance
will still be available with retirement pension, within the rules
applying at that time. As the hon. Member for Newbury pointed
out, the bereavement allowance will not include the SERPS element
in the current widows pension.
<P>
That reflects the changes that we discussed this morning.
Seven in 10 married women are now in work, compared with only one
in eight when the widows benefits scheme was first established.
<P>
Of course, the widowed parents allowance will include SERPS,
in the same way that the widowed mothers allowance does. The
bereavement allowance, however, will not include SERPS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister mentioned seven in 10 widows earning
income from jobs. However, people without jobs and further income
may be married to people who paid SERPS on the assumption that
their spouses would get the widow's pension based on those
payments. Is it fair that those people without jobs will not
receive a widow's pension or a bereavement allowance based on
their spouse`s SERPS?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> They will receive SERPS when they reach retirement
age, when they will receive the SERPS to which their late spouses
contributed through their working lives. We are holding firmly
to the contributory principle for the retirement pension.
However, as we discussed this morning, the bereavement allowance
is a short-term allowance focused on providing help for people
at the point at which they most need it.
<P>
It is important to remind Committee members about the
bereavement payment, which will provide immediate help at the
time of bereavement. The payment will be &#163;2,000, which is
double the value of the current widows payment. Together with the
bereavement allowance, the payment will give non-means tested
support to widows and widowers without dependent children, and
will help them to adjust to their new circumstances.
<P>
I therefore hope that the Committee will reject amendments
Nos 101 and 113 and will accept Government amendment No. 128.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I promised earlier to be jet-propelled, but I
languished and allowed the Minister to reply courteously to a
speech that I did not make. That may set a precedent, as the
Minister successfully anticipated what I was going to say.
<P>
The Minister did not respond to a point made by the hon.
Member for Newbury from a sedentary position.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The fact that the hon. Member for
Newbury made his point from a sedentary position rules it out of
order.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that that is absolutely right, Mr.
McWilliam. However, the hon. Member for Newbury made a rather
good point, and I share his view.
<P>
We all understand the contributory principle and the fact
that when people reach retirement age their SERPS contributions
will be taken into consideration. However, it is reasonable to
point out that we cannot have anticipated that SERPS element
being part of the widow's pension.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 113. The Minister said that the
bereavement allowance is a short-term benefit. Reducing a benefit
that lasts only six months by 7 per cent. for each year over the
age of 55 seems a little redundant. Indeed, it is a highly
inappropriate, cheese-paring measure.
<P>
Bereaved people will be denied the opportunity of choice, as
the allowance will be cut off at six months. It seems needlessly
mean to introduce a system that was originally based on the
assumption that people would receive the allowance until
retirement age, provided they did not remarry. I should be
interested to hear the Minister, who was most comprehensive in
replying to me before I spoke, deal with the six month period.
Why is the 7 per cent. rule necessary to deal with that? Why is
it appropriate to adopt a system designed to deal with people who
would receive the allowance for 20 years?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am happy to respond to that question. The
current arrangement, which might be surprising to some people
reading our proceedings in view of the remarks of Conservative
Members this morning, is that a person who is widowed under the
age of 45 and does not have dependent children, does not receive
a widow's pension, and those aged between 45 and 55 receive a
pension which is less&#151;by 7 per cent a year, as the hon.
Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said&#151;for each
year that they are less than 55 when they are bereaved.
<P>
I am not aware of a call for a more generous arrangement;
none has featured in the responses to the Committee. If we were
to dispense with the provision and return to an arrangement that
existed a long time ago when there was no age-related reduction,
that would reduce the long-term savings resulting from the
proposals in the Bill.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Newbury has made the
case for his amendment and I hope that he will see fit to
withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> In this case it is probably I who must rise to
my feet with rocket-like speed, because, as our amendment is the
first in the group, the important question is whether we wish to
withdraw it.
<P>
I am not satisfied by the Minister's response. Once again,
he is allowing the Government to break promises made by the
state&#151;a contract made between the state and the citizen.
He did it in response to amendments that we discussed this
morning and this is another case in point. It is bitterly
disappointing that the Minister feels that he can continue to
break promises in that way. However, it is an argument that we
have had before, and there is no great point in pressing the
amendment to a vote at this stage. Therefore, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Malins.
<P>
It is opportune that we have a chance to discuss the
amendments today, although they are mainly probing amendments,
because the Government have got themselves into a right mess over
halving additional pensions due to widows when their husbands
have made contributions. I do not believe that the Government
have any idea what they will do. They have not carried out their
pledge to make an announcement about a compensation package. It
is apposite that the amendment should come before us now, because
we heard today that the ombudsman has accepted my suggestion that
he should investigate the fact that the changes were not properly
advertised. I am happy to say that the press notice says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Parliamentary Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Buckley, is to
investigate a sample of complaints that the Department of Social
Security (DSS) gave out misleading advice about legislative
changes to the state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Ombudsman expects, through investigating a
representative sample of cases, to establish the facts and, if
he finds that maladministration on the part of DSS has led to
injustice, to determine whether whatever action DSS might propose
will stand to remedy that injustice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Ombudsman intends to report his findings in good time
before the relevant provisions of the 1986 Act come into effect
on 6 April 2000.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is indeed good news from the ombudsman. I am delighted
to hear that he has taken on board our request that he make such
an investigation. Given the facts, I have no doubt, that he is
pretty well bound to discover that there was maladministration.
That, of course, dates back to the time of the previous
Government and cannot be wholly blamed on the present Government.
However, we have discovered evidence that the error has continued
well past the coming to power of the present Administration in
1997. Therefore, they are implicated too. It will be interesting
to hear what recompense the Minister intends to provide for those
who have sufffered from the maladministration, as I believe it
to be. It is difficult to see how the wrong can now be righted,
but I hope that the hon. Gentelman will come up with some radical
suggestions.
<P>
The whole thing, of course, went wrong as a result of the
reforms in 1986 under the previous Conservative Government, who
legislated to halve widows' entitlement to thier late husbands'
additional pension. The change is due to take effect on 6 April
2000. Those bereaved after that date will suddenly discover that
they are to receive only half of what they would have been
entitled to had they been bereaved before. Interestingly, the
Conservative Government's original plan, which was revealed in
the Green Paper, was to abolish SERPS altogether for the younger
age groups. The proposal was only later watered down into a
modification, rather than the complete abandonment, of SERPS.
<P>
Our amendments are intended to deal not with what was done
in 1986, but with the maladministration that has occurred since
then because of that change. Leaflets produced at the time
clearly showed that there would be no change at any future date.
It was not until the leaflets were changed in 1996 that the DSS
began to give out the right information. As I said, we have proof
that the Benefits Agency continued to advise people wrongly,
right up to January this year. It was still telling people then
that the full payments would be made to them if they were widowed
after 6 April next year.
<P>
Letters from the Minister on 1 February and 4 March claimed
simply:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This change was introduced in the Social Security Act
1986, giving a long period of notice of the change.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was all that was said. There was no hint that the
Government might have been at fault or that the previous
Government might have been maladministering their own Act. Nor
was any hint given that any compensation might be due, even to
those people who were concerned enough to have written to ask
what would happen if the husband were to die after 6 April 2000.
<P>
An example of the continued giving of wrong advice concerned
W. K. Bennett, who says in a letter of 17 February:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The first inkling I had of this was six months ago, when
I read a letter in the Daily Telegraph which referred to this
change, and I felt sure that the writer had been misinformed, but
to reassure myself, I rang my local DSS office and I was told
that the writer had been misinformed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Still feeling uneasy, I asked for a copy of the regulations
. . . and when I read them I was astonished to find that the
SERPS element would indeed be reduced to half from April 6th next
year. I could not believe that such an important change to the
income of so many people had not received more publicity, from
either the Government, politicians''&#151;
<P>
so we all have to take the blame&#151;``or media.''
<P>
That letter is dated 17 February. Having seen the article in
The Daily Telegraph, he had taken the opportunity, at that stage,
to ring his local DSS office. In spite of the publicity in the
media, he was still given the wrong information by that DSS
office. In response to the claim of the right hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Major) that the measure would be properly and
fully advertised, the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs.
Beckett)&#151;who is now Leader of the House&#151;stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the Government are going to release ample publicity
warning people that their pension and the widows' pensions will
be halved, not only will we welcome it, but we shall help the
Minister to distribute it.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing
Committee B, 27 February 1986; c. 471.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is nothing constructive about taking away half of
people's pensions. Although the Leader of the House welcomed the
idea that the measures would be publicised, no such publicity was
forthcoming, and people still do not know about the changes.
Another letter, which is dated as recently as 3 March this year,
from Mr. Michael Davies of Kidderminster, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I learned two weeks ago''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
two weeks&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of the 50 per cent. cut in the SERPS Widow's Pensions from
6 April 2000.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I feel enraged that the Benefits Agency did not inform me
on the occasions when I sent for my Pensions Forecast.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On Monday this week, 1 March, I telephoned the Benefit
Agency, Newcastle on their Customer Care Helpline number. It
finally emerged that there was a definite policy decision not to
tell those concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what Mr. Davies heard at the beginning of this month.
The Government are still not giving people full and proper advice
on their pension entitlement.
<P>
How will the Government compensate people for large sums? The
only real way to right the wrong would be to reverse the decision
to halve the SERPS entitlement. That is the only sure way of
enabling proper compensation for all those who may have been
affected and who may have lost out financially as a result of
maladministration.
<P>
Mr. Michael Davies states that to replace the amount that his
wife is due to lose&#151;&#163;2,250 per annum&#151;he would
have to buy an annuity for his wife, for which he has been quoted
&#163;47,000. For many of those involved, therefore, large sums
are at stake. Some people have said that they took action on the
basis of the wrong advice, and we have been told that they will
be compensated. What about those who took no action or who felt
no need to take action because they had been given wrong advice?
Such people remained in the scheme, expecting full payments to
be made. A letter from Mr. Hopkin, dated 9 March this year,
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In brief, the Bristol Benefits Agency assured me in 1995,
without qualification, that my wife would be entitled on my death
to all my additional pension. It is particularly galling that it
was only in 1998 on reading a Times letter that we discovered
this rule change to 50 per cent. entitlement from 6th April 2000.
This was more than a year after I had rejected the opportunity
to make provision for a widow's annuity when deciding on a
personal pension then due to me. Her lost entitlement to all my
SERPS pension in 1998-99 terms is &#163;1,850 gross per
annum, a significant sum in her late years. I would certainly
have compensated part of her loss with an annuity had I known of
the change in 1997.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A letter from Mr. Holdsworth Hunt, who lives in Hungerford
in my constituency, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All my financial calculations for my wife's financial
future, in the event of my death, have been based on the
information received from the DSS, not once but twice!''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In addition to those people, all of whom have written
confirmation of their losses, thousands, perhaps millions, of
people who have rung the Department of Social Security are unable
to prove that they have been given the wrong information because
it was given orally. Even when they can prove it, the Minister's
response to my parliamentary question means that they may get
compensation only if they can also prove that, as a result of
receiving that information, they took a decision that affected
them financially. How many people can do that?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When the Government saw the problems that arose from the
mis-selling of personal pensions, they insisted that the private
sector should go further than they now envisage going in
compensating properly those people who were affected. The
Government should write to everyone who might have been involved,
or suffered a loss or disadvantage, in the way that they have
made the private sector write to everyone who may have suffered
a loss. They should ask whether people want to claim compensation
for the losses that they have incurred. What is sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander. The Government should be doing at
least as much to help those people who may have suffered as a
result of Government maladministration as they are insisting on
the private sector doing where people may have suffered from
private sector maladministration.
<P>
What are the Government going to do? Will they publicise what
the present Leader of the House said when the matter was debated?
She commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I advise anyone who is married to a man who is lingering
on 5 April quickly to shove a pillow over his face, because it
will halve the pension entitlement if the husband dies on the
following day. It is extraordinary that the Government should
place people in such a position . . . They will be taking away
rights that have been earned.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing
Committee B, 27 February 1986; c. 470.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are in a difficult position. I hope that they
will play fair by those who have suffered from terrible
maladministration for such a long time. The only reasonable
action would be to reverse the 1986 decision. At the very least,
the Government should put off the date on which the decision
takes effect or consider phasing in the change so that it is not
halved in one bitter blow on 6 April next year. They could even
combine those options. I hope that the Government are far enough
in their decision-making process to tell us what they intend to
do and that they will be generous.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I believe that
the first of the cases in question was raised with me by one of
my constituents in January. I wrote to the Department on what
was, as the hon. Member for Newbury outlined, a clear case. The
constituent was able to provide copies of the incorrect advice
that he had received from the Department of Social Security when
he went for his consultation on pension arrangements. I have
since been notified of 30 more cases, But I have not received a
response from the Department on what it proposes to do.
<P>
We have been advised by the ombudsman today that he will
investigate a sample number of cases that are referred to him.
That is inadequate. The same standards should be applied in the
public sector as have been applied in the private sector&#151;I
aim that unkind comment at Treasury Ministers who, through
political propaganda, have gloated about castigating the private
sector for pension misadvice. The Department of Social Security
should organise teams of people to deal with complaints, as the
private sector has done, and it should invite everyone in the
relevant age group to write in to establish whether they have
suffered a loss.
<P>
I have written to Howard Davies, the head of the Financial
Services Authority, for his comments on the matter in principle.
It would be a complete travesty to have detailed and burdensome
regulation in the private sector and slipshod and inadequate
regulation in the public sector. Many people will have done their
homework and gone to the Department of Social Security for
pensions advice, but others may not have done anything and may
not be aware of the change, which was introduced 13 years ago.
<P>
That situation demonstrates how wrong it is to meddle with
widows pensions. The changes may not be understood by people who
have planned their financial affairs for retirement and for the
expected eventual widowhood of the spouse. People should be
written to and told clearly how the rules have changed. It is
unreasonable of the state to say, ``You are expected to know the
situation.'' People are human and act according to how the
arrangements have been.
<P>
I hope that the amendments spur the Minister to produce
concrete proposals to investigate the mis-selling scandal and to
provide compensation that matches the sums that the private
sector has been obliged to provide for pension mis-selling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is nice to see you back in the Chair, Mr.
Malins. You probably recall reading the autobiography of the late
Reggie Maudling. He described how Keith Joseph went round wearing
not a literal but a metaphorical hair shirt saying that
everything had gone wrong. Reggie Maudling said that he did not
mind Keith going round like that, but he did not see the need to
wear one himself. In relation to the amendments, perhaps all
Committee members should wear hair shirt for a while. The
sitution is a mess.
<P>
I do not think for one moment that the Secretary of State for
Social Security or his immediate predecessor designed the
proposals. In so far as they were merely following instructions,
the situation is not their fault. However, the right hon.
Gentleman is the head of the Department, and he&#151;along with
the rest of us&#151;must carry the can in this regard.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr.
Flight) rightly referred to constituency cases and the hon.
Member for Newbury mentioned letters that he received. I am
surprised by the number of people who have received advice on the
matter relatively late. I have letters dated 12th January, which
was handed to me by Age Concern. As recently as January 1999,
people were receiving advice from the Benefits Agency. The name
has been removed from the letter to retain confidentiality. It
states: ``Dear Mr.''&#151;
<P>
whatever&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am writing with reference to your letter dated 1st
January 1999.<P>

Pension.
<P>

<P>
whatever's&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``own Graduated Pension.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 I trust this letter confirms details for you.''
<P>
It is shocking that the Government are involved and I use the
word ``Government'' in a non-political sense. It is not the
Minister's personal fault&#151;this discussion could be
considerably more heated&#151;but he must accept partial
responsibility because of the office that he holds, as must the
hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), whose cheerful
countenance we always enjoy seeing, and as, indeed, must I as a
Member of the House.
<P>
I was told by a representative from Age Concern that the
matter is to be investigated by the ombudsman and I welcome that.
The hon. Member for Newbury and my hon. Friend the Member for
Arundel and South Downs were right, if this were happening in the
private sector, there would be advertisements on the television.
We have all seen them&#151;the one with the ice cream van, or
the one with the woman in the pub being short-changed. A letter
would also be arriving on people's doorsteps. There is a good
case for a letter being sent to people on this matter.
<P>
Whether or not the decisions were a good idea, they were made
in 1986. I dare say that there are hon. Members in Committee
today who were Members of the House in 1986. I am not one of them
and I am not sure whether the Minister was&#151;he says that he
was not. However, part of making that decision was that we had
to tell people about it. The Leader of the House said that she
would help in the distribution of the leaflets and issued a
blood-chilling warning to sick husbands about the possibility of
being smothered, although I dare say that she did not mean it
literally. However, that warning might have a good effect on hon.
Members tempted to slumber in the Library as we get closer to 6
April.
<P>
What a great injustice has taken place. The Minister
recognises some of the problem and was forthright in an answer
he gave at the last Social Security On Time, when he laid out a
compensation scheme. I do not have his statement to hand, but no
doubt he will correct me if I am wrong. I believe that he said
that it was necessary to demonstrate proof and loss. Will he talk
us through the other aspects of that provision?
<P>
The gentleman who received bad information as late as 12
January in the letter to which I referred, at least has the
necessary piece of paper to prove the loss. However, hon. Members
will be aware from cases in their constituencies that those
matters are not always dealt with in a letter. It is also
possible to receive an assessment over the telephone. That is the
way in which most people receive their initial assessment.
<P>
One might think that the Minister was taking a civilised view
in the House, in saying that all he required of people was that
they produce some proof that they had been to the Benefits
Agency. However, those people might then say, ``But, we didn't.
We telephoned.'' I dare say that the Benefits Agency keeps
records, but I am not sure that they would be able to identify
all those individuals. Therefore, we shall be dealing with a
substantial number of people who have made a loss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I would like to take up the point about evidence
of telephone conversations. The hon. Gentleman is right that
there may be cases in which the Government have kept a record on
someone's file that a telephone conversation has taken place.
However, if he has had similar experiences to my own with, for
example, the records kept by the Child Support Agency, he will
recognise that there are Government agencies that frequently seem
to lose evidence of telephone conversations having taken place.
<P>
 D. Hardy
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is also my experience with the Child
Support Agency. However, I am not entirely sure that it
deliberately loses those records, or that one would expect a note
always to be made on the file.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Is my hon. Friend aware that
the Financial Services Authority has insisted that independent
financial advisers contact their clients about pension
mis-selling, with an unfortunate message on the envelope that
reflects badly on even those IFAs who are highly respected?
Should not the Government do likewise?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting and apposite
point. The sensible approach is to don the hair shirt, say sorry
and send out those letters. According to our informal discussions
with officials, the training was not passed on.
<P>
Perhaps some people do study carefully the Hansard accounts
of the proceedings of Standing Committees. One can imagine their
excitement as they wait for them to arrive by mail or through the
internet. However, I doubt whether they constitute more than a
handful of people. Some might say, ``Well, the announcement was
made in Parliament,'' but the best way to keep a secret in this
country is probably to announce it in Committee. If the people
who administer the system do not know what is going on, how can
we reasonably expect the man and woman in the street to reach a
sensible decision on the matter?
<P>
We must start sending out the letters to which my hon. Friend
the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) referred. We know what to
say to get the message across. The cost to the Exchequer would
not be great because existing television advertisements could
probably be overdubbed. We must start the process of rebuilding,
because people will notice a considerable difference in respect
of bereavement.
<P>
Committee members' contributions can change people's minds,
but they rarely change their votes. However, almost uniquely, our
votes are up for grabs. Our vote will depend greatly on the
Minister's response. Rather than passing the buck and
apportioning blame, we want to see something of the hair shirt.
We are all at fault and we must all work to put the matter right.
In particular, we must deal with the thousands of people who
telephoned who do not have the advantage of the right piece of
paper. We must consider their rights and ensure that they can be
compensated.
<P>
Governments come and go, but most people put their trust in
them. If one receives something from a Government official, one
expects it to be accurate, particularly if it affects people's
rights. Hon. Members may be cynical on that matter and they are
probably right, but we should try to be accurate. Those who say,
``I want to know what my pension will be,'' are entitled to the
correct answer from the Department. The information that the
Benefits Agency sends out should be correct and the agency should
organise a training course according to the explanation given.
Training courses were not organised until recently. I look
forward to the Minister's response and I am sure that he will be
reasonable. Hours of deliberation achieve little, but if we can
do something to right the Government's wrong in letting people
down, we can go off on our Easter break knowing that a job has
been well done.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I want to reinforce what my hon. Friend
said. The matter is serious. There seems to be clear evidence of
extremely poor administration by the Benefits Agency and the
Department of Social Security over many years and throughout two
Administrations. The first thing to do is to recognise the facts,
which are uncomfortable and unpleasant because it is clear that
the public have been ill-served by the state. Apologies are in
order and I am happy to deliver one on behalf of the previous
Conservative Administration and the present Conservative party.
<P>
No Minister in the previous Administration was personally
aware that the Benefits Agency was sending out misleading
information, but it was the responsibility of the Ministers in
whose Departments staff were so badly remiss. Having made that
apology&#151;they are not frequent in the House&#151;I hope
that the Minister will feel able, without loss of face, to match
it and to issue an equally unconditional apology for what has
been going on under his Administration. I do not accuse him of
personal complicity in misinformation from officials of the
Benefits Agency, but the evidence is overwhelming and it is
extraordinary that as late as 12 January this year&#151;I
believe that there are cases even later than that, to which my
hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred&#151;a
formal wildly deceptive letter was sent from the Department of
Social Security to a citizen. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Arundel and South Downs said, if that happened in the private
sector it would lead to compensation payments and individual
sanctions against the people who were so incompetent and
negligent that they allowed such misleading letters to be issued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman issued an apology, which was
helpful, but will he clarify what he is apologising for? Is he
expressing regret for the change that was made in the Social
Security Act 1986, which halved inherited SERPS&#151;such
changes were condemned by Conservative Members earlier
today&#151;or for the lack of information about the change?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I hope that the Minister is not trying to muddy
the water by raising matters other than the important one of
maladministration and deception of the public through grave
negligence, at the least.
<P>
Of course, the 1986 changes to the rules, which were
introduced by a Parliament of which I was not a member, are not
a proper subject for apology. It is an act of levity by the
Minister to suggest that I apologise for that. We can all
disagree about policy measures, which may be right or wrong. I
have said that, with the benefit of hindsight, I regret some of
the changes to national insurance benefits by previous
Administrations, although I said this morning that at least in
respect of the 1986 changes there appeared to be 14 years'
notice, so people could make personal provision in the light of
the change in the national insurance benefits to which they
subscribed through their national insurance premiums. There was
14 years' notice, but we have now discovered that, in practice,
the Department of Social Security and the Benefits Agency went
on giving people the wrong advice and concealing, whether
wilfully or by negligence&#151;if it was negligence, it was very
serious negligence&#151;the fact that the rules had changed. In
other words, when answering questions from the public, the
Department responsible for the relevant law and for the changes
in the law gave the public a false impression of what had
happened and pretended that the law had not changed, when it had.
<P>
 Sue Smith
<P>
There are two quite separate issues involved here. The
argument about policy, which I am sure was debated in
1986&#151;I certainly did not take part in those discussions,
although one of the people who was here at the time might be in
Committee, but the majority of us were not&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I feel the finger of blame
descending on the only member of the Committee who was here at
the time. I shall apologise if I am required to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman was, indeed, a very
distinguished Member of this Hosue at that time, but I do not
recall that he was a member of the Administration or had any
responsibilities in the Department of Health and Social
Security&#151;as I suppose it was then. His apology is heroic,
perhaps even a little excessively self-sacrificial. The Committee
will be able to confirm the impression that we all have of the
hon. Gentleman, that he is very much an honourable gentleman in
every sense of the term.
<P>
Of course, apologies are in order. My hon. Friend and I are
members of the Conservative party, and there was a Conservative
Administration in power at the time, even if we were not members
of it. I know that all those Members of the House who were
members of that Administration will want to join me in
apologising for the maladministration and concealment by
officials&#151;for which Ministers had ultimate
responsibility&#151;of the fact that the law had changed.
<P>
Anyone who was able to employ professional advisers would
have been able to find out that the law had changed. There were
means of doing that. One of the problems to which I had alluded
in another context is the excessive complexity of the English
law. Unlike continental jurisdictions, we do not have the habit
of producing a new consolidation when we amend statutes. A few
days ago, we experienced some confusion about the present state
of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which has been changed by
several subsequent pieces of legislation but there is no
definitive compendium of the Act as it exists in law. One either
needs to have Halsbury, but not all of us can afford Halsbury,
or even has a house big enough to store all its volumes, or must
consult a professional adviser or, as in this case, the
Library&#151;no, I withdraw that. It was the Department of
Social Security that provided an explanatory memorandum, which
set out what it thought was the up-to-date version of the
Matrimonial Causes Act.
<P>
As I said at the time, none of us on either side of the
Committee had any way of knowing whether that really was the
definitive version of the Act. It is an unsatisfactory state of
affairs that, in a country that regards itself as the cradle of
democracy and the rule of law, it is very difficult for a citizen
to know what the law is at any one time. Clearly, citizens must
be expected to rely on statements made by Departments about what
the law is, which those Departments are responsible for
administering. It is almost inconceivable, but it is a fact that,
week on week, month on month and year on year, officials in the
Department of Social Security and Benefits Agency either did not
know that the law had changed in that material way or, even
worse, if they did know that it had changed, were deceiving the
public with whom they were communicating by sending deceptive
letters of the sort quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for
Brentwood and Ongar. That letter was especially disgraceful as
it was written only two months ago. One can see for how long that
process was taking place. Clearly, that maladministration and
deception of the public is a disgraceful episode for which
apologies are in order. Apologies are separate from complaints,
proposals, counter-proposals or arguments about policy, which
hon. Members trade in the House and across the Floor in Standing
Committees as a matter of course.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I beg the Minister not to muddy the waters and not to mix up
the important issues of maladministration&#151;or, at the very
least, negligence&#151;and deception of the public, which one
hopes were not wilful, although they were certainly systematic,
with the question of whether a particular law, interpreted in the
relevant communications, was the right one, whether it should
have been enacted or whether it should have been amended. That
is a different issue and the Committee should focus on
maladministration, deception of the public and mis-selling, to
use a term that is appropriately drawn from the experience of the
private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman accused me of muddying the
water by mentioning the 1986 Bill. Will he acknowledge that that
is what the amendments are about? They are not about the matter
that he wants the Committee to discuss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sorry, but I think that it is for you, Mr.
Malins, to tell me whether my remarks are in order. You and your
predecessor in the Chair this afternoon have both accepted
passively, but effectively, that this is the right and proper
place to debate the important issue of mis-selling and deception
of the public.
<P>
Once again, I am worried. The Minister is trying to clutch
at every straw, even those of his own imagining. He is seeking
to evade the issue before the Committee; he does not want to deal
with it because he finds it uncomfortable, nasty and unpleasant.
He is thrashing around, trying desperately to find something else
to talk about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I could not agree more about what the Minister
has just said. I tried to explain in my speech that the Liberal
Democrats tabled the amendments to suggest to the Government some
ways in which they could compensate people for the
maladministration that occurred following the original decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Let me show my good faith and objectivity in the
Committee's deliberations by paying tribute to a Liberal Democrat
Member. I am always kind to the Liberal Democrat party and I
believe that the hon. Member for Newbury has done the Committee
and the public a service by tabling the amendments. He has
thought carefully about tabling amendments that would attract
your support, Mr. Malins, or at least not your veto, and which
can provide the basis for a debate on an issue of indubitably
major public importance. The hon. Member for Newbury has tabled
such amendments and you, Mr. Malins, have selected them, but now
the Committee finds that the Minister has the effrontery to try
to pretend that debate on them is out of order because he does
not like it.
<P>
You have not ruled me out of order, Mr. Malins. You have done
so in the past, and I know that there is little hesitation from
the Chair in ruling me out of order these days.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am still getting over the shock of
thinking about whether I should be apologising for 1986. I have
from time to time been severe with the hon. Gentleman when his
remarks have been out of order. At the moment, however, they are
not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Malins, for your comments and
I hope that because of them the Committee will hear no more of
the Minister's alibi. No doubt he is thinking up his next excuse
and the next intervention in which he can use some red herring
to try to distract the Committee's attention from his
responsibility to give an honest and straight account of where
the new Labour Government stand on the matter. What do they think
about officials whom they employ deceiving the public
systematically? What will they do about it? If one is in
government, one cannot avoid that question either&#151;what will
be done about it? Let us hear no more about policy debates from
the past, and no more attempts to raise issues of procedural
relevance or other such complete irrelevancies. Let us hear what
the Labour Government have to say to the Committee and how they
will address the challenge. They have to tackle that
challenge&#151;I am sure that they did not want it and I am not
suggesting for a moment that the Minister would have wanted to
find himself in such a situation. In government, however, one
sometimes has to take decisions on difficult issues that one
might wish had never arisen in the first place. Something
extremely nasty has occurred, which has resulted in tens of
thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of our citizens
taking important decisions for their retirement and for their
spouses in the event of their own death based on a completely
false premise, which the Government&#151;the DSS and the
Benefits Agency&#151;gratuitously supplied. Surely that is an
intolerable and totally unacceptable state of affairs. It behoves
hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to use such
unambiguous terms. I look forward to hearing whether the Minister
is prepared to face the matter in unambiguous terms or whether
we will merely encounter a lot more weasel words and another
smokescreen. I look forward to finding out whether he will take
responsibility, which is the essence of good government in a
democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggested that I would muddy
the waters if I referred to the changes in the 1986 legislation
and to the way in which the amendments could change it. However,
that is what they would do, so I shall certainly refer to them
and, indeed, to points that have come up in the discussion. I
will not avoid the question of what happened in the 1986
legislation, which the amendments would change.
<P>
 The amendments that the hon. Member for Newbury tabled make
several suggestions. Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 would ensure
that the amount of SERRPS inherited from the spouse to be paid
with widowed parent's allowance and retirement pension was 100
per cent. rather than 50 per cent. Amendments Nos. 214 and 215
would delay the implementation of the 50 per cent. reduction for
widowed parent's allowance and retirement penson until April
2010. Amendments Nos. 216 and 217&#151;another
variation&#151;would, for widowed parent's allowance and
retirement pension, phase in the reduction in SERPS by 10 per
cent. a year from April 2000 until it reached 50 per cent. in
2004.
<P>
The hon. member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) will recognise
that the amendments would apply only to widows and widowers below
pension age. The reason for that is technical, and it is quite
fair that the hon. Gentleman has couched the debate in wider
terms.
<P>
The previous Government introduced the changes to inherited
SERPS 13 years ago. The hon. Member for Gainsborough voted for
them on Second Reading on 28th January 1986. He told us&#151;let
me just quote to him the words that he used last
Thursday&#151;that we should bear several principles in mind
when discussing such issues. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The second is that if someone's husband has made
contributions throughout his working life, imagining that they
would help his widow, there should be an absolute principle that
the widow receives the amount that was expected by her deceased
husband.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 March
1999; c. 486.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet, in 1986, he voted for the change, which clearly breached
that principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This might be an object lesson for those who are
sitting behind the Minister. Their Whip is no doubt telling them
to toe the party line, but in 14 years' time we will hold them
responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The object lesson is for Conservative Members.
When we hear such apologies for all the errors that the previous
Government made, the question in the mind of all those who read
the Committee's proceedings will be which version to believe.
Does one believe what the Conservative party said in government
or what it says now, or will that change again? There is great
benefit in consistency in such matters.
<P>
The intention behind the change in 1986 was to bring SERPS
into line with occupational pensions, under which it is the norm
to inherit half of pension rights, thereby ensuring a level
playing field between occupational schemes and state provision.
At the moment, those who contract out of SERPS into occupational
or personal schemes can be&#151;and almost invariably
are&#151;treated less favourably in that respect than those who
choose to remain with state provision.
<P>
The changes were announced well in advance of their planned
implementation so that those who might be affected would have
plenty of time to change their financial arrangements. The hon.
Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who made some important and
valuable points, said that Ministers gave instructions for those
changes to be publicised. The record of Committee proceedings in
February 1986 shows that the then Minister, the noble Lord
Newton, said that the Government had every intention of mounting
a major publicity campaign to herald the pensions changes
contained in that Bill. There was no such publicity campaign and,
as we discovered, many people in the organisation did not know
about the changes, let alone the public at large. This is a
straightforward point&#151;I am not attempting to score
points&#151;but if the hon. Gentleman has information to suggest
that Ministers gave such instructions, it would be valuable to
know that. The process is a bit of a mystery to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have no direct knowledge of the internal
workings of the Parliament at that time. If the hon. Gentleman
looks further, he will see that the present Leader of the House
said that she would help in the process.
<P>
I naturally assumed&#151;and I do not think that it was an
unreasonable assumption&#151;that if, during any of the
Committee's deliberations, the Minister says ``This is what we
are going to do'', then that is what will happen, and it is on
the basis that we are seeking compensation for those who have
been misled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point.
<P>
I think that it is common ground between us that the changes
to inherited SERPS were not handled well. At the time, there was
very little publicity at all, let alone a major publicity
campaign. There was some publicity. An article in Whice? in 1986
went into the matter in some detail. No doubt there was other
information, but not very much. It was not until 1996, 10 years
after the changes, that they were first mentioned in leaflets
published by the Benefits Agency. I can understand and agree with
the concern that has been expressed about the lack of publicity
at the time.
<P>
There may have been people&#151;and strong evidence has been
adduced today that there were&#151;who received incorrect
information on their state pension. Some may have taken decisions
that will affect them to their financial detriment as a result.
We are seeking to establish how many people were involved and
affected. I have already said, and I reaffirm, that we will
consider claims for compensation from those who can demonstrate
that they were affected in that way. I cannot at this stage go
into great detail about how that will work. We are looking very
carefully at these matters, and we will be in a position to say
more in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that
he will say more in due course, although I hope that he will do
so as quickly as possible. There are a number of people out there
who are very worried.
<P>
Will the Minister also guarantee that he will not use as his
excuse the fact that nobody has yet been affected? It is always
possible that the spouse of everyone concerned will die before
6 April next year. That is not the point; the point is that some
people have made decisions based on the assumption that they will
get the full amount. Whether or not they die before next year,
it is important that they should be made immediately secure
rather than being left until 6 April next year to see whether
their spouse happens to die before the effective date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Nobody has lost out yet because the change has not
been made yet. However, I anticipate that we shall set out how
compensation arrangements will work much sooner than April next
year.
<P>
Recent press attention and the publicity surrounding this
debate will have done much to inform people. I pay tribute to the
hon. Member for Newbury, who has done a lot of work in drawing
attention to that. I also pay tribute to The Sun and The Daily
Telegraph, which raised the matter quite vigorously. I can tell
from my postbag that many more people are aware of this than was
previously the case. Nevertheless, I suspect that more still
needs to be done. We have recently sent out reminders to Benefits
Agency staff to ensure that they have the current information.
I welcome today's announcement by the ombudsman and I look
forward to hearing what he has to say about this matter on the
basis of his inquiries.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On 12 January, a bulletin was issued to all pensions staff
in the Benefits Agency reminding them about the current position
on SERPS inheritance. The hon. Member for Newbury suggested that
wrong advice was still going out in February. I am surprised and
disappointed by that, because the bulletin sent out on 12 January
was clear. However, I can tell him categorically that no decision
was made to keep the information from the public. That is
absolutely not the case. I know that the hon. Gentleman has been
in correspondence with the benefit management branch of the
Benefits Agency. I quote from the letter that was sent to him on
26 March from the head of the pensions age group:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I must however state in the strongest terms that there
has never been any deliberate act to suppress information.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will derive some reassurance
from that.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister quoted 12 January as the date on
which the bulletin went out. Were instructions therefore given
regarding the information sent out on 12 January&#151;or perhaps
a little earlier&#151;to ensure that corrections were also sent
out? If that was the case, does the hon. Gentleman know how many
corrections were sent out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I do not have that information. The purpose
of the circular was to ensure that everybody knew what the
correct position was. As far as I am aware, there was no
refererence to previous correspondence&#151;but the hon.
Gentleman makes a worthwhile point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> When the Minister knew that those
deceptive letters had been sent out and decided to correct the
position by putting out the circular to which he has referred,
why did he not give instructions that a correction should be sent
to those who had recently received a letter that was clearly
materially mistaken? Why did not the Minister think about that?
It is an important issue and I hope that the ombudsman will look
into it even if the Minister does not. Can he explain whey he did
not cover the obvious point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Brentwood and Ongar just raised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is a wider issue involving those who only had
the leaflets to go on&#151;those who, as the hon. Member for
Brentwood and Ongar said, made telephone calls. The issue
involves more than merely the letters that were sent out in the
period leading up to January and all those points need to be
properly addressed. However, I do not believe that the solutions
suggested in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Newbury
would be the right way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Surely it is a matter of fundamental good
administration that if a Department sends out an incorrect letter
and then discovers a few days or weeks or a month or two later,
that that information is incorrect, it should send a correction.
We have just heard from the Minister the interesting comment that
on 12 January a circular went out to Benefits Agency officials
concerned telling them to explain in future what the law really
is. On 12 January&#151;in other words a day or so before the
official had seen that circular&#151;a very deceptive letter
went out. Does the Minister mean to say that nothing was done
about that? Was no attempt made to correct the letters at all?
Did it never occur to the official who signed the letter, to
whoever is in charge of the pension services division of the DSS
or to the Minister himself that it would be right to correct the
letters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have not seen the letter dated 12 January and
I do not know whether any follow-up letter was sent. There may
have been&#151;I have no information about that at all. The
leaflets should have been changed in 1986 when the law changed.
If that had happened, we would not be in this position today.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury suggested a number or ways
forward. However, as I have suggested to the Committee, I do not
think that they are the right ones to take. It is right that the
state scheme should sit on a level with occupational and personal
schemes. The Government should not skew decisions about future
pension provision by continuing the discrepancy that has existed
until now.
<P>
Secondly, there is an important issue of costs. Preventing,
delaying or phasing in the implementation of these changes would
be extremely costly. The hon. Member for Newbury has already
proposed and supported several quite costly measures during this
part of the Committee's deliberations, and the measures that he
proposed today would also be expensive&#151;the first group of
amendments would cost up to an additional &#163;1 billion a year
by the end of the 10-year period that the hon. Gentleman
proposes. If he is proposing those measures seriously, he must
tell us where the resources will come from.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister is being most helpful in giving us
information. He seems to be making a technical argument about the
amendments, which are clearly probing amendments. I may be doing
him an injustice, but is he going to answer my question, which
was about how people who had made a telephone inquiry would be
compensated? That would be most helpful.
<P>
Finally, as this issue is important, it would also be helpful
if the Minister were kind enough to send Committee members a copy
of the circular, so that we can understand the problems that the
Government are trying to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's last request
can be dealt with. On his earlier question, about whether I am
going to spell out how we will deal with people who received
telephone advice, I am afraid that I am not in a position this
afternoon to go into detail about how those arrangements will be
made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Do I take it that those people who used the
telephone have not wholly been ruled out and that the Minister
is actively considering ways in which they might be included in
any compensation scheme, or is he prepared to rule them out at
this stage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, we are considering all those issues and I hope
that we will be able to say something firmer before too long.
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have agreed that
the changes were not handled well and did not proceed as they
should. We are taking steps to deal with the situation that we
inherited and to ensure that no one suffers as a result of
inadequate information. However, I do not believe that the
amendments represent the best way forward. I know that the hon.
Member for Newbury proposed them as probing amendments, so I hope
he now sees fit to withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Mr Rendel:</B> The Minister commented on the performance of at
least one Conservative member of the Committee in 1986. Perhaps
it is therefore worth quoting from a letter from a Mr. Tony Lynes
to the former hon. Member for Gedling. In it, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When the last Government made the change (in 1986, if I
remember rightly), it was strongly opposed by Labour members of
the Standing Committee on the Bill. The cut does not take effect
until next year, so there would be no serious difficulty in
reversing it if the Government wished to do so. Of course it
would have been better to do it in 1997 or 1998, but it is
certainly not too late to do it now. Nor is it unaffordable,
given the extremely healthy state of the National Insurance Fund
which, according to the Government Actuary, will by March 2000
have a surplus of &#163;5.9 billion over the amount he
recommends as a working balance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hesitate to comment on that myself&#151;I do not know
whether the Minister would like to comment on the state of the
national insurance fund according to the Government Actuary.
<P>
However, I accept and have always accepted the important
point that the costs could be significant if the Minister chose
to provide full compensation by reversing the original decision.
Of course, it would not have to be totally reversed; he might
just put it off for the number of years during which the wrong
information was given out. That would be the effect of one of the
amendments that we tabled&#151;to give the Government an
opportunity to consider that as a possible means of proceeding.
Saying that the amendment would be hugely costly, and therefore
could not possibly sensibly be afforded, ignores the fact that
the state ordered the private sector to do just that.
<P>
The Government did not say, ``If it will cost a lot to
compensate people for the mis-selling of pensions, we will let
you off, because that will bankrupt too many of you, you will be
in difficulty, or you will have to put up fees.'' They simply
said, ``You must compensate people for all the losses that they
may have suffered as a result of the mis-selling of private
pensions.'' Given what they said to the private sector, the
Government have a duty to pay for the costs of wrong information
that they had handed out.
<P>
Perhaps the taxpayer will have to bear that cost eventually,
but surely we should consider what is just, right and proper. If
it is right that taxpayers as a whole should have to bear the
costs of a certain section of our population that has been
misinformed by the state, and has therefore lost out financially
as a result of the state's maladministration, we need to tackle
that&#151;to take that bull by the horns, as it were&#151;and
face up to the need for the state to act justly, fairly and
properly, just as it has insisted that the private sector must
do.
<P>
I accept that this matter is highly complex. It is difficult
to decide precisely who needs compensation; it is even more
difficult to know precisely how many people may be involved. The
Government have told us that up to 2 million people may have
retired between 1986 and 1996, but the problem may extend beyond
those people. People who may have retired even earlier than that,
but whose spouses are younger than them and who may die much
later, after 2000&#151;and also people who retire after
1996&#151;may be affected. A huge number of people may be
involved, perhaps including some people who retire after 2000.
Not all those people or their spouses will have suffered as a
result; some will have died before the relevant time. Given all
those complications, I am happy to leave the Government to
continue to consider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman share my
great disappointment&#151;though not enormous
surprise&#151;that in responding to the amendments, the Minister
did exactly what I predicted? No apology was made; all he did was
read out a civil service brief and attempt to distract the
Committee's attention with a series of irrelevancies. The
Government faced the challenge of whether they were capable of
apologising when apologies are clearly called for, and they
failed that challenge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Yes, I certainly accept that point. It is fair
to say that although the Government have admitted that they may
have to pay compensation, they have not produced much by way of
apology to those concerned. Some of the worst instances of all,
in which people have been directly written to with wrong
information, not just provided with a booklet containing wrong
information, have arisen since the new Government took office.
<P>
Although, to be fair, some Conservative Committee members
have attempted to apologise for what happened in the early years
after 1986&#151;the failure to change the booklets and some of
the misinformation that was given then&#151;the Government have
not yet given any apology for the wrong information that has been
issued since they took over. We would certainly welcome such an
apology&#151;as I am sure would some of the people involved.
<P>
As I said, this is a complex matter. It is difficult to know
how many people are involved, the extent to which they are
involved and how they can best be compensated. There are many
alternatives, and I look forward to discovering what alternative
the Government produce. I hope that they will choose to be
generous and do their best to compensate everyone who may have
lost out. I also hope that, as far as possible, they will speed
up decisions on what compensation is due.
<P>
I asked the Minister of State whether he was prepared to
consider compensating people before it was known whether the
spouse concerned had died before 6 April 2000. He worried me by
intimating that the Government were prepared to consider
announcing the compensation package before that date. It would
be far better to speed up the process much more than that and
make an announcement within the next month or two. I cannot
believe that the Government need more than a month or two at the
outside to decide how the compensation package should work. I
hope that they will speed up their deliberations and produce a
generous package. Because of the complexity of the matter and
because these were probing amendments tabled mainly&#151;

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is coming
to the end of his remarks and that twice we have stopped him in
his tracks, but I want to put one final point to him.
<P>
Various letters have been provided. Does the hon. Gentleman
believe that, at the very least, the recipients of those letters
should be sent a correction, so that they know what the position
is, because I am not convinced that everyone knows yet?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I have already suggested that the Government
should write to everybody who may have been affected, just as
they asked the private sector to write to everybody who may have
been affected. That is the least they can do. The Government
should send a circular letter not merely to those who can prove
that they had wrong information but to everybody who may have had
wrong information. Therefore, I am going a little further than
the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar.
<P>
I was about to close my remarks a second time, as the hon.
Gentleman rightly said. I was on the point of saying that this
is a complex matter. I hope that the Government will speed up
their decision and that it will be generous. In the light of the
fact that they are working on it and will, I hope, make an
apology, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. May I
ask you, on behalf of the Committee as a whole, to send a copy
of the Hansard of this afternoon's debate direct to the
ombudsman, because what has emerged this afternoon is evidence
of even worse negligence than we foresaw at the beginning of the
debate? When the original mistakes were discovered it never
occurred to the Government or to Ministers to send letters of
correction to those who had been deceived. The ombudsman should
see the direct evidence of that from the Committee as soon as
possible.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for the Chair. The hon.
Gentleman has raised his point and can deal with it in the way
in which he chooses, but it is not a point of order for the
Chair.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The amendment relates to the disregard to be applied to the
widowed parents allowance. The original consultation document
suggested that the disregard should be &#163;10, but the
amendment would double that to &#163;20, with a mechanism to
increase it annually. We believe that &#163;10 is a measly
disregard and we took the trouble to cost various other potential
disregards through parliamentary questions. We have discovered
that to double it from &#163;10 to &#163;20 would cost the
Government &#163;15 million a year in the short term and
&#163;10 million or so in round figures in the long term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Committee must be grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for having done that research. Did he discover the
cost of disregarding the total amount of the allowance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> We have figures for the disregard at &#163;20,
&#163;30, &#163;40 and &#163;50, which I am willing to show
the hon. Gentleman. In the short term, for &#163;20 it would be
&#163;15 million; for &#163;30, &#163;25 million; for
&#163;40, &#163;40 million; and for &#163;50, &#163;55
million. In the long term the figures would be lower. I do not
have a figure for an overall position. If he wishes to discover
that, no doubt, the Government will answer a parliamentary
question within the next few days, but I cannot give him that
figure tonight.
<P>
Clearly the disregard is of importance to the neediest
claimants. The Government have said all along that they would
like to target help at the neediest claimants, and increasing the
disregard in the manner proposed in the amendment seems a useful,
sensible and efficient way of doing that. The amendment also
provides for the amount to be increased annually in line with
prices. That clearly is the sensible thing to do. If the figure
is put in the Bill itself, clearly some means of changing it
other than by regulations is needed. We believe that the
amendment carries out that necessary function, too. The
Government would be wise to take that on board. It is a sensible
way of targeting help on the neediest. The figure that they
produced in their consultation document is remarkably small and
I hope that they will agree to double it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Conservative Members think that this is a
reasonable and modest measure. The hon. Gentleman moved it as
such. He clearly demonstrated that the cost is relatively
negligible given the sums of money that the Government will save
by these measures. We are not certain that &#163;20 is right;
&#163;15 or &#163;25 might be right. What attracts us to the
measure is that it lays down a method by which the sum can be
increased without further reference to statutory instruments or
to Government decisions or announcements in the Budget. It puts
it on a level at which it can be increased automatically in line
with the retail prices index.
<P>
That is particularly attractive because of the effect on
people at the lower end of the income scale. We welcome the
Government's statement that it is part of their policy to target
resources. The amendment would effectively mean that people on
lower incomes would pay less tax. It was certainly my impression
that the Chancellor was moving around his figures in the last
Budget so that the poor could pay more taxes. The various changes
to tax credits were designed to do that. What he gives with one
hand he takes away with the other.
<P>
This is a good example of doing the reverse and finding a way
in which people can retain their own money. It is much better for
people to do that than to be trapped into means-tested benefits,
a subject on which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr.
Field) spoke so passionately at 4 pm in Westminster Hall. The
points that the hon. Member for Newbury made about the growth of
means testing in our benefit system is valid. There is almost an
acceptance of the growth of means testing and an end to the
contributory principle.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has moved a reasonable amendment which
suggests another route. We could follow that route. We could
increase people's disregard and allow them to retain more of
their own money. Not only that, we could remove it from the
capricious nature of politics in which it is up to the
politicians to increase the amounts on a yearly basis, or perhaps
conveniently to forget to increase them for a number of years.
We have seen that happen with other benefits.
<P>
The amendment provides a mechanism in which there is a degree
of certainty. An announcement will be made every year calculated
simply on the retail prices index, and recipients will understand
that it allows them a degree of certainty when they calculate tax
and the like that they will be able to retain more of their
money. If the hon. Member for Newbury wishes to put the amendment
to a vote&#151;it is a reasonable amendment and I think that he
should&#151;I will urge my hon. Friends to support him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> As my hon. Friend says, it is a good
amendment, which goes to the heart of the means-testing debate.
It is interesting, as he also said, that we seem to have
converted one or two hon. Members on the other side of the House,
although not on the other side of the Committee, to our views.
It is not so much a question of converting as that they have,
independently, long held the same view as ours on the unfairness
and deep social and economic damage done by means-testing and by
the folly of continuously extending it that is the Government's
agenda for welfare. It has been a source of considerable
artificiality in the Committee's proceedings that none of the
Labour Members who spoke against means-testing on Second Reading
have been allowed to be members of the Committee. Therefore, with
the honourable exception of the hon. Member for Colne Valley, we
have faced a mass of entirely silent people who are either
embarrassed at supporting the Bill or intimidated into saying
nothing against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt (High Peak)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> This is not my first intervention in our
proceedings. Surely the amendment is not against the principle
of means-testing in that it would provide only a small disregard
in the Bill. It does not change the principle of means-testing
although, as I have said, means-testing and targeting resources
on those most in need are surely two sides of the same coin?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman has clearly failed to
understand the amendment, the purpose of which is to weaken the
effect of means-testing by ensuring that the widowed children's
allowance, in this instance, is not entirely
discounted&#151;brought to nought&#151;by the application of
means-testing to other benefits.
<P>
If there were no disregard, there would be no benefit
whatever to an individual from having participated&#151;or from
her husband having participated&#151;in the national insurance
system because any money paid from that system would be
compensated for a by pound-for-pound reduction in the
means-tested benefit for which the widow was eligible, or
eligible in respect of her children. That would be the effect of
full means-testing, but the hon. Gentleman appears not to
appreciate it. A disregard would reduce the impact of
means-testing. I assume that the hon. Member for Newbury tabled
the amendment from precisely the same position as ours on the
Bill, which is that means-testing is bad, is part of the problem
in the welfare system rather than part of the solution, as I have
said many times, and that, where possible, it should be reduced,
or its effects mitigated. The amendment is an example of the
effective mitigation of the effects of means-testing. I hope that
the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) has now grasped the
point, but if he has not, and wishes to intervene once more, I
shall be happy to give way. If we proceed down means-testing's
route without some mitigation by way of disregard we will add
insult to injury. It would be deeply insulting to people on low
incomes who qualify for some benefit&#151;typically perhaps
housing benefit, and in circumstances that we are talking about,
income support and council tax benefit&#151;to be told, ``You've
qualified for the widowed children's allowance but you aren't
going to get it because we'll pay it to you with one hand but
take away all your other money with the other.'' Yet the person
who paid national insurance for many years&#151;the husband and
father of the children who are benefiting from the
allowance&#151;did so in the expectation and, at that time,
certain knowledge that his children and widow would be better off
if he died than they would have been if he fell on to the
means-tested safety net.
<P>
That was the whole point of making his contributions.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government are now turning round retrospectively and
saying, ``Ha, ha! You paid this money over the years but all that
effort is going to be brought to naught. We are going to ensure
that you get not another penny because, though we have to pay you
the statutory benefit, we will compensate by removing an
equivalent amount of means-tested benefits.'' This bereaved
family is made a mockery of by the Government.
<P>
Even this Government have accepted the need for some
disregard, but &#163;10 is excessively mean&#151;it is almost
insulting. It is also remarkable&#151;although not extraordinary
given the nature of the Government&#151;that the Government have
made no provision to index that disregard to ensure that its
value is maintained in real terms. I pay tribute to the hon.
Member for Newbury for incorporating in his amendments an
improved and more respectable element of
disregard&#151;&#163;20 a week&#151;and the necessary
provision for indexing it.
<P>
We all know from experience of the welfare system over the
years, particularly during the super-high inflation of the Labour
Government in the 1970s, how rapidly non-indexed welfare benefits
are brought to naught by inflation. Chancellor who find
themselves in a jam can all too readily gain some unanticipated
windfall at the expense of vulnerable members of the public by
a rapid reduction in the real value of benefits, through
inflation, if those benefits are not properly indexed.
<P>
If it is pre-eminently a good cause to protect the recipients
of widowed parents allowance&#151;and indubitably we
should&#151;we should be serious about it and ensure that
protection is maintained in real terms. Its value should be
protected, so the second part of the amendment is particularly
valuable and should be strongly supported.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury has done his homework commendably
well on the amount of the disregard. On the basis of a figure
supplied by the Government in response to a written question, the
cost of the disregard would be &#163;15 million. One does not
have to be a mathematical genius to work out that &#163;15
million is roughly 3 per cent. of the net take by the Government
out of the profits of widows as a result of the Bill's
provisions.
<P>
This morning, a precise figure of &#163;475 million was
mentioned and was not challenged by the Government. As I said,
&#163;15 million is in the order of 3 per cent. of that
amount&#151;a smidgen of the total. That is eminently
affordable. It is difficult to conceive of how &#163;15 million
could be better spent to produce some mitigation of the
pernicious effects of means-testing, which we have criticised
throughout our proceedings and which remains the most important
issue in the welfare provisions of the Bill. They are certainly
not about welfare reform, but welfare reduction and the hon.
Member for Newbury's reference to welfare abolition, which sounds
a little extreme at first, may well be an equally justified
description.
<P>
If we are to salvage what we can from the shipwreck of the
national insurance system practicably with the minimum
expenditure&#151;given the extremely unfortunate situation
created by the Government's election and their implementation of
a previously concealed agenda to massively extend means-testing
and emasculate our national insurance system&#151;I am afraid
that, inevitably, we will be fighting an orderly retreat over the
next year or two.
<P>
We want to save as much as we can for when we come back to
power and can run the country properly again. However, in the
meantime, we must keep to a minimum the undoubted damage being
done daily to so many of our national institutions, not least the
national insurance system. We ought to find ways of stemming that
tide and saving valuable ground. That useful exercise is
necessary to ensure that the task of restoring the national
insurance system is not insuperable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does not my hon. Friend agree that one of the
best features of the amendment is that it would allow people to
keep more of their own money? What do you think that does in
terms of self-esteem and rebuilding?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should not refer to
me in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend fell into the trap that all
Committee members fall into of using the second person pronoun
in an impersonal sense. He was using the pronoun in the plural,
but was interpreted as using it in a singular, personal sense by
the Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Stop showing off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was not showing off, but admitting
responsibility. I was in the confessional mode so much favoured
by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am gentle in my interpretation of the
rule, but on this occasion the hon. Member for Brentwood and
Ongar used ``you'' in a personal sense to address the hon. Member
for Grantham and Stamford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> All I can say is
<P>

I am sure that my hon. Friend will be able to complete the
quotation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is extremely important that a
Chairman should be able to understand what is going on. All I
understood was ``Mea culpa''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins.
<P>
I made it clear that we support the amendment. We pay tribute
to the hon. Member for Newbury. He has done his homework and made
a proposal which is extremely useful and pertinent to the
difficult circumstances that we face under the systematic attack
on the national insurance system. I hope that the hon. Member for
Newbury takes his amendment as seriously as we do.
<P>
We are trying to be open-minded and to examine all
ministerial suggestions positively and constructively. By
ministerial suggestions positively and constructively. By
contrast, Labour Members never make suggestions of any kind. The
Ministers alone speak for the Government, with the exception of
the hon. Member for Colne Valley, who makes occasional,
much-valued contributions. The Ministers never listen to the
merits of counter-arguments, and never suggest&#151;not even for
a moment&#151;that they might be wrong or that the Bill might
be susceptible to improvement.
<P>
We have got used to the intolerance enforced and strengthened
by the Government's massive majority and by the cynical media
manipulation machine that supports them. However, Conservative
Members have listened to suggestions and amendments made by
Liberal Democrats, and have tried to adopt a fair-minded,
positive and constructive approach to them. We have not been in
any way selfish, or allowed any sense of ``not invented here''
to influence our reactions to their amendments. When we have
thought that they have come up with a proposal that has genuine
merit, has been properly thought through, and addresses the needs
of the nation, we have decided to support it.
<P>
We have often found that we have the courage of their
convictions. We are prepared to stand up to the new Labour
Government, to press our amendments to the vote and to stand and
be counted. If we are defeated in Parliament, so be it. The
record will stand, and we will build on it when we return to
power.
<P>
I am afraid that&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
return to the subject of the amendment. He has been engaged on
something of a general peroration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My remarks are extremely pertinent to the
amendment, because they address the issue of whether we should
support it. I cannot take such a decision and avoid confronting
the Committee with the fact that when we support amendments
tabled by the Liberal Democrats they generally run away form
them. Once or twice in the Committee, I have pressed to the vote
an amendment that the Liberal Democrats originally formulated and
tabled. They are so terrified of upsetting this apparently
all-powerful Administration that they have run away from pressing
their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> To help the Committee to proceed, I assure the
hon. Gentleman that I intend to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I can see that the hon. Gentleman is finding the
trend of my remarks uncomfortable and wants to forestall me going
further. He has done that by giving me the answer that I wanted
to hear. I am delighted, and I hope that on many other occasions
the Liberal Democrat party, which used to be a grand British
political party that was never in fear of any
Administration&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We will have no lessons on the history
of the Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The modern Liberal Democrat party is represented
on the Committee by the hon. Member for Newbury who, I believe,
is planning to take over that party. He has the courage of his
convictions regarding this amendment at least. I hope that there
will be other occasions on which we may support the Liberal
Democrats. We shall be delighted to support this amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social</B><P>
Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley): I congratulate the hon. Member for
Newbury on having raised an important issue that he has
researched thoroughly and clearly understands. I, and I suspect
my hon. Friends, learned a great deal more from his two-minute
speech than from the 20-minute speech of the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford, who clearly did not understand the issue.
I suspect that the hon. Gentleman had not even read the
amendment.
<P>
The Committee knows, I hope, that the Government are
proposing a disregard in widowed parents allowance of &#163;10
a week in income support, and &#163;15 a week in other
income-related benefits. The hon. Members for Grantham and
Stamford and for Brentwood and Ongar fulminate against the
meanness of the disregard. I remind them that it is modelled
entirely on the disregard that the Conservative Government
introduced in relation to widowed mothers allowance. Our
intention is to apply to both men and women the provisions that
have applied only to widows and not to widowers.
<P>
  shirley
<P>
We believe that our proposal will help to address a key
problem with the current system&#151;that the poorest widows
benefit least. There is no need for primary legislation to
achieve that, or to ensure that the level of the disregard is
kept under regular review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Because it can be done by regulation, as it was
done in the past when the Conservative party was in power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Given the Labour party's record on means testing,
is the Minister seriously asking us to trust it to maintain the
real value of a protection against means testing?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I will come to the hon. Gentleman's remarks about
means testing, but people inside and outside the Committee
realise that they are absolute baloney.
<P>
I turn to the sensible points made by the hon. Member for
Newbury. I take it that his amendment was intended as a probing
amendment, so I am slightly surprised to hear that he will put
it to a vote. Of course, he is perfectly entitled to do so.
<P>
The amendment would extend the Government's proposals by
requiring us to make regulations&#151;and Conservative Members
seem opposed to them&#151;to set the disregard at &#163;20 and
to increase it annually. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar
clearly misunderstood the nature of the amendment. He said that
it would be better for people to keep their own money instead of
becoming dependent on means-tested benefits. He seems to have
missed the crucial point that the disregard is available only to
people who are on means-tested benefits.
<P>
That misunderstanding was compounded by the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford, who also does not understand that the
disregard is available to people on income support and other
means-tested benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister clearly was not following what I was
saying. The whole drift of my remarks was that a disregard
protects those on means-tested benefits who would otherwise lose
all the national insurance benefit. I do not think that I can be
accused of making speeches that are too short or of being
unclear. I made that point over and over again. We are clear as
to what a disregard achieves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I invite the hon. Gentleman to read the Hansard
record of what he said. When he misunderstood the nature of the
amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak made clear the
relationship of the amendment to means-tested benefits. The hon.
Gentleman now understands that; he is reasonably quick on the
uptake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> No, I will not. The hon. Gentleman spoke for 20
minutes and had plenty of time to make his case. On two or three
occasions, he said ``Aha! The Labour party is applying a tighter
means test.'' We are not applying a tighter means test, and that
is why his remarks are absolute baloney. We are simply doing what
the Conservative party did in previous legislation. We are making
the benefits that were available only to widows available to
widows and widowers.
<P>
The Government's proposed levels of &#163;10 and &#163;15
for the disregard are right for two reasons. First, they reflect
a careful judgment of relative priorities when resources are
inevitably limited. I note that the hon. Member for Newbury and
Conservative Members sought to increase the amount that the
Government spend by a further &#163;15 million. If the amendment
were accepted, that would add to its costs of &#163;100 million,
which Conservatives have already voted for, and &#163;120
million, which Liberal Democrats have already voted for.
<P>
Secondly, we believe that the disregard has been set at the
right level because, when we set it, we took particular account
of the proposed child maintenance disregard. That is a key issue.
Unlike deserted or separated parents, widows do not have a living
partner who shares responsibility for the maintenance of the
children. They could not benefit from the proposed new child
maintenance disregard. Instead, the disregard of widowed parents
allowance is available. It would be wrong to create a kind of
lottery, with different amounts of disregard available to the
poorest lone parents depending on the reasons for their being
alone. That is why I invite the hon. Member for Newbury to
withdraw what I take to be a probing amendment. If he will not,
I invite the Committee to reject it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman realise that in his last
sentence he once again gave the game away? He revealed that he
does not believe in the national insurance system. To someone who
believes in it, it seems perfectly fair that a person should have
more money for his widow and children, having contributed to the
national insurance system and the child benefit allowance, which
we are discussing. That would not be the case for someone who was
benefiting from a payment via the Child Support Agency. Those
factors would make it perfectly reasonable for those in the first
example to be better off than a divorced mother. The hon.
Gentleman's remarks have once again revealed that the Labour
party does not believe in the national insurance principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Member for Newbury will have to excuse
me while we go round a loop that the Committee has unfortunately
been forced to travel several times, which is not germane to the
amendment. It is the height of cheek for the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford to strut in Committee, posing as the
defender of the contributory principle. When his party came to
government in 1979, 63 per cent. of the benefit spend went on
contributory benefits. By the time it left office it had cut that
to 46 per cent. The proportion of means-tested benefits when it
took office was 16 per cent. and when it left office it had more
than doubled that to 34 per cent.
<P>
The provision that we are considering extends a contributory
benefit to widowed men where that was not available before. What
the hon. Gentleman said was not just inaccurate, but the height
of cheek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I sought to catch your eye, Mr. Malins, although
I know that you will shortly call the hon. Member for Newbury,
because an intervention of the length that you would have been
likely to permit would not have been sufficient to rebut the
unjustified attack that has just been made on me. I have actually
been accused of cheek. What an arrogant Government! They think
that criticism should properly be characterised as cheek. Being
unable to take criticism and thinking that anyone who offers it
is being cheeky is the very definition of arrogance. I shall be
accused soon of lese majeste, or blasphemy, if I
dare to criticise the Prime Minister&#151;let alone Mr. Alastair
Campbell.
<P>
Two things should be said in response to the Minister. It is
perfectly true that universal contributory benefits fell as a
proportion of the social security budget during the Conservative
Administration between 1979 and 1997, but that was largely the
result of the introduction of new means-tested benefits, notably
family credit, rather than the means-testing of existing
contributory benefits. That makes all the difference in the
world. Labour Members&#151;even the hon. Member for High
Peak&#151;should be able to grasp that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> How are the hon. Gentleman's remarks consistent
with his party's introduction of jobseeker's allowance? The
relevant benefit used to be contributory, but is no longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I find myself once again having to correct
Department of Social Security Ministers' understanding of the
benefits for which their Department is responsible. There are two
aspects to the jobseeker's allowance. The contributory
jobseeker's allowance runs for six months&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is in danger of being
sidetracked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I accept that the six-month figure is a reduction
from that at which unemployment benefit, as the predecessor to
the jobseeker's allowance was called, stood in 1979. I used the
word ``largely'' advisedly. I said that the figures quoted by the
hon. Gentleman are largely a reflection of the introduction of
new means-tested benefits and not of the means testing of
existing contributory benefits.
<P>
The Government have a perverse record. That ratio is
continuing to fall and is falling dramatically because of the
means testing of previously universal contributory benefits,
including widow's benefit and incapacity benefit, which we shall
discuss shortly. That is the difference. Even the hon. Member for
High Peak must be able to understand the difference for
beneficiaries of our welfare system between an old, means-tested
benefit&#151;family benefit has been a very positive benefit
which has been imitated around the world because it was a
particularly innovative and impressive addition to the history
of state welfare&#151;and destroying or emasculating an existing
contributory benefit and making it means tested. That is the
agenda on which the Government are engaged.
<P>
The second charge to which I must respond is that I am
inconsistent, which is much more serious than cheek. It was
implied that my support for the contributory principle and the
national insurance system is opportunistic or insincere. The
Under-Secretary of State made a serious charge and if there were
any truth in it it would have upset me. But there is no truth in
it. I have considerable admiration for the information storage
and retrieval system operated by the modern Labour party. The
Under-Secretary of State uncovered some comments I had made on
Newcastle Radio&#151;he deserves a prize&#151;and I thought at
the time that one could not even get away with saying something
on Newcastle Radio without Mr Alastair Campbell's office putting
it on the computer in the ministry of propaganda. He had some fun
at my expense, which is fair enough, but I do not doubt that his
researchers have been searching the computer trying to find
something which I may have said or written at any stage in my
career in favour of greater means testing or which is
inconsistent with my strong support for the principle of social
insurance as represented by the national insurance system. They
will have been unable to find anything. Those researchers must
have broken the keys of their computers from bashing them in fury
because they could not come up with such a quotation. They may
have come up with reverse quotations from days long before I was
a party spokesman and they may have come up with a number of
inconsistent themes in my political career, one or two of which
the Minister knows about in a different context. But my support
for the national insurance system is long-standing and
consistent.
<P>
I do not mind being accused of cheek and if it is cheek to
criticise the new Labour Government for their arrogance and
unwillingness to accept the facts of what they are doing, they
will hear a lot more cheek from me before we have finished. I do
not want to be accused of insincerity or inconsistency and such
charges will not stick. I challenge Opposition Members to find
a single instance when I said anything that was inconsistent with
what I have said in the Committee on the national insurance
system and the evils of means testing.

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I do not intend to take long. The hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford was wrong in thinking that he had persuaded
me with his wonderful peroration to press the amendment to a
vote. That decision was taken some time before he started to
speak, not least in relation to the support from the Conservative
Benches. I am, as you notice, Mr. Malins, rather lonely on the
Opposition Benches today. I explained earlier that my hon. Friend
the Member for Winchester is ill disposed with a severe stomach
upset and is unable to join us, so it is good to know that I have
support for my amendment from Conservative Members.

shortly before we broke for dinner, I misinformed the Committee.
I must apologise for doing so and set the record straight.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford complained that our
disregards of widowed parents allowance of &#163;10 and
&#163;15 were not generous enough, and I said that they were the
same as the disregards that we inherited, which applied to the
widowed mothers allowance under previous legislation. In fact,
there was no disregard at all. Our proposal is new and it will
be more generous than benefits that were available hitherto.
<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for
correcting the situation. He said that the proposed disregard
will be more generous than those that were previously available.
I accept that, but it is not good enough for me or for other
Opposition Members, not least because&#151;as I explained
earlier&#151;it is important to get money to those who need it
most. The Government claim that they want to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives me an
opportunity to respond to the Under-Secretary. I acknowledge, in
my usual fair-minded fashion, that &#163;10 is better than
nothing, but that &#163;20, which the hon. Member for Newbury
proposed, would be better still.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted to have such support.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendments
Nos. 129 to 131.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This narrow, probing amendment will correct an
anomaly in the Bill, which states that if a person is claiming
widowed parents allowance immediately before reaching pension
age, he or she will receive a pension at the allowance rate, as
stated in subsection (2). However, as subsection (4) states, if
they stop receiving widows pension benefit a day before reaching
pension age, the pension that they receive will not be related
to that allowance. The amendment would make subsection (2) apply
only so long as the allowance had been payable if the person had
not reached pension age. Having spelled that out, and in respect
for the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), I shall
sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful for the succinct manner in which the
hon. Gentleman moved that amendment. As I understand it, the
intention here is to apply the same rules for those who have been
bereaved but do not have a dependent child at pension age to
those who did have a dependent child at pension age, once the
dependency ends.
<P>
There is no need for an amendment to achieve that, because
the Bill as drafted will ensure the same outcome. Perhaps it will
be helpful if I explain how that is the case. Under the
proposals, widowed parents who satisfy the qualifying conditions
will receive a widowed parents allowance equivalent to the
current widowed mothers allowance. That consists of two parts:
a basic allowance paid at the same rate as the full standard rate
retirement pension, plus SERPS based on the late spouse's
earnings-related national insurance contributions. Also payable
are allowances for each dependent child, but those are provided
for separately in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits
Act 1992.
<P>
Widowed parents allowance ceases to be paid at pension age.
Those widows and widowers who are still receiving that allowance
when they reach pension age will be entitled, as in the current
scheme, to a retirement pension at the same weekly rate as the
allowance, consisting of a full basic pension and SERPS. That
will be the same as before. That can be added to any SERPS of
their own, subject to the maximum payable to a single person
reaching pension age. Additionally, the same allowances are
payable with retirement pension for child dependants. As widowed
parents allowance has ceased when the youngest child in the
family is no longer considered to be dependent, all that will
happen is that the child allowance will cease to be paid. That
is exactly the same position as now, except that the benefit is
extended to widowers.
<P>
I shall briefly speak to the amendments in my name, which
have been grouped with amendment No. 112. Unfortunately, the
clause, as drafted, does not fully achieve our intention in the
case of widowed parents, where there is a gap between the widowed
parents allowance finishing and retirement pension being claimed.
Our amendments will ensure that, as now, if the widow or widower
was aged 45 or over when the widowed parents allowance ended, the
amount of retirement pension will be reduced by 7 per cent. for
each year that their age at that point was less than 55, to
produce a maximum reduction of 70 per cent. In the case of people
without dependants, an entitlement to bereavement allowance at
any time will mean that inherited SERPS can be claimed at pension
age. We have already had a discussion about our intentions in
that regard. I therefore beg to move Government amendments Nos.
129 to 131 and I hope that the hon. Member for Brentwood and
Ongar will feel able to withdraw amendment No. 112.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister has given a model reply. Had he
been as helpful as this on other parts of the Bill, our
deliberations would probably now be complete. Having received
that assurance from him, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.

23, leave out `a work-focused interview' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an interview to advise on employment opportunities, benefit
take up, and other issues of relevance to specific claimant

</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall now consider a series of amendments that deal with
what is known as the single gateway. The next four amendments
that I shall move, three of which are grouped together, would
attempt to make the single gateway work better. In principle, we
are not opposed to the idea that people who claim some form of
benefit should have the opportunity to be interviewed by a
personal adviser who should impart useful information to them.
However, we are worried about the compulsory element of the
single gateway and, in particular, the implied threat that
claimants may have their benefits restricted simply because, for
one reason or another, they fail to attend the appropriate
interview.
<P>
The Government claim that they want to help people who can
work to find work through the single gateway. If the single
gateway is to succeed, people must not be deterred by its rather
off-putting conditions. That is the background to the four
amendments. I shall now introduce each in turn and, in doing so,
I hope not to repeat that background.
<P>
 Hannington
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should tell the hon. Gentleman that
each amendment will be taken separately and we will vote on them
accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am sorry if I misled you, Mr. Malins. I did not
mean to imply that I hoped to move all four amendments at once.
When moving the first amendment, and to avoid repeating myself,
I made general points that apply to all four amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 reaches to the heart of the purpose of the
single gateway. At present, the single gateway is
specifically&#151;and, I believe, deliberately&#151;a
``work-focused gateway''. I suspect that the Government
deliberately included those words in the Bill to impart to the
single gateway a particular aura. In our view, that phrase will
put off people from the entire procedure. If the single gateway
is to help people back into work by encouraging them to attend
interviews and seek the advice that they need, it should not be
seen as a means to force them back into work. However, it is
likely to be interpreted in that way if it is described as a
``work-focused gateway''.
<P>
The amendment would remove the words, ``a work-focused
interview'' and substitute the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an interview to advise on employment opportunities, benefit
take-up, and other issues of relevance to specific claimant
groups.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would give the procedure a different feel, which we want
to encourage. The purpose of the single gateway is to help
claimants, not to force them to do something. If we could
encourage them to believe that the single gateway was of benefit,
the process would be more popular. If people thought that they
were going to benefit from interviews, they would be happier
about attending them and taking the advice that was tendered
rather than rejecting it because it was forced on them.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would make the single gateway a one-stop shop
for delivering benefits and information on seeking and obtaining
work&#151;if that is what they want to do&#151;to claimants.
We hope to ensure that the interview is about more than work. The
single gateway should offer to provide payments with advice about
benefit entitlement, child care, training opportunities, help
with caring for others&#151;because people may want to do
that&#151;and other valuable information to help new claimants
without focusing on work. If we put too much emphasis on the
paid-work aspect of the single gateway, it will be seen as a
punitive measure that threatens claimants with benefit
disentitlement rather than a positive measure that helps them.
<P>
We want to reduce the emphasis that is put on paid work
rather than on unpaid or caring work. Too little in the Bill
demonstrates that the Government see unpaid caring work as being
as valuable as paid work. The focus on paid work ignores the
important work that is done by carers of the disabled, elderly,
sick or children under the age of five. Our society has
undervalued that work. If the Government concentrate on the
``work-focused gateway'', they will increase the extent to which
those people feel undervalued. The priority for those groups that
wish to be carers should be to facilitate their choice in taking
up that caring role and to ensure that they know about the help
and benefits that are available to them.
<P>
The Government have ignored the great value of unpaid and
therapeutic work for people who have been out of work for some
time or who have had trouble getting back into work, perhaps
because they have disabilities. Such work gives people contact
with the labour market and gradually encourages them to take a
first step towards getting the means to taking paid work at a
later stage.
<P>
The gateway should do a great deal more than focusing on
getting people back into paid work. By changing the description
of the single gateway, as proposed in amendment No. 92, we would
do much to encourage its popularity. It would be more acceptable
and people would wish to use it rather than avoid it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw (Chatham and Aylesford)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Jonathan Shaw.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I am grateful for that cheer. The last time that
I was cheered before I spoke was at a meeting in my constituency
in Snodland.
<P>
The single gateway has been widely welcomed by all lobby
groups. It is a policy that has the stamp of the Labour
party&#151;not just in Parliament but in the
country&#151;firmly on it. My colleagues and I conducted policy
forums throughout the country last year and party members told
us that a simplified system&#151;or a one-stop-shop, as the hon.
Member for Newbury called it&#151;was required. Benefits are
confusing&#151;claimants are sent here, there, back and all over
the place in pursuit of them. My experience of working with young
people taught me that they found the system confusing. The
Government's measure should therefore be warmly welcomed. It is
at the heart of the welfare reforms and ties in with out approach
to the new deal.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury said that the single gateway
should not force people into work. He called for a change of
emphasis in the description of what it will provide. For people
in receipt of benefits, however, it is not the title that matters
but the practical effect. In the case of the new deal, young
people who have been to job centres have experienced a revolution
in the approach of personal advisers. It is people's experiences
that matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> My hon. Friend will no doubt share my experience
of talking to those working in the administration of the new deal
as well as claimants. Such people are experiencing a new culture
and a new purpose in their job. Does he not share my conviction
that the same positive mood will spread among single gateway
advisers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. One young man who
had been unemployed for two years and has now obtained employment
with a local construction company asked me why the new deal was
not introduced years ago. I was delighted to tell him that the
new deal was part of the Government's welfare-to-work programme.
My hon. Friend is absolutely right&#151;the new deal has changed
the culture of the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency and
other related agencies.
<P>
I understand people's worries about attending interviews. The
old culture was one of trip up, find out and blame. But a
different approach&#151;one of assistance&#151;has now been
introduced. People will need time to understand that. The
amendments are unnecessary because of the points that I have made
about the changing culture and the importance of people's
experiences. Staff training is at the centre of that changing
culture, as later amendments mention. Training must be of the
highest quality and there must be proper monitoring to ensure
that people do not feel that they are to blame for being on
benefit. A series of checks will be reviewed during the pilot
projects that will precede the launch of the programme throughout
the country. The way in which the different agencies work
together will be studied carefully and partnership with trade
unions representing different staff groups will be necessary.
Quality must be ensured; I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister
of State will deal with that later in the Committee.
<P>
Many vulnerable individuals in our communities live in
housing association accommodation provided by registered social
landlords. Housing benefit includes a care component. If those
people do not understand the letters that they receive or choose
to ignore them, they could lose their housing benefit. That would
harm them, as well as the housing associations that are the
registered social landlords. Will guidance be given to the
agencies providing the service, requiring them to contact the
careworkers working in registered social housing to advise them
that tenants will be invited for interview? That could easily be
dealt with in guidance to the local agency.
<P>
These provisions lie at the heart of the reforms and
epitomise the change in culture that we want to achieve. I have
talked to many individuals who have experienced the new deal and
the different relationships with special advisers, and who say
that it is a revolution&#151;something that they have not
experienced in the past&#151;and it is working well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I support the amendment, which I see as a probing
amendment. It seems that there is common sense in the so-called
``single gateway'' approach and there is common sense in what I
would describe as the case officer approach. Although it is not
directly relevant, nowhere would have benefited more than the
Child Support Agency from having competent case officers, who
would have made life a lot easier for people.
<P>
The idea that someone will sort out a person&#151;by finding
that person the right job, working out what benefits he or she
is entitled to, and even helping to sort out his or her life
where problems result from tragedies, such as
widowhood&#151;must make sense.
<P>
Do the Government intend that there should be any discipline?
The suggested discipline, that anyone who does not turn up to an
interview will lose benefits, is not good enough and will not be
put into effect in practice. As the hon. Member for Newbury said,
it sends out the wrong signal because it says, not ``Come to us
and get sorted out'', but ``Come to us and we will make you
work.'' In many circumstances, it may not be right for people to
work. They might have young children or other dependants to look
after, so work might not be the answer.
<P>
 wink
<P>
Equally, discipline is needed within the system. With the
best will in the world, just as people do not pay more tax than
they are legally obliged to pay, so too, people will naturally
try to claim every benefit to which they are entitled. I am not
clear what the Government's stance is on discipline in relation
to entitlement to welfare.
<P>
Finally, do the Government intend that, as the role of the
case officers develops, they will have some discretion within the
law on legal entitlement? That may naturally develop because a
case officer is most likely to know whether people are cohabiting
and milking the system. What is the Government's thinking on the
growing importance of case officers? It strikes me that that
thinking is pointed at a rather wet cop-out that will not work.
It does not make sense to say, ``You will lose your benefits if
you do not turn up for an interview.'' The Government will not
dare to do that in practice, and it sends entirely the wrong
signal.
<P>
Secondly, as has been mentioned, my concept of case officers
is that their task goes much wider than merely directing people
to a job; it is often about sorting out their wider problems so
that they can get back on track and manage their lives
successfully by themselves.
<P>
This is a suitable occasion on which to hear more from the
Government about to how they see matters developing. The
initiative will clearly not stop where it is at present.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I am feeling less charitable
than my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr.
Flight) and I will speak against the amendment.
<P>
The speech of the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr.
Shaw) struck me enormously. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend
the member for Gainsborough anticipates me. What struck me
particularly strongly were the hon. Gentleman's first couple of
sentences. If I may do so within the rules of order, I will
paraphrase them. The sense of the hon. Gentleman's words was:
``at last, we've got something in the Bill that I agree with.''
He went out of his way to say that the proposals were what the
Labour party was all about and how pleased his constituents were.
What a relief it must be to come to a part of the Bill that he
feels able to support.
<P>
As we debated the clause, I remembered the broad rule of
thumb that has applied over the past two years to almost all the
Government's policies&#151;that they tend to fall into two
categories. I am quite clear about which category clause 47 falls
into. The two categories of policy are those that are
continuations and developments of earlier Conservative policies
and those that are failing. The clause falls broadly into the
first category. Through the jobseeker's allowance, we had already
gone a long way towards introducing a single gateway. I am,
therefore, delighted to be able to speak to the first amendment
to the clause.
<P>
I wish the promoter of the amendment, the hon. Member for
Newbury, no ill when I say that I understand and even agree with
some of the underlying points that he made, but that the
amendment is not appropriate. [Laughter.] How nice it is, at this
late hour, to find a degree of consensus emerging in the
Committee.
<P>
The amendment would apply across a range of different
categories of claimant. Indeed, it is not targeted at one or two
of the more specific groups as, to be fair to the hon. Member for
Chatham and Aylesford, some of the amendments that we shall reach
shortly are. The amendment applies across the whole category.
<P>
It goes without saying, as the hon. Gentleman observed at
least implicitly, that any sensible person who conducts what the
clause calls a work-directed interview is bound to consider
issues such as training needs or, where appropriate, child care.
Indeed, it would be difficult in the case of many claimants to
have a work-focused interview that did not cover those issues.
<P>
The amendment would, however, change an environment that
should be robust but encouraging to one in which people simply
leant over backwards and which ran into danger of becoming simply
a counselling session. Of course, many people who go into
benefits offices need counselling of one sort or another. From
time to time, when I visit my local benefits offices&#151;I am
extremely impressed with the quality of staff there&#151;they
recommend individual claimants for counselling because those
claimants, for a range of reasons, clearly need counselling
before entering the world of work.
<P>
To include in the Bill the provisions sugggested by the hon.
Member for Newbury, at least in this much broader amendment, so
that they apply across all categories of claimant seems at best
redundant and could, at worst, open up all sorts of specious and
complicated grounds for appeals to subsequent tribunals if there
are arguments about benefit. For that reason, I oppose the
amendment. Although I have a certain sympathy for some of the
hon. Gentleman's underlying points, they are better argued with
some of the more specific categories. There is no case for
including such an all-embracing proposal in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It will come as no surprise to the Committee, or
indeed to my hon. Friend, to know that I will not neccessarily
go down the same path as him. [Hon. Members: ``Splits.''] It is
nice to know that some Government Back Benchers support the Bill,
because we have not heard a great deal from them&#151;in support
or anything else.
<P>
I should like to use this opportunity to probe the
Government's attitude to the people whom they believe will
benefit from a single gateway interview. The hon. Member for
Newbury has tried to widen the parameters of the interview, but
my concern is for people who are mentally ill. I take a great
deal of interest in the Beckenham organisations that work with
mentally-ill people, and have spent quite a lot of time working
with sufferers. I am conscious of their concerns about the issues
that are raised by single gateway work-focused interviews.
<P>
A problem for many mentally ill people is that employment
service staff, however well trained, reflect the level of
knowledge in the rest of society about the problems that afflict
mentally ill people. It takes some time before even a trained
person is aware that some people who turn up are mentally ill.
The stress for such a person, even in preparing for the
interview, can worsen the illness. There are fears among the
families of some mentally ill people that the stress of the
interview process and the fear of losing benefits could lead some
people, with some types of mental illness, to threaten suicide.
<P>
Of course, not everyone is in that position. For instance,
I have a constituent whose case has not yet reached the Minister
of State, although I have a horrible feeling that it will in due
course. My constituent is a paranoid psychotic with a whole range
of other problems; he has been turned down for disabled living
allowance, and is in the process of appealing to a tribunal. I
have got to know this gentleman quite well over the past few
weeks and months, and have tried to help him to get to an appeal.
Believe me, there is no way that this gentleman should ever, ever
be invited to a single gateway interview. I hope that there will
be people at the tribunal who understand his mental problems.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I cheekily ask whether this individual is one
of those grass-roots Labour party activists whom we read about
recently?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> In defence of my constituent, I must say that he
has more common sense.
<P>
I have a very clear focus on one constituent who would not
give of his best if invited to this sort of interview. I met
various people who were members of an organisation called Horizon
Clubs. I know about their efforts to get back into work and about
the systems and schemes that they have set up to help them to do
so. Being invited to such an interview would add to the stress
with which those people have to deal. They voluntarily want to
get back into work, and see that that is how they must proceed.
They cannot cope with such interviews, however, and they are not
sufficiently organised for them because of their illnesses. They
are also not sufficiently abreast of the infomation that one
assumes that the interviewer would want, which would help them
to make a case for or against going back into work. Such people
are very willing to get back into work and want to do so.
<P>
I am not making a plea for not helping mentally ill people
to get back into work. The circumstances under discussion are
very stressful&#151;people are taken out of an environment in
which they feel comfortable and are challenged in a way that they
cannot cope with and which could worsen their illnesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. I hope
that she will agree that her points would be especially well
focused if addressed to a number of amendments listed under the
clause that will be considered later. They include amendment No.
94, which deals with bringing a representative to a meeting, and
amendment No. 78, which proposes specific changes relating to
disability.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall probably repeat my arguments when the
Committee reaches those amendments. I thought that this was an
opportune moment to alert the Minister to the issues that I have
mentioned, which the Committee will discuss further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond </B>(Gravesham): Unlike the hon. Member for
Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), I do not wish to undermine the hon.
Lady's points. She would surely acknowledge the important role
of training for the staff involved in the single work-focused
gateway. The hon. Member for Gainsborough will agree that when
the Select Committee considered the disability living allowance
one issue that arose was the need for staff dealing with disabled
people to have proper disability awareness training. I am sure
that the hon. Lady is not suggesting that that is unimportant,
although she is making other additional points.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I thought
that I had said that we needed to improve the training of staff
at the gateways. It would help enormously if all Benefits Agency
staff were better trained in recognising the problems of mental
health and mentally ill people. The whole of the British
population could do with training in how to deal with mentally
ill people. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that one
of the biggest problems that such people have to cope with is
stigma.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I have a question further to the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond). Would the
hon. Lady find it more acceptable if an adviser of such calibre
were to visit her constituent in his home to discuss future
options?
<P>
[Interruption.]
<P>
  Chris
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I think that I heard the hon. Member for Gravesham
pointing out an amendment that will be considered later, which
is exactly what I was going to do. The hon. Member for High Peak
is right&#151;there is an argument for people with mental health
problems to be visited in their own homes. Such people still have
to be advised on the broadest possible basis, however, which is
the intention of the amendment to which I am speaking. I shall
not get too diverted, if the hon. Gentleman will excuse me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not want to tempt my hon. Friend to be
diverted. Given the point just made by the Member for High Peak,
I should point out that some of the briefing from the disability
benefits consultant makes a strong point. The consultant has said
that some disabled people would find an interview at home
intrusive and rather threatening. It is important not to have
ready-made solutions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> That is absolutely correct.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Lady, and Committee
Members in general, will recognise that a series of amendments
to the clause have been tabled. Various matters come up for
discussion under different amendments. Amendment No. 92 stands
on its own, and it is important to stay within its confines.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins. I was hoping very much to
be able to stay within the confines of the amendment, but I have
been tempted down paths that perhaps I should not have followed,
which have been offered to me from hon. Members on both sides of
the Committee.
<P>
I turn to a concern that, again, refers back to the original,
much broader, amendment about the nature of the interview. People
who deal with mental health problems are familiar with the fact
that illnesses are often sporadic in nature. On one occasion a
person could turn up for an interview and appear to be wholly
well, but in a matter of days or weeks they could be very ill
again. The problem is that if the system focuses on them when
they are particularly well, they can be badly let down by the
system because it is not sufficiently flexible and speedy to be
able to react when people get into a cycle of depression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am sure that the hon. Lady is making a good
point about the sporadic nature of some forms of mental problems.
Will she accept that there are also some physical problems that
have the same sort of incidence rate, where one can be very well
at some times and very ill at other times?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I accept that point. I was tempted to include
problems such as MS but decided to focus entirely on the problems
of mental health, because I knew that if I did not I would be
brought back into order by the Chairman. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will therefore forgive me if I do not follow him down
that route.
<P>
Another issue that arises from the cyclical nature of some
mental health problems is that the way in which the benefits
system interacts and the medical advice that is given to people
to help them to recover can lead to some difficult financial
problems for some people. I have a case in my constituency
involving a gentleman who suffers from severe depression. His
medical adviser recommended that he should be given some form of
therapeutic work. The hon. Member for Newbury's comment about
therapeutic work brought that case to mind. That part of the
therapy was receiving money, but the problem then arose that he
began to lose his benefits. We are now having to try to resolve
that interaction problem of benefits and a pittance, his own
earned money. That money came into conflict with the benefits
that he was receiving, leaving the rest of the family
considerably worse off.
<P>
We need to have people who are not only highly trained and
flexible in dealing with mental health cases, but who have the
ability to give advice on benefits that is so encyclopaedic that
the situations that I have briefly outlined&#151;to which, I
give the Committee good warning, I will no doubt return&#151;can
be dealt with through the interview process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It gives me great pleasure to support the
Government and resist the Liberal amendment. I suppose that I am
safe in doing so, because it is unlikely that any one will read
the Hansard record of our proceedings. My hon. Friend the Member
for Brentwood and Ongar suggested in an earlier debate that
people should pick up our copies of Hansard, which I found
alarming. I have calculated that if the Committee has 20
sittings, it will cost the public some &#163;80 to buy all the
relevant editions of Hansard. I have also calculated that if we
strung together all the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for
Grantham and Stamford, they would amount to a fair-sized book.
That would mean that instead of paying &#163;4.99 for a Jeffrey
Archer in the book store, we could pay &#163;80 for the
collected speeches of my hon. Friend&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am finishing this point.
<P>
As I said, it gives me great pleasure to support the
Government on this measure, and to welcome them into the ranks
of the Thatcherite radical right. For years, some of us have been
trying to persuade various soggy Conservative Governments to be
rather more tough in their approach to benefits.
<P>
I therefore want to support the Government, and encourage
them to resist them to resist any pressure from the Liberals or
their own left wing. What they propose is quite the right thing
to do; I am not just making a speech late at night to tease the
Government. Seriously, the Government are doing the right thing.
We must have clearly framed legislation, as we have in the clause
as drafted. If we were to accept the amendment proposed by the
Liberal party, that would undoubtedly dilute the clause. Frankly,
it is not good enough just to have a general chat.
<P>
In the Government's defence, such people would not be
required to come along just to talk about a job&#151;to be told,
``I am sorry, but you want a benefit, and there is this job,
which is not very suitable, but you must take it.'' The
explanatory note about the Government's new contract for welfare
and the gateway into work states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``After claimants make initial contact to supply basic
information such as the benefits to be claimed, and other details
relevant to the claim, they will be allocated a personal adviser.
The adviser will carry out work-focused interviews with each
individual, assessing their job potential, and provide access to
a range of help and information on work, benefits and services
such as childcare.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So, as I understand it, the Government do not propose just
a work-focused interview; they are also prepared, as we read on
page 73 of the explanatory notes, to provide a general interview
to give help on the matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Canterbury&#151;child care, and the rest of it.
<P>
Earlier I had a bit of fun with my remarks about what
happened under the previous Government.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am a little confused by what the hon. Gentleman
is saying. He appears to be saying on the one hand that the
Government are absolutely right, because we ought to be focused
purely on work, but on the other that what the Government propose
is not focused purely on work, it is focused on all sorts of
other things&#151;exactly the things that I have suggested in
the amendment should describe the single gateway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We could argue the semantics of it. If we read the
Bill, it is clear that the interview will be work-focused. People
will come in not for a general chat about what benefits are
available to them; they will come in to be helped into a job. My
point was that the Government are being quite reasonable, and
saying that although people will be helped into a job, unlike as
happened in the past&#151;when people were taken into a spartan
atmosphere and moral pressure may have been put on them to take
unsuitable jobs&#151;they will allow the interview to be broadly
based.
<P>
However, it would be a mistake to dilute the Bill in the way
that the hon. Member for Newbury wants. We would not then focus
our attention, and the Bill, on what is needed.
<P>
To be fair to the Government, the explanatory notes also
state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There are already comprehensive powers to require those
claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (who will make up the majority of
claimants entering the gateway) to attend work-focused
interviews.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To be fair to the Conservative Government, presumably they
were also moving along those lines.
<P>
I would like to give the Government credit for the personal
adviser idea. I have always thought the problem with our social
security system was that it was too impersonal. However, for how
long will people have their personal adviser? I am sure that the
Government have set that out, but it would not do any harm to
make it clear now that people can return to that personal adviser
again and again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way.
I hesitate to interrupt when he is being so supportive of the
Government. Does he agree that the personal adviser role is
important because so many people with disabilities live in an
isolated world? A group in my constituency helps people with
agoraphobia. I helped the members to set themselves up as a
proper charity.
<P>
At its inaugural meeting, one of the people who had been a
user of the organisation, explained that she could stay only for
a few moments to address the group about her problems because she
had to go to her teaching job later that afternoon. She had
received help and support to get back into society and to
overcome her difficulties. One of my concerns about the
contribution from the hon. Member for Beckenham is that perhaps
we will be writing those people off. We need to ensure that the
support is there in the personal adviser role to bring them back
in again.
<P>
 Sue Smith
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I accept that point, and I take on board the
points made by hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham from her
personal knowledge. However, I have confidence in the way that
these interviews will be set up. We can look at later amendments
but I am confident that, notwithstanding the good points made by
my hon. Friend, it will be possible to recognise people with a
particular problem or disability.
<P>
We are embarking on something very exciting here. We are now
changing the whole focus of the welfare state as we get much more
technically advanced computer software. We are changing the focus
of the welfare state away from the general disbursement of cash
benefits&#151;I hesitate to use these catch-phrases as they come
from the lips of Labour party supporters, but why cannot we
occasionally be bipartisan about this? We are talking about real
people and real issues. Given the limitations of computer
technology, it has been difficult to move away from the
girocheque-based DSS, but we can now move towards a much more
personally based advisory service. But we have to be tough. There
is a political price to be paid. This is quite a tough thing to
do. It is much cheaper and easier just to hand out the
girocheques.
<P>
If the Government are really serious about this and want to
give effective personal advice and to ensure that the person can
come back again and again to the personal adviser and can be
helped not just into one job but into many and given the sort of
advice that the hon. Member for Newbury rightly wants them to be
given, it will be expensive. This is a big commitment. I hope
that we are not merely dealing in headlines here. I hope that the
Government are really committed to spending the resources on
shifting the nature of the welfare state into this personal
flexible service, which is prepared to be both tough and tender.
I do not know who first used that phrase&#151;tough on the
workshy, but tender to those who need help into work. I am
delighted to support the Government on this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I think that we will probably have to
have a free vote on this amendment. I shall probably find
myself&#151;amazingly&#151;supporting the Liberals, but we will
see where we go. The interesting point about the debate is that,
for the first time, there may not be that much difference in
terms of the principles that we are espousing on different sides
of the Committee or on our long-term objectives.
<P>
The Opposition greatly appreciated the contribution from the
hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford. One of the attractive
features of the House is that, when one serves on a
Committee&#151;including a Standing Committee on a Bill&#151;it
is on the whole a unique opportunity to get to know colleagues
on both sides of the House, to get to know their views, their
personalities and perhaps their idiosyncrasies. That is
particularly valuable where Members on the opposite side of the
House are concerned, whom one does not get so many opportunities
to get to know. I was worried that we were reaching the end of
the Bill and that we would not hear anything from Labour Back
Benchers and that we would leave the Committee with no greater
understanding of their views, or knowledge of them as human
beings, than when we started. That would be a pity. It has been
positive that we have started to hear one or two tentative and
timorous contributions to our debates and I hope that they will
be encouraged to take part further.
<P>
I find it difficult to disagree with anything that the hon.
Member for Chatham and Aylesford said and I was not trying to
disagree. Contrary to some impressions, I am not a naturally
antagonistic person. I like to feel that I give credit where it
is due and that I am open-minded. I certainly do not think that
I am dogmatic or unreasonable.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have had cause to use strong language about some of the
Government's actions and about some of the proposals contained
in the Bill. Nevertheless, I very much welcome the single gateway
and the concept of work-focused interviews. As has already been
said, there is probably more continuity than revolution in their
proposals. The Bill continues in the direction first taken with
the introduction of jobseeker's allowance, which was a major
step. However, I entirely accept the critique that aspects of the
jobseeker's allowance are unduly negative. The emphasis tends to
be on imposing penalties for not making the effort to find a job,
rather than on offering positive help and support for unemployed
people.
<P>
The great job for the Committee when probing the Government
is to find out whether the proposals represent a genuine advance
on the hitherto rather bureaucratic approach to administering the
jobseeker's allowance. The amendment tabled by the Liberal
Democrats provides a good opportunity for that. The system as it
is presented tells applicants, ``Here is the allowance. You must
go through the following hoops and procedures or you lose it, and
that's that.'' The Committee must discover whether Government
Departments will be able to give positive advice and help people
who, in most cases, regard unemployment as a personal reverse and
a problem to be dealt with.
<P>
Some people are professional scroungers. I have always said
that such people must be toughly dealt with. We all know that
members of our profession can lose their jobs&#151;even members
of the Government are not so complacent that they do not
recognise that. If we lost our jobs, we would need help. We would
appreciate an opportunity for sympathetic, well-informed advice
based on experience. It would be thoroughly positive if that were
to be offered at the taxpayer's expense by the Employment Service
or by the Benefits Agency. I shall come to their relationship
soon.
<P>
We want to know whether there will be such a positive step
forward. Can we believe the rhetoric? Is it just rhetoric and is
the proposal just gimmick? I know what hon. Members will say: it
is a piece of ``Alastair Campbellism'', not worth even the hot
air with which it is presented. It is an insult to people who are
in a difficult and vulnerable position. We must examine that
matter.
<P>
 Chris
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury&#151;I shall say some nice
things about the Liberal Democrats again&#151;has formulated his
amendment well. We should be examining whether a work-focused
interview will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an interview to advise on employment opportunities,
benefit take up, and other issues of relevance to specific
claimant groups.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let me take the points in turn. The great issue concerning
employment opportunity is whether the people conducting the
interview will be able to add positive value to the interviewee.
<P>
I tell the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal
Opportunities, who is to sum up this debate, that for the advice
to be useful the interviewers must be professional and prepared
for the task. They must not merely be officials of the Benefits
Agency who, up to now, have been spending their time signing
cheques, handing out money and giving people wrong advice about
their entitlement to SERPS pensions. Officials should not be
told: ``You guys are on the desk tomorrow morning to conduct
work-focus interviews.'' If that were to happen, the whole
process would be utterly bogus&#151;a rather sick ``Alastair
Campbell'' joke would have been perpetrated on the public.
<P>
Interviewers should have the same tested skills and trained
competence as are available in the private sector, where people
face market disciplines if they do not provide what they should.
Therefore, will the Minister, tell us what he is doing to ensure
that skills and training are provided?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Training will be a subject for a later
amendment. Any reference to it now should be only in passing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Malins. With
your usual wisdom, however, you have chosen as the first
amendment to be debated under the clause the one that has an
overarching quality. It sets out the general principles.
Subsequent amendments are like the individual stones that make
up the cornice, the structure of which is set out in this
amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That may be true, but training will crop
up later. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will restrain himself
a little.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I appreciate your guidance Mr. Malins, but I hope
that I have made such passing glances to training as to establish
my point about its importance.
<P>
The amendment refersh to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an interview to advise employment opportunities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will that interview represent the prospect of advice being
offered in the public sector by civil servants or officials of
the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency or other aspects of
the bureaucracy, which is comparable to services available in the
private sector from employment or placement agencies? I refer to
placement agencies because they work for individuals who are
looking for jobs. Often, such individuals cannot afford their
help, but many firms retain the services of a placement agency.
<P>
When I was the director of a firm in the City, we retained
a placement agency and I was a great supporter of that approach.
Unfortunately, as businesses restructure, one has to make people
redundant from time to time. Therefore, we always made a point
of paying for the services of a placement agency to advise
individuals and minimise the psychological impact of losing a
job. It would say, ``This is an opportunity, not a disaster. What
can you do and what have you dreamed of doing that you have not
been able to do until now? How can we make this a positive turn
in your life?'' That is the right approach. It requires
considerable experience of handling people and considerable
knowledge. The agency must understand the job market, how to
approach the various sectors in which jobs are available, the
training, qualifications and skills required for different jobs
and be able to deal with human beings in a convincing and
authoritative manner.
<P>
Such work also requires the ability to market human beings.
Marketing is always difficult and business always depends on the
ability to market something. However, placement agencies have to
market human beings and that is a particularly delicate and
important task. They may enable people to achieve their
aspirations and, in a human sense, that is probably even more
important than achieving a match between the demand and supply
sides in the labour market. Its economic importance is not to be
underestimated.
<P>
Those points fall four square into the framework established
by the amendment and as you are sitting there happily, Mr.
Malins, I trust that you accept that too. We want to know how
real the Government's proposals are and what provisions have been
made to ensure the quality of the service provided.
<P>
We also want to know who will provide the service. That is
unclear from the Government's explanatory memorandum. I cannot
quote a paragraph, but the memorandum certainly states that
interviews may be conducted by the Benefits Agency, the
Employment Service, local government or another aspect of the
bureaucracy. That is not good enough. We need a dedicated cadre
of people who regard providing the service as an important
function in life&#151;it will be important if they do it
properly. They must be properly trained and committed to doing
so on a career basis. The idea of the service being pushed around
between different, competing agencies is absolutely wrong. We
want an assurance from the Minister for Employment, Welfare to
Work and Equal Opportunities on the organisational aspects of the
service, to ensure that there is no overlap, underlap or
administrative confusion and that there are clear lines of
responsibility and a clear sense of the importance of the task
being taken on. Otherwise, we shall come to the conclusion that
we are dealing again with an Alastair Campbell gimmick. We shall
respond accordingly, if there is the slightest suspicion of that
version of unpleasantness, and too much of which is going on in
this country.
<P>
The second aspect of the amendment relates to benefit
take-up. That is an important aspect of the interviews that will
be conducted. Perhpas the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I
have misunderstood his intention. Even if I have, I believe that
the phrase in his amendment should be interpreted in this way.
There has been no collusion between the Conservative party and
the Liberal Democrat party, or between myself and the hon.
Gentleman, on the amendment. My support for it is entirely
spontaneous.
<P>
I trust that what the hon. Gentleman had in mind with this
phrase was that those conducting the interview will be competent
to advise the unemployed person helpfully and definitively.
Unlike the advice given on the SERPS issue, people will be
advised correctly and in a well-informed fashion about the
benefit consequences of different options&#151;specifically, for
example, about the opportunities for family credit if a person
moves from jobseeker's allowance into work, and about housing
benefit, a massively important benefit in relation to the
taxpayer's liability and its impact on so many people's lives.
As it is important and contains scope for fraud and perversity,
it is an issue that the new Labour Government avoided altogether,
preferring to go for softer, easier options in making changes in
welfare.
<P>
I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for
Gainsborough, who I trust does not wish to disagree with me on
that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No. I wanted to refer my hon. Friend back to the
passage that he was looking for on page 75 of the explanatory
notes, where the Government say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an interview may be conducted by a person acting on behalf
of the Secretary of State (most commonly an employee of the
Benefits Agency, the Employment Service or a private/voluntary
sector organisation contracted to provide services to the
Secretary of State) or by a employee of a local authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am trying to encourage my hon. Friend to ask the Government
for further and better particulars and to ensure that there will
be adequate training, clarity of responsibility and the rest of
it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for making
that point. He has endorsed my memory of what was in the
explanatory notes. One has so much paper in front of one that one
cannot always have the reference to hand. However, my memory has
been confirmed by my hon. Friend's intervention. Clearly his eye,
like mine, was caught by that passage, with the prospect of a
proliferation of different agencies, supposedly having
responsibility for delivering the service. You know, Mr. Malins,
as someone who is much more experienced in public affairs than
I am, that once there is a proliferation of responsibilities, one
has no responsibility at all: no one is accountable for
delivering the service.
<P>
Therefore, I hope that the Minister for Employment, Welfare
to Work and Equal Opportunities has agreed with his hon. Friend
the Minister of State and, perhaps more important, that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed with the Prime Minister
and with Mr. Alastair Campbell, about how the service is being
delivered in practice and who accepts responsbility.
<P>
May I return to the second aspect, on which I was focusing?
The Minister of State thinks that I have said something funny.
I am glad that he thinks that I am amusing, but I should be
worried if he thought that the issue of providing benefit advice
was inherently funny. It is not. The benefit traps in our present
system should be of considerable concern to us all. Far too many
people assume, in many cases all too correctly, that if they go
back to work they will be worse off financially than if they
remain unemployed. Sometimes they are wrong in their
interpretation of the benefit consequences&#151;that is why the
second phrase in the hon. Gentlman's amendment is so
important&#151;but too often they are right. As we discovered
this evening, sometimes they will not know the answer by asking
the Benefits Agency because it gives wrong answers. I hope that
the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal
Opportunities is taking over responsibility for these matters and
that his officials in the Employment Service will advise us
because at least they do their homework, get their facts right
and give correct answers. We do not want any of these scandals
with my having to suggest that a copy of Hansard be delivered to
the ombudsman personally because it reveals such a disgraceful
case of the Government misinforming the public.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This matter should not divide the Committee on party lines
and on matters of principle. We are united in our wish to find
a better way of helping people back to work, and in wishing the
services that the Government deliver to the unemployed to be more
humane, sympathetic and effective. As to the rhetoric, we agree
that that can happen only if a group of people responsible for
conducting the interviews are, for the first time, properly
committed to the task, and properly trained. We wait positively,
open-minded and prepared to be persuaded&#151;but, of course,
critically, in the light of the disappointments, failures and
shortcomings of the Government that have been established as
recently as this afternoon in so many related areas&#151;that
these tasks will be properly fulfilled and the services
delivered. If we are happy about these points, we shall support
the Government; if we are not, or believe that a fuller, better
definition of the tasks is that set out by the hon. Member for
Newbury, we shall support the amendment. I am inclined in that
direction because I suspect that the secret of success is, above
all, to bring about a change of culture and of attitude, and of
the inherent values of the task being conducted in whichever
agency will be responsible for conducting these interviews when
the Government have made up their mind.
<P>
The amendment from the hon. Member for Newbury is more likely
than the original text of the Bill to bring about a change of
emphasis and of culture because it details the essential tasks.
A number of my hon. Friends and I genuinely listen with an open
mind to both the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and
Equal Opportunities, who will soon have his opportunity to
persuade the Committee, and the hon. Member for Newbury, who no
doubt will sum up.

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I shall speak very briefly. I did not want the
opportunity go go by, after 30 years in politics, to sit on the
fence on a Liberal Democrat amendment, and I want to hear from
the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal
Opportunities. I pay tribute to him because he has sat through
our deliberations. I have become used to Ministers flouncing in
and out doing their little bit, so it is nice that all three
Ministers have sat through the exchanges. All credit to them. The
Minister for Employment is a bit like the rather large lady who
appeared in the Morecambe and Wise show when the credits began
to roll, so I want to give him his moment in the sun.
<P>
The narrow point, which leads to the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford about advisers, is
this. I had a good long chat with the people who run the pilot
schemes for personal advisers, and I admit to being impressed by
the amount of time given to ensure that people who had not worked
for a long time had sufficient confidence to get back into work.
I am in favour of a single gateway. It works, because the
trainers are well trained, dedicated and probably at the top of
their profession. If we widen the training, we shall have to
ensure that it is extremely good, and that the people we choose
are extremely good. If not, it will fall like a pack of cards.
Getting people through that gateway will be a resource-driven
enterprise. Good advisers who recognise the problem identified
by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham will make a big
difference. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would
address that issue.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal</B><P>
Opportunities (Mr. Andrew Smith): I have four and a half minutes
in the sun. The outbreak of multi-partisanship has been a long
time coming, but it is no coincidence that it has greeted
discussion of the single work-focused gateway, and it is to be
welcomed. I was so taken by the speech of the hon. Member for
Gainsborough that, frankly, I could sit down and he could come
and take my place. I rest my case.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford said,
we are introducing a thoroughly Labour product, which has the
support of the Thatcherite right and upsets only the Liberal
Democrats and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. My hon.
Friend was exaggerating a little; however, we must be doing
something right.
<P>
The measure brings about a radical, overdue change in the
benefit system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and
Aylesford pointed out, it will provide a single point of entry
to the welfare system, thereby stopping people being shunted from
pillar to post and getting confused about filling in different
forms. It unifies the service and, as Opposition Members
stressed, gives work an appropriate place as the focus of the
claiming process.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury asked about the purpose of the
single work-focused gateweay. Its aims are to increase economic
activity and reduce the number of workless households, which have
become a real blight on this country, doing terrible damage to
individuals, families and the social fabric. The gateway will
help more people into work and towards greater independence,
enabling them to make more of their potential. It is appropriate
that there is a wider effort to provide support and help for
people applying for benefits. People who cannot work today or
tomorrow can look ahead to a time when they can do so.
<P>
We recognise with great sensitivity that some people are
incapable of work through incapacity or illness. As hon. Members
have stressed, knowing what training is available is a
significant part of personal advisers' work and will be critical.
We will debate that matter later, but such advice will be
provided and I assure the hon. Member for Beckenham that it will
address how best to cater for the needs of people with mental
illness. Such advice should enable those people properly to
access the benefits system, refer them to the specialist support
that they need and allow them to be accompanied when necessary.
<P>
Reference has been made to the importance of such support,
especially for vulnerable individuals. However, we should not
assume that people are written off from the prospect of having
work because they have a mental illness or disability. Personal
advisers will give advice and support, ensuring that such people
can take the best steps forward in the circumstances confronting
them.
<P>
I therefore assure the hon. Member for Newbury that treating
people as individuals is at the heart of the measure. We shall
provide help with employment opportunities and aim for accuracy
in benefit assessment and take-up. The hon. Gentleman mentioned
general advice and linking to wider support and advisory
networks. However, it is right to maintain the work focus and the
element of discipline mentioned by some Opposition Members. Such
matters should not be seen as contradictory or mutually
exclusive, as the measure aims to enable people to make the most
of their potential.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford raised
another important point about social landlords and the care
component of housing benefit. As he knows, we consulted on
supportive housing and are presently considering responses, which
will help to inform our decision on the best way to proceed. In
particular, they may show how the single work-focused gateway can
help identify those who need that support. I can therefore assure
my hon. Friend that that provision will be made. It might end up
being called the Shaw provision because of the spotlight that he
has focused on this important issue.
<P>
I am conscious that time is limited and it is difficult to
do justice to all the points raised in the debate. It augurs well
for this radical reform of the welfare system that it commands
support across the Committee. We need to mobilise that sort of
support in the wider community.
<P>
The role of personal advisers will be crucial, and
Conservative Members could usefully acknowledge the important
lessons to be learnt for this gateway from the experience of the
new deal. Whatever Conservative Members think about how the new
deal is going, its personal adviser role provisions have been
successful and greatly appreciated by the young long-term
unemployed. We intend, through the single work-focused gateway,
to extend support to many more people who would otherwise be
denied it.
<P>
Time is against me; I put it to the hon. Member for Newbury
that his amendment is unnecessary because the single work-focused
gateway will achieve his objectives, but will be the better for
remaining work-focused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> This has been an interesting debate. The
Conservative party is not entirely united on my amendment. I
assure the Committee that the Liberal Democrats here tonight are
entirely united. [Laughter.] Perhaps that goes for the Labour
party too. It is interesting to note the support that Government
Members are receiving from some Conservatives. It seems, from
what Conservative Members said about themselves and their views,
that the more right-wing and Thatcherite they are, the more
likely they are to support the Government. Labour Members should
reflect on that in deciding whether to accept the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham rightly and significantly spoke
about people with mental difficulties, particularly the
depressed. If people with a depressive illness are told that they
will be forced to attend an interview in order to get them into
work, that is likely to make their illness worse. It is
especially important for such people to believe that they are
attending an interview for their own benefit, rather than for the
Government's benefit.
<P>
Many Labour Members agreed that the single gateway process
was supposed to be about all the matters described in my
amendment and thought it absolutely right to include other
processes with the single gateway, but they wanted to stick to
the name, which unfortunately&#151;as the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford said&#151;provides an atmosphere that is
all wrong. I hope that the Government will recognise that they
are providing the wrong atmosphere for the process and that they
will agree that a better atmosphere would be created if the
amendment were accepted.
