<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 657, in page 178, line 20, leave out 'by'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 658 and 660.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> A hearty good morning to you, Mr. Gale. I am sure that we are all raring to go for another sitting of this fascinating Committee.
<P>
I shall provide a tour of the horizon on schedule 11, as it contains several important provisions including the financial arrangements and requirements that will apply to the revenue stream generated by any road user, charging or workplace parking levy scheme. It includes arrangements for the hypothecation of charging revenues and proposals for separate and published income and expenditure accounts for those moneys.
<P>
Paragraph 1 defines a relevant scheme for the purpose of schedule 11. A relevant scheme will be any road user or workplace parking charging scheme introduced by a local authority, either singly or jointly, or a trunk road user charging scheme introduced by the appropriate national authority.
<P>
Paragraph 2 defines an expense of a charging or licensing scheme for the purpose of deriving the net proceeds of a scheme from its gross proceeds. We will table some technical amendments to schedule 11 and Report to clarify the definition of net proceeds in paragraph 2. [Interruption.] Does the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) want to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Well, that is a relief. I have a note on the subject that might content the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Paragraphs 3 and 4 provide that local authorities that introduce joint charging or licensing schemes can share the net proceeds between themselves. That also applies to trunk road charging schemes that may be introduced by the appropriate national authority at the request of a local authority.
<P>
Paragraph 5 requires local authorities to set up and maintain separate accounts for the income raised from new charges and for the expenditure of that income on local transport improvements. Those accounts will be published annually and to ensure transparency and local accountability, and will help to demonstrate the additionality of charging revenues, to which we are committed.
<P>
Paragraph 6 provides that charging revenues can be used for 10 years to make good any deficits in general funds that might be incurred in setting up charging and licensing schemes.
<P>
Paragraph 7 provides that the net revenue raised from every local authority charging scheme introduced within 10 years of the commencement of the schedule will be retained locally for exclusive spending on local transport improvements. That will be the case for at least 10 years for each scheme. We recognise that the hypothecation is crucial to the public acceptability and success of any charging scheme and will lead to greater transport choice for all. The paragraph also enables the appropriate national authority to prescribe circumstances in which schemes that are varied during the first 10 years of the commencement of the schedule are to be considered as new or amended schemes. That is to determine when the period of guaranteed hypothecation for transport spending should apply for those schemes.
<P>
Paragraph 8 empowers the appropriate national authority to make regulations to set out the arrangements that will apply to the retention and use of charging revenues for local charging and licensing schemes, once the period of guaranteed hypothecation has expired.
<P>
The regulations will also cover schemes introduced within the first 10 years of the commencement of the schedule, once the scheme's guaranteed period of hypothecation has ended. They will also cover schemes brought forward after the first 10 years following the commencement of the schedule. The regulations were made following a thorough review of our policy of hypothecation.
<P>
Paragraphs 9 and 10 require local authorities to prepare plans to set out how the revenue stream from new charges will be spent. A 10-year plan will cover the initial opening period of the scheme and a more detailed plan will cover the remainder of the period of the current local transport plan. The more detailed plan will be rolled forward in successive local transport plans. The spending proposals will be approved by the appropriate national authority. The approval process will provide a safeguard to ensure that charging revenues will be spent on value-for-money transport measures that support local transport objectives.
<P>
Paragraph 11 provides that the Secretary of State shall make regulations to provide for the use of charging revenues in a joint scheme involving a charging authority outside London and a London charging authority. The Secretary of State must consult the mayor before making the regulations.
<P>
Paragraph 12 applies only to trunk road schemes. It provides that the net proceeds from trunk road charging schemes that are made at the request of a local authority and brought forward within 10 years of the commencement of the Schedule will be retained for spending on transport for 10 years for each scheme. As far as charging on trunk road bridges and tunnels of at least 600 m is concerned, the period of hypothecation will be for 10 years from whenever the scheme is introduced. That acknowledges the fact that new structures can take a significant amount of time to build. As with local authority schemes, paragraph 12 enables the appropriate national authority to prescribe circumstances in which schemes that are varied are to be regarded as new or amended schemes. It also empowers the appropriate national authority to make regulations to set out the arrangements that will apply for the retention and use of trunk road charging revenues once the period of guaranteed hypothecation has expired. The regulations will also provide for the hypothecation arrangements for trunk road charging schemes produced after the 10th anniversary of the commencement of the schedule.
<P>
I hope that that explanation has assisted the Committee. I note that hon. Members have listened to my observations with rapt attention. I have obviously inspired my beloved hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): Will my hon. Friend confirm that, under paragraph 11.3, when dealing with arrangements on London and outer London traffic authorities, the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall consult the Greater London Authority<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not specifically the mayor, as he said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is, as it were, the mayor within the Greater London Authority--rather like the sovereign in Parliament, if I might make that analogy. I was tempted to fear that we would have another example of that deadliest of all interventions, the helpful intervention. I am delighted to have been able to clarify the position for my hon. Friend.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 657, 658 and 660 make several small drafting changes to schedule 11. They each correct a minor typographical error.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for a useful and interesting overview and for promising an amendment to define net proceeds, which is important. If a scheme requires capital expenditure, through electronic means and so on, would that have to be taken in one year or could it be taken across a five or 10-year period? If a deficit built up in the scheme, the authority would borrow money and presumably pay interest from its general fund. If there was a surplus, however, and interest and balances were accruing--in the form of interest on any money accumulated--would that have to be ring-fenced within the scheme? Could an authority take the surplus on the interest on the balances and use it against its general rate fund?
<P>
When I was involved in local government, there were always debates about what could be done with surpluses on housing revenue accounts and other accounts, and about how money should be treated. Perhaps money from the scheme should remain in it, but the interest could be used differently. How do the Government feel about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Perhaps unusually on highly technical matters, I can assist the hon. Gentleman. I reassure him that we will return in due course to at least some of the issues that he raised.
<P>
The capital costs of the scheme can be defrayed during a 10-year period. Deficits that accrue from the start-up of a scheme will be paid initially out of the general fund, but we expect them to be put back into the general fund during the 10-year period.
<P>
The surplus on the interest on the balances cannot be passed over to the general fund. All the proceeds from a charging scheme are ring-fenced and they must remain within the scheme and be devoted to local transport purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I have thought of one more question. The administration costs of running any scheme are substantial. Most authorities have finance departments and computers, for example. Presumably, authorities will be able to charge for the use of their manpower and time. What controls are there to prevent a local authority from charging for everything that it can think of? It might say, "We have another 50 people in our finance department, and we want to charge fully for them." Will the Government draw up regulations to ensure that local authorities do not take advantage of their good will?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the Opposition for that recognition of the good will of Ministers. I cannot say that they always recognise our good intentions.
<P>
As for administration costs, we say yes to legitimate charges, but no to abuses of the system. I remind the hon. Gentleman that there will be guidance on that matter and that the Secretary of State will have to consider and endorse the scheme. He will want to ensure that costs are properly defrayed in its implementation. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 658, in page 178, line 34, leave out 'an authority which is'.--[Mr. Hill.]

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 659, in page 178, line 35, leave out 'council fund' and insert 'general account'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 663.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This group of amendments makes two small technical changes to schedule 11, to remove an incorrect financial term that was applied to Welsh authority accounts. "General account", rather than "council fund", is the correct terminology for Welsh authority accounts.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 660, in page 179, line 7, leave out 'or'.--[Mr. Hill.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 793, in page 179, line 32, leave out paragraph 8.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
Nos. 791, in page 181, line 8, leave out from first 'of' to end of line 9 and insert 'maintaining, repairing, restoring or improving the trunk road and subject of such charging scheme or financing, refinancing or reimbursing the cost of construction of such trunk road.'.
<P>
No. 792, in page 181, line 23, leave out sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7).
<P>
No. 720, in page 181, line 31, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'.--(1) Any charging authority may use its projected net proceeds to support any borrowings or expenditures which it deems necessary for the purpose of directly or indirectly facilitating the achievement of policies in the authority's local transport plan.
<P>
(2) In this paragraph, "projected net proceeds" are those net proceeds that a charging authority might reasonably expect to collect during the period of the early relevant scheme in paragraph 7 of this Schedule.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Syms:</B> We are moving amendment No. 793 because the Secretary of State has the power of veto over how an authority spends its money. We want to leave out paragraph 8 to obtain a slightly fuller explanation than we have had from the Minister about how the Secretary of State's powers interact with paragraph 7 of the schedule. We are not sure whether, under paragraph 8, we are giving too much discretion to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Amendment No. 720 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) is an important amendment. It is somewhat different from that moved by the hon. Member for Poole, in that it will give the Minister the opportunity to explain clearly to the Committee how he anticipates the Secretary of State's own view being put into practice. The Secretary of State's view is that road-user charging and workplace levies are likely to be successful only if high quality, adequate, alternative public transport is in place at the time of their introduction. There is a real question as to how local authorities will fund improvements to public transport before they obtain receipts from the two measures that we have already discussed. It is important that the Minister explains clearly how local authorities will be given the opportunity to raise such funds. In anticipation of the Minister not giving us something on the record as to how that is to be done, we move this amendment, but I am sure that the Minister will tell us a better way of doing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Perhaps I can deal immediately with the issue raised by the hon. Member for Poole. He asked whether the word "interaction", used in paragraphs 7 and 8, gave too much discretion to the Secretary of State. He will perhaps not be surprised to learn that the answer to that is no. The schedule is, after all, about the review of hypothecation after 10 years. It is as simple as that. Having said that, however, the purport of the amendment is rather more wide ranging than the question that he asked. Since they are on the amendment paper, I suppose that I ought to respond to them before I go on to the important points raised by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster).
<P>
I am afraid that I remain wholly unconvinced by the underlying purpose of the amendments tabled by the official Opposition. Amendment No. 793 would result in the indefinite hypothecation of the revenues raised from local authority road user and workplace parking charges for transport spending. Similarly, amendment No. 792 would result in the indefinite hypothecation of trunk road charging revenues, with amendment No. 791 requiring the revenues raised from trunk road charging schemes to be spent exclusively on the trunk road where the charge was levied.
<P>
It is a trifle rich on the part of the Opposition to press for the indefinite hypothecation of the revenues from charges that they claim to oppose in principle. I do not want to get too aggressive about this as it is early in the morning and I am sure we feel a little fragile, but honesty itself, to which the Government are dedicated, requires that I at least draw attention to that inconsistency in the Opposition's position. The inconsistency in the Opposition's position is highlighted by the fact that their 1996 Green Paper, to which we have referred, contained a presumption in favour of giving local authorities new charging powers, but gave no guarantee that the revenues would be hypothecated for local transport improvements. That is the ground-breaking aspect of the Bill.
<P>
The arrangements that we included in the Greater London Authority Act 1999, and which we have extended to the Bill by guaranteeing hypothecation, represent a major breakthrough. Unlike the previous Conservative Government, we recognise that that is crucial to the success and acceptability of any such scheme. The Bill therefore provides that every penny of the net revenues raised from local authority charging or licensing schemes introduced within 10 years of the schedule's commencement will be retained locally and ring-fenced for transport spending for each scheme's initial period. The expectation is that the initial period will be 10 years, beginning from the implementation of a scheme. However, paragraph 7(6) of schedule 11 enables the appropriate national authority to guarantee the hypothecation of charging revenues for more than 10 years for individual schemes. We have debated this point to a limited extent, but it might interest the hon. Member for Bath to know that that flexibility could be particularly valuable if a local authority wanted to undertake a private finance initiative deal, and the private sector required a guarantee that a revenue stream would be available for more than 10 years.
<P>
We propose that the revenue from trunk road charging schemes that are introduced at the request of the local authority, and which are introduced within 10 years of the schedule's commencement, will be ring-fenced for transport spending for 10 years. For charging schemes on trunk road tunnels and bridges of at least 600m in length, the period of hypothecation will be 10 years. For all schemes, the Bill provides that the arrangements for the retention and use of charging revenues will be reviewed after 10 years. It would be irresponsible to guarantee hypothecation for transport spending indefinitely, because spending charging revenues on transport in perpetuity might not deliver value-for-money improvements in the medium to longer term. That is why it is appropriate to have a review after 10 years.
<P>
The review may recommend that 100 per cent. hypothecation of charging revenues for transport spending should continue for all schemes for a further period. I am sure that many hon. Members think that hypothecation will be needed for more than 10 years to make up for the inadequate amounts spent on our transport infrastructure under the previous Administration. I can assure them that the Bill explicitly allows for hypothecation for transport spending to continue after the review, although, clearly, I cannot pre-empt the outcome of such a review.
<P>
In addition, amendment No. 791 would limit the use to which trunk road charging revenues can be put. It says that any amount raised from a trunk road charging scheme can be spent only on the charged trunk road in question. That suggests that the hon. Gentlemen would prefer the proceeds from such charging schemes to be spent on gold plating trunk roads, bridges and tunnels rather than--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Golf courses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Gold plating, not golf courses. I make that clear, in case any confusion arises from my hon. Friend's comment. Such gold plating of specific parts of our motorway and trunk road network would be frivolous and shortsighted.
<P>
The proceeds from trunk road charging should be used to further integrated transport objectives. That may include maintaining or improving the trunk road network rather than simply the charged road in question. However, we do not want to rule out the possibility of spending revenues from trunk road charging schemes on improvements to public transport by imposing such a restriction in the Bill.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Bath and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale would allow for borrowing on the strength of future charging revenues as a means of funding up front improvements to local transport. I agree that we can expect a charging scheme to need to be accompanied by some improvements to local transport before the scheme starts operating. That is known as early evidence. For example, it will be necessary to accomodate commuters who switch from cars to public transport. The Government do not envisage approving any charging scheme unless some improvements to local transport have been made before it becomes operational.
<P>
As the Committee will know, we are providing £755 million in 2000-01 to help local authorities implement their local transport plans. That is set to rise to more than £1 billion in 2001-02. That increase will make a difference to improving transport choice for all and help to provide motorists with a genuine alternative to the private car. We have also pledged that any real increases in fuel duty will be ring-fenced for transport spending. We await my Right hon. Friend the Chancellor's pronouncements on the matter next week with bated breath.
<P>
We are making additional funding available to local authorities that actively consider a road user or workplace parking charging scheme as part of our charging development partnership. An extra £18 million was made available at the end of 1999, and partnership authorities will obviously be well placed to receive additional support.
<P>
I recognise that allowing borrowing on the strength of future charging revenues may seem an attractive means of funding even more up front improvements to local transport, but local authorities already have powers to borrow for capital spending purposes such as transport improvements. Under present rules, the amount of such borrowing depends on credit approval issued by the Government. Those rules are an essential part of the mechanism for regulating public expenditure in the interests of the national economy. That local borrowing has to be counted against the public sector borrowing requirement.
<P>
We are, however, currently reviewing the local government capital finance system. In particular, we are considering the possibility of allowing a local authority's leval of borrowing to be determined mainly by its affordability to the authority, taking account of the authority's overall financial position. We intend to issue a Green Paper on our proposals in the summer. To accept amendment No. 720 now would pre-empt the outcome of this consultation. That would not be wise, as I am sure that the hon. Member for Bath would agree.
<P>
Where a charging scheme could yield significant revenues, it would be worth exploring the scope of a deal or some other form of partnership with the private sector to fund up front private finance initative transport improvements. Paragraph 7(6) of schedule 11, which allow the appropriate national authority to guarantee more than 10 years of hypothecation for transport spending for individual schemes, makes that an exciting possibility. Such options can already be pursued under existing rules, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions in the Bill are sufficient to allow local authorities to make private finance initiative deals to fund transport improvements. No further provisions will be needed.
<P>
Having explained in some detail why I cannot accept the amendments, I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will withdraw amendment No. 793.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for outlining the Government's thinking on the issue. I was aware that a review of the borrowing arrangements for local authorities was intended, but it is good to hear it again. When the review takes place, I hope that consideration will be given to how quickly legislation on a proposed change can be brought in. Until the Government clearly suggest their intended changes local councils will not have much confidence in introducing proposals on road user charging and workplace levies.
<P>
It came as no surprise to hear the Minister saying that PFI is an option. He will know that there is a cap on PFI of around £800 million, and that that option will therefore not be available for the many schemes that both 1067 1068 he and I want throughout the country. Funding through that route is problematic. The Minister's officials are considering several imaginative options--even the concept of "securitisation" has been mooted, involving a futures-market style of sale whereby someone in the private sector would buy--
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Buy Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, we do not want to buy Bath. I shall be careful and not say what I think.
<P>
There are several imaginative ways forward. I hope that the Minister will also accept that a key barrier is the current definition of the public sector borrowing requirement. I hope therefore that the review--which would be more appropriate if it took a different form--will consider the possible changes, including the PSBR.
<P>
Until the Government produce a workable system in which local authorities have confidence, some of the measures that the Minister and I would like will be obstructed. The review needs to get under way and proposals need to be introduced as a matter of urgency. I regret that that work did not take place earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his explanation. During the passage of the Greater London Authority Bill that matter was debated. The Opposition tabled amendments to make the hypothecation period 30 years and the Government eventually compromised with 10 years, which is why we have that period in this Bill. If we are to set up a scheme that charges and taxes people for a specific purpose, we should be concerned about the possibility that, after 10 years, those funds could be used for other purposes, whether chosen by the authority or the Government.
<P>
We have not had an explanation for that period of 10 years. Why not 12 years or eight years? If we are not careful, it will become another stealth tax. The Minister again referred to the transport grant of £754 million, but only £l3.5 million of that was real grant; the rest constituted borrowing powers. The Government have substantially reduced the grant while increasing authorities' ability to borrow. There is concern about the issue. As the Minister said, our amendments would break the link between money being raised for a specific purpose and that money being spent for the purposes set out in the Bill. I do not think that we will make much progress on the matter; we have a difference of view. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We tabled the amendments principally to make it clear that when authorities start to collect such moneys, the Secretary of State should disregard that in their awarding of grant or other moneys to those authorities. The reason is simple We suspect that if a local authority decides to implement the charges, the Government may react by reducing its grant in other areas, on the ground that it will receive hundreds of thousands of pounds from the scheme. That must be additional and hypothecated money. There is concern about that. Car parking charging has two slightly different regimes. The money that comes from machines in central London is ring-fenced for transport means, but some of the funds from off-street parking are taken into account in the standard spending assessment. We do not want the Government to change the SSA calculations because that would disadvantage local authorities that participate in the scheme by reducing their money in other ways. We want a guarantee from the Minister that that will not be Government policy and that the money will be additional. To some extent, the Government should be blind to what local authorities do in relation to transport grant and the SSA. Those are our main concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I echo to some extent the comments of the hon. Member for Poole. Our amendment attempts to get to the heart of the same issue and to ensure that the resources that are to be raised under the schemes will be additional finance. We realise that the revenue support grant arrangements are being reviewed. The review is important and this is an important time for the Government to make it clear that they intend the resources to be additional and for them to be explicit about how they will ensure that that is so. A related matter is the question of the baselines from which the funding will be additional and the necessity of ensuring that there is a proper assessment of the need around the country for transport funding, infrastructure improvements and so on when the cash from the schemes is divvied out. I expect that, if the the Minister does not accept our amendment, he will at least give us assurances that serious consideration is being given to formalising the way in which the resources will be guaranteed to be additional.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Poole and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale for raising the important matter of the additionality of revenues that will be raised through new charges. I have listened carefully to the reasoned points that both hon. Gentlemans made and I assure them that we are at one on the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It says here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Member for Bath says "It says here," as if I were merely going through the motions of expressing agreement with the principles enunciated by Opposition Members. The truth is that we are in heartfelt agreement with the sentiments and intentions that they have expressed, even though I fear that in due course, when I have given an explanation, I shall be unable to accept the amendment.
<P>
I agree that the revenues from new charges must be additional to other forms of local government funding and that this must be clear for all to see. We realise that that will be crucial to the success and public acceptability of any charging scheme. For the record, I repeat the Government's promise once more. I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will accept it as the guarantee that he seeks and that the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale will accept it as the assurance that he asked for. The net proceeds from charging schemes will be additional moneys for improving local transport.
<P>
Schedule 11(5) was drafted with the issue of additionality in mind. It will require charging and licensing authorities to establish separate accounts for the income from new charges and for the expenditure of this revenue on local transport improvements. The accounts must be published annually. That will guarantee transparency by making it clear to local people and business how much money is being raised through charging, and how it is being spent. That will help to demonstrate that revenues raised by new charges are additional to local authorities' revenue support grant and other grants paid by central Government to local government.
<P>
In principle, we agree with the amendments. However, I regret that I cannot accept any of them because they would be unworkable. As Committee members know, many factors are taken into account when calculating a local authority's funding from central Government, so in practice it would be difficult to prove what the decisive factors were. It would be hard to prove that the Secretary of State had not disregarded the value of the net proceeds of a charging scheme when setting a local authority's grant from central Government.
<P>
Accepting the amendments could therefore leave the determination of a local authority's revenue support grant or any other grant open to judicial challenge. I am sure that hon. Members agree that that is in no one's interest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): I am extremely grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way. His wonderful new haircut--a Portillo quiff--has clearly helped his reasonableness.
<P>
The Under-Secretary made a case for not including in the Bill a requirement to disregard the income received from charging schemes. However, the matter could also work the other way. As the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale suggested, a Secretary of State's refusal to give a transport grant might be subject to a judicial challenge, on the grounds that the authority is doing pretty well out of its charging scheme. That would apply if the amendment was rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I resent the hon. Gentleman stealing my joke about the name that I gave to a rather dramatic hairstyle change that I revealed to the House yesterday. I told the hon. Gentleman then that it was a Portillo, with one wave being called Miguel and the other Xavier. However, I am sure that Committee members have heard enough about my hairstyle and I do not want to risk your famous irascibility, Mr. Gale, by pursuing that line any further.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the Government could be open to challenge for refusing to give a grant for local transport purposes on the grounds that the local authority was already doing well out of its charging scheme. That is contrary to the Bill's purpose. Indeed, I have given the Committee powerful reassurances that the Government are determined that proceeds from charging regimes of whatever nature should be additional. They will appear in a separate account that is published annually to achieve transparency in relation to the size of revenues derived from charging regime and how those revenues are spent.
<P>
As I have tried to explain, I am sympathetic to additionality. However, we have received clear legal advice that the Government would be subject to judicial review if we accepted the amendments. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to expose this Government or a future Government of a different complexion--in the unlikely event that one will be elected in the foreseeable future--to such risk. It is for the most honourable purposes and on the basis of serious legal advice that we stand firm against the amendments.
<P>
As I have said repeatedly, however, we are committed to the additionality of charging revenues. The Government hope and expect to secure a high, sustained level of support for local transport investment, in addition to what accrues from charging regimes. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the amendments and I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will agree to withdraw them.
<P>
9.45 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his assurance. An authority that is thinking of providing congestion or workplace parking charging will put it into its local transport plan, which is one of the means by which the Government will determine the level of support that an authority will receive. As the Bill is drafted, I am not sure how to disentangle that. We tabled our amendments to make it explicit in the Bill that the Secretary of State should disregard the matter.
<P>
A more subtle worry is that an authority that may have no great wish to implement congestion charging or workplace parking charges because of local circumstances may be put under pressure by the Government, when they complain about their poor grant settlement. The Government will turn round and say, "Of course, we have given you the power to charge for car parking and congestion and you have chosen not to do so. It's your own fault that you have a rotten grant settlement." It causes Opposition Members more concern than anything else, that, having given local authorities the power to raise money, the Government may use it as an excuse not to support them to the level that it is their responsibility to provide. Having obtained the Minister' assurance on the record, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As I understand it, clause 168 allows a charging or licensing authority to spend money in operating a charging licence scheme and to enter into contracts with parties. In the operation of a scheme, people will be allowed to enter other people's premises, for example, when a company which is licensed for so many parking places, may be exceeding that number.
<P>
Will the Minister give an assurance that care will be taken in such matters? As the Bill is drafted, individuals who work for a private company that is operating a scheme under contract could maraud across the countryside and enter any premises in a given locality. If a private company operates a scheme and has to enter a company's private premises, will it do so with an employee of the local authority or on its own? I am wary of over-zealous activity that gives powers to private companies to enter the premises of other private companies. When a local authority is involved, it has to balance protection with operations. Local companies might find it more acceptable if they could complain to their councillors. As we know, excessive behaviour on the part of companies with contracts for clamping undermines public confidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising privacy and the right of third parties to enter another's premises, to which I shall return in due course. The clauses relate to the rights of entry and to civil liberties. It may be helpful to the Committee if I take advantage of your wise stewardship, Mr. Gale, and give an overview of the clauses before coming to the matter raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Chapter III of part III of the Bill contains a number of general and supplementary provisions that are common to both the road user charging and the workplace parking levy provisions that we have already debated in some detail.
<P>
Clauses 168 to 175 deal with a number of issues, including supplementary powers for charging and licensing authorities, the disclosure of information in the operation of a scheme, arrangements for dealing with disputes and appeals, Crown application, the definitions used in part III and the issuing of guidance by the appropriate national authority.
<P>
I shall go through each clause in detail. Clause 168 relates to both road user charging and workplace parking levy schemes. It allows an authority to incur expenditure in relation to making or operating a scheme, or to enter into arrangements with any person in respect of a charging or licensing scheme. That provides the freedom to enter into contracts with the private sector, or others, for example in public-private partnership projects, when that will provide the authority the best value in operating a scheme.
<P>
Clause 169 contains general powers for the Secretary of State, for England, and the National Assembly for Wales, to issue guidance to local authorities on how to exercise their powers to introduce road user charging or workplace parking levy schemes. The Greater London Authority must be consulted on any guidance that relates to Joint schemes involving a London charging or licensing authority.
<P>
As the Committee is aware, we are working closely with the first authorities interested in developing schemes through our charging development partnership. There will be lessons to be learnt and best practice to pass on to other authorities. It may therefore be appropriate to issue detailed guidance when schemes are up and running.
<P>
Clause 170 allows the disclosure, of information by public bodies to a charging or licensing authority. That is essential to allow, for example, information about who is the registered keeper of a particular vehicle to be divulged by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency for the purpose of liability for road user charges and the imposing of any penalty charges.
<P>
We also expect that an authority introducing a workplace parking levy scheme will want to use information that it already has on non-domestic ratepayers, for example, as a starting point for liability for the levy. The clause also allows such information to be passed to agents of the authority as part of the operation of any scheme.
<P>
Clause 171 gives the Government the power to make regulations about appeals, disputes, and evidence in relation to charging schemes and the workplace parking levy. These regulations will provide the detailed framework for a common administration of Justice in England and Wales and ensure that people are treated equally between those jurisdictions.
<P>
Clause 172 deals with the application of new charges to Crown roads, vehicles and property. Crown roads can be included in a road user charging scheme in the same way as other roads in a charging authority's area. The Crown will not be criminally liable for any contravention, although the courts may declare its acts unlawful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be patient, as I am about to deal with an issue of interest to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I seek to intervene only because I am not sure what a Crown road is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am glad to explain that phrase to the hon. Gentleman. A Crown road is, for example, a road in a royal park. In other words, the Mall is a Crown road because it is in a royal park. Almost certainly, any road user charging regime that applied to central London would include the Mall, hence the need for the Bill. Roads in Windsor great park are also Crown roads, although I am not sure whether anybody expects a charging scheme to be introduced in that geographical context. Ministry of Defence roads are Crown roads as well. That will interest the hon. Gentleman, and I will deal with that issue in more detail in a moment.
<P>
As I said, the Crown will not be criminally liable for any contravention, although the courts may declare its acts unlawful. In addition, there will be no right of entry to Crown vehicles or Crown premises. As I am sure the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) agrees, a right of entry would be unacceptable for some vehicles and premises the security of which must be maintained in the national interest, such as MOD establishments. Under the clause, it will not be possible for the representatives of a charging regime to enter royal palaces, although I have observed that there is extensive parking in the grounds of Buckingham palace, and the Government are convinced that Her Majesty would want to co-operate as much as possible with any charging regime.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire) rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Wisely or unwisely, I have obviously tempted the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Strangely enough, I have been planning to do so for some time. I alerted officials on Tuesday about my interest in the issue. Buckingham palace will be subject, as this Palace is, to parking charges. How many of the parking slots at Buckingham palace will be attributable to workplace parking and how many will be attributable to the person of Her Majesty? Clause 172(5) says that that clause will not apply to the person of Her Majesty. How many slots at Buckingham palace will be subject to a charge and how many will be exempt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I wish that I could answer the hon. Gentleman's question in detail. Unfortunately, I cannot at the moment although, as ever, inspiration may flow in due course. If I can answer the hon. Gentleman's perfectly reasonable question, I shall endeavour to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire mentioned the Palace of Westminster. It is a matter of public speculation whether we will all be charged for the underground car parking arrangements here. Can the Minister enlighten us? I think that everyone here has an interest, save the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), who has a whole bus fleet to provide for his transport arrangements. The rest of us merely have motor cars--of course, the Secretary of State has two jags. Can the Minister tell us whether the charges will apply to us?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I think that I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999, Members of Parliament and others in the Palace of Westminster would be liable for charges, in the event of implementation of a charging regime in the locality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Surely that is not correct. Members of Parliament would not be liable. Under the law, it is not entirely clear who a Member of Parliament's employer is. Surely the employer, whether it is the Palace or the Government, would be liable, rather than the Member himself. How many slots are there in the Palace and, using the figure of £3,000 per slot, what would the total bill to the employer be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I certainly do not want to get into a detailed debate about who our employer is. My general impression was that we were deemed, for tax purposes, to be self-employed.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Perhaps I can assist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I have obviously got that wrong. It might help the Committee if my hon. Friend offers us some direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> My understanding is that we are not self-employed. We needed to be at one time, but not now. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire raises an interesting question about who is responsible for us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This demonstrates why I am never likely to become a Treasury Minister, not that I have that aspiration. I am perfectly satisfied with what I have got.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire asked how many parking places there were at Westminster. The House authorities have given a figure of 636 spaces at the 1075 1076 Commons: 326 for hon. Members and, 310 for other users including visitors and disabled people. They were unable to give a figure for parking in the Lords. The mayor will decide whether to introduce a workplace parking levy scheme in London and what its level should when drawing up his or her transport strategy. Parking arrangements are a matter for the House authorities and it would be for them to decide how to respond. As for Buckingham palace, inspiration has winged its way to me and I am apparently unable to supply the hon. Gentleman with the information he sought. It is an interesting question and perhaps we can elicit that information in various ways.
<P>
Clause 173 is a technical clause. It provides that regulations may be made by statutory instrument for regulations affecting England and England and Wales jointly. All such regulations will be subject to negative procedures in either House with two important exceptions. The first relates to clause 158, concerning changes to the definition of workplace parking. The second covers those paragraphs of schedule 11 that relate to financial regulations dealing with the hypothecation of revenues. Once the guaranteed period of hypothecation has expired, they will be subject to the affirmative resolution of the House.
<P>
Clause 174 provides definitions of words and phrases used in this part of the Bill. It also provides the appropriate national authority with the power to define the classifications of vehicles under all schemes. That means that there will be a standard system of classifying vehicles, whether through weight, engine size and so on. That will aid interoperability of equipment and help drivers to determine what charges they will pay. Clause 175 introduces schedule 12 of the Bill. Schedule 12 contains amendments to schedules 23 and 24 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 as a result of the provisions of this part. I hope that that overview has been helpful.
<P>
On the important issue of contractors, having the power to enter the premises, land, or indeed vehicles of other private companies, in principle, that could happen with the agreement of the local authority, but the hon. Member for Poole has raised an important point. We will think about giving guidance to meet his reasonable concerns. I am grateful to him for raising those matters. We will seek to be as responsible as we can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for that helpful overview. He mentioned obtaining information from the DVLA. I do not know who has access to the DVLA, apart from police authorities, but I presume that local authorities or some clamping companies may have access to it. I am concerned that a private company in a particular area might obtain information on any vehicle, its registered keeper and his or her address, because someone might see a woman driving around in a car, think that she is attractive and phone the DVLA to find out where she lives. Will guidance be given on such matters? To return to my original question, will those entering premises be local authority employees acting in an enforcement role or employees of private companies? My main concern is that the information accumulated could be misused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises two matters. In principle, those who enter premises could be either local authority employees or those of the contracting party. The Government have tabled amendments to clause 170 and schedule 12, with which we are about to deal, that may reassure him about the disclosure of information, which is an important civil liberties issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I am not sure whether it is appropriate for me to pursue the line that I pursued on the probing amendments a few moments ago. However, the Under-Secretary's speech appeared to have some of the characteristics of a composite, in that he referred to several clauses because he thought that chapter III was general, relating both to workplace and congestion charging, so may I pursue an issue that involves Members of Parliament?
<P>
A general principle needs to be elucidated. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East suggested that we are not self-employed. I do not know what the Under-Secretary puts on forms when asked to state who is his employer, but when I am invited to do so, I always write "the electors of Aldershot". I regard them as my employers. However, having returned to the House as a retread in 1997, I have found a significant difference: in 1992, I felt that I was an honourable Member of Parliament, but when I returned in 1997, 1 felt that I was an employee of the House of Commons, which I resent. We have allowed ourselves to be put in that position. If we as Members will be liable to pay the costs of workplace charging, the Under-Secretary should prepare to receive about 658 letters.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman places me in some difficulty. Clearly, the matter is of personal and public interest, but it was properly dealt with during the consideration of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and is not directly relevant to the clause. If the Under-Secretary wishes to make a statement on the issue, I am willing to allow him to do so, within reason. If he wants the issue to be clarified, I am sure that an appropriate place can be found for him to make a statement. However, I am not entirely happy that the Committee should go too far down that path in this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am extremely grateful to you, Mr Gale, for that guidance, because this is clearly difficult procedural territory. I wanted to point out that if we are not individually liable, the House authorities--the Fees Office, for example--would be responsible for paying such charges and there would be no disincentive to right hon. and hon. Members to bring their cars here under the workplace provisions. If it applies to us, it will apply to many other companies--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, I am seeking a way through a matter of considerable public interest. I would not wish to put words in the mouth of Madam Speaker, but I suspect that she should expect hon. Members to use the resources made available through the public purse conscientiously and responsibly--all hon. Members are always expected to do so--and that includes office space and other matters. I rule that we must leave this matter for the moment, although I accept that the Committee and indeed the House of Commons may wish to return to it at a more appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am under no illusions. I was not suggesting that right hon. or hon. Members would act improperly. That was not my point. I was arguing about the lack of incentive to use other forms of travel, but I shall not pursue that, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Let me return to clause 168 and ask the Under-Secretary precisely who will have the power to enter premises--I leave aside the question of military land, as it is covered in clause 172. As I said on Tuesday, I have great reservations about the clause and the Under-Secretary has not satisfied us that the safeguards are sufficient. What he said is logical. The licensing authority will be able to enter arrangements with private sector contractors, who will then have the power and responsibility to enter private premises. It could be argued that private contractors already operate wheel clamping, sometimes imposing draconian sanctions on people, although there is a difference between placing a wheel clamp on a vehicle and physically entering private property. I shall want to revisit the subject on Report.
<P>
It would reflect well on the Under-Secretary, particularly with his new hirsute appearance, if he acknowledged the widespread concern outside this place about the readiness with which Parliament is prepared to give people power to enter private property. His hon. Friend, the Minister for Housing or Planning did not do so on Tuesday. As I said, I intend to raise the matter again on Report.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) Information disclosed to a person under subsection (3)--
<P>
(a) may be disclosed to any other person for or in connection with the charging scheme or licensing scheme, but
<P>
(b) may not be used (by him or any other person to whom it is disclosed under paragraph (a)) otherwise than for or in connection with the charging scheme or licensing scheme.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following Government amendments: No. 687 and No. 699
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Clause 170 deals with arrangements for the disclosure of information in connection with the making or operation of a charging or licensing scheme. The Committee will be aware that information will need to be disclosed by public bodies to provide for the efficient and effective operation of a road user charging or workplace parking levy scheme. For example, a charging authority will need to be able to obtain information from the DVLA about the registered keeper of a vehicle where a road user charge has not been paid.
<P>
As drafted, subsection 3 of clause 170 provides that information can be disclosed to third parties that are involved in a charging or licensing scheme. However, at present there is no safeguard to ensure that the data that is disclosed as part of the charging or licensing scheme cannot be used for purposes that are not related to that scheme. Amendment No. 669 provides this important safeguard. Amendments Nos. 687 and 699 provide that the same safeguards covering the disclosure of information used in a charging or licensing scheme outside London will apply in London as well.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 670, in, page 95, line 40, leave out 'Secretary of State' and insert 'Lord Chancellor'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following Government amendments: Nos. 671, 674, 678, 679, 683, 684, 688 to 691, 695 and 696.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This large group of Government amendments serves a simple purpose. Amendments Nos. 670 and 671 provide that the Lord Chancellor's Department rather than the appropriate national authority will be responsible for making regulations in the legal matters that arise in the enforcement of road user and workplace parking charging schemes outside London. These regulations will include arrangements for the appeals and adjudication process and issues about what is admissible as evidence for the non-payment of a charge. Regulations covering policy aspects of the enforcement of road user and workplace parking charging schemes, such as the arrangements for imposing penalty charges, will continue to be the responsibility of the appropriate national authority.
<P>
The amendments will ensure that the Lord Chancellor's Department continues to be responsible for regulations that deal with legal aspects of road user and workplace parking charging schemes. This will ensure consistency in the legal process throughout England and Wales.
<P>
That consistency also needs to extend to charging and licensing schemes that might be introduced in London. Amendments Nos. 683, 684, 695 and 696 to schedule 12 therefore amend the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to provide for this. Amendments Nos. 679 and 691 are consequential drafting amendments to provide that the Secretary of State will make regulations for London except where the regulations are to be made by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
In addition, amendment No. 674 is a consequential amendment to provide that regulations covering the legal aspects of enforcing charging and licensing schemes that are made by the Lord Chancellor rather than the Secretary of State will be subject to the negative resolution procedure of either House of Parliament.
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 678, 688, 689 and 690 correct a small number of minor drafting errors that have crept into the current draft of schedule 12 of the Bill. They ensure that the references to the 199 Act are indeed the correct references. The amendments therefore improve the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> It may be appropriate to raise my concerns now rather at clause stand part. I recognise the argument advanced that the appropriate Minister in this case is not the Secretary of State but the Lord Chancellor. Will the Minister elucidate for the Committee the Government's ideas for procedures in determining the regulations? Is it proposed that separate tribunals should be stablished? Clause 171(l)(d)--at the top of page 96--talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the appointment of persons to hear any such appeals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will these be lawyers or motoring experts? Who does the Minister have in mind? What consideration has the Government given to the operation of the appeals procedure? In determining the regulations, are separate tribunals to be established" Subsection (1)(d) states that the Secretary of State may make provision for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the appointment of persons to hear any such appeals.
<P>
Will those persons be lawyers, or motoring experts? Who does the Minister have in mind? What consideration have the Government given to the operation of the appeals procedure? As we discussed in the previous sitting, the proposal will create enormous scope for appeals on the basis of exemptions--for example, getting down to the minutiae, on matters such as whether  a car parking space outside the offices of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service is for an employee or for someone using her own car to deliver meals to an old-age pensioner. Such thorny issues will be the subject of many appeals against the measures lodged by large and small organisations. The cost of the appeals procedure, which is foreshadowed in the clause, has the potential to be substantial and will be deductible from the income derived from the car parking and congestion charging, especially the workplace parking schemes.
<P>
 I want the Under-Secretary to share his thoughts--I suspect that they are being formulated in his mind at this moment--and those of his colleagues about the number of disputes that will arise. They will, of course, vary throughout the country and according to the nature of the scheme imposed by the licensing authority. However, there is enormous scope for a substantial bureaucratic operation that will carry a large price tag.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hill:</B> It may surprise the hon. Gentleman that I welcome the questions that he and his hon. Friends asked at our previous sitting about the application and about who would be designated, for example, as a business customer or a regular shopper. The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) asked whether such decisions would be based on the appearance of the shopper. National and local considerations must be taken into account in answering such questions, which are part of the value of what I call the "what-iffery" of the Committee process. I do not discount such debates, but in broad terms, I give the hon. Member for Aldershot the assurance that although there are extensive details to be resolved in connection with drawing up and implementing charging schemes, work is already being done on the schemes' practicalities.
<P>
The Government have established the charging development partnership, which brings together 25 authorities that expressed an interest in charging schemes. The hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that two of those authorities--Hampshire and Cambridgeshire--are Conservative; we are delighted that they are discussing with Ministers and officials the problems involved in implementing the proposals. There will be wide and lengthy deliberations at national level about best practice and the most appropriate charging regimes. In considering their approach to the authorisation of the schemes, the Government will want evidence of the most extensive consultation by local authorities with the public, and especially with local businesses. Many of the potential traps mentioned by the hon. Member for Aldershot and his hon. Friends have been anticipated and will be ironed out before the proposals are implemented. That will reduce the number of cases that are likely to come before the courts and thus the costs of those procedures. There will be a long and detailed process, designed to resolve many of the problems to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aldershot also asked about appeals procedures and about who would hear such appeals. In appeals against penalties in respect of road user charges, the adjudication will be exactly as it is in the present system of parking penalties. Appeals against penalty charges in respect of workplace parking levies will be dealt with by the civil courts. I hope that those answers help the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Minister's reply, for which I am grateful, gives us some enlightenment, but I suspect that he cannot give us an enormous amount. Parking ticket disputes ultimately end up in the magistrates courts, but there are few of them. I won such a case once, but it is not something that one readily undertakes. Businesses may find it worthwhile to dispute a levy or a tax on the provision of parking spaces for their employees and will go to court.
<P>
I do not want to pursue the argument; there is tremendous potential for disputes, bureaucracy, and cost, which, in fairness to the Minister, he acknowledged. He is working with several authorities to try to find a way forward before any scheme is introduced. I was interested to note that Hampshire county council is one of those authorities and I shall discuss with the leader of the council how discussions with the Department are going. I flag up the potential for substantial cost, a lot of aggro and many time-consuming appeals.
<P>
The Minister did not answer my question about who would be appointed to hear appeals under subsection (1)(d); can he tell me what is envisaged? Presumably, there will be appeals bodies on workplace parking levies, such as the Hampshire, Rushmoor or Streatham workplace parking levy appeal committees. Have I misunderstood the Under-Secretary?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, it is my fault. Obviously, my powers of communication are failing as the morning wears on. I repeat my earlier explanation. For road user charges, the adjudication in appeals against penalty charges will be as for decriminalised parking now. In other words, the appeal will go to the adjudicator. Appeals on workplace parking levies will go to the civil courts. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
10.30 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The scenario that I have in mind is, say, that of a small florist's shop run by a lady who employs two or three people who work part time. She will have one parking space. The licensing authority may decide that she has two parking spaces and tell her that she must pay double the levy. A dispute arises and a material sum could be charged to a small business. To whom will that lady appeal if she disagrees with the licensing authority's assessment of the number of parking spaces at her place of business that are reserved for employees and, therefore, subject to the levy, and the number that are available to customers, and are not subject to it? Such a case would not go to the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government are considering a threshold for the number of parking spaces to which schemes will apply. This may help the thousands of florists in the country who will be following our deliberations carefully. The threshold may therefore exclude the florist with one parking space whom the hon. Gentleman has in mind. If the florist refuses to pay the penalty, the procedure is straightward: the council will take her to court.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or any premises held or used by or on behalf of the Crown.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government attach great importance to the fact that clause 172 provides that the Crown will be included in the scope of road user and workplace charging schemes. However, the Committee will be aware that granting rights of entry to Crown vehicles and Crown property as part of the enforcement process for a charging or licensing scheme could have security implications, which cannot be ignored.
<P>
The clause as drafted provides that enforcement agents will not be empowered to enter Crown vehicles as part of the enforcement process for a road user charging scheme. Amendment No. 672 provides for enforcement agents not to have powers to enter Crown buildings such as those occupied by Departments of State and the military to check compliance with the workplace parking levy. The Government will, of course, ensure that appropriate workplace parking licence to cover their workplace parking needs in areas where new charges are introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says about the security aspects. However, the Bill gives a right to go into private property and there is one rule for private individuals and another for the Government. It reminds me of the time that the British landed and captured Washington in the 1812 war. They burnt the White House and buildings that were the property of the United States Government but would not burn private property because they felt that that would not be entirely fair. I note how times have changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important contribution to the debate with his distinction between the importance of the private and public sectors. I hope that the Minister will regard the amendment as the Aldershot amendment to ensure that prying officials do not try to enter Challenger 2 tanks in my constituency to enforce workplace parking levies and the like. The Minister was right to introduce the amendment, which makes the position clear. It would be nonsensical, if not downright dangerous, for agents of the licensing authority to be able to enter military vehicles or property. On behalf of Aldershot and other garrison towns I welcome the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() Regulations under paragraph 8(1) or 12(2) or (5) of Schedule 11 shall not be made without the consent of the Treasury.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In an earlier sitting, we debated amendments relating to the Government's policy on devolution. I draw the Committee's attention to amendments Nos. 661, 664 and 665, which were agreed previously. They amend schedule 11 to provide that the appropriate national authority rather than the Secretary of State should be responsible for making regulations governing the way in which the proceeds of charging schemes will be spent when the 10-year period of guaranteed hypothecation of the revenues for transport spending has ended. Government amendment No. 673 would ensure that the national authority is required to secure Treasury consent before regulations are laid under paragraph 8(1), 12(2) or 12(5) of schedule 11. This arrangement allows the opportunity for a measured review of the hypothecation arrangements for both local authority and trunk road charging schemes in England and Wales that can take account of future revenues and the way in which they might be spent before decisions are reached. Given the sums involved and the need to ensure that charging revenues continue to be spent on value-for-money measures in the medium to longer term, it is prudent that both the Secretary of State and the National Assembly of Wales be required to seek Treasury consent before laying regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I commented earlier about the 10-year review and the opportunity that is given to the Government to grab the money. The amendment puts the 1083 1084 Treasury's fingerprints firmly on the provision. I thank God that we are likely to have a change of Government by the time the reviews come round.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Do I take it that we now have an official statement from the Opposition that they support the indefinite hypothecation of charging revenues?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We do not support charging because it is not part of our policy. If the Government implemented legislation on the ground that there should be hypothecation, however, but failed to introduce a scheme on that basis, we would be letting the public down.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The Minister told us in an earlier debate that he would not seek to persuade his hon. Friends to support this new clause. Nevertheless, I hope that in a relatively brief contribution I can persuade him to think again.
<P>
Hon. Members will be well aware of the contents of the White Paper that was produced in 1998. The Government argued in Paragraph 4.108 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are strong arguments for workplace parking charges to be levied in all types of location, whether in the town centre or at out of town sites, in order to be consistent with our planning policy, particularly on the revitalisation of towns and cities, by influencing individuals' travel choice and businesses' location choice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sadly, during our deliberations on Tuesday, the Under-Secretary and the Minister made it clear that they are no longer persuaded of the need to consider workplace charging at out-of-town venues. We were told that it was extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would be prepared to consider proposals from local authorities unless it was in an area where the prime problem was one of congestion. There has been a significant shift in the Government's thinking about the location of workplace charging levy schemes since the 1998 White Paper was published.
<P>
Another shift in the Government's thinking is even more recent than that that occurred between the publication of the White Paper and now. Indeed, it has occurred since the publication of "Breaking the Logjam", the Government's response to the consultation. Paragraph 6.4 of that document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government proposes that only parking associated with the workplace should initially be subject to the levy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the White Paper, however, the Government clearly suggested that they were prepared to consider charges on other types of parking space. "Breaking the Logjam" does not deny that possibility, given the sentence that I have just quoted, which suggests that the Government are minded to consider other possibilities in future. Indeed, paragraph 6.7 shows that they have not ruled out other options, such as introducing a parking levy at out-of-town retail and leisure centres.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, the Government acknowledge that they are not yet persuaded of the need for such schemes. Paragraph 6.7 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Over-generous provision of parking for customers and visitors can have other undesirable effects, such as encouraging car-dependent development on edge-of-town and out-of-town sites. However, the Government is not yet persuaded that a levy on non-workplace parking would be the most effective way of addressing the issue of changing customer travel patterns.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Since the White Paper, the Government have had second thoughts, but have not ruled out the possibility of such a levy. They suggest going for an initial levy on workplace parking but are not yet persuaded of the merit of including the alternatives that I mentioned.
<P>
The Government have asked the Commission for Integrated Transport to examine the matter to discover whether extending the scope of the Bill's provisions would be a good idea. I do not wish to detain the Committee on why extending parking levies is a good thing, so I shall merely say that the sole purpose of new clause 28 is to provide the Government with an opportunity to introduce an extension by an order approved by both Houses of Parliament, should they be persuaded of the value of such an extension in light of the commission's report.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has said on several occasions in Committee that transport legislation does not often come before the House. If the commission recommends that the proposals be extended, the Government do not have a vehicle for introducing legislation unless they accept new clause 28.
<P>
There are strong arguments for and against the introduction of extensions. However, I put on record the fact that I have had detailed discussions with several organisations that could be affected by such extensions. I pay tribute to them, especially the supermarkets, for the work that they already do on green transport plans. I acknowledge the efforts of several supermarket chains to provide non-car transport to out-of-town shopping centres. However, much more needs to be done. In some parts of the country, certain roads may be more congested on Sundays than they are in the rush hour.
<P>
Such matters are being examined on the Government's request. They have not yet ruled extensions out, although they are not necessarily persuaded that they are a good idea. New clause 28 merely provides a vehicle that would enable the Government to introduce the necessary legislation by an order approved by both Houses if they were convinced of the merits of extension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Bath for raising the important matter of the scope of the workplace parking levy provisions in the Bill in his usual reasonable well-informed fashion. However, I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman as I am not prepared to accept the new clause, although I appreciate the spirit in which it was tabled. Not for the first time, Liberal Democrat Members are kindly offering the Government an enabling provision, but it would be premature to accept it. Indeed, such an action could be misinterpreted as a signal of future Government policy, which would be unhelpful for our purposes and for bodies potentially affected by any such policy development.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, our transport White Paper and the follow-up consultation paper "Breaking the Logjam" made it clear that the levy would initially apply only to workplace parking. We are not yet persuaded that a levy on customer parking is the most effective way of changing customer travel behaviour.
<P>
As we have said, we expect major retail and leisure operators to work with local authorities to build on the initiatives that some major retailers have already taken to tackle overdependency on the car. Those could include providing bus shelters, funding bus priority measures on the surrounding road network and providing secure cycle parking. Retail outlets could also extend or introduce easy and affordable home delivery services.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we expect to make real progress on such matters. As we said in our White Paper, we shall ask the Commission for Integrated Transport to assess the effectiveness of such an approach and to consider the case for extending the scope of the levy to include customer parking. I shall ensure that the Committee's deliberations this morning are conveyed to the Commission. It would be better to wait for the commission's recommendations before taking a final decision on extending the scope of the parking levy. Such an approach would also provide greater flexibility when deciding how to draft any legislation for a levy on customer parking. I therefore request the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's reply. However, he did not answer any of my questions.
<P>
I accept entirely that the Government are not yet convinced about extending parking levies and that it is sensible for the matter to be examined. The Under-Secretary said that the Government intend to make "real progress". If such progress is made and the Government decide to introduce customer parking levies, by what mechanism will they do so? I merely offered the Under-Secretary a means to deal with them. He has given not a single, solitary answer to whether the Government have an alternative to accepting the mechanism that I suggest. I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell us how the Government intend to deal with the issue, should it arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his concern. It is true that transport legislation is not an everyday, nor even an annual, occurrence, but it does crop up from time to time. In the first five years of the previous Administration, there was a transport Bill every year. The fact that we have not had a transport Bill for some time--we are all truly delighted that the present Bill is before us--does not exclude the Government from introducing the appropriate primary legislation if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary's explanation is like the proverbial bus story: as soon as one comes along, so do several others. He has given us a clear assurance that, were there to be a proposal to extend parking charges to include customer parking, legislation would quickly be introduced. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
<P>
