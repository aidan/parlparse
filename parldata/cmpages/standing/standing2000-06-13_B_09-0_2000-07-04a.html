<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Clause 50 is difficult and sensitive, as it deals with cultural issues. There is a sensitivity about cultural issues in Northern Ireland that is sometimes real, sometimes imaginary. It should be understood that our proposals on the name, badge and flag are not intended in any way to diminish or deny the sacrifices made by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, particularly over the past 30 years, and the suffering endured by its officers, their families and members of the community that identified with them during that period. We must acknowledge that there are people in the RUC and the wider community who see the retention of the name, badge and flag as recognition of what they have endured over the years.

<P>
However, the Social Democratic and Labour party believes that many people in the RUC and the wider community, including the Unionist community accept that changes are needed in the emblems, flags and name of the police service to create a new beginning. Again, we have adopted an approach that ensures compatibility with the accepted Patten report and addresses the structures and cultural issues with which it dealt. We have tried not to be one-dimensional by focusing on one issue, but to deal with the broad canvas that was covered by Patten in his attempt to achieve a new police service.

<P>
If the new police service is to be accepted, there needs to be a satisfactory resolution of the issue of emblems and flags. The cultural proposals in the Patten report are both symbolically and structurally important. They are an expression of the new beginning to which I have referred. Much more importantly, they are and will continue to be an invitation to all sections of our community to accept and join the new service. The amendments express our hope of achieving a corporate neutrality, impartiality and independence in the new police service, albeit there will be individual diversity within it.

<P>
The Patten report dealt unambiguously with those matters. The legislation should be equally unambiguous. Patten was particularly straightforward on the name, flag and emblems:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that new beginning cannot be achieved unless the reality that part of the community feels unable to identify with the present name and symbols associated with the police is addressed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Patten made that statement on the basis that he outlined in the report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many people in Northern Ireland from the Irish nationalist and republican tradition regard the name, badge and symbols of the RUC as associating the police with the British constitution and state  The problem is that the name of the RUC, and to some extent the badge and the uniform too, have become politicised-one community effectively claiming ownership of the name of ``our'' police force, and the other community taking the position that the name<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the emblem and the flag are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>symbolic of a relationship between the police and unionism and the British state.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some people here and in other places disagree with that. In an earlier debate, the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) quoted from the response of the Northern Irish bishops, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is important to point out that the name, symbols and political ethos of a police service are not essential to its primary purpose of detecting crime and upholding the law in service of the whole community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave the impression that his quote fully represented the opinion of the Catholic hierarchy in Northern Ireland. I know that he did not intend to mislead the Committee, but he did not continue to quote the response, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To our mind such de-politicisation of the culture and ethos of policing is essential if policing arrangements in Northern Ireland are to win the full support of the Catholic community and if the targets for Catholic recruitment set out in the Report are to have a realistic chance of being met.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The full paragraph has an entirely different meaning from that of the partial quote recorded in our sitting on 27 June at column 312. Lest that be taken as the view of the hierarchy, I think it important to read the full sentence into the record.

<P>
The members of the police commission knew of the difficulties and the nuances because they came from different traditions in Northern Ireland and different backgrounds. They accepted and promoted the idea of a substantive change in emblems and flags, and the strength of Patten's unambiguous and conclusive recommendations on the emblem and the flag must be acknowledged. The commission recommended:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the Northern Ireland Police Service adopt a new badge and symbols which are entirely free from any association with either the British or Irish states;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the Union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that, on those occasions on which it is appropriate to fly a flag on police buildings, the flag flown should be that of the Northern Ireland Police Service and it, too, should be free from association with the British or Irish states.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The SDLP amendments would turn those recommendations into law.

<P>
The Government say that they accept Patten's argument that the police service should adopt a new badge and new symbols free from any association with either the British or Irish states. However, they argue that the badge and symbols need not be free from any association from the British or the Irish traditions. We do not think that Patten intended such an approach. Some anxiety has been expressed about the difference in meaning between ``association with either the British or the Irish states'' and ``association with either the British or the Irish traditions'', and about how the Government interpreted those expressions. The wording of the Bill seems to be contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of Patten.

<P>
Unfortunately, the final decision on such matters appears to lie with the Secretary of State. In his only public comment about the issue after the report's publication, Patten said that emblems and flags should not be linked to any political view either. That is another significant comment. We are opposed to the Secretary of State having the power to decide. The responsibility should be left to the Policing Board, just as decisions about the flying of flags from public buildings should have been left to the Northern Ireland Executive, rather than the Secretary of State.

<P>
Patten stated unambiguously that the Union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State reserves to himself the power to determine which flags, including national flags, and which police flags, whatever emblem may subsequently be upon them, shall be flown from police buildings. The Government have argued that they need this power, ironically, to stop the national flag being flown from police buildings. But there is a real sense that it is to enable the national flag to be flown from the buildings that the Secretary of State is securing such a power. The terminology and ethos of the clause are contrary to the letter and certainly the spirit of what Patten intended.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): I am a little surprised that the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) appears to know Chris Patten's inner mind, but does not elaborate. He tells us what he believes Chris Patten had in mind, but cannot justify his assertion. The Committee should ignore that advice. I am also surprised, although not quite so surprised, that the hon. Gentleman has tabled these amendments relating to the Union flag. He and I were part of a negotiating team, which came to an agreement on Good Friday in 1998. It was a specific agreement that was intended to allow both major traditions and others in Northern Ireland to build upon a clear definition of Northern Ireland's constitutional position.

<P>
The agreement began by stating that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom until such time as the majority of its people at the ballot box decided that it should be otherwise. Hence, it is important that everyone-politicians, police and others-support and defend that agreed position. It was not without some reserve that Unionists accepted that state of affairs. They accepted it as democrats but realised that if Northern Ireland's constitutional position was left open to question, even in terms of the future vote, it could provoke the sort of agitation that has been reflected in the contribution here this morning. If we are part of the United Kingdom, the citizens of Northern Ireland should take the United Kingdom's position of constitutional, legal and other issues.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The United Kingdom flag is the Union flag; it should not be abused, as it has been by a small minority. That adage could be applied to all flags, which tend to be abused in confrontations. The Ulster Unionist party stands firmly and resolutely against the abuse of any person or tradition in Northern Ireland. If that were the attitude commonly accepted across the community, there would be fewer difficulties. Hence, it is important, when considering the Union flag, that we do not give the impression that the police service in Northern Ireland-currently, the RUC-is constrained in observing, protecting and upholding those things to which the entire community is entitled under the British constitution and United Kingdom laws.

<P>
For that reason, we must not, unlike the hon. Member for South Down and his party, seek to isolate the police from one or other tradition or from the community in Northern Ireland. However, insofar as the greater number of people across both traditions have accepted the constitutional position stated in the Belfast agreement, for the present and the future, they must reasonably be expected to accept all that goes with that. There cannot be a deviation, or those who have defended the rights of citizens across the political divide in Northern Ireland will be alienated.

<P>
I repudiate any attempt by an individual, party or group to create circumstances in which the reality is different from that in the hard-won agreement of Good Friday 1998. That must be what guides us and that responsibility must be accepted by both traditions in Northern Ireland. We are talking about the responsibility, the duty and the constitutional position.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> We are not talking about the constitutional position; we are talking about the regulations on emblems and flags. The hon. Gentleman has just said that the new police service must be acceptable to all parts of the community, so how will he make the changes necessary to emblems and flags to achieve that? Will he confirm that the flag of the Ulster Unionist party is, in fact, the Union flag and that it has therefore been politicised by his party?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Whatever I might think about the views of the hon. Member for South Down on this matter, I can confirm that he is no fool. His foolish and mischievous question is so transparent that people will see through it. In case the hon. Gentleman has confused anyone else on the Committee, let me proceed with my argument.

<P>
The agreement was hard-won and hard-fought and took 10 years-not a couple-to achieve. We entered into negotiations with virtually all political parties 10 years ago this year. When we finally reached an agreement on Good Friday 1998, it stated the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.

<P>
The term ``cherry-picking'' will not be unfamiliar to the hon. Member for South Down, but he cannot cherry pick the agreement, even though we have all attempted to cherry pick the Patten report, simply because some of its basic tenets, elements and projections are not fact. Patten was inaccurate on many issues and his report is flawed. That report is, however, entirely different from what the hon. Gentleman and I negotiated over two years. We knew what we were doing: the constitutional position of Northern Ireland is clearly defined in the agreement and it cannot be cherry picked. I need say no more.

<P>
Members of the Committee will recognise that the motivation of the hon. Member for South Down and his hon. Friends in the Social and Democratic Labour party has more to do with what is projected as ``republican effort''-the fight for the hearts and minds of republicans at election times-than with the outworkings of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.

<P>
I pay tribute to the SDLP. While other parties indulge in in-your-face politics in the outworkings of the Northern Ireland Assembly and haul down the Union flag from the Departments of Education and of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the SDLP has not involved itself in any such shenanigans. That is the yardstick against which it should expect others to function in Northern Ireland-not in-your-face politics, but sensible, constitutional, stable politics, which will move Northern Ireland forward and ensure that the police service is aware that its responsibility under the constitution is to protect every citizen, and to be even-handed. By and large, it has been even-handed, as far is it could be in the past 30 years, in circumstances fraught with terrorism, murder, mayhem and destruction.

<P>
Finally, I come to the constitutional position, and the flag. If a police service is told that it has no connection with reality, its raison d'etre is undermined. My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone will speak to other amendments, but as far as the Union flag is concerned, I want the Minister to make it clear that neither he nor any other member of the Government will tinker with the Belfast agreement or with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.

<P>
I hope that I shall not test your patience, Mr. O'Hara, if I cite the situation being displayed on television to illustrate the work that the police service in Northern Ireland has to do. Have we so tampered with policing and impinged on its responsibilities that an individual-an ex-prisoner to whom I alluded in a previous sitting without naming-whom I name as Johnny Adair, can flaunt himself in confrontation with the police and with law and order? Masked men and weapons can be seen-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who is beginning to test my patience. I trust that he will return to the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I hope that I shall not test your patience, Mr. O'Hara, if I say that by undermining the authority of the police to act in the best interests of society, we are doing a disservice to that society.

<P>
Mr. Adair's actions have more to do with who controls the drugs trade in Northern Ireland than with God and Ulster. I implore the Minister to think about what was on television last night when he considers what he wants for a police service in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I shall speak to amendments Nos. 261, 262 and 272 to clause 50, which relates to the emblems and the flag of the Royal Ulster police force. Unionists have no problem with the existing emblems and the flag that flies from the police stations on some occasions. As the Government will insist on the clause, we want to amend it to strengthen the hand of the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 261 would therefore add a provision that the emblem should be designed to reflect the sensitivity and the traditions of both communities in Northern Ireland and the award of the George Cross to the RUC.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Many people in Northern Ireland were delighted when the RUC was awarded the George Cross, but the Government, through Patten, gave the RUC a slap in the face by saying that they would take away its name, its emblems and its standing. A new emblem or a police flag should reflect, with sensitivity, the position of both communities and the award of the George Cross to the RUC.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Öpik </B>(Montgomeryshire): This may be a small point, but it is important. The amendment suggests that there are only two communities in Northern Ireland. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many other minority groups, although agreeing with the sentiment, will feel that the amendment is too exclusive?

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> To some extent, I sympathise with what the hon. Gentleman said. The Belfast agreement and the political way forward in Northern Ireland assume that there are only two communities in Northern Ireland-the Roman Catholic community and the Protestant community. Life is never as simple as that and, as the hon. Gentleman said, there are many communities in Northern Ireland. Historically, there has been a confrontation between the two political communities in Northern Ireland and the flag of the RUC has adequately reflected that. It will be a happy day when we do not have to say that there are two warring communities in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): As the hon. Gentleman said, there is not a simple, two-way divide: the situation is much more complicated. As an Ulster Unionist, will he underscore what he and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) have said-that this is so much more complex than some think? Would he care to offer a view as an Ulster Unionist on how many Catholics might, on the question being put, be in favour of the Union?

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. My understanding is that more than 70 per cent. of people in Northern Ireland believe in and accept the union. There are many Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland who quite happily accept it. At least 70 per cent. of all the people in Northern Ireland accept it, so we could take it that probably 25 per cent. of the Roman Catholic population are happy to live in the Union. Why should they not? After all, there are more Irish people living in the Union than there are in Ireland, so I do not see why they should have strong objections; seeing that they have the same Government, I do not understand what they are complaining about.

<P>
However, we must recognise that religion was more important 50 years ago than it is now and there was more commitment to the Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths than there is now. Many people in Northern Ireland have no faith in anything and the idea that there are just two communities is inaccurate. The existing emblem and badge of the Royal Ulster Constabulary has reflected the historical divide in Ireland. It does so quite adequately and should continue to do so. However, changes are taking place and the Government wish to do away with that. We are trying to preserve the integrity of the RUC and to maintain and reflect its contribution.

<P>
Our final amendment is amendment No. 272. It recommends that when the Secretary of State makes regulations, he should consult not only the Chief Constable and the Police Association but, if there is a devolved Assembly at that time, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Amendment No. 31 proposed by the hon. Member for South Down must be the most remarkable amendment ever to have been tabled in this House. It suggests that the Union flag shall not be flown over any land or building used for the purposes of or in connection with the police force. We can see from the exchanges between the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) and the hon. Member for South Down what a foolish agreement the Belfast agreement was.

<P>
Clearly there are two interpretations of that agreement: those Unionists who were foolish enough to go into the talks have one notion of it while Sinn Fein and nationalists have another. They do not know what they agreed. The result is the suggestion that we should have a neutral police force in Northern Ireland, one that is neither British nor Irish. There is no such thing as a neutral police force. The police force is ultimately an arm of the state to which it belongs. I can think of no other country in the world where the Government would not acknowledge that and where the police would not display the fact that they belong to part of that state. The idea that one could have a neutral police force in Northern Ireland is nonsense and humbug. It will represent the arm of the British state, no matter what anybody says. It is therefore unlikely that Sinn Fein will ever agree to become part of it. This wonderful new experiment is unlikely to be successful. Be that as it may, I ask the Committee to accept our three amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I should like to speak to new clause 11 and to take the opportunity to say a few words about some of the other amendments before us. It is noteworthy that the Secretary of State, perhaps wisely, has decided to leave himself the maximum discretion in the way that the clause is drafted. Faced with the various comments that have been made this morning, he has fudged the issue. Whatever the Patten report may say, whatever the Belfast agreement may intend, his way out is to say that he will make regulations about this later, thus avoiding having to explain or develop more clearly his thinking on what he or the Government feel would be appropriate. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister amplifies how the Secretary of State views the exercise of that discretion under these regulations.

<P>
There is undoubtedly a core point on this, which was rightly touched on by the hon. Member for West Tyrone. The Belfast agreement sets up a framework to try to achieve peace and reconciliation within Northern Ireland, but one need only look at its terms to see that it is quite clearly a structure whereby Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. When we discussed the question of the flying of flags over public buildings, the Secretary of State acknowledged that the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom makes it nonsense to suggest that anything other than the Union flag should be flown over public buildings in Northern Ireland.

<P>
At the same time, some of the amendments seek to fudge the issue about the nature of the police force in Northern Ireland and from whom it derives its authority. It is not a question of being an arm of the state, but in the UK-there are different rules in different countries-ultimately all power devolves from the Crown. The police force is like any other body, such as the judiciary. It is not an arm of the state necessarily, but its members are undoubtedly Crown servants. That is the reality and nothing that we legislate on or change by way of symbols or names can alter that.

<P>
Curiously, I have always found the issue of symbols for the police force more difficult than the issue of names. There may be arguments for a name that people prefer, but it is difficult to see how the symbols currently in use for the police force in Northern Ireland do other than accurately reflect its local community ties and links. They are a series of emblems that are intimately connected with Ireland-the harp and shamrock-and finally a crown, which is a common symbol to represent the fact that the people who are serving are Crown servants. No amount of removing of those symbols can remove that reality.

<P>
I sometimes wonder whether we are embarking on an argument that will have people roaring with laughter at us in 20 or 30 years' time. We are spending a great deal of time considering what in my judgment is a relatively straightforward issue. I appreciate that the hon. Member for South Down wishes to try to turn the police force in Northern Ireland-let us forget about what its name may be-into something that it quite patently is not. In view of that, I wonder whether the desire that he has manifested in his various amendments to neutralise its status will carry the weight that he says it does within communities that might, for instance, wish for a united Ireland. In effect, if they feel that, they are conning themselves. The Belfast agreement provided for some extraordinary although welcome variants on normal principles of democracy to provide inclusive forms of Government that respected the existence of a substantial minority with an alternative political viewpoint. I nevertheless see nothing in the Belfast agreement that called for that Patten Commission proposal. I will need a lot of persuading that it would make a fundamental difference to the acceptability of the police force. That provides the context for new clause 11.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Like all good conservatives, we must be persuaded that existing emblems are so unsatisfactory that they must go before accepting that option, as opposed to providing new names or a change in ethos and recruitment. Apart from the change of name, there is no reason to change existing symbols or flags in any way. The question of which flag should fly over a police station on what occasions can properly be left to the sensitivity of the Chief Constable or, if necessary, to regulations made by the Secretary of State. It is a matter of mere detail.

<P>
The hon. Member for South Down wants to insert a clause to specify that the Union flag can never be flown above a police station, but that is a rather extraordinary thing to do. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, so such action would be both novel and curious. That is why we tabled new clause 11.

<P>
We may all be swirling around a central point-basically, the Secretary of State saying, ``Leave it to me''. We are all suggesting better definitions of what should happen. Many concessions were made in the Belfast agreement-an unusual document-so it is right to reassure the majority community in Northern Ireland that their country is not about to be transformed into an extraordinary condominium-or, worse still, a cantonised state in which majority local communities will hold sway over what should happen in particular localities. There is a need for sensitivity, but the basis of the Belfast agreement, with all its good ideas and concessions, remains that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. In future, Northern Ireland should be governed with greater sensitivity to minority requirements and more inclusively, but the hon. Member for South Down's proposals will not achieve that.

<P>
I remain concerned about the Secretary of State's intentions. It is all very well saying that one must bend over backwards to escape the reality of state structures, but where does that stop? Should Inland Revenue documents no longer refer to the fact that the Inland Revenue is a Crown body? We are surrounded by such bodies. Anyone visiting a state in the European Union, including Ireland, will be surrounded by similar symbols. The institutions must command confidence, but tinkering around with symbols will not make a valuable contribution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I may have missed a point about new clause 11, but the hon. Gentleman's objectives could be achieved under the Bill. His new clause, if he will forgive me for saying so, is otiose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point in that nothing could prevent the Secretary of State from using his powers under the Bill to achieve the purpose of new clause 11. We are debating whether the Secretary of State's discretion should be fettered, so it is proper to introduce a new clause to make it clear that he cannot act arbitrarily in this respect. It is a difficult issue. The House and Committees routinely give substantial discretionary powers to Ministers and I do not usually lose much sleep over it. However, discretionary powers can be used in suspect ways that people do not like. When the purpose is called into question, the use of discretionary power-[
Interruption.] Does the Minister want me to give way?

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram) No.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The moment that the use of discretionary powers is called into question, people start becoming concerned. That is why we tabled new clause 11. I await with interest the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): I have considerable sympathy with some of the arguments on both sides, including those made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down and the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone.

<P>
I recognise Patten's point, pressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, about the desirability of a symbol that is entirely free from association with any emblem of Ireland or the United Kingdom. That may be the right way ahead, but I mentioned an alternative on Second Reading. One could consider the possibility of choosing symbols that are common to both states, and a number of symbols are recognised by both traditions. I happened to choose symbols currently in the RUC badge. The harp, for example, is found in traditional symbols used by the UK and Eire. The same applies to the shamrock, although not in the form in which it is used in the RUC badge. I said on Second Reading that the royal crown would certainly be regarded as identified with one community, although the antique crown-the crown of St. Edmund-was a traditional symbol of Ireland.

<P>
Interestingly, my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) informed me after the debate that one political party in Northern Ireland-the Irish Republican Socialist party-has adopted the crown of St. Edmund as its symbol. I think that he was implying that there was a certain Irish logic to a republican socialist party choosing a crown as its symbol.

<P>
Having made those points, I recognise the fundamental problem, that any symbol chosen for the new Northern Ireland police service that bears too close a similarity to the present RUC badge may offend one community and any symbol that does not bear sufficient resemblance to it may offend the other. However, there is room for us to have sensible consultation and dialogue with both communities on whether the symbol should either be common to both communities or have no connection with the state of Ireland or the UK. That was the case with the six-headed flax chosen for the Northern Ireland Assembly to symbolise not only the tradition of flax growing in Northern Ireland, but the six counties that form it. That symbol was acceptable to both communities. Surely there is room for sensible negotiation and consultation.

<P>
There are various options on whether the George Cross should be included in any symbol. It is possible in heraldry to have symbols that can be interpreted differently by different people, which is helpful. I do not want to go into a lot of detail, but there are possibilities for discussion and negotiation.

<P>
The symbol should not be prescribed by law at this stage. It is far more sensible to leave such issues to the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone spoke to amendments Nos. 261 and 262, which, sensibly, use the word ``sensitivity''. It is important that sensitivity is shown. That is best done not by prescribing the symbol in legislation now, but by discussion and negotiation, after the Bill has been enacted.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone said that he doubted whether police stations in any other country did not fly their national flag. Most police stations in Scotland do not usually fly the Union flag. He said that he did not expect the police force to be neutral. He should think carefully about that. I expect the police to be totally neutral in upholding the law. In a debate in the Chamber, we discussed whether people who supported nationalism could serve as policemen. In Scotland, I would not ask whether potential recruits supported the Scottish National party. They have an absolute right to do so, and the police force should be utterly neutral between nationalists and non-nationalists. I see no reason why such an attitude cannot be taken in Northern Ireland. It would probably be sensible for police in Northern Ireland to fly the flag chosen to be the police force's flag.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Does my hon. Friend agree that a period of abstention from flag-flying would not go amiss?

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I have considerable sympathy with the idea that flags can sometimes cause great dissent and that not flying flags might solve many problems. However, if a flag must be flown, perhaps it would be most sensible to fly the flag of the police force.

<P>
I shall make a plea to my hon. Friend the Member for South Down and the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone. If the clause is left unamended, the Secretary of State will be able to consult both communities sensibly and sensitively, with a view to reaching agreements that pay proper attention to the concerns of both communities. That would be better than insisting on any of the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I agree with the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down about the sensitivity of the issue, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) alluded. My hon. Friend the Member for South Down talked about the real and imagined aspects to the issue, and I shall deal with the points that he made later.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made some telling points, but I do not agree with them all. He asked me to assure him that the Government would not tinker with the Belfast agreement or Northern Ireland's position in the United Kingdom. No one can level the charge that the Government are tinkering with the Belfast agreement. We have consistently said that we will implement the agreement fully, despite all the difficulties that flow from it, which I do not need to recount. Northern Ireland's relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom is governed by the consent principle, which is writ large in the Belfast agreement and to which the British Government adhere.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone focused on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland under the Belfast agreement as an argument for the use of British symbols by the police force. Therefore, it is important to examine what the Belfast agreement says and how it imposes conditions on the Government. It requires that the power of the Government shall be exercised
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of, civil, political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all citizens, and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos, and aspirations of both communities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a powerful statement, and the Government must deal with the problems that it poses. Those conditions were approved by 71 per cent. of the people of Northern Ireland-including a majority of Unionists-and, since its acceptance a couple of years ago, the Belfast agreement has allowed us to move forward.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We saw disgraceful scenes on television this morning of last night's events in Northern Ireland. We are all concerned, and I can assure the Committee that the Government take the matter seriously. We are reflecting on how best to react, but this is not the place to recount in detail how we expect that our response will play out. I repeat my assurance that we are seriously examining the problem and intend to respond proportionately on the basis of the evidence.

<P>
Yesterday, I took the opportunity of visiting the Army and the RUC at Mahon road barracks and I spoke to an RUC officer who had been injured on Sunday evening, so I am fully aware of the tenseness within the ranks as soldiers and police carry out such a difficult job, which requires them to interface with violent people. I pay tribute to the fortitude and determination of the RUC and the Army. I cannot say that they are without fear, because fear is inevitable in certain circumstances and maximum restraint has to be shown. The Army and the RUC, in facing such difficulties, do not receive the respect that they deserve from the community. I fully share the concerns of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in that regard.

<P>
Before addressing amendment No. 29-

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I hope that I can assume, on the basis of the Minister's hints, that the Government will adopt certain courses of action, but he must not be tempted to treat one part of the Belfast agreement as separate from the fundamental part-the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. I hope that he was not about to do that.

<P>
I have never sought to cherry-pick the Belfast agreement, but a sequence of events within it must be applied to all circumstances-policing or the constitution, for example. The Minister must not seek to avoid such sequencing. By emphasising one part of the agreement-with which I concur-and skimming over its initial part, he may be tempted to make wrong assertions and reach wrong conclusions. I certainly hope that he will not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is difficult to tempt me, but the hon. Gentleman's political antennae are too finely tuned this morning. Nothing that I have said about the Bill could lead to the conclusion that he fears. I set out a powerful statement of the need to respect all traditions, and I know that he agrees with it. He has been a brave champion of that concept for many years and has delivered tough arguments within his own community in its support. We are at one on what the Belfast agreement means in that regard, which is why I wanted to put it on the record. It sets out the way forward for the Government and is supported by the people of Northern Ireland. I shall not be tempted in the way that the hon. Gentleman fears.

<P>
I want to set out the generalities of the case before dealing with the specifics of amendment No. 29. I shall set out the Government's approach toward the symbols of the police service. The Government gave Patten's recommendations considerable thought, in the knowledge that the flying of flags in Northern Ireland has long been an emotive issue, and the amendments clearly demonstrate the strength of feeling on it. The Government took account of Patten, who recommended that the badge and other symbols be entirely free from any association with the British or Irish states. Paragraph 17.4 of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The name of the RUC-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we shall debate it later in our deliberations-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and to some extent the badge  have become politicised.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The carefully chosen phrase ``to some extent'' is notable in relation to the symbols. Patten separated the name from the symbols.

<P>
The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report of 8 July 1998 on the composition, recruitment and training of the RUC reached some similar conclusions. Paragraph 33 stated that the policy should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to identify and to remove disincentives for Roman Catholics to join the RUC.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 37 stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The cause of low Roman Catholic numbers  must be acknowledged as a symptom of the lack of acceptance or confidence in the RUC among a significant part of Northern Ireland's community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Despite that, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee found that symbols were not central to the status of the RUC. It is no disrespect to that Committee to note that Patten had the time and resources to consult more widely. The reactions to consultation were polarised between ``make no change whatever'' and ``fundamental changes are necessary''-the same polarisation that we debated in earlier sittings.

<P>
The Government's starting point was always what Patten said, and we accepted his headline approach-that the name must change. We also accepted that the badge will change at the same time as the name, in autumn 2001. We have taken account of the Patten view that the symbols are to some extent a lesser issue than the name, because they are less clear-cut.

<P>
As stated on page 83 of the implementation plan, there will be change, but the Government do not accept that the new symbols should necessarily be free of any association with both traditions-providing that that is consistent with the principles of the Good Friday agreement. We also want to consult the Policing Board, which should be representative on that issue, and we shall also consult on the flying of the flag. Clause 50 effectively allows the Secretary of State to do so.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 29, 268 and 31 would require the Secretary of State to make regulations to deal with the emblems and flag of the police service and would require the letter of Patten to be implemented. In other words, the police force should adopt a new badge and symbol that are entirely free of any association with the British or Irish states; the Union flag should no longer be flown on police buildings; and if a flag has to be flown, it must be free of association with the British or Irish states. That is my understanding of the SDLP's position on the amendment, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down.

<P>
The Government are aware of the need for Catholics no longer to regard the RUC as a Unionist force. We question the conclusion of the Patten report that the symbols of the police service need to be completely neutral in respect of both traditions to achieve that end. We accept the need for a good and harmonious working environment and for the symbols of the police service not to be a disincentive to the recruitment of Catholics or to support from across the community.

<P>
However, we are not convinced that that objective requires neutrality in respect of both traditions in the workplace or in the service. The Government do not accept that the new badge needs to be entirely free of association with both traditions providing that it is consistent-I use the phrase again-with the principles of the Good Friday agreement. Both traditions are equally valid and there should be consent to just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the Minister agree that he and the Secretary of State have found nothing in the RUC badge that can be improved on? Do they suspect that the reason for wanting to change the badge has more to do with cutting the continuity of policing in Northern Ireland than with the reality of the situation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am trying to interpret what the hon. Gentleman said. If we were starting with a blank sheet, people would throw on to it various elements that would make up a new badge or symbol of the police force of Northern Ireland. Those from the Unionist tradition would argue strongly for a crown-the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) alluded to arguments in favour of that symbol-others would throw in a hat because that identifies the wider tradition of the Irish people, and some would throw in the shamrock.

<P>
Such symbols would appear in some shape or form if we had a blank sheet of paper, but we do not; we are dealing with what exists, and, possibly, with imagined hurts, which can become very real in Northern Ireland. People may say that they are hostile to a certain symbol. The spectrum of views on the RUC has visceral hatred at one end, and a knee-jerk reaction against discussing any change at the other. We have to deal with reality, not symbols on a blank sheet of paper; that is why the Secretary of State said that we were not free of association with both traditions. That does not mean that we accept the existing elements, but that it would be wrong to think that they will not be considered. They are there and people will say, ``This is what the badge should include.''

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North mentioned some features that may be included, but the issue is so complex that it is difficult to reach a conclusion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> In fact, what the majority of the people of Northern Ireland want has no bearing on the matter. The majority are happy with the existing symbols.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not intend to respond to what I perceive to be a one-sided approach to the matter and a lack of flexibility in trying to understand its complexity. I understand that the hon. Gentleman has a strong view; he does not support the Belfast agreement and campaigns vigorously against it. He does not like the harmonisation that is beginning to flow from it. He is also opposed to the devolution of powers to a Northern Ireland Assembly. That is his position, and his questions will be judged on the basis of his prejudice. I do not intend to try to convince him otherwise, as I have tried before and failed. I can be like a dog with a bone in an argument but I have gnawed this one as much as I can. To use a Scottish word, I have gone ``gumsie'' trying to convince him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> What the Minister said has nothing to do with the matter. Does it count for nothing that the greater number of people in Northern Ireland, and the majority of their elected representatives, support the existing names and badge?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Where lies the majority? Is it the majority of people and the majority of representatives in Northern Ireland or the majority of representatives in the United Kingdom? The hon. Gentleman is a Member of this House. Does he respect the opinion of the majority of his colleagues when they express a different view from his? If he is asking me to support the majority view as he expresses it, I ask him to consider the majority view of the people in Northern Ireland and in the House.

<P>
The Secretary of State will consult the board, which will be representative of the wider community of interests within Northern Ireland if, as we hope, it is constituted of 10 political representatives and nine independents.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Does the Minister understand the frustration felt by those who hear endless references to the two communities in Northern Ireland? The Alliance party has said many times that there are other communities; if some of us were a little less fixated about the two communities and more interested in having a police force representative of all the communities in Northern Ireland, we would get away from this sticking point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not fixated, as the hon. Gentleman suggested; that is why I use the phrase ``both traditions''. I hope that he appreciates that that shorthand description is most accurate. It represents the vast bulk of prevailing attitudes. People settle into one tradition or the other, although they may not be vehement about their views.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I fear that I will end up in another theological debate about whether that is the case, but I shall have a go.

<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I do not intend to distract the Minister in that respect, but what he said is factually incorrect, in that there are people who say explicitly that they are from neither community. Although he may regard it as a small point, I am anxious that, by being so focused on satisfying two traditions, we sometimes miss the opportunity to satisfy the wider community in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not discount the fact that such a body of opinion exists, but people tend to settle in those two traditions. The cultural traditions do not necessarily have a religious aspect, although people may be categorised as automatically holding a religious affiliation because they are part of a cultural tradition. Those are the dividing lines in Northern Ireland. Committee members do not want a lecture from me on the subject, especially as there are hon. Gentlemen from Northern Ireland present who may want to disagree with me. However, I have tried, as briefly as possible, to express the reality as I and the vast majority perceive it. If I get a lot of Mr. Angry and Mrs. Angry letters from Northern Ireland saying, ``You've got it wrong,'' and that view adds up to the majority, I will certainly let the hon. Gentleman know. It is always tempting to encourage people to write, and given the size of my mailbag on matters related to Northern Ireland, another few hundred letters would not matter.

<P>
I was dealing with the amendments when we digressed into an important discussion about their intention and background. The Government have shown that they are not afraid to take difficult decisions where required. We did so on the issue of 50-50 recruitment, and we will deal later with the name of the police service. There are many other examples of where we had to tackle fundamentally difficult decisions involving the polarisation of attitudes. We intend to make changes with regard to flags and emblems, but will do so only when we are convinced that such changes are appropriate and proportionate. We have yet to be convinced that Patten has got it entirely right, and that is why we intend to consult the board before reaching any conclusions. I understood my hon. Friend the Member for South Down also to have recognised the benefit of consulting the board; if I am wrong, perhaps he will correct me. I do not know whether he said that it would be appropriate to consult the board. He looks a bit mystified-does he want to intervene?

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I am not terribly clear about what statement of mine the Minister is referring to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was speaking from memory, but I was referring to the fact that he mentioned the board and the Secretary of State's consultation with the board and others in coming to a decision. I was unclear about whether he was saying that that was a desirable option or whether he was completely writing it out. It would help my consideration of the matter if I knew what he meant. He may want to deal with that point later.

<P>
We recognise that there will be changes to flags and emblems and that the board should be consulted on that. If, in the interim, the board and the Chief Constable act on the matter, so much the better. If a local settlement can be achieved and some way forward found that precludes the necessity for the Secretary of State to use his powers, that would be the most desirable outcome. The Secretary of State has applied a similar arrangement with regard to the flying of flags on devolved Administration buildings. It is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive to sort out. If it cannot come to a resolution, it will, as ever, fall on the Government to find a solution. We will then be pulled in both ways: ``Don't do it,'' and ``Do it.''

<P>
If those who have responsibility to come to decisions on difficult areas fail in discharging that duty, someone then has to do it-and ultimately that must be the Secretary of State. It is not a power that he desires to use, because in many ways it is a reflection of others' failure to come to conclusions, but if decisions are not taken locally, they will have to be taken by someone else. That ``someone else'' must clearly be the Secretary of State. For that reason, I do not support amendments Nos. 29, 268 and 31. I recognise that we may be at variance with Patten on that but, as we have said, Patten is not the fount of all wisdom; he has to be interpreted. In some areas, Patten did not come to conclusions, because it was difficult to do so. Judgments then have to be made and that always involves intensive consultations with as many interested parties as possible.

<P>
I have sympathy with the idea of reflecting the traditions, as shown in my response to amendments Nos. 29, 261 and 3, that decisions should take account of the Good Friday agreement. Unfortunately, however, I must disappoint the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone because we do not believe that they are principles that should be into the Bill. I have set out how we are seeking to tackle this.

<P>
Amendment No. 272 would require the Secretary of State to consult the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the clause 50 regulations. I cannot see how that adds to the existing provision, which requires consultation with the board. Where there is devolved Government, the board will be made up of the main parties in the Assembly, including representatives from the Ulster Unionist party. That is why we have said that the board should be the responsible body. With no disrespect to the important roles of the First and Deputy First Ministers, policing is a matter that is devolved to the board.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone argues that the Police Authority should be a powerful body and should not be over interfered with. He has argued that in the past too, and I assume that the same principles would apply to the new Policing Board. Clearly my hon. Friend the Member for South Down also believes that the Policing Board should be a powerful body. I assume that he would not support further consultation with the Deputy First Minister, who is currently a representative of his party.

<P>
Let the Policing Board be the forum in which these issues are debated and decisions are made. If unanimity or a majority view is expressed on this issue, clearly that would affect the Secretary of State's thinking. I could not envisage a set of circumstances in which he would override the balanced view of the Policing Board on this issue. It would be a very unusual set of circumstances in which a cross-community expression of view on the emotive issue of symbols and flags was rejected by the Secretary of State. Although the provision is there, the view of the Policing Board would be paramount in taking it forward.

<P>
Finally, although I will not ask the Committee to support new clause 11, I welcome it because it accepts a name change. That is a new point of departure for the Conservative party. We are beginning to make some converts.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My party accepted the possibility that the Bill, as drafted, would lead to a name change. That is the best way of expressing of it. We were seeking to tailor the new clause to the Bill that might emerge from Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not want to get into the casuistry of the debate. I prefer my interpretation. The hon. Gentleman has described how he drafted his new clause, but others could read it differently. Obviously I have and I am not convinced of his argument about the way that it should now be interpreted. I welcome the Conservative party's acceptance that a name change is possible. That has not been its position hitherto, unless I am much mistaken.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Mr. MacKay) has always had an open mind about the possibility of a name change. He had a formulation, which, if I am fair to him in his absence, he conceded was clumsy but modest. He has always pursued that objective. It is not a change of heart, but it is correct to say that my party has always had a relatively open mind on this question.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I did not say that there had been a change of heart and I do not want to get into the political knockabout of saying that I never thought that they had a heart to change. I said that it was a point of departure. I would prefer to use my terminology. If the careful wording of the right hon. Member for Bracknell is such that he has always envisaged a name change and this new clause is consistent with those gaps in the door that he left, I will withdraw my suggestion that this is a point of departure. I welcome it if the Conservative party is prepared to support a change of name and we look forward to the debate on that.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
New clause 11 makes an assumption about the emblem that should be used by the new police service. While the Government are not unsympathetic to the view that the new emblem of the police service need not necessarily be free of association with both traditions and have said so, the proposal restricts the movement of the Secretary of State, who wants to consult the board. I have set out the position that he and future Secretaries of State would adopt towards a considered view of the board.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> For the convenience of the Committee it might be appropriate for me to draw attention to the fact that my party's position on names is enshrined in new clause 9, which is on the amendment paper. I have not divulged a secret this morning. New clause 9 has been on the amendment paper for some time. While I have the Floor, Mr. O'Hara I should say that as, on your impeccable advice, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and I will not be able to vote in favour of new clause 11 until much later in our proceedings, we shall vote against clause 50 because we believe that our new clause is superior.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I always thought that Conservative Members considered themselves superior: that is why I am a member of the Labour party and hold to the socialist tradition. I respect their position. I will watch with considerable interest how Conservative Members work their way through the debate on the name change. Ultimately they must decide whether they are in favour. They cannot leave the door slightly ajar for too long: they must open it to let us see what is on the other side.

<P>
My feeling is that the wording that the emblem of the police force shall be the emblem of the RUC is unhelpful and will not engender the nationalist confidence and support that we need and want. I do not need to explain that further. The view of that tradition in Northern Ireland was well expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield may have hoped for certainty in this and, clearly, the Government would have preferred that too. Indeed, that is the view of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down-there should be certainty in this.

<P>
Our approach is to state that the Policing Board should be consulted and its views taken into account. As with the view adopted at the Assembly on the flying of flags on Government buildings, if a local determination can be achieved, we will not need a further determination by the Secretary of State. The regulations may need to be made, but they will be consistent with that local determination. What we are seeking to do is wholly consistent with both the principles of devolution of power and the devolution of responsibility. Where that responsibility is not seized, the Secretary of State must take responsibility in those unhappy circumstances. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendments and the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The sensitivity of the clause is well illustrated by the contributions made from all parts of the Committee this morning. It is a difficult matter, but we must keep in mind what we are trying to achieve which is, first of all, a change from the past and a new beginning that will be embraced, supported and enjoined by all sections of our community, be they two or multi-faceted. That is the message that we are trying to communicate. That requires sensitivity, and without that we will fail to accomplish not only the amendments to the clause but the entire purport of the Bill.

<P>
The contributions were many and varied. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made considerable comment about the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and referred to the Good Friday agreement in that respect. He used the phrase ``cherry-picking'', insinuating, I think, that that was what I was doing. The SDLP totally accepts the principle of consent in the Good Friday agreement, with regard to the constitutional position. The hon. Gentleman knows that well, but that is not what we are debating. We are discussing the clause dealing with emblems and flags.

<P>
In referring to the Good Friday agreement-hiding behind the bush and shaking it at the same time, as we say in our country-the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone really was cherry-picking. He failed to mention many of the other aspects of the Good Friday agreement that impinge on the debate, the equality of the state of political traditions and the equality of the safeguards built into our Government institutions. The thrust of our debate concerns the necessity to build in equality of perception of traditions in the new police service serving those institutions.

<P>
I was disappointed that there was no attempt to rebut the conclusions of the Patten Commission. When we say ``Patten'' as a shorthand, we envisage one person, but in reality we are talking about the Independent Commission on Policing. It was not a one-man band-those serving on the commission represented a cross-section of professional, experienced people from both within and without our community. It was a considered, cosmopolitan investigation that considered police services across Europe and north America to reach its conclusions. Not one argument was made in rebuttal of the commission's submissions and findings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would develop his argument and explain to us why Professor Shearing, a member of the Patten Commission, wrote in one of his publications that he had considered coldly the question of the administration of justice and the speed with which justice was administered in South African townships. He remarked that necklacing seemed in many ways a more satisfying form of justice than methods that the hon. Gentleman or I would assume proper. Necklacing involves putting a rubber tyre with petrol around someone's neck and setting it alight. Will the hon. Gentleman admit that, however cosmopolitan and broad-minded the commission was-and that remark takes broad-mindedness to its ultimate limit-it might have benefited from local knowledge? On the other hand, such knowledge might have enabled it to do what the hon. Gentleman is doing, which is to take out of sequence the points of the Belfast agreement.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Obviously, I do not approve of necklace murders, but they are not relevant to emblems and flags, so I shall leave aside the issue of enforcing justice by putting burning tyres around people's necks. Discussing that will not support my contribution or help the Committee.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone talked about the service given and the duty performed by the RUC. He will recall that my first comments acknowledged that service and sacrifice, not only by members, but by families and communities. By implication, I acknowledged the award of the George Cross to the RUC for the services that it has given the community in the past 30 years. However, I must emphasise the fact that we are trying to create a new beginning with a different and acceptable police service. The matters to which the hon. Member for West Tyrone referred are in the past, and we are trying to move forwards. His response to my arguments and quotes from Patten was lacking, so it is difficult to respond further.

<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield again adopted a philosophical and almost aloof attitude to Northern Ireland's problems. I do not mean that in a derogatory sense, and perhaps I can explain. Last night, a few miles from my town, hooded gentlemen flying the Union Jack manned a barricade that blocked the main road, yet the police did not intervene. I am not criticising the police, but illustrating the difficulties in a microcosm. The problems are not theoretical. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone mentioned other aspects to the problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not dissent from the proposition by the hon. Member for South Down that a flag can be used to provoke. However, we have only to look along Garvaghy road to see the tricolour used to provoke. That argument is not a good basis for our discussions on the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and the way in which we build on the agreement that the hon. Gentleman and I made two years ago.

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The hon. Gentleman again uses the constitutional position against me, as if I disputed it. As I have twice said, we accept the Good Friday agreement. We virtually sponsored it and we wholeheartedly supported it. The same cannot be said for the Ulster Unionist party. This morning, we heard the dichotomy between the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and for West Tyrone in their support or otherwise for the Good Friday agreement. That agreement made clear the need for a police commission to consider the future of the police service and it anticipated that review and reform would take place. I presumed that the Ulster Unionist party accepted that-certainly, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone did. However, when the review was completed, his party totally rejected it, even though much of what the Patten commission recommended had been articulated by the current Chief Constable of the RUC. That is something (of which) the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone should be fully aware, given that, until recently, he was adviser to the Chief Constable.

<P>
Our experiences are not the same as those of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. He has experienced independence, impartiality, upholding the rule of law and the way to proceed, the identification of the police service with one community and one political aspiration. We want to change our circumstances in Northern Ireland. We must change people's perception, part of which is concerned with the emblem and the flags used by the RUC. The new police service would require different symbols to identify it.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I turn now to the contribution of the hon. Member for West Tyrone. It is amazing that statements can be made in the House that a police service should not be politically neutral and that a neutral police service was humbug. If that was the attitude of the representatives of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, I would shudder for our future. The essential nature of the new institutions is that the forces of law, order and justice are absolutely overt in their dealings. They must be seen to be impartial and any contravention of those concepts should be dealt with publicly, swiftly and effectively. That would eschew any concept of it being humbug to have a neutral police force. To say that a police force should reflect political interpretations is wrong.

<P>
I reaffirm to the Minister that the board should play a part in deciding the issue of flags and emblems in the same way that the Northern Ireland Executive should have the power to deal with flag flying. They have not had time to address such issues, important though they are. The Assembly dealt successfully with the issue of emblems. It took about six months to do so, but we ended up with a symbol for the new Northern Ireland Assembly that is acceptable to all parties that participate in its proceedings, which range from extreme loyalist paramilitaries to extreme republican paramilitaries. That symbol was negotiated and accepted by the Business Committee, whose Presiding Officer was advised by the old committee. The emblem comprises six blue cornflowers, which are symbolic of agriculture and traditional industry in Northern Ireland and represent its six counties.

<P>
The symbol has replaced all the other imperial symbols that were part of the Stormont regime. So why is the Minister certain that the people of Northern Ireland, either their elected representatives or the Policing Board, cannot reach such an agreement, when, as has been illustrated, they have done? Therefore, the terms of our amendments reflect accurately the recommendations of the Patten report and the independent commission. The Government and the Secretary of State have consistently said that they accept, support and will implement the Patten report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the Northern Ireland Police Service adopt a new badge and symbols which are entirely free from any association with either the British or Irish states.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that, on those occasions on which it is appropriate to fly a flag on police buildings, the flag flown should be that of the Northern Ireland Police Service and, it too, should be free from association with the British or Irish states.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendments accurately reflect those quotations. If the Government are sincere in their statements that they support, endorse and will adopt the Patten recommendations, they should have agreed to accept the amendments. They have not done so, which I regret greatly. I shall therefore want to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> If what the hon. Member for South Down says is correct, I did not in any way intend to imply that any member of the police force should not act impartially on all occasions. I was speaking about the police force itself, which cannot be neutral-neither British nor Irish-because it exists in part of the United Kingdom. It is a Crown force, and therefore must represent the state of the United Kingdom. I was not making a comment on the impartiality of any member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, whom we would all expect to act impartially, irrespective of class, creed, or religion, in carrying out his duty. I hope that that is absolutely clear.

Amendment negatived.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not intend to delay the proceedings of the Committee to any great extent, but I will enter one or two caveats to the clause. It deals with the Chief Constable implementing arrangements for co-operation on policing matters between the police in Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana in the Irish Republic. That makes good sense. If I cast my mind back 42 years to 1958, when I was a uniformed reserve officer, I remember the co-operation at that time with the Garda Siochana. Across the frontier, the sergeant in the Irish Republic used to telephone the police station in Northern Ireland to let those of us who were carrying out our duties north of the frontier know where there was danger or potential danger.

<P>
I have on occasions shown my respect and support for much of what the Garda Siochana does. I believe that I have many good and long-established friends in that police force, just as I have in the RUC. However, as in all large bodies, there are people who have not lived up to the general reputation of the force. I will draw attention to two issues that should cause concern and be borne in mind as we consider the co-operation that the clause envisages.

<P>
First, an investigation is taking place into a case in which an officer of the Garda Siochana is believed to have been involved in the murder by the IRA of two police officers: Superintendents Buchanan and Breen. We should recognise that there can be inherent dangers in assuming that co-operation is possible without difficulties and dangers. Secondly, we have read in the past week that the Commissioner of the Garda Siochana has had to institute an inquiry into corruption among up to 70 of its members.

<P>
I do not intend to belittle the Garda Siochana. I believe that it ranks second only to the RUC in the way in which it carries out its duties. However, at a time when it appears that the whole ethos of the RUC is being called into question, I want to register how difficult it is in the modern era for any police force to be pure and whiter than the driven snow. There are significant difficulties particular to Ireland and Northern Ireland; I have alluded to the mafia sub-culture inherited from years of terrorism.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I endorse the idea of co-operation, but I want to draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the inherent difficulties. I have no intention of voting against the clause, but I want him to acknowledge them, not only as they apply to police forces as entities but when forces seek to co-operate. We must not assume that one or the other has some monopoly on techniques, on what is right, or on how they function and serve society.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth)</b> As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, the clause is important to the interests of future arrangements for co-operation between the police in Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana in the Republic of Ireland. On several occasions, he has justifiably mentioned some of his serious concerns about lawlessness in Northern Ireland, including drugs and the control of terrorist activity. He and the hon. Member for West Tyrone also mentioned the availability of weapons. The Committee acknowledges that those are important issues. I know that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will agree that co-operation is an important way to exercise proper controls, but there is more to the matter than that.<P>

<P>
The Patten report made several recommendations in chapter 18 about the strengthening of co-operation between the police on both sides of the border. It advocated an annual conference, a programme of long-term personnel exchanges, structured co-operation in training, joint disaster planning and pooling of investigative teams after major incidents. I know that the hon. Gentleman, with his long experience, will appreciate the significance and possible benefits of that approach. It could be seen as technical, but it will be important. Another suggestion was improved communication systems. If some compatibility could be made between systems, the potential for better policing in some situations would be enhanced.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised two issues, about both of which there would be little disagreement. However, I accept their importance. The first was the conduct of on-going investigations, whether in the Republic or Northern Ireland. Whatever co-operation that the hon. Gentleman believes that there should be and that Patten recommends, none of it should undermine or prejudice the capacity of either police force to carry out appropriate investigations. That principle should hold true, whether in relation to corruption or a criminal investigation. The hon. Gentleman's point was well made and will be well taken by both the Commissioner of the Garda Siochana and the Chief Constable.

<P>
On the second point that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made, he is equally right to hold up the reputation of the RUC and say that any such arrangements should not be understood to be a finger-pointing exercise that suggests that, because of certain factors, the RUC needs to be supervised by another force. That is not what is involved. Almost without exception, in their speeches over the weeks that we have been sitting, members of the Committee have, rightly, defended the bravery, sacrifices and professionalism of the RUC, and the arrangements should not be understood to be a departure from that. They are not.

<P>
We all believe that the RUC is a force of which we can be proud and that the future arrangements that Patten recommends are nothing to do with the reputation of the RUC. They are designed to encourage reconciliation and the conditions under which the police force can be more representative through the people who join it, not to sully the reputation of the RUC.

<P>
The two Governments will take the matter forward using the sensitive and intelligent approach rightly advocated by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Clause 52 requires both the board and the Chief Constable to put in place any arrangements for cross-border co-operation with the Garda Siochana agreed between the British and Irish Governments. In a sense, therefore, a longstop has been provided, in that the two Governments will be heavily involved, as well as the board and the Chief Constable himself.

<P>
Given that that is the nature of the arrangements, the anxieties of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone-he does not want to oppose the clause as a result of them-are well accommodated. It is important that they were raised, and it provided a good opportunity to put on record what we mean in clause 52 and, just as importantly, to say what we do not mean.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am pleased that I have been able to tempt the Under-Secretary down the route that he has taken. His comments were helpful and reassuring. I shall press him further on the phrase ``co-operation on policing matters'', and hope that he will be able to give me some assurances.

<P>
Will co-operation impinge on the autonomy of either our police force or the Garda Siochana? Will the training provision for the police in Northern Ireland-which Patten properly, on this occasion, recommended-take account of the autonomy of our police force? There will be co-operation in terms of accessibility for Northern Ireland policemen in the training centre at Templemore in the Republic and vice versa, at Bramshill-not a place that I hold in the highest regard; hon. Members will have heard me allude to what I call the Bramshill syndrome, which takes policemen off the streets and puts them behind desks to philosophise. That notwithstanding, I should like an assurance that a training facility will be provided for the police in Northern Ireland, as Patten recommended. I get very worried when I see pieces of paper being passed in various directions concerning that issue, which is of huge importance. The police should be looking for an appropriate site for that new training depot, somewhere near the end of the M1 motorway. The Minister will understand why I said that-but I have not chosen that site only because it is in my constituency; it is time that policing in Northern Ireland was seen not to be centred wholly in the east of the province. What better inducement to the community than to bring the training depot to the end of the M1 motorway, or within easy access of it? That would provide access for both traditions in a much more meaningful way than anything else that I can think of.

<P>
Let me qualify all my reservations by saying that I have seen members of the Garda Siochana coming to the RUC conference in significant numbers year after year. I would not want that buddy-buddy or professional link impaired in any way, but we must ensure that the autonomy of the police in Northern Ireland is not sacrificed for any political reason as we pursue professional co-operation across the frontier.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman-in agreement, perhaps, with the Government-encourage and support the lateral entry of officers and other personnel from the Garda Siochana to the new police service? Will he also encourage the establishment of liaison and liaison officers in the border areas of which he is a representative? Will he encourage long-term exchanges between the Garda Siochana and the new police service in Northern Ireland? Will he endorse my aspiration that the Government, together with the Government of the Republic of Ireland, should sign up to an agreement as soon as possible?

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thought earlier that there was an inferred criticism of the number of questions that I managed to get into an intervention on the hon. Gentleman, but I think that he has surpassed my efforts on this occasion. He need have no fear, however. I have always believed that it was necessary to have professional co-operation at every level between the two police forces on either side of the frontier. I have encountered no professional difficulty with that. None the less, there have been real difficulties, although I do not want to revisit the sad instances when they have occurred.

<P>
I have already made it clear that co-operation must be underpinned by the assurance that the Northern Ireland police service will be autonomous and will have its own police training facilities for officers at every level. So long as autonomy is ensured, I have no difficulty with interchange.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised two issues. The first is his desire for reassurance on the autonomy of the new police force. He is right to seek such reassurance. The force will remain under the control and direction of the Chief Constable and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that co-operation, not the co-policing of Northern Ireland, is what we are talking about. The Chief Constable's role is the key to autonomy. As to the training college, we are already looking into possible locations. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's observations on suitable sites, which, perish the thought, could not possibly be special constituency pleading. The hon. Gentleman's points are well noted, but I cannot provide any cast-iron assurance about the location of the training college.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Will the Minister respond to a question posed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which did not receive a positive response? The question was about the lateral entry from Garda Siochana to the RUC and vice versa; the appointment of officers in border areas; and the long-term exchange scheme. Finally, have the Government made progress towards achieving agreement-under Patten-with the Republic of Ireland on the implementation of these policies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> There is continuing dialogue with the Republic of Ireland about all aspects of the Bill and, indeed, of the Patten report. An appointment has been made with the specific purpose of examining implementation. We are ambitious about the implementation of Patten and the Bill, as are our colleagues in the Republic of Ireland. Much effort will be put into making progress.

<P>
On lateral entry, my hon. Friend the Member for South Down must have misread my intentions: I was not about to sit down, but to address that very point, which had been raised in an intervention on the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. We support Patten's recommendation 119 on lateral entry. Patten also acknowledged the importance of other aspects of recruitment. Achieving the right balance in the new police force will mean not just attracting new people generally, but looking around the rest of the United Kingdom and southern Ireland for people, perhaps serving police officers, who may find the police service in Northern Ireland an attractive possibility in the new circumstances. That would be a useful way to augment the existing high skill levels, while making the police service more balanced and representative of the different traditions and communities. People from more than one tradition would have something to contribute. Some people who have served in forces in England and Scotland have returned to Northern Ireland, perhaps on promotion. I doubt that there would be disagreement about such matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> For the record, the Patten recommendation referred to was 159, not 119.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for correcting me. However, recommendation 119 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The agency should advertise beyond Northern Ireland, in the rest of the United Kingdom and in the Republic of Ireland.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Either my hon. Friend needs a visit to the optician, or he misunderstood me-

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If my hon. Friend will allow me to finish, I shall give way in a moment.

<P>
Recommendation 119 makes it clear that we should recruit in the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend points out that recommendation 159 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there should be a programme of long-term personnel exchanges<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Recommendations 127 and 128 both refer to recruitment, 128 referring specifically to lateral entry, a matter that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down raised.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> My approach to the matter of co-operation is realistic. I would not want the hon. Member for South Down to gild the lily of what I said. Of course, I can see the possibility of police who belong to other forces serving with the RUC; however, I would be slightly suspicious, and wonder what was intended, if there were 500 recruits from county Kerry. That is one reason why I emphasise the autonomy of the RUC. I would be worried if every assistant chief constable had been transferred from the Garda Siochana as there is no tradition of such transfers. There may be circumstances in which an officer would wish to join the RUC, but as far as I am aware-the Minister will alert me to it-there is no provision in the Bill for an officer from the Garda Siochana to become an officer in the RUC in the same way as an officer from Kent or Surrey. That is not to preclude the possibility of temporary attachments, but I was alerted by the hon. Member for South Down using the expression ``long term''. I am sorry for making such a long intervention, but it is an important matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Patten talks about ``encouraging'' such measures. That is important, as without encouragement they tend not to happen. Provision can be made in the arrangements between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland but that is not in the Bill. It may be unwise of me but I shall speculate that it is unlikely that anyone could be involved in a transfer without fundamental retraining, as there are differences in the approach to policing and in how the two forces are, and will be, constituted. Transfer would not, therefore, be an easy matter.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone did not rule out the possibility that, some time in the future and with the right retraining, the Chief Constable could be recruited from the Republic of Ireland, although that seems unlikely. However it could not be ruled out as an absolute, never-will-happen possibility.

<P>
With those assurances, and before I am tempted along other highways and byways-

<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Will the Minister make it clear that this is about co-operation only and is not the thin end of the wedge to integration?

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I said earlier that it was about co-operation, not about the co-policing of Northern Ireland. I am happy to repeat that assurance for the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I am anxious that there are issues of substance that have not been properly aired. The implementation notes on recommendations 127 and 128 suggest that the Government are much more positive about relationships with the Garda Siochana. They mention lateral entry, head hunting, secondment and so on, stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government welcomes efforts to address under-representation of Catholics in the police service. It accepts that ``head-hunting'', lateral entry and secondments all have a positive role to play.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend understated the extent to which Patten and the Government's implementation notes commit us to being much more positive about the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not know why my hon. Friend has the impression that I am not enthusiastic about the arrangements, as I am. As he rightly said, and for the record, the Government accept in principle, and welcome, efforts to address under-representation of Catholics in the police service. We accept that head hunting, lateral entry and secondments all have a positive role to play. Appointments would have to be on merit; the privacy of those who are likely to be approached and the integrity of relationships with other organisations must also be respected. If my confirming those words gives my hon. Friend a nice warm glow before we retire for lunch, I am happy to confirm them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It was not my intention to create a difficulty with the clause, but it is of huge importance to the morale of the RUC that the Minister responds as clearly as possible to the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone. I talked about autonomy; my hon. Friend talked about the thin end of a wedge towards integration. We cannot be clearer than that.
