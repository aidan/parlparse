<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">128
</b><a name="090129100000161"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Thank you, Sir
Nicholas. Good morning. I should like to put my questions in two parts:
part 1 on policing and part 2 on sex offences. Ms Chakrabarti, I read
your submission with interest. To kick off on policing, why are you so
critical of the provisions giving the Association of Chief Police
Officers a right to nominate to the senior appointments panel and of
the power of ACPO when it comes to sitting at the national table in the
tripartite structure? In fact, you want a deletion of its role. Could
you explain your
concerns?</div><a name="090129100000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> This is not in any sense a concern about
having senior police officers involved in this kind of process. It is a
concern about the nature of the creature called ACPO. There is no clear
purpose for ACPO. It is not a creature of statute. It is a private
company. It is exempt from freedom of information legislation. It has
no clear defined role in our constitution. In practice, it seems to
have developed over the years to be a range of different animals.
Sometimes it appears to be a campaigning pressure group in very
sensitive, sometimes party political, debates about new police powers.
Sometimes it seems to be something akin to a public body that issues
guidance&#151;for example, on very sensitive police power matters.
Sometimes it seems more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>like a staff association for chief police officers, who obviously need
to communicate with each other and share expertise and
experience.</div><a name="090129100000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a need for all those functions, but we think there is a real concern
about ACPO being all those things. In particular, it has become one of
the most powerful policing organisations in the land and it is not a
creature of statute. Parliament has never taken the opportunity
properly to define its role. It is possible that its roles cannot all
live in one body and it is time to grip the issue and decide that it
perhaps is a number of different bodies&#151;some that are properly
regulated by statute and others that are a matter for the police
themselves to organise as a staff association or pressure group. It is
dangerous, therefore, to give it further power without taking the
opportunity to define what it is and what its role should be in modern
policing.</div><a name="090129100000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000162"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I will stay in order, Sir Nicholas, because part
1 of the Bill is entitled &#147;Police Reform&#148;. Therefore,
Liberty&#146;s observations, which I think are noteworthy, go to the
heart of the tripartite structure, but I notice, Ms Chakrabarti, that
you have not taken the opportunity to lay down any amendments. Is that
because you do not want to start unpicking the tripartite structure as
such? You are saying that there are certain functions that you do not
think ACPO, as currently constituted, should be involved in, such as
senior appointments. Would that be a fair
summation?</div><a name="090129100000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> Absolutely right, sir. We do not take
principled objection to the tripartite structure, but we do have
concerns about the role of a modern police force in a modern democracy.
We see it as a vital agency that serves the rule of law, rather than
serving the Executive at local or central level. Ultimately, the police
are servants, in a way, of the statute book. Through the statute book,
you and your colleagues here communicate directly with each police
constable doing their job in the land, and through the statute book you
also, hopefully, communicate clearly with people who are helped and,
sometimes, rightly hindered by the police. That is in the best
traditions of policing in this country. ACPO may well have a role, but
its current role has just developed without the proper intervention of
Parliament. It is a creature that has grown up organically. It is a
company that largely regulates itself, but at the same time is given
more and more statutory
power.</div><a name="090129100000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000163"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> ACPO has an interesting governing structure. When
you look at its website and speak to its members, it does lots of
things that many people would not think that it does. I shall move on
from that. Clause 11 gives new powers to Ministers to make directions,
and I note that you fear that that centralisation could lead to
unwelcome politicisation. Let me put the counter to that, the case for
the clause and something that Liberty might like. It would give
Ministers the power, for instance, to direct that there could be, as
suggested in Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s interim report, a national suite
of forms for the police, with minimum reporting requirements, so there
would be a standardised set of forms across the country; saving police
time and creating clarity for defence counsel, and lawyers generally,
to rationalise the system. The only way in which that can be
done  is through centralised control. That would not be
politicisation. What objection would you have if the power were used to
have a national suite of forms?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div><a name="090129100000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> There would not be an objection to that
use. All or most broad powers in statute are capable of good and bad
use. Our point here is a general fear about Executive power over
policing, rather than parliamentary legislative power, for example, or
other types of power over the police. We think that there has been too
much Executive control of policing in recent years and we would like to
see that tide turned. Anita Coles might have something to add on
that.</div>
<a name="090129100000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> This allows the Secretary of State to direct
just one police force to do something. That raises the potential for
the Executive to impose its will on one police force only, where there
may be questions about whether it is performing well. This is a
potential problem that we wish to raise.</div>
<a name="090129100000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000164"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> May I turn to part 2 and the issues relating to
sex offences and prostitution? Mr. Lodder, on the new
offence of paying for sexual services of a prostitute controlled for
gain, we have already heard quite a bit of concern about the drafting
and whether as drafted it would be enforceable in an effective way.
Could you give us your views, as an esteemed lawyer, on what the
profession thinks about how those words will be interpreted in
practice, and how the police will interpret
them?</div><a name="090129100000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I will give you my views&#151;whether as an
esteemed lawyer or not, I do not know.</div>
<a name="090129100000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129100000165"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Forgive my editorialising.</div>
<a name="090129100000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> Our concern is that, first and foremost, this
is creating what we call a strict liability offence, so it matters not
what the man&#151;as we shall assume it is for these
purposes&#151;knows when he enters into a transaction of this sort.
Even if he were to make inquiry as to whether the prostitute is in fact
being controlled for gain, he would not be acquitting himself of any
charge. The nature of this type of relationship is such that it would
be impossible, even if one was to pursue an inquiry, to discover
whether the person was controlled for gain, so one can understand the
rationale behind making it a strict liability offence.</div>
<a name="090129100000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty, it seems to us, is that inconsistencies are created, for
example, by the fact that the offence is not limited to commission
within this jurisdiction. There are inconsistencies in the sense that
if one were to go to a country where prostitution is legal, such as the
Netherlands, one would still be committing an offence in this country.
It seems to us that that sort of inconsistency is an undesirable
feature in a piece of legislation in the type of world in which we now
live. Moreover, the purpose behind this would appear to be to try to
reduce prostitution. We are not convinced that this is necessarily the
best way in which to go about it. It is a very heavy-handed way of
doing it. Is the real objective here to stop prostitution, or not? Is
it a question of saying that if you pay for sex then that must be
criminalised, or is it&#151;as this is&#151;an attempt to try to
get to those who are behind prostitutes? Our fear is that we will not
achieve either of those things because of the way in which the clause
is currently
phrased.</div><a name="090129100000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concerns are that individuals will be convicted without knowing what
they are involved in. Alternatively, this will not lead to any
prosecutions because the information will not come to light. Bear in
mind that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>this is the source of income for the prostitutes concerned. In those
circumstances, we feel that at the very least there should be an
element of intentional knowledge or belief on the part of the person
who would be prosecuted under this
clause.</div><a name="090129100000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000166"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Evidentially, would not that intent be very
difficult to
show?</div><a name="090129100000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I think it would, but the trouble with the
offence as it is now is that although it would be, in one sense, easy
to prove because of the strict liability nature, we run the risk of
creating the inconsistencies that I have already pointed out. Moreover,
if prostitutes know what is happening, they are very unlikely to give
the sort of information that will lead to a
prosecution.</div><a name="090129100000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000167"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> May I ask Ms Chakrabarti for her thoughts on that
same
question?</div><a name="090129100000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> I have little to add to the Bar Council.
We are concerned about prostitution. If you are a human rights
advocate, you take no joy in the idea that people should be bought and
sold for money, but one has to take great care in this area to ensure
that use of the criminal law is helping the problem and not making it
worse. We share the concerns about an offence that is unclear as to
whether it is an offence that is banning prostitution, or
whether&#151;as it would appear on its face&#151;it is about
attempting, laudably, to tackle the pimps, the traffickers and the
controllers of women. If that is what you seek to do, strict liability
is difficult. I do not just mean from the point of view of the punters.
It is not just about fairness and arbitrary results against the
customer. If you seek to protect women from pimps, traffickers and
controllers, you need to impose some kind of obligation on punters to
take some care as to who the woman is and what the circumstances are.
If it is strict liability, you do not do that.</div>
<a name="090129100000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also have
real concerns about the closure orders, and the dangers of making women
and their children and families more vulnerable, rather than protecting
them.</div><a name="090129100000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1347</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000168"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> We all know about the problems with strict
liability, but if we do not use strict liability because it is
difficult to work, how would Liberty draft an alternative clause that
imported some notion of intent on the part of the man? In other words,
let us talk about this Bill and trying to make it better. Could you
with all your skills&#151;and the Bar Council as well&#151;draft an
alternative clause that would import some notion of intent to get away
from strict
liability?</div><a name="090129100000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> To be clear about my position, I do not
know whether an offence per se is the right way to protect vulnerable
women.</div>
<a name="090129100000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129100000169"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Let us assume
that.</div><a name="090129100000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> If there is to be an offence, those who
draft criminal offences have various choices to make about what element
of intention there should be. At one end of the scale, an offence such
as this would include intention in all aspects&#151;an intention to
pay for sex, and full knowledge about the personal circumstances of the
woman concerned, which is difficult to prove. You have made that point.
Short of full intention, there is also recklessness, where you were
reckless as to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>circumstances of the woman. Short of recklessness, there is negligence,
where a reasonable person would have believed that the woman in
question was being controlled. At the other end of the scale, you have
the present offence, which is strict liability. I say to you as
legislators that all those options of intent are always available to
you when creating a new criminal
offence.</div><a name="090129100000040"></a>

135</b><a name="090129100000170"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): We have spoken to
a number of sex workers&#151;I certainly have&#151;over the past
two weeks who have chosen to be sex workers as their way of life. That
is what they want to do. You went on to talk about the closure orders
and what you felt they would do. Will not some of the measures laid
down in the Bill further impinge on the rights of those women to carry
out their trade? I was trying to think of a way of putting it, but that
is how they describe it, as carrying out their trade. Should we not be
moving the emphasis of the Bill? Could it not be drafted to move the
emphasis away entirely from the women? I am thinking of the closure
orders and the issue of the three meetings. We have heard from sex
workers that many will not and do not want to attend&#151;they regard
it as coercion. They would like more in the way of voluntary help and
assistance, if they could have it, but they do not want to attend the
meetings or to have closure orders. Do they not have rights as
well?</div><a name="090129100000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> My experience of non-custodial
sentences, not just in the context of prostitution, but in that of
probation, community service and so on for a whole range of offenders,
is that such orders work best when those subject to them want to
comply. That is even more the case when talking about engagement and
addressing why it is a person is offending, and what they might do
instead of offending. When talking about something akin to counselling
or training, in my experience those sort of activities work best when
there is an element of voluntary
engagement.</div><a name="090129100000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
said, to be honest most sex workers do not choose&#151;in the sense
that I chose my work or you chose yours. Some may, and no doubt you
have spoken to them, but my view is that it is not a free choice for
most of the women that I have met, in the sense of really having a
choice in their economic, family or social circumstances. If there is
to be sentencing of women and it is to involve counselling and so on, I
would prefer to see that the person had consented, as part of the
condition of making the order. I much prefer this type of order to
custody, fines or some of the traditional disposals that send a woman
straight back out on to the
street.</div><a name="090129100000043"></a>

136</b><a name="090129100000171"></a><b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): I have concerns about
the phrase &#147;controlled for gain&#148; because, from what we
have heard in previous evidence, there will be circumstances in which
women in a brothel would be happy with that arrangement, because it is
a safer way of operating their trade. Technically, they are in control
of the gain, because there is someone there answering the telephone and
sorting it all out. So, while the Government&#146;s intention to
tackle trafficking is entirely laudable and desirable, the catch-all
&#147;controlled for gain&#148; will be more likely to attack or
cause a problem for the better forms or organisation of prostitution.
Is there another phrase that could be used, Mr. Lodder,
other than &#147;controlled for gain&#148;, which could get the
traffickers rather than the blanket?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="090129100000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I cannot provide a phrase at the moment, but
I would be very happy to think about it after this session and assist
you if I possibly can. The phrase you have lighted upon is undoubtedly
a difficulty because it is so broad. The ramifications are that, where
people come together as a collective so that they may conduct their
trade in safe and comparatively secure surroundings, with the interest
being mutual gain rather than the advantage in the way that we perceive
it&#151;in terms of traffickers, pimps and so forth&#151;with the
advantage residing with the workers themselves, there is a danger
there, I entirely agree with you. That is the consequence of what is
rather loose drafting. I would like to think about that, if I may. If
it is helpful to you, we will make some submission with that very much
in mind.</div>
<a name="090129100000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back
to the early point made by Mrs. Dorries, there is a
difficulty, when you consider the range of people who may be said to be
prostitutes. Depending on your definition of the word, a prostitute it
is someone who provides sexual services for some form of reward.
Exactly how you categorise that can become rather difficult. There are
people who make observations about people who are content with going
out for the evening on the basis that they will have a jolly evening.
There will be a payback at the end of the evening, but they are
prepared to go through that for the benefit of the night out. At the
other end of the spectrum, there are people who deliberately go on to
the streets to have sex with the first person who turns up on the basis
of the simple handing over of money. To find a happy medium which is
susceptible to statutory analysis in this way is difficult. It becomes
even more difficult when you talk about, as you did, a number of people
who have said, &#147;This is what we choose to do,&#148; assuming
that that is a genuine expression on their part. We are concerned that
these clauses will impinge upon a lawful and consensual&#151;so far
as they are concerned&#151;trade.</div>
<a name="090129100000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
objective here to stop prostitution? Is it to stop punters, and
therefore stop prostitution? Or is it to stop those people who
manipulate women and, therefore, do not involve the women whom you are
talking about, assuming for the moment that they are plying their trade
in a way that means that they are not being manipulated? It may be that
there is not that distinction. They may be happy, in reasonable terms,
to work in that way, knowing that they are manipulated. A lot of
people, in their ordinary, lawful, workplaces, feel that they are being
manipulated, but it is a job that they consent to
do.</div>
<a name="090129100000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger in looking to frame legislation with a small group in mind. My
impression is that the vast majority of women who work in this trade do
not do so in the sort of spirit that you have indicated that some of
the people you have in mind do.</div>

138</b><a name="090129100000174"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD):May I start with some questions
for Liberty? You object to the clauses in the Bill that give the Home
Secretary power to direct different police forces to do certain things,
so you seem to be saying that the relationship between police
authorities is okay as it is now. You also object to clauses in the
Bill that require police authorities to take into account the views of
local people because you say in the briefing that you provided on
Second Reading that the mechanisms already exist for that. You seem to
be arguing that the system is perfect as it is and the police are
perfectly accountable in a balance between the Government and the
people.</div>
<a name="090129100000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> Obviously I do not agree with that
analysis of our position. The system is far from perfect as it is, but
we are not convinced that perfection will be achieved or even come
closer to being achieved by some aspects of the Bill. The objection to
the rather vague and general duty to consult the people is not because
the people are not important, but who are the people, in real practical
terms, for the purpose of the consultation? When you create statutory
duties you need to be clear about what is involved. The provision could
lead to legal challenge, if the people do not feel adequately
consulted. We prefer, in relation to that aspect of local democratic
involvement, the police authorities model.</div>
<a name="090129100000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to the Home Secretary directing constabularies, we have a real concern
that that is potentially direct Executive control of a chief constable.
Of course it could be used in a perfectly laudable case in which
something needed to be done and the Home Secretary would sweep in and
do it; but it could also be used in ways that are less benign. That is
the point about creating broad powers for Executive direction of
policing in a country with one of the strongest and most robust
democratic police traditions. I do not need to give the Committee a
history lesson on the origins of policing in this country, springing
from the citizenry and closely linked to the magistracy. From the
outset the police were servants of the rule of law, rather than
servants of government&#151;local or
national.</div>

young people. Will you elaborate on
that?</div><a name="090129100000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> We have a problem with the way the provisions
are drafted. We do not think that targeting young people in that way is
helpful. There is the power to remove children under the age of 16, if
they are in possession of alcohol, to their place of residence or a
place of safety. There are already powers that allow police to move
children on in certain circumstances, and there are already criminal
offences and public order offences that would apply in those instances.
We do not see that it is necessary to increase the powers of the police
to act in that way&#151;or that it is helpful.</div>
<a name="090129100000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to
criminalising children who are in possession of alcohol on three or
more occasions in a 12-month period, we do not see that that will help
to solve the problem. If there is a problem, and it seems there may be,
it is a child protection issue. It is not a matter for the
criminalisation of children. Putting them in the criminal justice
system for possessing alcohol does not assist in reaching the intended
objective.</div>

using it&#151;is also part of the over-broad, unnecessary process by

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000176"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> On Tuesday when we took evidence, particularly
from the police, a defence that emerged was that they would not be
criminalising young people at random for possessing alcohol three times
in a year in a public space, because they would be getting the hardened
characters, rather than anyone at random. By definition those random
cases would not crop up three times in the same
area.</div><a name="090129100000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> I think that, yes, it is illegal for a 16 or
17-year-old to be drinking, so they should not be drinking, but the
reality is that a lot do. That does not make them criminals, in the
sense that we would think of it; three times in one year is not
actually that much. It does not seem that this will help with the
problem of teenage
drinking.</div><a name="090129100000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000177"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I want to turn to the Bar Council and the issue of
the proceeds of crime. On Tuesday, we took evidence, in particular,
from the police, who put forward a very convincing argument for why
they need more powers to seize assets from major criminals whom they
are investigating, because many assets disappear over the one, two or
three-year period that an investigation takes to reach its conclusion.
You expressed some doubts about those
provisions?</div><a name="090129100000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Evans:</b></i> The restraint provisions in the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 permit all assets of somebody who is either under
investigation or later a defendant in criminal proceedings to be
restrained. That is subject to the scrutiny of a judge. The new
proposed powers suggest that items of property can be detained pending
a prosecution and, ultimately, a confiscation order. The drawback of
the restraint-based system is that, although a person is restrained by
the court from disposing of property, assuming that an order had been
made, it does not prevent an individual from disposing of that
property&#151;it simply exposes him to punishment by way of
proceedings for contempt. The police&#146;s concern, therefore, is a
real and reasonable one.</div>
<a name="090129100000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
system puts the onus of preserving the assets on the person suspected
of committing a serious crime. The Bar Council has no objection to the
principle that, in effect, personal assets&#151;cars, jewellery or
household effects, and other such things&#151;could be detained under
this power. The Bar Council&#146;s particular concern is that there
is the scope for a lower tier of de facto restraint order not subject
to the scrutiny of a judge where an application could be made to the
magistrates court for particular items of property to be detained, and
possibly for a very long time. It appears that the intention is that an
application would be made where property is detained, under the new
search and seizure powers, either for a restraint order, which would
come before a judge in the Crown court, or to vary an existing
restraint order, for which there is a 48-hour time limit. The proposal
permits, on an application to the magistrates, the property to be
detained indefinitely. That is a concern, because, as I said, it
introduces a lower tier.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="090129100000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
Bar Council is concerned, there is no particular evidence that the
restraint system, per se, is not working. Scrutiny by a judge is
important in our submission on this area, because we are dealing not
necessarily with the proceeds of crime. It might be that the individual
is suspected of having committed a crime, but the proposals would
cover, for example, a family heirloom. It would cover jewellery handed
down through generations, in respect of which there could be no
possible or realistic claim that it is or represents the proceeds of
crime. However, it might be an asset that ultimately, should a
confiscation order be made, would be available for the satisfaction of
that confiscation order. At the moment, there is a balance between
retaining the property by way of a restraint order and permitting the
individual to enjoy the use of it pending the making of that order. In
many cases, of course, there will be no conviction and so no
confiscation order. The concern is that, although that might be a
necessary power, it should be monitored strictly by a judge, rather
than devolved down to the
magistracy.</div>

one phrase. All we need do is define &#147;controlled&#148; and
separate it from &#147;assist&#148; or &#147;organise&#148;.
The English Collective of Prostitutes talked about this on Tuesday.
Even now, apparently, women who are buddies in a flat are being caught
up in the &#147;controlled&#148; aspect. Do we need to go so far as
to find a different phrase, or do we need simply to define what
&#147;controlled&#148; means, and separate it from assistance and
organising? I believe that there has even been an issue with people
organising a rota. Do we need to go so far as to change the wording and
have an additional

147</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000186"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> On alcohol concerns, and the point you have made,
Anita, I took evidence yesterday as chair of the all-party group on
alcohol misuse, and I think that if anyone found a young person aged
between 10 and 15 drunk three times in a year, it would be quite
significant. When you think about the release of figures today in the
new Government document, it is quite significant. If young people are
arrested or moved on, or if there is some form of police intervention,
for want of a better phrase, that will allow early intervention from
alcohol groups across the country. There is an Aquarius-run system in
my constituency, and across Dudley, where young people who have been
arrested are referred straight to an alcohol-concern intervention group
that will work with them. They welcome that intervention, because it is
their best way of connecting with young people with those problems.
There is an alcohol-referral arrest system, and I know that my hon.
Friend the Minister, Vernon Coaker, has had people come and talk to him
about it, and that it has been tremendously successful. I do not think
that we can dismiss how useful it could be to identify young
people&#151;even if it is three times&#151;and refer them to such
services.</div>
<a name="090129100000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> I completely agree with you,
Ms Waltho, that it is a serious matter that so many young
people are drinking, and drinking so much, in Britain today. The
question is whether that should be a criminal justice matter, a child
protection matter or a public health matter. We see it more as the
latter, rather than a criminal justice matter.</div>
<a name="090129100000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two things
follow from that. The first is that, if at all possible&#151;it may
not always be possible&#151;we would like young people&#146;s first
engagement with the state, particularly on matters of their health and
protection, not to be with policemen as babysitters. It is not the
police at their best, and it is not us as a country at our best, if
children are vulnerable, drinking or being neglected by their parents
and the first port of call, and first engagement, is the police.
Sometimes, I agree, that is unavoidable, but it is not the
ideal.</div><a name="090129100000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is that making it an offence would open up prosecution, as
opposed to all the wonderful encounters that you have been describing,
as the statutory course and option. As I said, we do not rule out the
possibility that there will be such occasions under the existing law,
including the law of child protection. The police already have a great
many powers to move on and arrest both adults and children.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="090129100000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally
speaking, Liberty&#146;s approach is that if the problem that you are
trying to address in a particular situation or community is crime and
disorder, the power to arrest on the basis of crime and disorder can be
the same, whether it is an adult or a child. If you feel that you need
additional powers in relation to children, those powers should be
predicated on the child&#146;s vulnerability and the need to protect
them, not an additional antisocial behaviour dispersal/alcohol power
because that person is a child.</div>
<a name="090129100000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why are you
using that power and directing it against a child on such an occasion?
It is for one of two reasons: their bad behaviour&#151;fine, deal
with it&#151;or their vulnerability. Be quite clear in your mind as
legislators what power you need on that occasion, and things follow
from that.</div>
<a name="090129100000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><a name="090129100000187"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I wanted to
take up the point about taking the local community&#146;s views into
account on policing, because some of what you have written
sounds almost counterintuitive. My question is similar to Ms
Waltho&#146;s. Can we, perhaps in a statutory instrument, define what
we mean by taking views into account, or at least give
examples?</div>
<a name="090129100000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
press that point because of my experience of setting police policies in
a local area, particularly on licensing, for example. Police might have
a particular view of what should happen in the area, but the local
community might know more about the local fear of crime and what should
happen to protect public safety. They might know more about the
movements of people in the area and how to protect children from harm,
and can give the police a lot of information that leads them to make a
different decision. That is not to say that police authorities are not
effective or representative, but a lot of the time, there is something
to be gained from taking local community&#146;s views on board.
Rather than throwing out the measure, should we try to define what is
meant by taking views into account, perhaps by listing
examples?</div>
<a name="090129100000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> Yes, I completely agree. Of course there
is a role for consulting local people. I emphasise
&#147;consulting&#148; because it is about consulting, not about
saying, &#147;Who shall we arrest this week? Let&#146;s have a
vote, perhaps on a reality TV show. Shall we let Barabbas go free, or
somebody else?&#148; That is a silly joke, but it is also a serious
point about the rule of law, which cannot always be dealt with by
majority vote at either the national or local level.</div>
<a name="090129100000136"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">None
the less, your point is incredibly important. There needs to be public
confidence at the national and local level. People have local knowledge
about what the problems are. As legislators, if you are creating a duty
to consult the public&#151;and it is a duty that theoretically
therefore should be enforceable and could be litigated on&#151;people
should be able to bring a judicial review if that statutory duty is
ignored. You are completely right that the Bill should be clearer about
what the process of consultation is and who the relevant people are.
That means creating a clear mechanism that sets out what the
consultation involves, which people are to be consulted, and by what
route. The police authority structure is one way of doing that, and
there are all sorts of other things that you could do. However, I do
not think that a vague and broad duty to consult people achieves your
objective.</div>

149</b><a name="090129100000188"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): While it is
fresh in our minds, the point made by Lynda Waltho was that if
&#147;controlled for gain&#148; was better or perhaps more narrowly
defined, the provision would be improved. At the moment, the definition
comes from section 53 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which simply
states, &#147;Controlling...for gain&#148;, then defines gain.
Recently, the case of R <i class="I">v. </i>Massey in the Court of Appeal ruled
that control for gain did not require intimidation, force, coercion,
threat or a fear of any of those things&#151;it went wider than that.
Do you think there is an argument for narrowing the
definition&#151;at least in respect of section 53, but certainly in
the Bill? That would leave a separate, wider definition of child
prostitution, in relation to which organising a diary and all of that
ought to have a wider definition, as opposed to adult prostitution,
which might be quasi-consensual.</div>
<a name="090129100000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> If you make a definition more precise, it is
helpful, because it is clear, but if you narrow a definition, the
objectives of the clause might fall outside that. The thinking behind
the Court of Appeal&#146;s position is not that the definition should
be narrower. If you are suggesting in this proposed legislation that it
should be narrow, you need to think through the ramifications. It may
be that one would like to review the entire phrase, because if the
phrase has a connotation already, you might want to pick a different
phrase so that your objective is achieved. In a sense, that comes back
to the offer that I made earlier&#151;we would like to think about it
and see if we can assist you. I am reluctant to draft on the hoof, as
it were. A great deal of thought goes into these Bills and a momentary
response to your question would probably not be helpful in that
context. Accepting those precepts, it may be a way of dealing with the
issue,

which has an intentional element and does not further define
&#147;controlled for gain&#148;. There is arguably the less serious
issue of something that is not trafficking but is
intimidation&#151;pimping, essentially&#151;and is covered by
&#147;controlled for gain&#148;. Then there is
arguably&#151;certainly the system of penalties in the Bill suggests
this&#151;a less serious offence still of having sex with someone
controlled for gain. It is the latter offence that is strict liability,
and does not require intention. The definition of &#147;controlled
for gain&#148; is, nevertheless, the same as something more serious,
including trafficking and child prostitution. Is the imposition of
strict liability in the least serious offence usual, or unusual, as far
as strict liability is
concerned?</div><a name="090129100000137"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> In general terms, no it is not. Conscious of
the fact it is a strict liability offence, the legislation imposes a
strict liability only where the comparative punishment is to be a lower
one. Obviously, the other examples that you cited are certainly, if
only in moral terms, much more serious offences. If you increase the
strict liability ambit across the more serious offences and therefore
cause people to be convicted of those particular serious offences
without even necessarily attending to the consequences, you bring the
general culture of legislation into potential
disrepute.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000190"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The corollary is that if someone is guilty of this
offence&#151;they particularly want to have sex with someone who is
trafficked, so they know and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>have the intention of doing so&#151;many of the elements of rape are
formed in that case. The penalty, however, is a &#163;1,000 fine. It
seems this offence is not particularly discerning, and does not
differentiate between those people who have an intention and those who
are subjectively reckless as to whether the person is controlled
&#147;in a trafficked way&#148;, as distinct from &#147;mere
pimping&#148;. Do you have a view on
that?</div><a name="090129100000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> This is a broad offence and it tries to
encapsulate a number of different aspects of the problem. If you deal
with it in this way, you get the problems that you have just
highlighted and that is why we are unhappy about it. A way of dealing
with it is to try to break down the objective. For example, if there is
a situation that is more akin to rape, that will be dealt with. If you
are talking about a factual matrix which is more akin to rape, maybe
this is not the legislation under which someone should be prosecuted
anyway. Maybe it should be under sexual offences
legislation.</div>
<a name="090129100000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000191"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> But if neither the prosecutors nor the police
explore intention&#151;if it is not necessary to get a
conviction&#151;potential rapists would not be gone for.</div>
<a name="090129100000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> That is true. That is another danger in
leaving it in its current form.</div>
<a name="090129100000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000192"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not know if Liberty have a view on that but,
in any event, I would like to ask for its view on strict liability
offences in the area of personal conduct, particularly the dangers of
creating a scenario for other offences such as blackmail. If there is
no defence, it seems to me that entrapment and blackmail would thrive,
just as they did to a certain extent when homosexuality was criminal
and there was very little in the way of defence. In certain parts of
the country there was no defence as to, for example, mistaken
age.</div>
<a name="090129100000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> Strict liability offences are
best&#151;and traditionally&#151;suited to minor regulatory matters
where there is little real argument about issues of judgment or
intention and so on. It is just a matter of fact as to whether your
factory was a fit and proper place for people to work and so on. There
are other appropriate examples. Strict liability is a difficult device
in the context of sex offences. As you observed, Dr. Harris, as a
result, the offence necessarily in my view becomes quite limited in its
penalty.</div>
<a name="090129100000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make the
following observation on the basis of your remarks and others from this
Committee. You pointed out how broad the range of conduct and how broad
the range of personal circumstances of the women concerned might be in
the context of the strict liability offence. Mrs. Dorries
told me earlier that she has met a few women&#151;she believes they
are only a few&#151;who say, &#147;It is my trade; I chose it
freely.&#148; Ms Waltho said that the Committee has heard from
collectives of women who band together and protect themselves that
way.</div>
<a name="090129100000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could be
misreading the Minister&#146;s body language, but from the nods and
shakes of his head I understood, rightly or wrongly, that he was not
seeking to attack those women in any sense in this Bill. This opens up
the theoretical possibility, which was also discussed in terms of
control of the gain, of attempting to separate these classes of women
and indeed to separate the issue of people who are being trafficked and
bullied and abused for someone else&#146;s gain as a public policy
objective from those who, rightly or wrongly&#151;it is as old as
time itself&#151;have made a judgment which is, perhaps, a bad 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>and dangerous one. If that is the Committee&#146;s thinking, and
because drafting comes after policy decision making, there are umpteen
ways in which a narrower formulation could be used to make the offence
one that is not a sort of fudge&#151;are we really banning
prostitution or not?&#151;but one that places on those who enter the
trade as customers a serious obligation to think about where the woman
has come from and whether she is being trafficked or abused. That would
not be strict liability, but the corresponding benefit might be a
greater penalty that can flow because it is not strict liability, and
perhaps, therefore, a real public policy benefit, rather than just a
statement and a totem on the statute
book.</div><a name="090129100000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000193"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Bar Council, in one of its briefings, pointed
out that a woman, by offering sexual services, might be assisting in
the commission of the offence and therefore be guilty under the Serious
Crime Act 2007; I think that you cited section 44. However,
intentionality would have to be proved and there are extra defences, I
think, with regard to action that was felt to be reasonable. You
commented, in relation to that, on a double standard and the danger of
extending criminalisation of prostitutes
themselves.</div><a name="090129100000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> Exactly. The objective on the face of the
clause is to reduce, if not to extinguish, the trade by having the
punters as the objective&#151;I mean the trade where there is
somebody behind the prostitute. Our concern is that if one of the
by-products of what you do is to expose the prostitute to an offence
herself, because she will know whether she is being controlled or not,
that is an undesirable by-product

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000194"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Before I hand over to the next
questioner&#151;if there is time, I might come back to closure
orders&#151;I want to ask a non-Bill-specific question about
extradition. There will be other questions, I am sure, on this subject.
Are our extradition laws too wide in respect of the potential at
least&#151;thankfully, this was not shown in the recent Toben
case&#151;for people to be extradited from this country to another
country for a speech offence that is not an offence in this country but
is an offence in the other country, even when that person is a resident
of a third country and the dissemination is mainly not in the country
where it is an offence? Does Liberty have a view on that and whether
the Bill would be a vehicle to seek to narrow the way we implement our
extradition
laws?</div><a name="090129100000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129100000195"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I would suggest that the Bar Council and Liberty
have a comment to make on that question. Peter Lodder
first.</div><a name="090129100000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> I am not an expert on extradition, so I will
defer commenting directly on the point and allow Shami Chakrabarti to
deal with it. Our view in general terms is that there is in principle
an asymmetric relationship in some of the extradition
provisions&#151;&#151;for example, with the United States. We are
concerned about the very low threshold that is currently required to be
met for someone to be extradited to the United States, but beyond our
general principle position, I would not wish to comment at this
stage.</div><a name="090129100000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> We have some very principled and general
concerns about recent extradition  legislation, and Anita has
some specific concerns about the amendments on extradition in the Bill.
First,  the opportunity that the Bill provides in relation
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>extradition has not yet been taken. We have concerns about summary
extradition full stop. We think that, even in circumstances in which
someone will receive Rolls-Royce due process in another friendly
democratic country, being taken from your home, your family, your
country and your language, and legal aid and all the rest, and being
taken to the other side of the world, even if what follows is a very
fair trial in humane circumstances, is a serious matter for an
individual and should not happen without a bare case to answer being
shown in a local court. That is our principal position.</div>
<a name="090129100000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also have
concerns that in this age of globalisation and necessary co-operation
between countries, in the age of the internet, and in the age where
understandably and rightly countries assert criminal jurisdiction over
activities that happen all over the world and in cyberspace, it is
incredibly important that we have provisions in our law that ensure
that judges are able to consider whether Britain is the appropriate
place for someone who lives here as a national or otherwise to be
tried; whether it is in the interest of justice and fairness that they
should be prosecuted here rather than somewhere else.</div>
<a name="090129100000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We suggest
that that should be addressed, and the Bill provides an opportunity to
do it, although the point about speech offences becomes very pertinent
in relation to the internet. It is a live issue in relation to the
European arrest warrant, which we have concerns about. I do not have
the legislation before me, but even given the existing law on the
European arrest warrant, we think it is possible to revise the relevant
schedule to the Extradition Act 2003 so that we do not implement the
European arrest warrant arrangements to extradite people summarily on
speech offences that would not be an offence here. Again, the Bill may
be an opportunity to do a little tidying up that will spare potential
injustice in relation to controversial speech offences in the future. I
think that Anita has a comment to make on what there is in the Bill on
extradition.</div><a name="090129100000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> The real concern we have is about the power in
the Bill for the Secretary of State to give an undertaking to return a
person to a country, either, once they are sentenced&#151;if they are
sentenced in the UK&#151;to serve their sentence in that other
country, or on return. The problem of course with that is that it now
applies to anywhere in the world&#151;any country: failed states and
rogue states. It applies to UK nationals. The only limit is if it would
breach convention rights; but there are obviously other issues, such as
the interests of justice, and other international instruments, such as
the refugee convention, that would be relevant. The statute does not
say what will happen to the undertaking if the person is not able to be
returned.</div>
<a name="090129100000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
concerns as well in relation to the limitation and the Secretary of
State&#146;s undertaking. At the moment the provisions rely on
whether the Secretary of State thinks return would breach the
convention; we think it should be a matter of law whether it would
breach the convention and other international treaties, and would be
contrary to the interests of justice. There is a real potential for
injustice.</div><a name="090129100000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129100000196"></a>The

briefly, not least to
clarify&#151;</div><a name="090129100000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami

Minister.</div>
<a name="090129100000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090129100000198"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):</b> I just want briefly to
clarify something. I am sorry if my body language was so
obvious.</div>
<a name="090129100000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to one of the points made in answer to Nadine Dorries, the
Government&#146;s intention is not to ban prostitution. It is
important to put that on the record. We have never said that a ban was
a policy intention. We looked in Sweden at the idea of a full offence
of paying for sex, and making any payment for sex illegal, and we
thought that was not appropriate; we also looked at other models. It is
not our intention to bring about a ban in a back-door
way.</div><a name="090129100000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention, which I know everyone on the Committee shares, as has been
demonstrated by this morning&#146;s evidence-taking session, which
has explored where we are rather than being confrontational, has been
about how to end exploitation and the exploitative elements, where
there is no free choice. Julie and others raised the question of
&#147;controlled for gain&#148;, and we have lawyers who
say&#151;I am not trying to be funny about it, because Mr.
Lodder has said something on that point&#151;that &#147;controlled
for gain&#148; as defined in case law means what one would regard as
the common-sense definition. It would not be where somebody is helping
somebody else: organising, protecting, looking after them and so on. I
am not a lawyer; that is the legal advice that I have had. Certainly,
it is something that we are looking at. &#147;Controlled for
gain&#148; is a key part of ensuring that we have absolute clarity of
meaning. As the Bill goes through Committee and beyond, we will take up
the points that Julie and others have made and look at them to give
certainty, which will help if the Bill should be passed by
Parliament.</div><a name="090129100000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000199"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Perhaps both Peter Lodder and Shami would like
to come back briefly on that. As the Chair, I do not take part in these
discussions, but we have heard what Mr. Lodder said about
seeking to help the Committee. If he and his colleagues have any
suggestions for draft amendments or on how the Bill might be improved,
that is the purpose of these sessions and this Committee, and I know
that the Committee would be most grateful. I say the same thing to
Shami Chakrabarti. She is an experienced lawyer, and I am merely a
humble politician in the Chair of this Committee. Mr.
Lodder, do you want to reply to Mr. Coaker, the
Minister?</div>
<a name="090129100000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Lodder:</b></i> It is very helpful to hear what the Minister
said about the Government&#146;s intention and the thinking behind
the use of particular phrases. I well understand why the advice has
been given in the way that it has. Of course, all new legislation is an
opportunity to improve. In so far as we can help in that process, we
will.</div>
<a name="090129100000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Shami
Chakrabarti:</b></i> This has been a very pleasurable
Committee. I have been in more antagonistic ones before, and I am
grateful to the Minister in particular for his remarks about intention
and his openness to look again in the light of comments made in this
Committee. In relation to the provisions, including those on
extradition and prostitution, this is not a titanic battle of intention
or policy. It is really about a common cause and attempting to do
something that is better rather than worse. That makes a nice
change.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div><a name="090129100000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
157</b><a name="090129100000200"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I would like to come back
to asset seizure and what might be described as pre-emptive seizure.
One of the arguments put forward is that there is some broad
equivalence between the seizure of assets after arrest and how evidence
might be seized. Do you agree that that concept of broad equivalence is
appropriate?</div>
<a name="090129100000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Evans:</b></i> They are entirely distinct. Hitherto, the
powers of the police and other investigatory bodies have, as you
indicated, been to preserve evidence that may be used in trial. The
existing powers of restraint permit the holder of the property to
continue to enjoy its use and to hold that property pending the making
of any confiscation order.</div>
<a name="090129100000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
proposals will give search and seizure powers permitting items to be
detained that may have nothing whatever to do with the criminal
offence, as I have already indicated. There is a balance to be achieved
between, on the one hand, permitting an individual who has not been
convicted at that stage and ultimately may not even be charged with an
offence at all to enjoy his or her possessions and, on the other hand,
preserving assets pending the making of an order. That is why the Bar
Council and I have expressed the concern that there should be any
devolution of the power to magistrates rather than judges.</div>
<a name="090129100000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
standard to justify a search and seizure is, in colloquial terms, that
there is a risk of dissipation. That is the test applied at the
restraint stage, but of course, as I have said twice now, property at
the restraint stage remains in the hands of the owner, whereas in this
it does not; it is detained. With respect, it is not unreasonable to
suggest that property be detained where it can be shown that there is a
real risk that otherwise someone will get rid of it. You cannot get it
back once it has gone, and the gifting provisions under the
confiscation structure in the Bill have the effect of deeming that
property still to be available, even if it is not, which might have the
desired result that the now convicted defendant has to find the
equivalent value of the gift that he has given way&#151;that which
has gone&#151;but of course that will not actually produce the money.
There are concerns about that
issue.</div><a name="090129100000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern is that the confiscation regime is a value-based one, rather
than one that focuses on the property. Where a confiscation order is
ultimately made by a Crown court judge, the order does not attach to
the property itself, but simply requires the convicted person to pay a
sum of money equivalent, in general terms, to the total value of the
assets. That individual has a choice of how to realise the money. For
example, returning to the family heirloom, if he or she would rather
not have to give up that item, they can raise money another way, if
they are able too&#151;very often, of course, they  are
not.</div><a name="090129100000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
detention provisions represent a shift from that value-based system to
an asset-based one. There are concerns about that, but those would be
ameliorated, at least to some extent, if the matter were in the hands
of a judge, which is what proposed new section 41A would do where there
is already a restraint order or an application is made to vary a
restraint order. It is a balance. The proposal represents a shift from
the current regime. It is an understandable one, but it needs to be
scrutinised with care, which is something that a judge could do. Within
the structure of the restraint orders, the defendant, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>or any third party&#151;sometimes a third party will be the one
concerned about an item being detained&#151;can go back to the court
and make an application to have that order varied or discharged. As far
as the magistrates aspect is concerned, the proposal contains a power
of appeal, but it does not entitle an individual who might be
interested in the property to make representations at the time that the
order is made. That again is of
concern.</div><a name="090129100000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000201"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> One of the explanations given to us,
certainly in evidence this week from the police, is that the proposal
is a tidying-up exercise and that case law has exposed certain areas
where criminals have managed to get round the legislation and frustrate
the intent. One of the areas of focus, certainly of previous recovery
and seizure legislation, was in connection with convention rights under
the Human Rights Act 1998 and the way in which they needed
to be looked at and interpreted in the context of that legislation. Can
you give any insight on the case law in this area? Equally, how would
you view the human rights connotations impacting on some of the
provisions that you have talked about and that, of course, are in this
Bill?</div><a name="090129100000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Evans:</b></i> The concern is about an individual&#146;s
entitlement to enjoy the protection of their possessions under article
1 of the first protocol. The courts have, hitherto, where they have had
to deal with arguments in the restraint and confiscation field, come to
the conclusion that the statutory regime is proportionate, because
there is a reasonable degree of proportionality between the intention,
which is to preserve property pending the making of a confiscation
order, and the person&#146;s entitlement to enjoy that property,
because of course he might not be convicted. In some cases,
particularly where an order is applied for when somebody is
investigated, where the case involves, for example, allegations of
serious fraud, the order may be in place for considerably longer than a
year. It is not uncommon for the order to be in place for 12 months, 18
months or two years in these situations. Where the person continues to
have the property, the article 1 rights are not infringed, or at any
rate, the infringement is proportionate.</div>
<a name="090129100000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give an
example of a car, it may or not be part of the prosecuting
authority&#146;s allegation that it has something to do with the
crime, but assume, for the present that it does not. The individual
could be deprived of that car, and the use that he or she gets from it,
for a long time because there is a risk that the car might be sold in
the meantime. It is certainly going to engage article 1 concerns more
than they have been hitherto because of the shift from the individual
retaining it subject to the court&#146;s
order.</div>
<a name="090129100000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000202"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The view being put forward is that these
convention rights do not apply. Are you suggesting that it may not be
as straightforward as
that?</div><a name="090129100000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Evans:</b></i> I do not think it would be as straightforward
as that.</div>
<a name="090129100000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000203"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Ms Chakrabarti or Ms Coles, do you
have anything to add in this area, in terms of the human rights issues,
the impact of these provisions and safeguards that you may wish to
see?</div><a name="090129100000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> We have to remember that people under this
have not been convicted of any offence at this point in time. The
thought of whether or not they have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>benefited from their criminal offence is on the balance of probabilities
and not on the criminal standard. So people may go on to be acquitted
of any charge. Their property may have been taken away from them for a
considerable period of time and they are not guilty of any offence. One
of the big concerns we have here is that it will be extended to apply
when someone has been arrested, but not even charged, with an offence.
The property can then be taken from them, so that the first and second
conditions relate to arrest rather than to charge. The only other point
to note, is that there are article 8 privacy rights, in terms of
property. Courts have found that that is an issue that is engaged. So
the right to private life and the home is something that also needs to
be considered if taking away personal property and possessions that do
not necessarily affect just the potential offender but also their
families.</div>

161</b><b class="B"><a name="090129100000204"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It has been explained as a tidying up
exercise. Do you share that
view?</div><a name="090129100000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Anita
Coles:</b></i> I think it goes a bit further than just
tidying up. It is giving new powers and more explanation is needed as
to why that is necessary. The explanatory notes talk about having a
code of practice to ensure that the exercise of the powers is conducted
appropriately. I do not think that it is appropriate that monitoring
that should be left to this sort of secondary mechanism. Parliament
should consider the matter carefully before giving extra
powers.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="090129100000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Martin
Evans:</b></i> The Bar Council&#146;s view is that several
clauses within the Bill represent a great deal more than merely tidying
up. It would be wrong to characterise it as simply sorting out problems
that have arisen in practice. One final example with regard to cash
detention is that it is proposed that a forfeiture order can be made on
the application by an officer. It would be for the person whose cash it
was, from whom it has been taken, to prove to the civil standard that
the cash was not either recoverable property or intended for use in
unlawful conduct. That reverses the burden of proof and puts it on the
person from whom the money has been taken. With respect, that does not
represent tidying up; it is a
change.</div>
