								Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Welcome back,
Mr. Gale. As I was saying, new clause 3 would require the
Secretary of State to report to Parliament every financial year on how
the Government have used the revenue saved by abolishing contracting
out and, in particular, how that money has been used to encourage a
culture of savings in this country. Amendment No. 37, tabled by the
Liberal Democrats, is along much the same lines. I am happy to endorse
much of what the hon. Member for Yeovil has said. New clause 3 is
essentially a probing amendment. We will listen to what the Minister
has to say in response.</div>
					<a name="07020141000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I conclude, I should
just like to reiterate my plea to the Minister for a clear explanation
of how the contracting-out rebate figure moved within the space of
under a year from &#163;4 billion down to &#163;1.6 billion. Were a
company listed on the stock exchange to come out with such a massive
variation in financial forecast it could have its shares suspended and
the directors would probably be hauled before the stock exchange board
to account for themselves. I am sure that all members of the Committee
are waiting with bated breath to hear what explanation the Minister can
give us on that point.</div>

							<a name="07020141000286"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (James Purnell):
						</b> Thank you,
Mr. Gale. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
this afternoon. I hope that I can answer the points raised by the hon.
Members for South-West Bedfordshire and for Yeovil to their
satisfaction. We have had accusations of mis-selling and of companies
being suspended on the basis of these figures. The rather more prosaic
truth is that the figures on which we base our assumptions change, so
the resulting projections change. I will seek to explain that; if the
hon. Gentleman remains unconvinced, I am sure that he will press his
amendments
ruthlessly.</div>
					<a name="07020141000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
core of the debate is the abolition of contracting out for
defined-contribution schemes, which we announced in the White Paper in
May. That was one of the key recommendations of the Turner Commission.
In principle the view is shared across both Opposition
parties&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am getting a nod of assent from
the hon. Member for Yeovil. He said earlier that he did not think that
tax relief made any difference to overall pension saving. I think that
was the implication of what he was saying. We look forward to his
seminar on that
subject.</div>

							<a name="07020141000287"></a>Andrew

morning.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000288"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> It is hard to know when one is not in a seminar
with him. Life is one long
seminar.</div>
					<a name="07020141000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We took the
approach of abolishing contracting out because we essentially agree
with the Pensions Commission that it was making decisions for people
too complex. The system was understood by few people, especially in
defined-contribution schemes, and overall, rather than helping to
support saving for a pension, it may have been discouraging it. Clause
15 and schedule 4 seek to achieve this abolition, and amendments that
we have already agreed provide a regulation-making power to remove or
vary the rules on protective
rights.</div>
					<a name="07020141000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
interest in the effect of abolishing contracting out on the national
insurance rebate, so it is important that we should be able to discuss
that now. We have already covered the fact that the abolition of
contracting out would mean that more people build up rights in the
state second pension, and that takes the form that we were discussing
earlier. Therefore, the first answer to the question put by the hon.
Member for Yeovil is that it will be broadly financially neutral.
People who withdraw from contracting out are building up future rights
in the state second pension and therefore those are set at a broadly
actuarially neutral basis. That is the point that the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare was making.</div>
					<a name="07020141000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the debate, which has
been based on the assumption that there was a huge saving here is
incorrect, because any reduction in the cost of the contracted-out
rebate is paid for later through increases in S2P obligations. The way
that this will operate in practice is that from the date of abolition,
contracting out will cease to be available for schemes that contract
out on a defined-contribution basis. The members of such schemes will
begin to build up state second pension. Contracting out will continue
to be allowed for schemes that contract out on a defined-benefit basis.
That is the answer that I tried to give the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 254</div>Member for Yeovil on the quinquennial review, but there were two
slightly separate points. One was our proposal for twinning the date
for the earnings link with that for abolishing contracting out for DC.
The other is when the next quinquennial review will happen. That
continues to be relevant, even if we abolish defined-contribution
contracting out, because that review will set the terms for
defined&#151;benefit contracting out. So, that process continues to
be relevant and those issues are quite
separate.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07020141000289"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Has the Minister considered the
practical issues of having such uncertainty about when contracted-out
rebates will end as a result of uncertainty over the earnings link? Is
he worried that life will be made a lot less certain than it ought to
be for the schemes involved?</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000290"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I think that we are giving people the appropriate
level of certainty by saying that our objective is to do this in 2012.
As we previously established, our policy on this is much clearer than
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, or that of the official Opposition. We are
legislating to give people a clear timetable, and that applies here as
well.</div>
					<a name="07020141000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3
and amendment No. 37 are both concerned with how the putative revenue
that would otherwise have been used for the contracted-out rebate is to
be allocated in future. I have tried to explain that there are no
actual savings there, as the change is, broadly, intended to be
actuarially neutral. Without wanting to go into excessive detail, the
abolition of the defined-contribution rebate reduces cost in the short
term, but there is a broadly equivalent increase in future spending on
the state second pension. Thus, changes to the rebate are not a real
saving in the sense that it could be used to fund other
expenditure.</div>
					<a name="07020141000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Bedfordshire&#151;and, I think, the hon. Member
for Yeovil&#151;asked why the figures on contracting out had changed.
The reason is that the assumptions on which the projections are made
have also changed, as the regulatory impact assessment set out in some
detail. Perhaps they have been able to read that as well. The estimates
in the White Paper were based on the 2005 pre-Budget report, which used
the data available in autumn 2005. To have consistency within the
document, all of the figures used within its cost projections were from
that same period. </div>
					<a name="07020141000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
publishing the latest White Paper, we have been able to look at how the
numbers were changing; in particular, at new evidence of the numbers of
people contracting back into the state second pension. A number of
major schemes had contracted people back in, which, with the effects of
the review that we have put in place, meant a significant downward
effect on the number of people who had contracted out. As a
consequence, the forecasted cost of the contracted-out rebate, based on
real figures, had also fallen significantly. So, there is no great
mystery about how that happened. It is a significant change, but one
that reflects a big change in people&#146;s behaviour. People are
contracting out less; partly because of specific changes and also
because there is a growing view that contracting out is too
complicated, and people find that a disincentive to save rather than an
incentive.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000291"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for trying to
explain how this came about, but some fairly big question marks are
left in my mind. The Minister is saying that between autumn 2005 and
the end of 2006, the projections&#151;on what was, after all, a
pretty static pension scheme with no massive changes in that
time&#151;changed to the extent that the figures altered by
&#163;2.4 billion. That is a huge change, so could the Minister say a
little more about those changed assumptions? Is he worried that his
officials are suddenly going to come to him with other massively
changed assumptions within the next six months or so? That could alter
the figures even further.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000292"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s premise is that there
was a stable pension population, but that is wrong. The figures
actually reflect a significant change in the number of people
contracting out. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs collected
data from providers running exercises to contract their members back
into S2P, which became available in January 2006. The data showed that
about 200,000 people contracted back in every year from 2003-04 to
2006-07, a total of 800,000 people, which will reduce the cost of the
rebate in 2010 and 2011 by about &#163;1 billion. There were some
significant changes; they were not forecasting changes but actual
changes.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000293"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. Will he put on record the number of people who were
contracted out at the first date cited by the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire and the total number contracted out on the
basis of the new estimate?</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000294"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with
that information. I hope that I have explained why the figures changed.
There is no great mystery to them.</div>
					<a name="07020141000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second thrust of the debate
was about what, if there is some money, it will be used for, and the
hon. Member for Yeovil advanced four theories. There are two separate
matters: first, the cost of pension benefits and pensions, which is set
out in the White Paper; and, secondly, tax relief. The two are taken
separately in respect of policy and how the figures are explained in
the White Paper.</div>
					<a name="07020141000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way we set out our expenditure means that it does not include the
contracted- out rebate in terms of the GDP figures that the hon. Member
for Yeovil quoted. Nor does it include the increase in tax relief which
will come from personal accounts. Personal accounts will drive an
increase in the number of people saving through a company or a personal
pension. That in itself will lead to an increase in tax relief. The
Turner Commission&#146;s recommendation that tax relief should be
available to encourage people to save is exactly what our policy will
implement.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000295"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his customary
patience in giving way to me. He said that the net cost of the policy
was zero for the reasons that he set out. Did that estimate include the
cost of tax relief on personal accounts? If it did&#151;or even if it
did not&#151;does he have an estimate of the cost of that new tax
relief?</div>

							<a name="07020141000296"></a>
								James
Purnell:
						</b> No and no is the answer to the hon. Gentleman.
The change to the contracted-out rebate is actuarially neutral and
therefore broadly cost-neutral because there is a direct correlation
between people opting back in to the state second pension and there
being more state second pension costs in the future. The cost of extra
tax relief on personal accounts is not included in the GDP figures that
he quoted earlier. It demonstrates my point, that we have to consider
affordability within the benefits system. Tax relief policy is set by
the Treasury and is accounted for separately from these procedures. If
our policy is a success, it will increase the number of people saving
in a pension and therefore the overall cost of tax
relief.</div>

Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): Can the Minister

head, as they do not relate to our policy. We considered the
recommendations and put in place our own policy based on conclusions
from the quinquennial review. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can
elucidate on those figures if he wants to. I hope that I have answered
his question. There are no savings; that was the economists&#146;
version in the Work and Pensions Committee. There are tax relief
implications from the introduction of personal accounts, but they are
done separately. There is not a huge pot of money that we should
hypothetically be parcelling out among our favourite good
causes.</div>

patient and clear, but how does he tally that with the Secretary of
State&#146;s statement to the Select Committee on Work and Pensions
about the &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion that would be freed up
by the change? The Secretary of State clearly said that he was making a
bid to keep that money within the pension

								James
Purnell:
						</b> It is clearly consistent with what the Secretary
of State said. The money pays down the National Insurance fund, which
is in the quote. There should be tax relief for personal accounts,
which is what is going to happen. My point was that those two, as an
accounting issue, are done separately, one within the benefits
system&#151;the figures that we set out in the White Paper. There is
then the issue of overall tax relief and its affordability, which is a
matter for the Treasury, although of course we work closely together on
it. I hope that that answers the Opposition&#146;s general
enquiry.</div>
					<a name="07020141000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Yeovil made a specific point about risk sharing, which is
worth touching on briefly. People say that there is a transfer of risk
from companies to individuals and, indeed, from the state to
individuals. To an extent that is true, insofar as we are encouraging
extra personal responsibility. We are asking individuals to make
provision for themselves, but that statement is worth qualifying. There
are a number of ways in which we are trying to help people with those
risks. I want to trot through three.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 257</div>
					<a name="07020141000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						First,
personal accounts will help people to manage risk, because they will be
pooled in an organisation that is governed on their behalf and has a
genuine critical mass of investment, which would, one would hope, give
it greater security. Also, the organisation will be lifestyling the
investments for them, managing the security of the investments
according to their age profiles. Compared to a situation in which
people made the investments entirely by themselves, with their own
investments in the stock market subject to fluctuation, then the risk
is being
managed.</div>
					<a name="07020141000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
second point is that, because of automatic enrolment, there will be
more people involved in company pension schemes than there would
otherwise be. So, in that sense, that also moderates the general
trend.</div>
					<a name="07020141000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, we are
interested in encouraging risk sharing between companies and
individuals. There is a growing discussion in the financial services
industry and among people who run company pension schemes about whether
it is possible to bring back some risk-sharing hybrid schemes. That has
been mentioned, as has risk sharing with particular parts of pension
provision&#151;for example, life assurance could be provided by the
company. We are interested in looking at that because, if it is true
that finance directors increasingly want to moderate the risk on the
balance sheet, a halfway house between transferring it completely to
the individual and keeping it on the balance sheet may be some kind of
risk sharing. That is one of the things that our regulatory review is
keen to look
at.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07020141000301"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): Will the Minister make
it clear that he disagrees with some outside commentators, who seem to
make the point that defined-benefit schemes are some sort of gold
standard and inherently better than defined-contribution schemes? I
think that he is making that point, or it seems to be underlying what
he is saying. Certainly based on the information that we received in
Select Committee, the differential is mainly based on different levels
of contributions; if one puts less into either sort of scheme, one gets
less out.</div>
					<a name="07020141000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
providing the market risk is managed as he described, there is another
significant element of risk, which there is not for a
defined-contribution scheme. That risk is regulatory change over the
course of someone&#146;s working life. The degree of regulatory
change and, therefore, the risk of having one&#146;s supposed
benefits eroded through law changes, here and elsewhere, are much less
in the case of a defined-contribution scheme than in other
options.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000302"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That is why the Pensions Commission recommended
personal accounts, which it wanted people to know was their individual
pot. They would have a mixture of provision, with state provision
subject to those political risks, but moderated by accounts that were a
person&#146;s own property and subject to another type of
risk&#151;investment risk. From an individual&#146;s as well as a
country&#146;s point of view, sharing those risks is good. The
portfolio of risk consists of a mixture of political and stock-market
risk, with some people wanting their company to stand behind their
pension, too.</div>
					<a name="07020141000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am obviously not
regulated under the Financial Services Act 1986 to give people
financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 258</div>
						advice. They must decide which kind of scheme is
most appropriate to them and the risk that they want to take. That is a
rather pedantic way of saying that different types of scheme have
different risks and advantages, and people need to decide what is right
for them.</div>
					<a name="07020141000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Yeovil also asked whether there was a risk of
mis-sellng&#151;one of his favourite words&#151;because of the
changes to the rebate. I hope that I can reassure him. It is for
individuals to decide what sort of pension provision is best in their
circumstances; the information that they get at the point of sale,
through regulated financial advice, is a key part of their doing so.
However, they may want to review annually the advantages and
disadvantages of contracting out. The Financial Services Authority will
keep a close eye on that. My officials are working closely with the FSA
on the consumer information on contracting out that it
provides.</div>

							<a name="07020141000303"></a>Mr.

this is a matter for individuals and their advisers in the context of
the Government&#146;s rejection of advice from the Government
Actuary&#146;s Department about the level of rebate that is
appropriate in order for people to be sensibly contracted out. Surely
there is a mis-selling risk, because the Government are ignoring that
advice.</div>

Government making the decisions rather than the individual. The
individual takes out a pension&#151;regulated by the FSA&#151;and
it is the individual&#146;s decision. In practice, some providers
have chosen to contract their members back into S2P. It is because of
the difficulty of making those decisions that we think that
contracted-out DC schemes, with the extra complexity that they
introduce, should be
abolished.</div>

neutrality&#151;the Government are not seeking to incentivise
employers to take up one scheme rather than the other&#151;or do the

							<a name="07020141000308"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I think that the tax relief on each will be
broadly equivalent. However, we do want to encourage employers to
continue to provide company pension schemes, or to start to do so. The
range of measures set out in the December White Paper is designed to do
exactly that. We are not proposing extra tax relief above and beyond
that which already exists to do that, but, like all parties, we want to
encourage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 259</div>people to provide company pension schemes. As I told the hon. Member for

not to press amendment No. 37 and new clause

has been useful and the Minister&#146;s answers have been candid and
direct. I shall sum up where we are and where there are still problems.
He said that there is a clear timetable for getting rid of the
contracted-out rebate. His idea of a clear timetable is slightly
different from mine, because his allows for the opted-out rebates to be
abolished in any of four years. He gave us an insight into the
decline&#151;pretty much the collapse&#151;of defined-contribution
schemes in a short period. He has kindly said that he will put in
writing the number of people who were in DC schemes and what that
number has come down
to.</div>

							<a name="07020141000313"></a>James

contracted out. People are still contributing to their pensions, but

							<a name="07020141000314"></a>
								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful for that clarification. It has perhaps
been a collapse in the attractiveness of remaining contracted out. In
that regard, I remain concerned about the Government&#146;s
determination to ignore the potential mis-selling of the level of
contracted-out rebates. We all know that that is uncertain by the
nature of DC schemes, but the Government should not say that it is
simply an issue for advisers and individuals. The Pensions Commission
has shown that the Government chose to ignore the advice of the
Government Actuary&#146;s Department, and it set out the implication
of that in black and white terms in its final report: that</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 260</div>
					<a name="07020141000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;unless
individuals aged over 44 in APPs and 48 in money purchase schemes
receive higher investment returns than assumed by GAD, the
contracting-out rebate will not replace foregone S2P
benefits.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
chose to ignore the GAD&#146;s advice and to allow people who decide
not to go back into the S2P to risk losing out, which creates a
dangerous position. The Government ought to consider whether to give
further advice to people in that position to ensure that there is no
possibility of our being back here in 10 years with a case of serious
mis-selling. People would have a strong case to argue.</div>
					<a name="07020141000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister mentioned the
missing &#163;5 billion, or &#163;4 billion&#151;it is
now down to &#163;2 billion&#151;and plumped for what I describe as
the economist&#146;s case: that it is a zero-sum game because the
rebates will offset the extra S2P obligations. In fact, he went a bit
further and said that the Government have coughed up tax relief on
personal accounts, although he did not give us a figure. It would be
useful to get one on the record. Also, the contracted-out rebates are
not compensating properly for the state second pension, so if there is
any value in what the Government are doing it might be that they are
taking on board an additional cost, which is set against a saving. The
Minister has been clear about that, but it seems at least moderately to
contrast with the Secretary of State&#146;s acceptance of the fact
that there was a pot of &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion that he
was desperate to get his hands on. Other people who have also been
desperate to get their hands on it will be disappointed to know that
they are not allowed to and that the amount has shrivelled so
much.</div>
					<a name="07020141000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
Government incentives in relation to personal accounts and company
schemes, including DB schemes, will be dealt with to a greater extent
when the personal accounts come in. However, there is widespread,
legitimate concern that there could be a levelling-down process that
will accelerate the decline in the contributions made by many
companies. The Government need to give some thought to the extent of
the regulatory changes that they could introduce to make it easier for
DB and other good employer schemes to remain in existence. The Minister
indicated that the Government have an open mind on that issue and are
willing to examine changes that could facilitate more affordable
schemes.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07020141000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
is also an issue about whether the Government will take a completely
neutral attitude on whether employers will opt for personal accounts or
for DB or other schemes. I hope that the Government would be, at the
very least, neutral on that matter, and that, if anything, they would
acknowledge that those employers who choose the non-personal account
schemes will be taking on very large costs and burdens. Furthermore,
the Government should consider what they can do, through legislation
and other means, to ensure that those schemes do not disappear in the
years ahead.</div>

					<a name="07020141000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The only
amendment that we have tabled is at the behest of the Pensions Advisory
Service, which erupted on to the scene at the end of last week with
this wording. The Minister may be able to tell me something different,
but it seems to me that PAS is making an eminently sensible,
workmanlike and practicable suggestion. For those members of the
Committee who are not aware of PAS, it is an independent organisation,
but it is funded by grant in aid from the Department for Work and
Pensions. Speaking as a constituency MP, I believe that it does
excellent work in trying to resolve a lot of complaints, problems and
concerns that individuals have about pensions issues. Indeed, in its
briefing note PAS
says:</div>
					<a name="07020141000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the
period April 2005 to March 2006...88% of the
complaints&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020141000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is 88% of the complaints referred to them&#151;&#147;were
resolved&#148; and no further action was required by any other body.
That is extremely impressive; it presumably makes matters much less
stressful for the individuals involved, and presumably also saves a
great deal of money.</div>
					<a name="07020141000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to PAS, the proposed
amendment would allow pension schemes to adopt a one-stage
IDRP&#151;for the uninitiated, that is an internal dispute resolution
procedure&#151;and if schemes take that route, members may not become
aware of the existence of PAS until after the completion of the IDRP.
PAS says:</div>
					<a name="07020141000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is our experience that the resolution of disputes is more effectively
done before completion of the IDRP, and often before the procedure has
been invoked. We are therefore concerned that the unintended
consequence of the amendment as it currently reads would be an increase
in unresolved disputes which in turn would increase the level of
submissions to the relevant ombudsman services.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div>
					<a name="07020141000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to discuss its independence and

					<a name="07020141000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">PAS goes on to say that the
management of complaints</div>
					<a name="07020141000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would be made more efficient if a
requirement were introduced that all written complaints had to be
acknowledged.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sounds axiomatic, but perhaps it is not. The PAS also
said:</div>
					<a name="07020141000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would
suggest the earlier involvement of TPAS in situations of disputes would
have the effect of reducing the number of cases which require the
formal deliberations of the IDRP and reduce the number of applications
to the Pensions
Ombudsman.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seemed
perfectly sensible, so I tabled the amendment with alacrity. On every

for Eastbourne for the amendment and for speaking with such alacrity in
support of it.</div>
					<a name="07020141000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I deal with the amendment it might help to say a few words about the
purpose of the clause. The clause amends the provisions relating to the
resolution of disputes. Occupational pension schemes are currently
required to operate a formal two-stage process for dealing with
disputes between individuals and trustees. However, the process is
rather prescriptive and is bound by rigid time limits. Although the
process works well in many larger schemes, we wanted to give schemes
the opportunity to adopt something simpler and more flexible. The
change that we propose also follows recommendations that came from the
Pickering report.</div>
					<a name="07020141000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
legislated in the Pensions Act 2004 to enable schemes to simplify their
dispute resolution arrangements, by allowing them to adopt either a one
or a two stage-procedure. However, the measure was not commenced,
because doubts were raised by pension schemes and their advisers about
the extent to which the provisions would allow trustees to delegate
decisions on disputes. It is common practice for trustee boards to
delegate such decisions, often to a dedicated sub-committee, and that
is perfectly reasonable and sensible. We therefore decided that it
would be sensible to put the matter beyond doubt at the earliest
opportunity. That is the main purpose of the clause. The clause makes
it clear that a decision on a dispute does not need to be made by the
full trustee board. The decision must, however, be made by one or more
of the trustees and cannot be delegated outside the
trustee
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 263</div>body. That is a small but sensible provision that will enable schemes to
adopt simpler and cheaper dispute resolution arrangements, if they
prefer to do so.</div>
					<a name="07020141000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that the Pensions Advisory Service does valuable work. I also
know that the assistance and support that it provides is greatly
appreciated. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to refer to the 88 per
cent. success rate in resolutions and the 68,000 referrals that were
made to the service last year. Under the current two-stage
arrangements, the scheme member will be told about the Pensions
Advisory Service with the decision on the first stage. The member will
then have the opportunity to talk to the service before the matter is
reconsidered by the trustees.</div>
					<a name="07020141000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current requirement is
based in secondary legislation. It is neither necessary nor appropriate
to deal with the issue in such detail in the Bill. As I have said, the
main purpose of the changes set out in the clause is to make things
simpler and easier for schemes to implement, and to make the
legislation less prescriptive. Requiring every scheme to acknowledge
every application in writing, as the amendment proposes, might be
counter to that aim. It may be that a dispute arising from a
misunderstanding or miscommunication can be resolved quickly and easily
and that an acknowledgment would serve no useful purpose. I am also
conscious that in December we published a simplification plan in which
we committed to reducing the burden proposed by existing regulations as
well as to minimising burdens flowing from any new regulations. In
considering any new regulatory requirement, we have to measure it
against the aims and targets set out in the Department&#146;s
simplification plan and consider it in the light of our current
deregulatory review.</div>
					<a name="07020141000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will consider the issue
carefully; I assure the Committee that we will give serious thought to
how best to ensure that people are made aware of the services offered
by the Pensions Advisory Service without imposing an unnecessary
regulatory or administrative burden on schemes. I should add that if
the clause comes into law, the secondary legislation will need to be
amended. We shall consult at that point, which would be the more
appropriate time to consider any basis of referral to the Pensions
Advisory Service.</div>

to the Minister for that patient&#151;indeed,
painstaking&#151;explanation of the provisions. I was not wholly
wedded to putting the issue into the Bill, although I had a hankering
to point out to my grandchildren that I had been the architect of
section 16(4)(b) of the Pensions Act 2007. However, I am afraid that
that is not to be. The Minister has assured us that the issue will be
considered and consulted on in secondary legislation, and I am more
than happy that that should be the case. I am delighted that the
Minister is also impressed by the effectiveness and efficiency of the

							<a name="07020141000318"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I shall not detain the Committee long,
Mr. Gale. Somebody once said of President Calvin Coolidge
that he looked at someone as if they had been a side dish that he had
not ordered. That thought went through my mind as I saw your face,
Mr. Gale, so I shall try to keep my contribution
short.</div>
					<a name="07020141000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 17 and
schedule 5 are designed to remove the requirement that the Secretary of
State should approve actuarial guidance in certain cases. The current
arrangement, set out neatly on page 82 of the regulatory impact
assessment, is that when calculating pensions liabilities all actuaries
are supposed to use agreed guidelines, to ensure consistency. For
reasons beyond my comprehension, those are called either
&#147;guidance notes&#148; or a &#147;technical
memorandum&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020141000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Various bits
of primary legislation require the Secretary of State to approve three
of those guidance notes&#151;although there are seven altogether; I
do not know who approves the other four&#151;and the one technical
memorandum. I understand that the Institute of Actuaries in England and
Wales and the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland, which combine the roles
of regulator and professional body, have always prepared those
documents. Owing to their dual role and what might have been described
or perceived as a conflict of interest, they were required to obtain
the Secretary of State&#146;s approval. That was said to be to
maintain the public&#146;s confidence, although I cannot imagine for
the life of me that many members of the public are even aware that the
things exist, let alone who prepares
them.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07020141000259"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07020141000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its 2005
report, the Morris review concluded that the Financial Reporting
Council should establish a new regime to set actuarial standards and
oversee the regulation of the profession. The Government have accepted
the recommendation, and in turn the FRC has set up the Board for
Actuarial Standards&#151;oh to be a fly on the wall at its meetings!
That is no doubt a relief to the Faculty of Actuaries and the Institute
of Actuaries, which continue to have an important role as the
professional bodies for their
profession.</div>
					<a name="07020141000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that on 6 April this year the board will take over
responsibility for the guidance notes and technical memorandums. At
that stage, the FRC and the BAS become the UK&#146;s independent
regulator for corporate reporting and governance, and there is no
longer a need for the Secretary of State to have a role. I am sure that
that will come as a great relief to him, as he already has quite enough
on his plate&#151;the pensions crisis, the failure to tackle reform,
the failing Child Support Agency. I could go
on.</div>
					<a name="07020141000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
a nutshell, the proposal seems to be uncontroversial and therefore we
support it. Indeed, I am emboldened in that view by a Library note
which tells me that the equivalent provisions in the Companies (Audit,
Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 did not even merit
discussion during its Committee stage.</div>

Gentleman&#146;s enthusiasm for the clause. I begin by cautioning him
about praying in aid the late President Calvin Coolidge. He should
remember that when that President died&#151;in 1923, I
believe&#151;his death was reported to a dinner party, and the
response was, &#147;How could they

						As
the hon. Gentleman said, clause 17 and schedule 5 remove the Secretary
of State&#146;s role in approving actuarial guidance. This arises
from one of the recommendations of the Morris review of the actuarial
profession. Clause 17 introduces schedule 5, which amends nine
references in legislation. It removes the requirement for the Secretary
of State to approve prescribed actuarial guidance notes and, in other
cases, it removes the power to make regulations to prescribe that the
Secretary of State approve such guidance. The references can be found
in the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985, the Insolvency Act 1986, the
Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act
2004.</div>
					<a name="07020141000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actuarial
guidance is currently produced by the Institute of Actuaries in England
and the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland. It ensures that all actuaries
calculate pension liabilities on a consistent basis. The Faculty and
Institute of Actuaries is also the professional body for actuaries. In
order to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between those
roles, legislation requires certain actuarial guidance to be approved
by the Secretary of State. However, following the Morris review, the
actuarial profession is now subject to independent oversight by the
Financial Reporting Council, which is the independent regulator for
corporate reporting and
governance.</div>
					<a name="07020141000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FRC
will establish the Board for Actuarial Standards to set technical
standards for actuaries and to oversee the prescribed actuarial
guidance. The Faculty and Institute of Actuaries remains the
professional body for actuaries. It is therefore no longer necessary or
appropriate for the Secretary of State to approve actuarial guidance. I
commend clause 17 and schedule 5 to the
Committee.</div>

that they were all matters for the next Bill, which will come up next

Waterson:
						</b> The Minister says, right on cue, that they are.
Well, we beg to disagree. Of course, there are areas of detail about
personal accounts that it is inappropriate to go into here,
Mr. Gale, as I am sure that you would be the first to remind
us. However, we fear that there is a temptation into which Ministers
are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 268</div>in danger of falling, and it is our job to help them not to fall into
it. The temptation is to pass the legislation with a sigh of relief,
then to pass the whole job over to some hot shots running the delivery
authority and leave it to them to make all the difficult, tricky
decisions. I would be the first to say that politicians are the last
people we want running something like that in any detailed way.
However, I think that it behoves us, particularly in view of the
timeline involved with the reports, to nail down some clear ideas about
the personal accounts system before we wave goodbye to the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07020141000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, I thought that the letter of 31 January betrayed a certain
nervousness on the part of the Minister. In the second paragraph, it
says that</div>
					<a name="07020141000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;delivering and
managing a major occupational pension scheme such as personal
accounts... should not be a task for
government.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
to that, as I have tried to indicate, is yes and no. Of course, they
are right, as the Minister goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07020141000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
therefore propose to bring in experts to help develop and deliver the
personal accounts
scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">He goes on to
talk about the second pensions Bill later this year, and to stress the
advisory nature of the delivery authority. That is all well and good,
but to take one clear example before I move onto the weight of the
amendments, he talks about</div>
					<a name="07020141000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;advising on the design of the
commercial strategy&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020141000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have made clear in more than one speech, the Opposition hope that
personal accounts will be a success, not only because they are the
right approach to take to such a massive change in our systems, but
because we may be the ones to inherit their implementation. We think
that personal accounts have got to have the right shape, in a very
general sense. I do not want the Minister to get too worried; we do not
want to be too prescriptive, but we need to feel that the system is
going to work. If it fails, and the accounts are not sufficiently
attractive to the target audience&#151;we shall come later to issues
about whether the target group has changed&#151;we want to do what we
can to try to put that right now.</div>

say two things. First, the body itself will probably benefit from some
sort of steer from the Committee as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div>to what shape personal accounts might have. Secondly, contrary to what
some members of the Committee may believe, I do not wake up in the
morning and dream up all the amendments and the concerns that we wish
to express. I do occasionally, but on the shape of personal accounts,
an awful lot of the amendments, if not most of them, are driven by the
industry&#151;the very people who will have to make them work.
Therefore, when I am speaking, it might not really be me at all; it
might be the very people whom the Minster wants to enlist to make
personal accounts a
success.</div>

annexe A&#151;rather bizarrely, there is no annexe B&#151;to the

Delivery Authority will be led by a Chair and Chief Executive with the
right skills and expertise...supported by appropriate legal, commercial
operational, business and financial
expertise.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
kind of issue that we want to explore in more detail. Crucially, he
moves on to marketing and communications. We think that marketing is a
crucial part of selling personal accounts; people will have to want to
buy them. I will also talk about that in more detail.</div>
					<a name="07020141000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The annexe to the
Minister&#146;s letter then refers to the role of the personal
accounts board,
which</div>
					<a name="07020141000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be
responsible for the management, rather than the delivery, of the
personal accounts
scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important distinction. We are concerned that the delivery authority
should be set up. Although in law the authority and the board are
separate entities, we are worried that the Government want to see one
morph into the other. Each requires a wholly different skills set for
the introduction and delivery of the concept. The Minister recognises
that by saying:</div>
					<a name="07020141000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is a clear
distinction between the work of the Delivery Authority and the personal
accounts board.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
to underline that in these
debates.</div>
					<a name="07020141000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall assist the Committee by pointing out that clause 18, along with
schedule 6, is about pay and rations, as it were, or the nuts and
bolts. Clause 19 is about the wider issues&#151;the purpose and scope
of personal accounts, the authority&#146;s relationship with its
successor body and the definition of success or failure. There I fear
that we may bump up against the limits of consensus, but we will see
where the discussion takes
us.</div>
					<a name="07020141000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
rapidly on to the large group of amendments, beginning with amendment
No. 81, which is a probing amendment that will allow me to raise a
couple of concerns. Subsection (2) makes it clear
that:</div>
					<a name="07020141000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Authority is not to be regarded as the servant or agent of the
Crown&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">and therefore does
not enjoy Crown immunity or any claims. That raises an important issue,
which arises in the context of the European Court proceedings that have
just been concluded against the Government and the High Court
proceedings that have been brought by pensioners&#146; groups, which
are due to be heard on 7 February.</div>
					<a name="07020141000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whoever the Government are and
however the architecture ends up, there should be distance between the
Government and issues such as investment policy. I do not think that
the Government should be in the business dealing with that sort of
thing; they should be in the business of minimising as far as possible
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 270</div>political risk. I should therefore like to probe the Minister as to what
the Government have in mind on the question of Crown privilege. It is
right that Crown privilege should not apply, but does the Minister
envisage claims against the authority? If so, what sort of claims does
he envisage?</div>
					<a name="07020141000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
move on. A cluster of amendments have been fomented, encouraged and
supplied by <i class="I">Which?</i>, formerly the Consumers Association, and have
its seal of good housekeeping. The hon. Member for Yeovil occupies an
interesting parallel dimension, because in most if not all cases, his
amendments are identical to mine. I take it as praise
indeed.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07020141000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07020141000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first set
of amendments includes amendment No. 8, which is ours, and amendment
No. 41, which is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s. Amendment No. 8 would put
&#147;lay&#148; in schedule 6. Its purpose is to ensure that all
chairs do not have any perceived conflict of interest with regard to
the financial services industry, and that they look after the interests
and represent the views of scheme members and of prospective scheme
members. It is a probing amendment. &#147;Lay&#148; is a difficult
word, and some definitions in other legislation are not directly
comparable. However, it is important that the Minister understands our
drift. The theme of many of the twinned amendments is to ensure that
the interests of consumers and of potential consumers are at the heart
of the way in which the authority undertakes its
business.</div>
					<a name="07020141000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise,
amendments Nos. 9 and 42 are again Conservative and Liberal Democrat.
The Bill does not state that there should be mandatory consumer
representation on the delivery authority. <i class="I">Which?</i> is keen to
ensure that there is a focus on the best deal for scheme members and
for prospective scheme members. The amendments call for two mandatory
non-executive consumer directors who would be recognised in a
professional capacity by those stakeholder consumer groups that have an
active interest in the subject. <i class="I">Which?</i> has been energetic in
attending many of those marvellous seminars, discussing with
us&#151;and, I am sure, other parties&#151;its concerns as time has
gone on. Emma Higginson, in particular, has been extremely helpful in
briefing on the concerns that it and its members have.</div>
					<a name="07020141000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">Which?</i> takes the view,
and I am sure that there is a lot in what it says,
that</div>
					<div class="hs_brev">&#147;consumer representation is fundamental
if trust and confidence in personal accounts is to be
upheld.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has carried
out its own research. <i class="I">Which?</i> has consistently demonstrated that
consumers trust an independent board to administer their pensions. They
want directors who will provide expertise and knowledge of consumer
issues, who will represent the diverse needs and aspirations of
consumers, and who will ensure that mis-selling scandals are
avoided.</div>
					<a name="07020141000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 11, and amendment No. 44 tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil,
would require the Secretary of State to consult such organisations as
appear to him to represent the interests of consumers before appointing
or approving the appointment of any member representing the interests
of consumers. It is important that the Secretary of State&#146;s
definition of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div>consumer representative is the same as that of recognised consumer
groups, and it makes sense to ensure that there is proper consultation
with those groups. My amendment does not specify those groups; that
might be a matter for secondary legislation. I am sure that the list is
obvious, but it is a point worth making in Committee.</div>
					<a name="07020141000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 14 and 45 say
that the authority must establish a committee. There is provision for
setting up any number of committees under the delivery authority, but
there should be a committee for the purpose of representing the
interests of scheme members and of prospective scheme members. Again, a
consumer committee could serve as a sounding board for personal
accounts issues, and for policy decisions in particular, given the
impact that they will have on the consumer. A committee would provide
extra scrutiny and advice to ensure the direct involvement of key
representatives and stakeholders, and, I hope, to improve the quality
of decision making. Amendment No. 10 is a consequential
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07020141000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 12 is, I hope, reasonably clear in its intention. It specifies that
before appointing any member of the authority the Secretary of State
must conduct an open recruitment competition inviting applications from
individuals with the relevant qualifications, consult organisations
representing key groups of stakeholders and</div>
					<a name="07020141000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to the desirability
of appointing a group of members whose expertise collectively spans all
aspects of occupational and personal pension provision and financial
marketing.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Those
last three words are important for reasons that I have already
mentioned. Whoever takes on this job must have a marketing background
or at least have people around them who do. Ultimately personal
accounts may stand or fall on the success of the marketing campaign and
therefore that is a particularly important provision in this Bill. The
National Association of Pension Funds has indicated its support for
amendment No. 12. It says that it wants to see members with the
relevant experience and knowledge, particularly of occupational
pensions. We agree with that.</div>
					<a name="07020141000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to tease out from the
Minister the kind of people he has in mind. What kind of people will or
are being recruited? I hope that he can share with us the extent to
which the Government are already seeking recruits for these positions.
There is always this slightly delicate issue of what a Government can
do before a piece of legislation receives Royal Assent. I seem to
remember that on the 2004 Act there was a bit of an up and downer about
hiring the head of the Pension Protection Fund before the Bill had gone
through all its stages. I do not want to get too formal about it, but
it behoves the Minister to tell us what is happening. Has the Secretary
of State appointed a firm of headhunters to beat the bushes in the
financial services and other sectors? If so, what criteria are being
given to the headhunters in that search? It is only fair that the
Committee be put in the
picture.</div>
					<a name="07020141000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
13 states:</div>
					<a name="07020141000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State
shall have regard to the desirability of recruiting a group of members
so that there is a balance as the Secretary of State considers
appropriate between&#151;(a) members with knowledge and experience of
consumers&#146; pension needs; (b) members with knowledge and
experience of employers&#146; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 272</div>involvement in pensions; (c) members with knowledge and experience of
pensions from the pension providers; (d) members with knowledge and
experience of pensions from the relevant
regulators.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
hope, again on the basis of this probing amendment, that the Minister
will feel able to say that these are all criteria that he is already
operating. That would be very reassuring. I can almost hear his
argument coming that these are not matters that should be on the face
of the Bill. But in the light of reasonable assurances from the
Minister, I am sure that we can come to some accommodation on
that.</div>
					<a name="07020141000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 15
is to schedule 6. It relates to paragraph 2(6) about conflicts of
interest, which
reads:</div>
					<a name="07020141000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In this
paragraph and paragraph 3 &#145;conflict of interest&#146;, in
relation to a person, means a financial or other interest which is
likely to affect prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as
a member of the
Authority.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020141000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
obviously be wrong if someone with a clear financial interest was
involved because there would be a conflict of interest. But what wealth
of potential problems is contained in the otherwise innocent words
&#147;or other&#148;? What kind of situation or conflict do the
Government have in mind? Would the Minister mind sharing that with
us?</div>
					<a name="07020141000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
82&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000329"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that amendment No. 82
removes a paragraph that allows the Secretary of State to pay pensions,
allowances or gratuities to the chairman and the non-executive members
of the authority at his
discretion?</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000330"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> That is a helpful intervention for which I am
most grateful, and the hon. Gentleman is right. This is a probing
amendment, because I am a bit puzzled as to why the delivery authority,
which will have a short existence, should be in the business of paying
pensions, allowances or gratuities&#151;I do not know what that would
mean. Would the members be given a couple of quid in their hands for
turning up to a meeting? Paragraph 4(1) reasonably makes it clear that
they should get remuneration and allowances. That is perfectly proper
and is to be expected. However, I am not entirely convinced about where
pensions, allowances and gratuities would come in.</div>
					<a name="07020141000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
14 exactly parallels amendment No. 45 from the Liberal
Democrats. That, I understand; it is about representing the interests
of scheme members in a committee.</div>
					<a name="07020141000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I think that
the last issue that I need to deal with in this group is new clause 5,
which concerns freedom of information. The Personal Accounts Delivery
Authority will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but
the Act exempts information relating to the formulation of Government
policy and the free and frank provision of advice. Those provisions are
intended to protect the confidentiality of advice given by officials to
Ministers and internal discussions within Government. However, we would
want to underline the fact that the delivery authority will be
independent from Government, not part of it, and I am sure that the
Minister will be eager to say that, too. We are supported by the
Association of British Insurers, among others, in thinking that it is
important to make it clear that the advice tendered by the delivery
authority about the best way to run personal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 273</div>accounts should be freely available to the public and the industry, so
that everybody can judge the value of its recommendations and assess
any final decisions taken by the Secretary of State on the basis of
that advice.</div>
					<a name="07020141000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I am always open to criticisms of my drafting, I think that the new
clause achieves that purpose. It is designed to ensure that members of
the public and others are able to make applications under the 2000 Act
in respect of the delivery authority, and that there will not be any
bar to that on the basis set out in the clause.</div>
					<a name="07020141000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have dealt
adequately with the new clause and all the amendments, even those that
were not tabled by my party, and I hope that there is something in
there that the Minister might accept.</div>
					<a name="07020141000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">The Chairman: </b>I have no
desire to curtail the right of any hon. Member to make whatever
in-order comment he or she wishes. However, it has not escaped my
notice that the provenance of some of the amendments seems to be
remarkably similar. It is therefore likely that the arguments might be
remarkably similar, so in order to expedite matters I should be
grateful if hon. Members would eschew
repetition.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000261"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000331"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful not only for that advice,
Mr. Gale, but for the fact that you did not look me directly
in the eye when giving it. It is clearly designed for all members of
the Committee. I did not, as you know, speak to clause 17 because the
passport for that seemed to be having a joke about Calvin Coolidge. As
I did not have one, I felt it was not appropriate for me to contribute.
However, I agree that these amendments look rather similar. We are
discussing a shadow delivery authority and have eight amendments
shadowing each other&#151;probably, I fear, in the wrong direction
from my perspective, but arguably so closely that we will not split
hairs.</div>
					<a name="07020141000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
8, as you rightly say, Mr. Gale, shadows amendment No. 41,
amendment No. 9 shadows amendment No. 42, amendment no. 11 shadows
amendment no. 44 and amendment No. 14 shadows amendment No. 45. They
all come from <i class="I">Which?</i> so the hon. Member for Eastbourne and I
will be happy for it to have the full credit for them. It is quite
right to say that I have, essentially, been able to contract out the
selling of these fine amendments to the hon. Gentleman, who has done a
magnificent job in setting them out.</div>
					<a name="07020141000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I really need add, then, is
that these amendments clearly demonstrate the importance of this body
having consumer interests at its heart and not just being a sort of
industry-Government fix. I need add nothing
else.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000332"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Now there is a practice that we should continue
in future, Mr. Gale; but I do not want to give you advice,
as I am surely not allowed to do so. I am tempted to agree with the
spirit behind all these amendments, and leave it at that. We do,
however, have a disagreement of substance on the one about freedom of
information, so I shall come to that. Yet people would feel
short-changed if we did not set out, on the record, a little response
to the desire for our thinking to be teased out. So, I will go through
the amendments as requested.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 274</div>
					<a name="07020141000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						First, when
the delivery authority takes on its next incarnation&#151;if
Parliament is willing to give us another Bill next year&#151;then it
will, we hope, move from being an advisory body to a genuine delivery
authority. At that stage it will be important for this House to make it
clear that the delivery authority should have genuine
independence&#151;both on investments and operationally&#151;and
the ability to recruit the skills that it needs. Personally, I think
that an important point within that will be for us to establish clearly
that it should make investment decisions on behalf of its members and
with their interests at heart, rather than under political direction.
That will be an important precedent to
set.</div>
					<a name="07020141000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that is
not the delivery authority that we are discussing today. As I said
earlier, the one under discussion is one that is advising the Secretary
of State on the proposals that he will be making. So, the bedrock of
parliamentary accountability here&#151;and the answer to the
questions set out by the hon. Member for Eastbourne at the start of his
speech&#151;is that it will not be going off to make a whole bunch of
decisions for which Parliament cannot hold it to account. It will be
advising the Secretary of State, whom Parliament can hold accountable
during this period of its operation in exactly the normal
way.</div>
					<a name="07020141000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the detail of
process in the amendments, I also want to echo what has been said about
<i class="I">Which?</i> and the important role that it has played throughout the
process of developing these policies, while representing in particular
the interests of consumers and members. <i class="I">Which? </i>has much
influenced our proposals, and all parties have welcomed that. Its
central point&#151;that members and consumers should be absolutely at
the heart of personal accounts&#151;is right, and we indeed intend to
reflect that in our proposals following the White Paper that we
published in December.</div>
					<a name="07020141000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						An open
question in the White Paper asks people to come forward with
suggestions on how members should be represented, involved and
consulted. We have a genuinely clear and open mind on that area, and
are keen to have suggestions; we look forward to what the Work and
Pensions Committee says on that as well. In making personal accounts
work, it will be important both that the criterion for the
authority&#146;s decision making is clearly established to be the
interests of its members&#151;as it is their pensions that we are
talking about&#151;and that the members themselves feel confident
that they have appropriate representation and influence over the
decisions being made on their behalf.</div>
					<a name="07020141000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will be discussing those
items in the light of the response that we get to our consultation,
which bore in mind the work of the Work and Pensions Committee. We will
publish our response to that Committee, which hon. Members will have a
chance to scrutinise over the next few months. Those are the general
issues that we will be able to discuss, but the amendments that we are
talking about today&#151;to which I now want to turn&#151;are much
more specific.</div>
					<a name="07020141000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
18 establishes a Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, which we want to
give independent advice to Government while using the professional
expertise and knowledge that exist in the private sector. The
establishment of such an authority has generally been welcomed by
stakeholders, both those in financial services and representatives of
consumers and trade 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 275</div>unions. I am pleased to see that the Opposition parties also support the
principle of having a delivery
authority.</div>
					<a name="07020141000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 6
covers the membership, proceedings and organisational parameters within
which the delivery authority must operate. We envisage the authority
operating on the basis of a small board, with executive and
non-executive members, supported by staff and specialist committees.
Initially, under the provisions set out in the Bill, the delivery
authority will provide advice, supporting the Government in
understanding the operational and commercial implications of policy
options. It will also advise on the design of the commercial strategy,
including the financial, technical and commercial analysis needed for
policy development. That is the general approach. I will now turn to
specific
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07020141000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Crown
immunity, I understand that the intention of the hon. Member for
Eastbourne is not to give the organisation Crown immunity, but to test
whether we believe that it should be subject to judicial procedures in
the normal way, as any organisation advising on policy in this way
should be. That is our intention. If he wanted to press his amendment,
we would resist, but I hope that gives him the comfort that he wants.
If people feel that they need judicial recourse against the authority,
they will be able to resort to it in the normal
way.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000333"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I do not want to labour the point, but it seems
odd to envisage legal claims against the delivery authority rather than
the board in due course. I wonder what kind of claims the Minister
envisages being made. Is any provision made for possible claims in the
amount set out in the regulatory impact assessment, which is &#163;21
million for the delivery authority up to the second Bill being dealt
with by
Parliament?</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000334"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> If people wanted judicial recourse against the
authority, they would sue the Secretary of State in the normal way.
They would have judicial review of the Secretary of State. I hope that
that gives the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants. If there was
a feeling that the authority had acted in a way that needed judicial
review, that would be
possible.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000335"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> So, I assume that in due course the board would
have a different set-up? That body, once it is up and running, is
envisaged as the one to be sued, rather than the Secretary of
State.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000336"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That is absolutely right. In the
authority&#146;s next incarnation, when not giving advice but
actually making proposals, then it would obviously be subject to normal
judicial review and other legal
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07020141000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
freedom of information, I am just not sure that I agree with the hon.
Gentleman. I can see the desire for transparency. However, in the same
way as civil servants give advice to Ministers, which they would
sometimes not be comfortable having in the public domain, so is the
role of the delivery authority in giving advice to the Secretary of
State, where the analogy would apply as well.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div>
					<a name="07020141000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some side effects of
his amendment that I think the hon. Gentleman would not want, such as
anybody applying for an interview being able to ask for the questions
that they were going to be asked in advance, or so I am told.
Apparently anyone wanting to get into the authority&#146;s IT system
could ask for the passwords. I know that that is not the
amendment&#146;s intention. On the basis of wanting effective
policy-making at this stage it would be better for the Freedom of
Information Act to apply to Departments, as it does now. That is why we
will resist the amendment if the hon. Gentleman divides the Committee
on the proposal. We do not propose to exempt the authority from
protection for policy and advice because it would not be conducive to
their giving frank and impartial guidance, which is exactly why
Parliament put those provisions into the Freedom of Information Act in
the first
place.</div>
					<a name="07020141000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
amendments Nos. 12 and 13, I reassure the hon. Gentleman and the hon.
Member for Yeovil that as with all other public bodies, when appointing
non-executives we are required to follow the code of practice of the
Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments for ministerial
appointments to public bodies, which is a guide to the steps that must
be followed to ensure a fair, open and transparent appointments
process. Independent scrutiny is a mandatory element of the process and
no appointment may be made unless an independent assessor has been
involved. In appointing initial executive members we will follow an
open and transparent process that follows best practice and standard
employment procedures.</div>
					<a name="07020141000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Eastbourne
wanted to know whether we had started recruiting. I can tell him that
we engaged headhunters on Monday and we plan to start the recruitment
process in February. If he knows of anyone who may want to apply, he
can refer them to a firm called Egon Zehnder. I hope that that gives
the hon. Gentleman the information that he
wanted.</div>

my CV.</div>
					<a name="07020141000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two questions
arise from what the Minister said: first, will he share with the
Committee the job descriptions of the positions of chairman and chief
executive that he has given to Egon Zehnder, a reputable and well-known
firm in the field? Secondly, what is the Cabinet Office or other rule
about recruiting people and spending money when the Bill has barely
scratched the surface of its parliamentary process? These people do not
work for charitable
purposes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000338"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I think the rule is that the process can start
after Second Reading. We will be careful to follow the application
procedure in keeping with Cabinet Office and Treasury guidance on the
spending of public money under this
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07020141000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

we are happy to discuss that with him and with

Purnell:
						</b> I probably have. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> We are
happy to share that with the hon. Gentleman. We want to discuss it with
our headhunters first, as their expertise is in formulating all that.
If the hon. Gentleman wants to make any suggestions we will be happy to
consider them and we will happily commit to sharing the job description
with him. The process can begin after Second Reading but the
appointment will be after Royal
Assent.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07020141000263"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="07020141000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did not
envisage requiring marketing expertise to be specified in legislation.
It will be for the chairman and the chief executive to decide the
expertise that they want on that issue. However, we do not want to put
that in the Bill, as we want a nimble organisation that can be flexible
in deciding whom it
recruits.</div>
					<a name="07020141000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, independent scrutiny will be a mandatory element in the process
and no appointment will be made without an independent assessor. We
recognise the importance of ensuring that the board contains
individuals with a breadth of knowledge and experience from a range of
backgrounds. At the initial stage of delivery, it will be small, so it
will be particularly important to ensure that we have the right skills
and expertise in place.</div>
					<a name="07020141000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11,
41, 42, 44, 14 and 45 relate to the important issue of consumer
representation. The principle that consumer involvement and expertise
is vital to the work of the delivery authority is recognised by all
parties. However, at this stage I am wary of starting to mandate
individuals on boards to represent individual stakeholder groups. We
might end up with stakeholders in the financial services industry,
stakeholders among employers providing schemes and stakeholders in
trade unions, and we would be in danger of creating the sense that
certain people on the board had responsibility for one particular
section or interest rather than for the effectiveness of personal
accounts as a whole. Like the BBC and Ofcom, which do not have people
representing specific interests, we want the board as a whole to be
responsible for the whole success of personal accounts. That means
representing consumers and performing the other duties that, initially,
the personal accounts board and the delivery authority will
have.</div>
					<a name="07020141000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
supporting the principle that consumers and people with expertise in
consumer issues should have appropriate involvement in personal
accounts, we are reluctant to legislate specifically for
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000341"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Has the Minister had a chance to meet the most
prominent consumer organisations to think about how he might satisfy
their concerns within the context of those reservations? Would he be
willing to do so if they wished to take him up on it before the measure
is taken
further?</div>
					
					<a name="07020141000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000342"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> We met with them a number of times in the run-up
to publication of the White Paper, and will be happy to do so again. In
fact, we had one running meeting&#151;the Division bell rang half way
through and we continued it while running to the Division Lobby. The
issue is not new, and the views of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 278</div>those people shaped the section of the White Paper covering consumer
representation. We are happy to listen to any specific proposal.
However, we do not think that we should necessarily legislate for the
detail. We will continue to discuss the issue; indeed, my officials are
in regular discussion with the stakeholders who have been mentioned and
others, as well as through our much-referred-to series of
seminars</div>
					<a name="07020141000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
for the calls for a lay chair, all members of the delivery authority
board will be expected to act in the interests of all prospective
scheme members in performing their roles. That duty will apply to
everyone. Given that we are trying to create an organisation with a
relatively small board, we do not want to specify backgrounds that
would not be suitable for particular jobs. We recognise that those
interests will have to be taken into account, and that people with
expertise in those issues will have to be involved in personal
accounts, but we may come to regret disqualifying anybody with a
financial services background from chairing the authority if the best
person to do so happens to have that background. In that, we disagree
with the thrust of the amendment. We want the delivery authority to
have the flexibility to recruit the best people for the job, and we do
not want to tie their hands. With that, I shall move on from consumer
representation, unless hon. Members have any burning issues to
raise.</div>
					<a name="07020141000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.15 relates to conflict of interest. There is nothing hugely
mysterious about it. Most conflicts of interest would be financial, but
it possible to envisage a conflict of interest that was not directly
financial. For example, a member of someone&#146;s family might run a
company that could be affected by the introduction of personal
accounts, or there might be other non-financial conflicts of interest.
The only reason for having the words &#147;and other
interests&#148; is to give the Secretary of State the flexibility to
deal with any potential non-financial conflicts, having regard to legal
advice as
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07020141000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
for amendment No. 82, again there is no great mystery here. We are
replicating the financial remuneration framework that applies to
non-departmental public bodies, which gives the Secretary of State,
should he so determine, the flexibility to pay or make provision for
payment of pensions, allowances or gratuities to non-executive members
or their dependants, survivors, spouses or children. There is nothing
new about that; that is how we remunerate people generally, and we will
consider the exact remuneration package at a later
stage.</div>
					<a name="07020141000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have given the hon. Member for Eastbourne the information that he
wanted, and that I have dealt with all the amendments that we are
discussing with the clause. I thank hon. Members for tabling the
amendments; it is important that we have had a chance to discuss them,
and I hope that we have been able to allay any concerns. As I say, we
support the general thrust behind most of the amendments. We want hon.
Members involved at the very heart of personal accounts; their support
and confidence in the organisation will be central to making it a
success. They have asked genuinely open-minded questions about how that
should be done in the next phase of personal accounts. In this phase
there will be a nimble, small body that gives us advice based on the
best financial, consumer and other expertise. I urge hon. Members to
withdraw their amendments.</div>

								Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for going through
all the amendments in such detail. Let me try to pick up some of those
points as briefly as I am able, given the size of the group of
amendments&#151;the largest group that the Committee has considered
so far.</div>
					<a name="07020141000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for the clarification on Crown immunity. I was genuinely puzzled by
that, and I am now clear that the legal situation in terms of the
claims of the delivery authority will be quite different from that of
the board in due course. It is important that there is in due course a
separation between the body that is delivering personal accounts in the
long term and the Government of the day.</div>
					<a name="07020141000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am
disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reaction on freedom of
information. I suppose that all Ministers develop in that way
eventually, and it is rather upsetting to see this Minister, who is so
young, succumbing to what the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton
(Sir Gerald Kaufman) calls &#147;ministeritis&#148; in his
excellent book, &#147;How to be a Minister&#148;, the third edition
of which has just come out and which I commend to the Minister. Again,
this is not just some mad Tory obsession, or even a mad Liberal
Democrat obsession. It is a point initially raised by the Association
of British Insurers, which has a legitimate interest on behalf of its
many members. In a way, it suggests to me that the Government are now
stepping back.</div>
					<a name="07020141000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have all immensely enjoyed the succession of seminars, where there has
been cross-fertilisation between Ministers, officials, the industry and
others. It seems as if we are now going to take a step backwards. Given
that the body will be primarily delivering advice to Ministers about
the future shape of personal accounts, I cannot believe that it can
claim a monopoly of wisdom, expertise and experience in those matters.
I think that it is important that bodies such as the ABI and its
members, and many others such as <i class="I">Which?</i> or any body with an
interest, should have access to the documents. As for the ludicrous
examples given&#151;with due respect to the Minister&#151;I do not
know whether he has ever tried to make a freedom of information
application under this Government, but the notion that someone going
for an interview could get the questions in advance by putting in a
freedom of information application is just risible. I forget what the
other example was.</div>

that some exclusion can be crafted to put the Minister at ease on that.
All that we are talking about is people with a legitimate interest and
genuine expertise and knowledge of these matters having access to the
advice tendered to Ministers. My intention&#151;I am not quite sure
where it comes in our deliberations, Mr. Gale&#151;is to
press new clause 5 to a vote. I urge Opposition Members to join me on
that.</div>

Purnell:
						</b> I give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that we
want the authority to be open and consultative in everything that it
does. There may well be occasions when it wants to give advice in
confidence. I am sure that he can imagine circumstances in which it
would want to do that. That is why we think that freedom of information
should apply to this body in the same way that it applies to other
Government bodies.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020141000347"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I see that. I do not suggest that this is the
beginning of some slippery slope to a police state, any more than we
have one at the moment but without the police, but there is a genuine
issue here. I hope that whoever runs this body will have the good sense
to meet regularly with us. If consensus is to mean anything, it needs
to be a continuing process. I regard the position on freedom of
information as being counter consensual in that sense.</div>
					<a name="07020141000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that we can get round
that by having regular meetings with this bod or bods who will tell us
their troubles. We do not want to sweep into office in two or three
years&#146; time to find that they have been advising Ministers that
this whole thing is doomed to fail miserably. We will keep coming to
the seminars, because we are sad people with nothing else to do, but
also because they can be quite interesting. But I urge the Minister to
reconsider that
point.</div>
					<a name="07020141000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for the Minister&#146;s openness on the appointment procedures. I am
delighted to hear that he has Egon Zehnder on the case. I shall be
interested to see what comes from his discussions with that firm. I
assume that the usual rules about political affiliation will be
observed. I was grateful for his confirmation that the appointment can
be made only after Royal Assent. I suppose that any money can be spent
only then too. I hope that Egon Zehnder is aware of
that.</div>
					<a name="07020141000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
serious point about marketing experience. David Norgrove or Laurence
Churchill are both excellent and incredibly able and competent men, but
a different animal is needed here. I am not suggesting PY
Gerbeau, but we are looking for someone with a bit of pizzazz and
salesmanship and a marketing strength which is not required in
something like the Pension Protection Fund, which in effect has a
captive audience. That is the point that I was trying to make, if I can
put it in a
nutshell.</div>
					<a name="07020141000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
think that I am happy with the Minister&#146;s assurances about
consumer representation. He clearly stated that
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 281</div>the Government were also grateful for the input from <i class="I">Which?</i> and
others. As I said in my opening remarks, I can understand the argument
that we should not necessarily state in the Bill precisely who should
be taken on. The Minister reassured me enough that I shall not press
the amendments. I accept that the wealth and variety of experience
referred to in the amendments, as well as consumers&#146; views, will
be taken into account. That is a win for our point of
view.</div>
					<a name="07020141000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
earlier the &#163;21 million which, according to the RIA, has been
budgeted for the delivery authority between now and the next Bill. I
should have done so earlier, but let me say that I shall be immensely
grateful if the Minister will write to us with a breakdown of how that
figure was reached.</div>
					<a name="07020141000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was satisfied by what the Minister had to say on conflict of
interest&#151;he confirmed what he had had in mind. However, as he
says, the great bulk of such potential cases would be based on a
financial conflict of interest.</div>

appropriate moment on new clause 5.</div>
