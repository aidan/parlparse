<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 599, in page 28, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) each local access forum within their area;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 644, in page 28, line 44, leave out `where any long-distance route passes through their area'.<P>

<P>
No. 607, in page 28, line 46, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) organisations prescribed by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to receive public path and definitive map orders'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 645, in page 28, line 46, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ea) such bodies appearing to them to be representative of owners or occupiers of land;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 595, in page 29, line 1, after `as', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may be prescribed or as'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 596, in page 29, line 33, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```prescribed'' means prescribed by regulations;
<P>
``regulations'' means regulations made by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I intend to be relatively brief this morning. This is an important group of amendments. Clause 54(1)(f) provides that local highway authorities should consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other persons as they may consider appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments seek to qualify, in a variety of ways, those ``other persons'' who should be consulted about the preparation or review of a rights of way improvement plan.
<P>
Amendment No. 599 seeks to add the local access forum to that list. I am confident that the Minister will resist it, just as he has resisted every other attempt to have the words ``local access forum'' included in the Bill. That does not prevent me from being persistent.
<P>
I am a half-owner of amendment No. 644. I shall not speak to it. Instead, I shall allow the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) to speak to it, as he beat me to the table by about three seconds. Inspiration obviously struck us both at the same moment.
<P>
It is transparently obvious that the categories of persons to be consulted should include those who represent conservation and recreation interests, but there must be a read across from part I about access to open countryside and the rights of way network; it must include landowners. The amendments seek to explore the reasons why the Government left it entirely to the discretion of the local highway authority or the national park authority to decide which bodies were appropriate. I say that not because I want an exhaustive or prescriptive list, but because it is self-evident that various other categories should be consulted. I believe that they would be better mentioned in the Bill rather than later in regulations or guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said, he tabled an identical amendment immediately after I tabled amendment No. 644.
<P>
Clause 54 requires highway authorities to consult a number of bodies on their rights of way improvement plans—including, if a long-distance route passes through the area, the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales. The corollary is clear: if no long-distance route passes through the area, the highway authority need not consult those bodies.
<P>
The Minister's intention may be meant as a kindness to the Countryside Agency or its sister organisation in Wales, but it is an unnecessary kindness. The briefing that hon. Members received from the Countryside Agency says that the agency positively wants to be consulted about every rights of way improvement plan. Although the briefing received from the Countryside Council for Wales does not use the same words, it says that someone should be responsible for the overall coordination of improvement plans and that if it is not the Countryside Council for Wales or its sister organisation, the Secretary of State should do so under the provisions of clause 61. The Secretary of State might wish to be relieved of that obligation.
<P>
There are good reasons why the Minister should accept amendment No. 644 and allow the two organisations to which it refers to be consulted on all rights of way improvement plans. They relate to consistency and quality. None of the consultees specified in the clause will receive every rights of way improvement plan as a matter of course. The amendment would add to the clause the only consultees that would see all the plans and which could compare them, ensure consistency, promulgate best practice and draw attention to those who are lacking their duties. The amendment is, therefore, modest but desirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I rise to speak to amendments Nos. 607 and 645, which were tabled in the names of myself and of other Opposition Members. Clearly, there is a general belief that the list contained in the clause is inadequate, and various ways of amending it have been proposed.
<P>
Amendment No. 645 would require bodies that appear
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to be representative of owners or occupiers of the land<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be included in the consultation. Such a requirement is a natural courtesy for the parties whose land is affected. Furthermore, it would be a travesty of justice if owners and occupiers, or their representatives, were not informed of what was happening and woke up one morning to find that a change had been made in relation to a footpath or a right of way across their land, even though they had not been consulted. The amendment is self-explanatory.
<P>
Amendment No. 607 seeks to achieve an aim that is generally in line with Government thinking, as it would ensure that the same phraseology is used in different pieces of legislation. It would include in the list of bodies to be consulted any organisations prescribed by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to receive public path and definitive map orders.<P>

<P>
Obviously, the 1981 Act contains a list of such organisations, although I would suggest one or two additions. The fundamental point is this: if that Act deemed it right for particular organisations to be consulted on public path and definitive map orders, precisely the same list should be used for consultation on rights of way improvement plans.
<P>
The idea for amendment No. 645 came from a group of organisations: the Byways and Bridleways Trust, the National Federation of Bridleway Associations, the British Horse Society, the Cyclists Touring Club and the South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust. Those organisations worked together on the proposal, which drew the 1981 provision to my attention. Its inclusion in the clause is an eminently sensible idea, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will take this opportunity to provide consistency between two similar items of legislation.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I bring good news. I have no difficulty with the aims of amendment No. 644, which would ensure that the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales were consulted during the preparation of all plans, rather than just on those which affect areas where there are national trails. We are willing to consider that approach.
<P>
I entirely agree with the sentiments behind all the other amendments. We expect local authorities to consult widely in the preparation of their plans and on the draft versions. However, the amendments collectively show the difficulty of prescribing every organisation that should be consulted and provide a wide range of possibilities. We believe that local authorities should have some discretion in deciding whom they should consult, but we accept that there may be a case for ensuring that certain key organisations, such as those which represent user groups and land managers, can give their views at an early stage in the plan preparation process. We consider it better to include a regulation-making power in the Bill than to list the organisations in the clause, as amendment No. 645 proposes, or to link them to bodies that are currently entitled to receive notice of orders, as amendment No. 607 apparently seeks to do.
<P>
We are, therefore, willing to consider amendments Nos. 595 and 596, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), as well as amendment No. 644. Having given that assurance, which I think also answers the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), I hope that all the amendments in the group will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary has been helpful and I appreciate his point. Amendment No. 607 was tabled in an attempt to create consistency, with which objective the Under-Secretary was sympathetic, but if he will not accept the amendment for the reason that he just gave—that it would be wrong to make such a prescription in the Bill—the logic is that the 1981 Act should also be amended. As I understand it, nothing in the Bill changes the list prescribed in the 1981 Act, but if that is good enough for the 1981 Act, it should be good enough for the Bill, and vice versa. There is no logic in having one system for public path and definitive map orders and a separate system for rights of way improvement plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Obviously, I acknowledge that helpful answer from the Under-Secretary. The determination not to give local access for any statutory basis is causing the Government to tie themselves in knots. Such a provision would have encompassed all the bodies that the Under-Secretary seeks to prescribe in regulation. The amendment seemed to suggest a more sensible approach. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire raised the issue of inconsistency, which the Government might like to address at a later stage. However, I acknowledge the Under-Secretary's positive response and his acceptance in principle of amendment No. 644.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I intervene to respond to the point raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. I am advised that we can specify all the relevant bodies, including those about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned, in a new set of regulations, and we would prefer to do that in regulations rather than in the Bill. That would be consistent with the 1981 Act to which the hon. Gentleman referred.

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for that contribution. It seems that Ministers who once eschewed the idea of regulation now embrace it. However, that approach will be useful on this occasion, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Clause 56</center></H4>
<H4><center>ENFORCEMENT OF DUTY TO PREVENT OBSTRUCTION</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 646, in page 30, line 3, leave out from `person' to end of line 7 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who alleges, as respects any highway for which a local highway authority other than an inner London authority are the highway authority—
<P>
(a) that the highway falls within subsection (2), and
<P>
(b) that it is obstructed by an obstruction to which this section applies, 
<P>
may serve on the highway authority notice requesting them to secure the removal of the obstruction from the highway.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 585, in page 30, line 6, leave out `within subsection (2) below'.
<P>
No. 586, in page 30, line 8, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
No. 643, in page 30, leave out lines 9 to 11 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a way shown in a definitive map and statement as a footpath, bridleway, restricted byway, or byway open to all traffic.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Clause 56 introduces a new procedure, which will allow members of the public to enforce through the magistrates court a local highway authority's duty to prevent as many obstructions as possible. Currently, a complainant must go to the High Court. We hope that that will encourage local authorities to be more active in keeping rights of way free from obstruction.
<P>
Government amendment No. 646 is, in part, a restructuring exercise. It makes it clear that the complainant requests, rather than requires, the removal of the obstruction, as, under this provision, that is not a matter for the courts. It also makes it clear that a local highway authority will not be relieved of its duty to serve appropriate notices under new section 130A(5) if the complainant is wrong about any matters to which the notice relates. For example, new sections 130A and 130B will apply only to obstructions that are without lawful authority. A member of the public might not be able to establish for certain that an obstruction is unlawful, but we would not want that to cripple his whole application.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 585 and 586 are related. They would remove the requirement that notice may be served only in respect of obstructions to particular types of highway: footpaths, bridleways, restricted byways and ways shown as byways open to all traffic on a definitive map. They would also allow for an order to be made by a magistrates court in respect of any highway for which a local authority was responsible. That would considerably widen the operation of clause 56 and could lead to highway authorities being swamped with notices, but authorities must retain a reasonable degree of control over their priorities. Part II is principally, although not wholly, about rights of way, which we believe are the best focus for clause 56.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 643 would restrict the application of clause 56 to rights of way that have been recorded on definitive maps, so whereas the previous set of amendments sought to widen the powers in the clause, this amendment would narrow the new powers. We are constantly being told that there are parts of the country in which few rights of way have been recorded, and the amendment would provide an incentive for local authorities not to record rights of way. Only once a right of way were recorded could a member of the public take action under these provisions to enforce compliance with a highway authority's duty to prevent obstructions. That would undermine the provision's objective, which is to encourage local highway authorities to take effective action to tackle obstructions to rights of way, whether or not they are recorded on definitive maps.
<P>
I agree that we do not want people to bypass the definitive maps procedure by applying to the courts under clause 56 to resolve disputes about the existence of a highway. However, the Bill includes provisions to reduce such opportunities, and those provisions relate to the situation in which the existence of a highway is seriously disputed. For the reasons that I have given, I invite hon. Members to withdraw amendments Nos. 585, 586 and 643.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): The Under-Secretary's description of amendment No. 643 is slightly unfair. He said that the clause provides important new powers to tackle obstructions on rights of way but, as I am sure he is aware, there is a risk that the clause could cause contention and undermine attempts to secure a complete and accurate definitive map, which must be the goal that we all seek.
<P>
As it is currently drafted, the clause provides that the new powers can be exercised in relation to any public footpath or bridleway, whether or not it is shown on the definitive map. As the Under-Secretary admitted, that means that someone could try to secure the removal of an obstruction from a path, the status of which is disputed, without being required to clarify its status by seeking a modification order. In other words, the clause could provide a means by which to assert rights of way without going through the proper procedures. If an authority were to act on an application relating to a right of way that was not shown on a definitive map, it would be accepting that the path sustained public rights, a fact that might be disputed by the owner or by other local people. If, subsequently, the authority did not make a definitive map modification order to add the path to the definitive map, contention over the path's status would continue indefinitely.
<P>
Surely, good government should recognise the importance of clarifying the status of paths before taking action to remove obstructions on them. The amendment would resolve those problems by providing that the new power to remove obstructions would be exercisable only in relation to paths shown on definitive maps. If someone believed that such a path existed and that it was obstructed, their first action would be to seek a modification order to add it to the definitive map. Once that had been done, action could be taken to remove the obstruction, with everyone involved knowing that the path had formal status as a public right of way. Apart from the practical preferability of the procedure, the amendment would ensure that the provisions in relation to footpaths, bridleways and restricted byways would be brought into line with those proposed for byways open to all traffic under new section 130A(2)(b). The new power would be applied consistently in relation to all public rights of way.
<P>
I take it from what the Under-Secretary has said that he is not minded to accept the amendment. However, I urge him to reflect on the fact that it would add the consistency lacking in parts of the Bill as currently drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I understand that the Under-Secretary is not minded to accept amendments Nos. 585 and 586 because they widen the scope of the clause to beyond the limit that the Government feel necessary. The two amendments would, by applying the provision to all highways, ensure a simple approach that would make the procedures under the clause more comparable to section 56 of the Highways Act 1980. The Act enables any member of the public to serve notice on a highway authority to secure the maintenance of a highway. I had hoped that simplification of the clause and comparability with the Act would commend the amendments to the Under-Secretary. I would welcome any comment from him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I want to ask the Under-Secretary about Government amendment No. 646 and why the term ``alleges'' is interpolated in the clause. The original wording suggested certainty about the facts of a case—that there was an obstruction on a pathway. ``Alleges'' is a more nebulous term suggesting a simple assertion on the part of the complainant with or without supporting evidence. I query whether the term is appropriate in the context of the contentious aspect of the Bill, under which there will undoubtedly be several claims. It might be better to require higher proof from the complainant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> In answer to the first point, I repeat what I said before. One set of amendments widens the clause unacceptably and the other narrows it. We are taking the third way—or even the third byway. The provisions ensure that no order can be made when there is a serious dispute about the status of a way. They are designed to enforce the duty to prevent obstructions, which arises whether or not a highway is on the definitive map. We want to keep that situation.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 508, in page 30, line 10, after `as' insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a restricted byway or'.—[Mr. Meacher.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 587, in page 30, line 15, leave out `or 154' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, 154, 164 or Schedule 12A'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As presently drafted, the Bill allows for notice to be served only in respect of limited classes of obstruction. In particular, it does not cover disturbances to the surface of a path caused, for instance, by ploughing, crops being grown on the line of a path, or barbed wire that is likely to be injurious to users if it is alongside paths. Improvements were introduced by the Rights of Way Act 1990 but the ploughing and cropping of paths remain among the biggest problems for users of rights of way. Extending the provision so that it could address those problems would help. As it does not cover cases of disturbance to the surface of a path, the clause could not be used if developers began to dig foundations for buildings across public rights of way. Schedule 12A to the Highways Act 1980 covers disturbances of the highway, including ploughing, and the amendment would include that schedule in clause 56. Barbed wire alongside paths can be a nuisance to all users and a particular menace to horse riders. Section 164 of the Highways Act 1980 deals with barbed wire and the amendment would make it relevant under clause 56.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not disagree with my hon. Friend about the problems that he wants to deal with by the amendment. The question is whether they amount to obstructions. The new sections 130A and 130B to be introduced into the Highways Act 1980 by clause 56 are intended to encourage local authorities to comply with their general duty under section 130 of the Act, to keep their highways as far as possible free from obstructions. Section 164 of the same Act, to which the amendment refers, is concerned with abating a nuisance caused by barbed wire on land adjoining a highway. That does not appear to fall within the classic definition of an obstruction, which would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>something which permanently or temporarily removes the whole or part of a highway from public use altogether.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would also insert schedule 12A of the Highways Act 1980 in the list of relevant provisions. That schedule relates to disturbance to the surface of highways, which is treated more generally as a nuisance, rather than narrowly as an obstruction. In any event, I am not sure that clause 56 offers the best way to deal with problems caused by the failure of land managers to carry out their duty under section 134 of the 1980 Act to restore the surface of a ploughed footpath or bridleway within the required period. The procedures under clause 56 necessarily take a little time to work through. The recipients of a notice must have time to respond. Although the clause is entirely suited to dealing with obstructions that are by their nature likely to last for a time, it may not be the most effective way of dealing with a ploughed footpath. By the time one got to court the crops might have surfaced. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> There could be arguments about when nuisance becomes obstruction, but in view of the Minister's comments I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 588, in page 30, line 22, leave out from `of' to end of line 27 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a permanent building which is in use as a dwelling'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 609, in page 30, leave out lines 23 to 27 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a permanent building'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 610, in page 30, leave out lines 25 to 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Amendment No. 588 deals with a form of obstruction that I mentioned on Second Reading. Clause 56 will not apply if the obstruction is part of a building or any other structure that it appears may be used as a dwelling. The effect of the general exclusion of buildings is illustrated by a recent and well-publicised case in East Sussex where a barn obstructing a path over land once owned by Mr. Nicholas van Hoogstraten could not be subject to such a notice. The current exclusions are too limited. My amendment proposes that the only exclusion in respect of buildings would be for permanent buildings that are in use as dwellings.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I rise to address amendment Nos. 609 and 610 in my name and the names of my hon. Friends. First, however, I would like to comment on the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion that has similar aims to ours. Opposition members of the Committee are wholly opposed to people intentionally obstructing footpaths by whatever means. In addition to the well-publicised case to which the hon. Gentleman referred, there are many examples of developers often unwittingly building properties across footpaths. In some cases, the footpath runs in the front door and out the back and some people who are obsessed with rights of way then insist on using it. Common sense must be applied to the issue and later in the Bill we will discuss methods of ensuring that. Therefore, it is sensible for dwelling houses to be excluded.
<P>
Amendment No. 609 has a similar purpose to the hon. Gentleman's amendment in that it seeks to remove all of subsection (4) except for a permanent building. Amendment No. 610 would remove the subsection altogether. The reasoning behind the amendments relates to a problem in my constituency that I know is also a problem for many other hon. Members. It involves travellers.
<P>
There are many green lanes in the southern part of my constituency and many droves in the Fens in the north. Many of those green lanes and droves are classified as footpaths or bridleways; some are classified as RUPPs, or roads used as public paths. Travellers often camp in them. The consequences for other users are serious. First, the number of caravans and people are an affront to the pleasant scenery of the area. The terrible mess that travellers leave only exacerbates that. If one visits a green lane after they have left, one often finds that the hedges have been cut down and burnt and there are piles of human detritus, food waste, empty bottles and other items, which the local authority have to clear.
<P>
Secondly, the travellers are intimidating. Over the years, many people have told me that they are unable to walk down a green lane when travellers are encamped on it because they feel intimidated. Many of those who enjoy walking are pensioners who are past their physical best in terms of an altercation, so they feel intimidated by those groups of people. There are often groups of dogs running loose which are also intimidating.
<P>
I have no problem and nor do my constituents with the genuine gypsy, the Romany, who has parked at a certain site for years as part of their normal rotation of sites. They are acceptable. However, other groups are much less acceptable. When I read clause 56, I was worried by the exclusion as drafted which refers to any building, including temporary ones or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other structure . . . which it appears may be used as a dwelling.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This will mean that a traveller encampment on a green lane, bridleway or whatever cannot be removed. In other words, it is excluded from the enforcement duty. That seems contrary to what the majority of people would want. My amendments offer alternative ways of addressing this serious issue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy):</B> I have sympathy with the hon., Gentleman's point, but the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 covers his concerns. Large groups of new age travellers have often visited—I would not say invaded—my constituency and there have been unfortunate incidents. However, the 1994 Act deals with that problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman's experience is the same as mine. The Bill places a duty of enforcement on a local authority. The 1994 Act makes enforcement an option. At least one of my district councils is fairly useless at doing anything about the problem, which it leaves to fester. The hon. Gentleman's district councils might be more willing to use their powers. I want to require them to act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I hear the hon. Gentleman, but the 1994 Act makes such action a criminal offence and therefore a police matter. It is not, strictly speaking, a matter for a local authority. He is right about local authorities, hence the need to change the law, but provision has been made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 588, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion, would alter the exclusions in new section 130A. Only permanent structures that are used as dwellings would be excluded. Consequently, caravans, tents and buildings such as barns would not be excluded. The amendment is inappropriate. The management of unauthorised camping is extremely sensitive because it can raise public order issues. We would not want a member of the public to be able to force a local authority into taking hurried action that could put its officers at risk. The Home Office and my Department have jointly produced detailed guidance for local authorities on managing unauthorised camping. It is a serious problem and too large to be dealt with in the Bill, as I am sure the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire would agree. It is best to tackle such problems in a considered manner as part of the overall strategy of individual authorities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) covered the point that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made about travellers. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 empowers local authorities to direct campers to leave land. In addition, section 61 allows the police to remove trespassers from land if they are intending to take up residence, have been asked to leave by the landowner and have caused damage or used threatening behaviour. I know that the law is operated imperfectly. We receive many complaints from hon. Members about difficulties in their constituencies, but the answer does not lie in the Bill. It is not intended to deal with the serious problems that arise from travellers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I accept that the Bill is not the principal vehicle for dealing with the problem, but it allows a possible way out for travellers if they decide to pursue the matter in court. More importantly, the Under-Secretary said that the 1994 Act ``empowers'', but that is not enough. It is all very well issuing guidelines, but many district councils do not follow them. I sought to deal with the problem through the amendment, but it is by no means the only way. I understand that the police will act only if the district council or the landowner asks them to do so, so a political initiative will be required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Of course, damage and threatening behaviour can be dealt with under other measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It has to be proved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it has to be proved. Yes, we live in a society that needs evidence for whatever proposition once seeks to advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): I intervene to point out that the amendment draws attention to a serious distinction. I entirely agree that this is not the time or place to resolve the issue of travellers, but the amendment seems to suggest that the ordinary citizen has a right to claim that an obstruction is taking place and to pursue that claim through the courts rather than relying on the local authority to use its powers, should it choose to exercise them. In my experience, many ordinary citizens would want to be able to take action if their individual rights were placed at risk by irresponsible travellers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I completely understand what my hon. Friend says. It is a large problem. The law operates imperfectly. It is not a question of passing new laws but of existing ones being properly enforced. I repeat that the Bill is not the place to address the real problems that I readily acknowledge are caused by unauthorised camping by travellers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I apologise for my late arrival this morning I had duties elsewhere.
<P>
The Minister may be interested to know that I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The matter was discussed at huge length, and I believe that that Act contains the powers necessary to deal with the sort of problem raised by my hon. Friend. The trouble is that the police do not always choose to use those powers. Consistency is needed in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman repeats what I said. It is not a question of needing new powers. The powers already exist. It is a question of enforcement. However, we must remember that circumstances vary between cases. Nevertheless, those powers will not solve the problem caused by travellers who are obstructing a right of way; to avoid the measures proposed by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), they could simply move off the right of way and onto the land next door. We would then have the same problem somewhere else. I do not propose to prolong the debate, as all hon. Members knows that this is not the place to deal with such problems.
<P>
Finally, I shall deal with Mr. van Hoogstraten's barn. Powers already exist under the Highways Act and the Town and Country Planning Act. We are not removing the discretion of the authorities to take the appropriate action. Again, this is not the place to debate the matter. The powers already exist, so I must ask my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary spoke about the powers that exist under other legislation, but we need to ensure that the relevant authorities implement it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 647, in page 30, leave out lines 38 to 41 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) so far as reasonably practicable, on every person who it appears to them may be for the time being responsible for the obstruction, a notice informing that person that a notice under subsection (1) above has been served in relation to it and stating what, if any, action the authority propose to take.
<P>
(5A) For the purposes of subsection (5)(b) above the persons responsible for an obstruction include any person who has possession or control of it or who may be required to remove it.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to new section 130A(5). Although it is technical, it serves to protect in the first instance the anonymity of the complainant. It achieves that by removing the present obligation on a local authority to send a copy of any notice of complaint to whoever the authority believes should be required to remove the obstruction. Such notices must state the name and address of the complainant. Under the proposed change, the local authority will be required to serve notice that it has received a complaint. In that way, the anonymity of the complainant will be preserved at the initial stage, thereby encouraging people who might fear retribution or pressure to withdraw their complaint to come forward.
<P>
Amendment No. 647 would ensure that local highway authorities were not under an absolute duty to serve notice on the person responsible for any obstruction. The duty is tempered. It would require them to serve notice as far as is reasonably practicable as an authority might be unable to identify the person concerned. Finally, the amendment widens the duty on the local authority, requiring them to notify whoever appears in their view to be responsible for the obstruction. The present wording of the clause covers only those who may be required to remove the obstruction and therefore may not cover all those responsible for a lawful obstruction.
<P>
I hope the hon. Members will agree that this is a sensible amendment and will accept it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 611, in page 31, line 28, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, having regard to the number and seriousness of obstructions in respect of which they have such a duty'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 590, in page 31, line 44, leave out from `time' to end of line 46.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendment is an attempt to make life easier for the highway authorities. Under clause 56, they are given powers to enforce their duties regarding public paths. New section 130A of the 1980 Act suggests how they go about that and outlines their obligations. Our amendment proposes that in performing those duties a highway authority should consider the number and seriousness of obstructions in respect of which it was obliged to enforce clearing. In practice, there may be more than one obstruction within any highway authority's jurisdiction. As it stands, the Bill places an equal duty on a highway authority to clear all obstructions at once. Indeed, the Bill requires it to take action. As a result, individuals concerned about a particular obstruction could try to insist—conceivably through the courts—that the highway authority acted as fast as possible, and that could result in unnecessary conflict. As the highway authorities are unlikely to receive the resources to enable them to clear every obstruction immediately, they will have to make invidious choices. That will mean breaking the terms of the Bill as it stands. The amendment would allow them to make sensible decisions on the order in which to enforce clearances and to carry out the most serious first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I speak to amendment No. 590. At present, the clause is too lenient with inefficient highway authorities. To allow highway authorities to have regard to the number and seriousness of obstructions would provide a get-out clause for authorities that have a heavy backlog of obstructions to clear and have not carried out their statutory duties properly in the past.
<P>
I cite as an example the case of East Sussex county council, the authority responsible for large parts of the south downs. A report to the council last month stated that there were 2,092 miles of footpaths, bridleways and byways; 540 of the paths and byways are currently impassable because of obstacles and another 850 of them have smaller blockages that make them difficult to use. One of the blockages has already been referred to this morning and is the responsibility of Mr. van Hoogstraten. The council estimates that it will take 20 years to clear the backlog at its current rate of work. It should not be given additional comfort from the wording of clause 56.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 611 would amend new section 130B(3) to make it an express requirement for the court, when making an order under the subsection, to have regard to the number and seriousness of the obstructions that a local highway authority has a duty to remove. The requirement would be unnecessary because, in making an order, we would expect a court to have regard to such factors. I am advised that courts would not impose unrealistic requirements. I must therefore ask for the amendment to be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment No. 590, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion, seeks to remove the express requirement that a court, when considering a defence under new section 130B(5)(b) of the Highways Act 1980, should have regard to the number and seriousness of obstructions that a local highway authority has a duty to remove. The defence allows a local highway authority to resist an application for an order if it can show that the obstruction will be removed within a reasonable time under arrangements that it has made. It is unclear whether my hon. Friend's amendment would necessarily achieve that aim because the court might interpret what is a reasonable time by reference to the number and seriousness of obstructions with which a local highway must deal.
<P>
The provision is important—a local authority might have to tackle a large number of obstructions, as the authority that my hon. Friend mentioned obviously does, under a properly funded programme. The courts should consider that factor when deciding whether to make an order. The intention of the clause is not to interfere with local authorities taking a responsible approach to their duties. Nor is it to provide local authorities not taking a responsible approach with an excuse for getting out of their duties. Its primary intention is to make local highway authorities improve the way in which they comply with their duty under section 130(3) of the Highways Act 1980 to prevent obstructions, as far as is possible. I am afraid that I must ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I note my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary's points about the intentions of the clause and I urge that, once the legislation is in place, his Department monitors carefully the way in which highway authorities use their powers under this and other legislation. However, in view of the comments made, I shall not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hear what the Under-Secretary says and am grateful for the reassurance that the courts will act sensibly and will not put highway authorities in invidious positions. We will have to see what happens in practice. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 589, in page 31, line 33, leave out from first `that' to end of line 37 and insert

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following: Government amendments Nos. 550 and 551.
<P>
Amendment No. 612, in page 31, line 35, after `disputed', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, an entry in the definitive map and statement of a way specified in subsection (2) of that section being conclusive as to its status for the purposes of this section'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 648 and 649.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> The amendment follows from my earlier attempt to remove subsection (2) which refers to a restricted range of highways. It would bring the Bill into line with section 56 of the Highways Act 1980, which can be used to secure the maintenance of a highway. That provision requires a member of the public to satisfy the magistrates that the route in question is a highway that is maintainable at public expense and that it is out of repair for an order to be made. I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider bringing the two items of legislation into line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I rise to speak in support of amendments Nos. 550, 551 and 612.
<P>
The amendments are not hugely important, but they raise issues that we should probe for a moment. Amendment No. 550 is very minor, and would improve the grammar of the clause by removing the phrase ``the fact that'', which seems an odd one to be used in law. Amendment No. 551 has a similar aim, and would remove the phrase ``is not seriously disputed'', which seems to depend on a highly subjective judgment. Who decides what is serious? Is it the seriousness with which the individual claimant disputes the matter or does it relate to a fine balance of judgment on whether the way in question is a footpath? There is far too much room for manoeuvre and subjectivity in the phrase, which could cause conflict when in operation.
<P>
Amendment No. 612 depends upon an assumption that I hope to be unnecessary, namely that the Government will resist amendment No. 551. If they do resist that amendment, amendment No. 612 would provide some definition for the phrase ``seriously disputed'' by emphasising that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an entry in the definitive map and statement<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is conclusive proof of its status. Such a definition should ensure that there is no serious dispute about whether a way exists. The amendment requires no other introduction than that of raising the profile of the phrase ``seriously disputed'', which our legal advisers tell us to be uncommon in law. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), from whose legal wisdom the Committee has often benefited, nods in agreement. The amendments seek to help the Government out of a little mess.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are always grateful for help, from whatever quarter it may come. I ask the Committee to resist amendments Nos. 589 and 612, but I can accept amendments Nos. 550 and 551.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 589, 550 and 551 seek to change the basis upon which a court can make an order under new section 130B(3) of the Highways Act 1980 to require a local highway authority to take steps to secure the removal of an obstruction. The clause provides that an order requiring the removal of an obstruction can be made only if the court is satisfied that there is no serious dispute about whether the obstruction is obstructing a highway within the categories referred to in new section 130A.
<P>
The amendments would require the courts to address serious disputes on the existence of a highway and decide that question for themselves. They are familiar with the phrase ``seriously disputed'' in relation to the duty in section 130 of the Highways Act 1980, and they will understand it. We have not provided for that in the clause because we do not want to encourage people to use the new procedure to resolve disputes about the existence and nature of highways. Parliament has expressly established the definitive map procedure for resolving such disputes and we do not want to encourage people to bypass that by using a measure that is designed for a different purpose. I think that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire understands that.
<P>
The duty on a highway authority to prevent obstructions is set out in section 130 of the 1980 Act. It does not arise if there is a serious dispute about whether a highway exists. The local highway authority could use that in its defence to argue that it has no duty to remove an obstruction under new section 130B(5)(a). However, we are happy to support amendments Nos. 550 and 551, which are necessary for Government amendments Nos. 648 and 649—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Government have added their name to amendments Nos. 550 and 551.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 648 and 649 put the burden of proof on the local highway authority to show that there is no serious dispute.
<P>
Amendment No. 612 would establish that a right of way shown on the definitive map of a footpath should be presumed to be a footpath and nothing else for the purposes of proceedings in new section 130B. There is no reason to depart from the general rule that the definitive map is not conclusive evidence of greater rights. The burden of proof should be on whoever is asserting those higher rights.
<P>
Government amendment No. 648 removes any implication that the burden of proof is on a complainant to show that there is no serious dispute about whether the obstruction is on a highway of the types referred to in new section 130A(2) before an order is obtained. The local highway authority must prove that there is no serious dispute, and it is best placed to produce evidence on that issue.
<P>
Government amendment No. 649 relates to amendment No. 648. Section 130(3) of the 1980 Act places a duty on highway authorities to prevent, as far as possible, obstructions from occurring. However, the courts have ruled that there is no duty under section 130 if there is a serious dispute that a highway is in fact a highway. In addition, the phrase ``on any other grounds'' is a tidying up measure. It confirms the relationship between the two provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> In view of my hon. Friend's decision to accept two of the amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 550, in page 31, line 33, leave out `the fact that'.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 650, in page 31, line 46, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where an application is dismissed by virtue of paragraph (za), (a) or (b) of subsection (5) above the court, in determining whether and if so how to exercise its power under section 64(1) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 (costs), shall have particular regard to any failure by the highway authority to give the applicant appropriate notice of and information about the grounds relied on by the authority under that paragraph.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 591, in page 31, line 46, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) A court shall not have power to make an order for costs against an applicant who has satisfied it as to the matters specified in subsection (4).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Government amendment No. 650 reduces the risk that members of the public might be deterred from seeking an order of the court because they fear that costs will be awarded against them. It is a general rule in litigation that the court should have the power to award costs in favour of the party that wins the case so that the unsuccessful party pays. New section 130B(5) provides several defences for the local highway authority against an application for an order. For example, no order can be made if the authority satisfies the court that it has no obligation to remove the obstruction, under its general duty under section 130(3) of the Highways Act 1980, or that it has arranged to have the obstruction removed within a reasonable time. The authority will probably know the facts forming the basis of such a defence—and whether it plans to rely on that defence.
<P>
The amendment would encourage pre-trial disclosure by the local highway authority by requiring the court, in exercising its discretion whether to award costs to a successful local highway authority, to have particular regard to an authority's failure to give the applicant advance notice of its defence. That would reinforce the current position, in which such a failure would have to be taken into account, by giving increased importance to such a factor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I welcome Government amendment No. 650, but I hope that Ministers will see the justice of removing the final potential financial deterrent to applications, as amendment No. 591 would provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Amendment No. 591 would remove the magistrates court's discretion to award costs under section 64 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 in cases which were brought under clause 56 and which, despite the applicant's proving various matters necessary to obtain an order, were successfully defended by the local authority. We see no grounds for that. It is not inconceivable that some complainants would act unreasonably, and we would not expect their costs to be met from the public purse. The Government amendments that have been tabled to clause 56 provide several safeguards and I hope that my hon. Friend will agree not to press his amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 592, in page 32, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) It shall be the duty of the local highway authority to monitor from time to time the compliance with any order made under subsection (1) above, and to bring proceedings under subsection (4) if the obstruction is not removed within the time specified in the order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has long been a matter of frustration to user groups and individuals that, even after they have gone to the effort and expense of bringing a private prosecution for obstruction of the highway, usually because of being unable to persuade the highway authority to deal with it, magistrates have no power, on the conviction of the person responsible for the obstruction, to order its removal. Again I cite the van Hoogstraten case in which the company owning the land was found guilty, fined £800 on each of two charges of obstruction and ordered to pay £3,500 costs to the Ramblers Association, which fought the case. However, the court could do nothing about the obstructions as they are a matter for the local highway authority.
<P>
The provision is sensible and cost-effective and could be made even more helpful by the addition of a duty on the relevant highway authority to monitor compliance with any order made by the magistrates, whether or not the authority brought the initial proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I agree with my hon. Friend about the importance of ensuring compliance with court orders. We expect that the new magistrates courts' power, under clause 57, to order someone convicted of wilfully obstructing a highway to remove the obstruction, will reduce the number of obstructions on rights of way and other highways. We cannot accept the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion for a number of reasons. First, not every prosecution under section 137 of the Highways Act 1980 will be brought by a local highway authority. Members of the public and the Crown Prosecution Service may bring prosecutions. It is not clear how, in practice, a local highway authority could monitor all such orders.
<P>
More fundamentally, it is not appropriate that a local highway authority should be obliged to prosecute every breach of an order. Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 provides local authorities with a discretion to prosecute where they consider it to be in the interests of the local residents. We see no reason to remove the discretion in the particular case of highway obstructions.
<P>
Moreover, in exercising their discretion to prosecute, local highway authorities, like any other local authority, should have regard to the Crown Prosecution Service's code of practice for Crown prosecutions. The code advises that the decision to prosecute an individual is a serious step and that fair and effective prosecution is essential to law and order. Each case is unique and must be considered on its own merits. A decision must be taken before a prosecution as to whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute and whether it is in the public interest to do so. The amendment would mean that those factors would not be considered. I am in sympathy with what my hon. Friend wants to do. However, in practice, a local highway authority, which has spent time and money on bringing a successful prosecution, will keep an eye on what happens afterwards. If they fail to do so, others will do it for them. If an order is not obeyed, an authority will have to decide whether there is a case to bring a further prosecution. I hope that, in the light of that, my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> I am sure the Ramblers Association and others, including myself will keep a close eye on the particular case I cited in moving the amendment. In view of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
