                           </strong> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr Streeter. I hope you
had a pleasant weekend. For a brief moment, we had a Labour majority in
Committee, but I am pleased to see that the Conservative Whip has done
a fine job. For the record, he was outside the room, but I was briefly
reminded of the good old days when we had a Labour majority.
C’est la
vie.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are important. I hope the Committee will fully debate their
substance and reflect the views of both the Opposition and the
Government. For the avoidance of doubt, I will commence with the points
that I made on Thursday. We believe that clause 1 is damaging and we
oppose it. We tabled the amendments to try to mitigate the effects of
the clause. If the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 160<a class="bkMark" name="Column160">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Committee accepts them, we will reflect on that. If not, we will
continue to oppose the clause. We are simply considering how we can try
to salvage something from the abolition of the child trust fund. The
key areas are looked-after children, children with disabilities and
children who form the poorest third of our society. If we can salvage
those areas, we will support an amended version of the Bill. I am
moving a long way from what the Labour Government did in office and
what Labour Members wish to see in practice. I do that for pragmatic
reasons, because we want to try to salvage something from the Bill to
ensure that we can help the groups of individuals that the amendments
cover.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
20 revises the August amendment date to ensure that children born on or
after 3 January 2011, who are in the care of a local authority or
similar body, remain eligible for the child trust fund. Amendment 21
ensures that we do the same for children in receipt of disability
living allowance. Amendment 22 ensures that children born on or after 3
January 2011, who live in the poorest third of households, remain
eligible. I wish to speak about each
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
20 is important because it deals with a group of individuals who are
potentially the most vulnerable in our society and who are currently in
receipt of the child trust fund. They are in care, predominantly
because they do not have parents who are responsible for them; because
the state has deemed that their parents are incapable of managing and
supporting them, or for a range of other associated reasons. Each year,
about 6,000 children become part of the care population of the United
Kingdom, which currently stands at around 86,000. For some, escaping
abuse or neglect may be a relief, as I mentioned previously. Others
will be split from their families because of illness, poverty or
overwhelming problems that mean that the parents cannot look after
their child. Life for such children is difficult, whether they are in
an institutional setting or in the care of foster families. Thankfully,
a minority are in institutions; about three quarters are in foster
families.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to recent statistics from the Department for Education, the Scottish
Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive, we
have 64,400 children in care in England and 15,288 in care in Scotland.
In my home region of Wales, we have 5,162 and in Northern Ireland 1,653
children were in care as of 31 March 2010.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The child
trust fund was established by the Labour Government in 2002; in 2008,
they introduced additional payments for those children looked after in
care to help support the needs that they would meet at the age of 18,
when they matriculated. If the Bill is enacted, children in care could
still be looked after, even with the abolition of clause 1, on 3
January 2029—18 years after the enactment of the Bill. We are
considering a long-term proposal for supporting children in care and
looked-after children. Whatever the outcome of our debate on the
amendment, the mechanism to support looked-after children from 2002 to
2011 will still be maintained for that
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
the regulations of 20 July, which the Minister and I debated in depth
on that date, a looked-after child would have received £500 as
the initial payment and £100 for each continuous year the child
is looked after in the care of a local authority, or a health trust in
Northern Ireland. From 2008, the Labour Government 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 161<a class="bkMark" name="Column161">&#160;</a>
                           </div>provided £500 and an annual payment of £100 for children
in care. For someone in care for the whole 18 years, that would have
been a considerable lump sum to help support them whatever their
objectives on leaving
care.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Financial Secretary knows that children leaving care are often the most
vulnerable children. They will still face challenges and have more
chances of going to prison, of ending up in poverty and of experiencing
drug abuse, despite the fact that the care system had invested so much
time and energy in their life to date. The argument advanced by the
Labour Government at the time was that the initial payment of
£500 plus £100 a year was to compensate for the fact that
those children in care did not have active parents who could support
them. The payments were made to help the children build up a
significant asset nest egg at the age of 18. It could assist with
putting a deposit on a property, provide help in training and education
or go towards the cost of university tuition fees, which will be
extremely large now that the Liberal Democrats have broken the promise
they made to the electorate last May. That level of funding would be
available to help support an individual leaving care at the age of
18.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
regulations that the Minister passed in July and which we opposed
reduced the payments quite significantly. They wiped out the majority
of the £500 so that, under clause 1, children leaving care up to
3 January 2011 will receive an initial contribution of £100, and
£100 a year thereafter. The amendment would ensure that we keep
in place the arrangements that were set up in July for looked-after
children. That would be a major step. The amendment is not even trying
to revert to the previous payment of £500, much as the Labour
Government supported it. We are simply saying that the ability of the
child trust fund to continue an initial payment of £100, and
£100 payment a year when in care is sufficient for the moment to
enable the Minister to meet his objectives for the next few years. We
have moved a lot on that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman can meet
us halfway by maintaining some form of payment for children in
care.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000021">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an important point. A key
factor about the child trust fund generally is that it was a
partnership between the Government and the individual—either the
family or, in this case, the looked-after child—about an
investment in their future after the age of 18. It said to looked-after
children that they were not just put into care, but that a nest egg was
put away to show them the benefit of saving, to let them see that the
fund was about partnership and, ultimately, to allow them to
matriculate at 18 with a lump sum to help them on leaving care. That is
a vulnerable time for people in the community, and the fund ensured
that they would have help and support at that particular time. As my
hon. Friend has mentioned, it is extremely important that we have
somebody who shows an interest in such children, in terms not only of
the care they receive, but of their financial planning for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000034">&#160;</a>

agree that, on pensions, the argument that if pensioners need more
money now they should get it has never been considered as the only
answer—we have always thought about how to encourage future
pensioners to save and the Government have always tried to consider
such matters? In this case, when we are thinking about children and
their savings, does he agree that it seems inconsistent to think that
the only solution to providing for looked-after children, for children
with a disability and for the poorest third is to say, “Well, if
they need more money now, they should get it”, rather than the
savings culture that the Labour Government were trying to
create?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000035">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, because
the general rationale for the child trust fund was to not only provide
a capital asset at the age of 18 across the board, but to encourage a
savings culture for them and their families. Very often, those who are
poor or disabled or in a looked-after environment would not necessarily
have been able to have that capital asset at 18. In this case, the vast
majority of looked-after children do not have direct families who
support them. They are in foster care, which is important and valuable
and not to be decried, or they are in residential care, which is
important and valuable and not to be decried. They do not have,
however, somebody who will necessarily put their hand in their pocket
to provide a trust fund ISA contribution for them. They do not have
family members who will say, “For this individual in care, we
will establish a tax-free ISA and put some money into it.”
Either those individuals do not have those family members
around—that is why they are in care in the first place—or
their family members may be in prison, where they do not have a regular
income with which they can top up a tax-free ISA, or they may have
issues with drugs or alcohol or other problems, where, again, they will
not be contributing to a tax-free ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000036">&#160;</a>

amendments. If the Committee supports clause 1, it will be part of the
Bill. If clause 1 stands part of the Bill, on 3 January next year,
there will be no financial support whatsoever for looked-after
children. There is no scheme in place, apart from an untested,
unthought-out tax-free ISA, which is not yet before the Committee in
its detailed form. That untested, untried, undetailed tax-free ISA will
be of no value to someone who is in care because their parents are not
interested in them or cannot manage them, or because their parents are
in a situation involving prison or drugs or alcohol, which mean that
their priorities will not be a tax-free ISA contribution for a
looked-after child. I ask the Financial Secretary and the hon. Member
for Birmingham, Yardley, if that were the case, how does a tax-free ISA
help those individuals downstream? Before we abolish this scheme, I
want to know what will happen to looked-after children, in care, with
the state supporting them, compared with what we have now. The answer,
currently, is not very

children. My opinion can be tested by the court of public opinion, but
I think that that is ultimately right, unless the hon. Member for

                        <p class="tabbed">Research
shows that having access to a modest level of savings at the age of 18
makes a difference to someone’s future. The key issue is that
children in care do not have the family support network that many of us
take for granted. Such children will not have those life chances at age
18 without that partnership with the state.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Conservative party manifesto commitment was to reduce payments except
to “the poorest third” of children, and the Financial
Secretary will find that the majority of looked-after children fall
within that category. I am not asking him, therefore, to do anything
that he did not commit to in May of this year, or that is outrageously
expensive; I am asking him to consider a small group of vulnerable
people, who in 12 or 13 years will reach the age of 18 and not have the
financial support of the state.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Department for Education’s figures show that the cost of a
£100 top-up for looked-after children in 2008-09 was
£1,039,833. In 2009-10, it was £1,502,786. Will the
deficit be damaged by a payment of approximately £1.5 million in
future years? The Financial Secretary will have the might of the
Treasury to work out the cost of the scheme for looked-after children.
Even if the cost were more than that, will the deficit be damaged by a
small amount of money that is not considerable in the grand scheme of
things, but will make a real difference to looked-after
children?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000046">&#160;</a>

may say the same, but I give him the opportunity to tell us what he
will do in the absence of such a provision. At present, payments are
made through Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs each month to
looked-after children as they find, each year, a contribution of
£100. What would be the alternative in the absence of such a

the amended clause, and we will vote for it to maintain the scheme. I
know it is difficult, but I will ask my hon. Friends to do that because
we would have salvaged, for looked-after children, a scheme that the
Minister can reflect on over the next two to three years. As the
economy improves, he can up the payments, and if the Government change,
we can revert to our scheme. However, at the moment, I am faced with

should not be too difficult for the Minister to support because, again,
it was in his manifesto, as it was in the manifesto of every
Conservative member of the Committee. If they thought it was important
in May, presumably they think it is important now. I would like to
start by asking the Minister not about what has changed since May,
because we know what has changed since then—the Conservatives
have made a coalition agreement with two Liberal Democrats and an
assessment of the financial situation. It is not what has changed since
May that I am interested in and concerned about, but what was important
in May. If the measure was important then for looked-after and disabled
children and children on disability living allowance, why is it not
important now? If it is not important now, is it because the Minister
has done a deal with the Liberals, or because he thinks the financial
situation should be paid for by children who are in receipt of
disability living allowance? If so, will he please say so? I would like

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister went into the election supporting the payments; he came out of
it ripping them up and saying that he was not interested in providing
child trust funds for children on disability living allowance. If
nothing else, the Minister now has the opportunity to explain why he
changed his mind. I do not want to hear that it was because of the two
Liberals or the economic situation. Why was that measure valid in
February, but not now? Why must that asset be taken away from children
with disabilities as part of the deficit reduction
plan?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Child Trust Funds Act 2004 allowed the Treasury to make regulations to
provide for further Government payments to the accounts of eligible
children. A key tenet of the legislation was to recognise that children
with disabilities may need extra support and to provide that support
with an asset at the age of 18 to meet the costs of disability. In the
2009 Budget, the then Chancellor announced that the Government would
contribute an additional £100 to the trust funds of disabled
children every year. The most severely disabled children—those
who at any point in the tax year were entitled to the highest weekly
rate of care components—were to receive £200 into their
child trust
funds.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Changes
were made to that measure in July. Amendment 21 states simply that the
situation that was to run from July 2010 to 3 January 2011 should be
maintained. The contribution levels can be reviewed in due course, just
as the Minister wants. He would also be able to meet his manifesto
commitments until the next election. At the moment, he chooses not to
do that. I am being pragmatic on these matters, although I am not happy
about the situation. We are trying to salvage something that helps to
support children with
disabilities.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000070">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the evidence session, I asked Mr McAusland, the chief
executive of the Children’s Mutual, whether it would be viable
for children receiving disability living allowance to receive continued
support via the child trust fund. He
replied:<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000071">&#160;</a>

one that I have seen which we are reasonably supportive of is the

therefore not impractical for providers to do that. I accept that a

think that it is really essential that we have some form of
asset-building mechanism that recognises the extra cost incurred by
having a family with a disabled child. That is why the payments that
came through the child trust fund were so important. The Government
have said that they will redirect some of those payments to short break
provision. Short break provision for families with disabled children is
essential, but it is not mutually exclusive to building towards their
future.

disabled children grow up thinking that they should not save and that
they should not invest within state benefits, because if they save they
will just have to spend it on a wheelchair, a piece of equipment or a

with you is a great way of giving disabled children a positive attitude

seeing a shift in the position of children with disabilities,
especially their complex needs? Children whose conditions might have
been highly difficult to manage previously have seen much more
successful outcomes in respect of their condition at the Lyndale
school, a specialist school in Eastham in my constituency. I have
witnessed children and parents dealing with the challenge of success.
The change taking place in looking after children is precisely what is
required so that the children know that their better future is backed
up by a financial

                           </strong> My hon. Friend eloquently makes the case for the
child trust fund and why the Labour Government focused particularly on
children with disabilities. Two aspects of the child trust fund go
across the board, one of which is a way of helping to encourage people
to save, who did not save previously. That has been shown to have
increased the savings ratio generally. It is particularly important to
give people at the age of 18 an asset that they can use to start their
lives and face whatever challenges there might be at that time. As my
hon. Friend mentioned, there is a changing stream of challenges facing
people and disabled children. Perhaps I should declare an interest in
that I worked for Scope for six years and know some of the pressures
that those individuals and parents face. Those pressures can be helped
by an asset to meet the challenges that children face at the age of
18.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000078">&#160;</a>

not considered. When I worked for Scope in the mid-1980s as a national
and a regional manager, one of the key things that parents of disabled
children always worried about was what would happen to the child when
they had died. Parents who are giving birth at perhaps an older age now
are aware the child trust fund will provide a cash asset sum to help
their children face some real
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Will the
Minister think about that statement for a moment? Let us consider the
abolition of the child trust fund. The acceptance of clause 1 will,
according to Scope—an independent, national charity dealing with
disabled people—increase inequality, particularly for families
with disabled children. Does the Minister want to have his political
record marked on that? Does he want to go through life as the Minister
who increased inequality, particularly for families with disabled
children? I appeal to his better nature. I think the Minister is a
decent man who would not want that on his record and he would want to
stand up for his manifesto commitment, what he said in February and for
children with disability living allowance. Again, I make him the offer
that if he accepts the amendment, we will vote in support of the
clause. I will explain to the Labour party why we have sold out on our
£250 promise and I will vote in support of the clause. I will
give him that opportunity. I have moved some way—let him move
some way as well. If he does not vote for the amendment, he will
abolish the disability living allowance component that he supported in
February, to which he committed in May, and which, according to Scope,
will increase inequality, particularly for families with disabled
children. I think Government Members will find such a situation
uncomfortable.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000082">&#160;</a>

we will do so, because we regard them as extremely important. If the

feels that, if all things have changed, of all the choices he could
have made to save money for the deficit, he chose to hit the poorest
third of families and to abolish the child trust fund, against his own

from the poorest third of families, to have that fund, and also look at
the ability of that poorest third of families to save for those
children’s futures. I hope, on reflection, that he recognises
that his initial judgments in May were right, and that he can keep the
manifesto commitments that he gave as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In summary, I
hope that the three amendments before the Committee are ones that the
Financial Secretary can accept. I say that for three succinct reasons.
First, the relative costs of those three amendments are low, in terms
of the savings that they make and the financial contribution that they
provide. Secondly, the child trust fund mechanism is in place and could
remain in place to deal with those issues. Thirdly, he has given
manifesto commitments on those key issues. The evidence before the
Committee, from all the independent bodies that gave evidence to us, is
that not progressing looked-after children, children with disabilities
or the poorest third will increase inequality at the age of 18. I
contend that the Financial Secretary would not want to do any of those
things and that he would want to maintain some element of the child
trust fund to help those particular three groups.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000099">&#160;</a>

my final offer to him. As I have said, if he accepts all those
amendments, or even if he only accepts some of them, we will put aside
some of our principles and vote with him to ensure that the clause
stands. When we have an opportunity, we will return to the scheme,
which the Labour Government put in place. If he rejects those
amendments, we will oppose the clause and we will expose that rejection
to the people outside the room who take an interest in these matters.
They will note that he has broken his election promises, he is
increasing inequality and that he is making the most poor and the
disabled children in the country pay for the
deficit.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000100">&#160;</a>

and one of the things that the Labour Government tried to
do—sometimes not as well as they could have done—is to
increase and improve social mobility. I want to see people having an
equal opportunity in life to reach the full potential of their talents.
One of the things that the child trust fund did was ensure that we had
a partnership between the state and a range of people, not least of
which were the poorest, the disabled and the looked after. They had
life chances which would be enhanced at the age of 18, because through
that trust fund they could afford a deposit on a property, help with
education, employment and training or help with bringing up a family
themselves. Those are real pressures. The Government were saving with
them and encouraging saving. Sadly, if the Bill stands as it is, all
that will be lost. I commend the three amendments to the Committee and
I look forward to hon. Members contributing to the debate on those

the Member for Delyn has given a comprehensive explanation of why he is
proposing, along with our hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East, the
amendments, which I support. I do not need or intend to repeat all the
points that have been made this morning. I want to highlight some of
the key issues in relation to each of the amendments. I hope that the
Financial Secretary will address them in his
response.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
20 is in relation to looked-after children. I know that hon. Members
across all parties share deep concerns about the poor outcomes that we
continue to see for looked-after children as they grow up and progress
into adulthood. That is a considerable concern for us all. Clearly, no
one answer will be sufficient to address the significant disadvantage
that those young people have experienced in terms of the reasons why
they arrive in care and, regrettably, the fact that even being in care
does not sufficiently improve their outcomes. There is work to do
there. I am not suggesting for one moment that, by simply providing an
asset at age 18, we have resolved all the deficiencies in the
experience of being brought up in care. It is absolutely right that
hon. Members of all parties continue to demand of all Governments that
more action be taken to improve the outcomes for those
kids.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to highlight two issues on looked-after children. First, on
arriving at adulthood, they have none of the support mechanisms that
the rest of us have in making the transition out of the family and into
independent living as an adult. Even the poorest families are able to
support their children as they set up their homes with, at the very
least, a few basics to put in the kitchen cupboard, and bedding, sheets
and blankets. Looked-after children leave with none of those basic
material supports—it is to the shame of us all that we continue
to cast them out into adult life with absolutely nothing to support
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000105">&#160;</a>

welcome the comments made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley. I
agree that we should look at how we can provide young people reaching
18 now and those reaching 18 between now and 2019 with an asset as they
move into adult life. That does not preclude us from planning ahead for
young people in care who are under 18. My second point is that how we
do that is important. I alluded to that in my intervention on my right
hon. Friend about those young people’s sense that nobody cares
about them, that they have no connection to the future and that nobody
aspires for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000106">&#160;</a>

that one of the greatest scandals about looked-after children, who are
in the care of the state for much of the time, is their educational
outcomes? Their GCSE pass rates are among the lowest of any group at
age 16. To give such children a flying start in their adult lives, the
Government and the Opposition should be paying attention to that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course, it is right that we should do more to
improve the educational outcomes and experience of looked-after
children. That reinforces my point that one difficulty in engaging with
and supporting them adequately is their sense that nobody cares about
their future and that they are too often seen simply as a problem to be
dealt with here and now.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000108">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One real
advantage of creating a mechanism and an asset that grows with
looked-after children through their childhood and presents them with a
vision of the future is that it shows them that people are not only
interested in them because of where they now are—the challenges
that they present and live with today—but see them as valued
future members of society. As well as providing them with support that
is better than what is currently available, this mechanism of saving
for their future would give those young people the important message
that they are precious and cared about. It would show that the fact
that they are not cared for within their own family does not mean that
nobody has an interest in them beyond seeing them as short-term
problems to be got through their childhood, which is what so many of
them
feel.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make some additional points about maintaining a mechanism to
support children on disability living allowance with a payment on their
reaching 18. In his evidence to the Committee, Mr Marc Bush—I
apologise that I have lost the reference—highlighted the
challenge presented to families with a disabled child, in that they not
only have to meet additional costs in raising their child as they grow
up, which diminishes the parents’ ability to set aside money for
their kids, but have more costs kicking in as the child reaches 18 and
moves into adulthood. Parents are very concerned about that transition
period, because all too often they find that the server support
previously provided by children’s social services falls apart at
that moment. At least for a short time, money is incredibly useful to
plug that gap, although it should not be like that. We should be
planning better joined-upness between children’s and adult
social services to smooth that transition, but such transitions are
always awkward and money provides an extra ability to ensure that they
go as smoothly as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000110">&#160;</a>

families with disabled children, but does she not agree that, for many
such families, particularly those with children with mental health
conditions, the transition period starts at the ages of 15 and 16? To
impose an arbitrary cut-off age of 18 is to try to fit all families
with disabled children into a single box. Sadly, the world is not like

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point. It is
reinforced by Mr Bush’s evidence, which stated that parents of
disabled children saw the transition period as being at any point
between the ages of 14 and 24. Perhaps we should have designed, and
should think about designing, a child trust fund savings mechanism for
disabled children with more flexibility, especially in the withdrawal
points. The hon. Gentleman has started an interesting line of thought.
If we are to go down that imaginative line of thinking, we must first
ensure that we do not abandon the product altogether. If we do, we will
be unable to make it more flexible so that it meets the particular
needs of disabled young people and their families as they face the
transition to adult
life.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000112">&#160;</a>

people with disabilities are already at a higher risk of poverty in
adult life, with disability an indicator of vulnerability to poverty. I
am concerned that they will lose a useful asset—admittedly a
modest one—that might help to compensate for that lifelong
higher risk of poverty by giving them a good start in adult life. I
hope that the Minister will think again. I am confident that Members on
both sides of the House and across the Committee are concerned about
the future of disabled young people. This mechanism gives us a chance

22 is aimed at the poorest third of children, which is the third group
that my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has targeted with this
group of amendments. The poorest third of children relates to the
definition of poor children in the Child Poverty Act 2010, which is
those who are growing up in households that receive below 60% of median
income. Currently, that is about 30 to 32% of children. Like the
Conservative election manifesto, the amendment commits to give all
children defined as “in poverty” the boost of maintaining
their child trust fund. That was a welcome commitment by the
Conservative party. I would have liked it to continue its commitment to
a universal payment, but I welcome its recognition of the importance of
the definition of income poverty. It was good to see that reinforced in
the Conservative manifesto. I am disappointed that the Conservative
party is moving away from that commitment. The intentions and the
definitions in the 2010 Act were strengthened by the cross-party
support that the legislation enjoyed. This is an opportunity to
reinforce that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000117">&#160;</a>

hope that in the measures that the Government introduces, extra
attention will be paid to the needs of the poorest
children—those who are growing up in households that receive
below 60% of median income. I cannot understand how the junior ISA will
achieve that because it appears to have an in-built inequality.
Better-off families will benefit more, because of the tax break, than
the poorest families, who are highly unlikely to be taxpayers. Whatever
the merits of the junior ISA, as a vehicle to create a savings habit,
or in its delivering a

more unequal model than that of the child trust fund. I hope that the
Financial Secretary will respond specifically to that point, because I
am genuinely concerned that a Government who proclaim their wish to
narrow inequality gaps, which I applaud, should introduce a measure
that looks likely to make things worse. Perhaps he can reassure me that
that is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000118">&#160;</a>

are two other points that relate to the three amendments that are under
discussion. The first, important one was made by the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Yardley—why wait another 11, 12 or 18 years to
deliver the payments? Why not make them now? I could not agree with him
more. I should like to see the Government take further steps to narrow
the gaps between the poorest adults and the better off in society Those
who are on low incomes because of disabilities are at greater risk of
poverty, as are those who have left care, who are also at much greater
risk of worklessness and poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000119">&#160;</a>

virtually every measure that the Government have announced in either
the emergency Budget or the comprehensive spending review seems to take
things the other way for the poorest adults. I hope, therefore, that
the comments of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley will relate not
only to the legislation, but to the spending plans as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000120">&#160;</a>

come to social mobility, about which there is considerable
misconception and misunderstanding, as much in my own party as
elsewhere in the House. We do not know that social mobility stalled
under Labour, because we have not been able to measure the group of
children who have benefitted from Labour’s spending
plans—its investment in tax credits, its increase in child
benefit, its improvements in lone parent employment, and so on. We have
not been able to measure the effects of such measures on those children
when they become adults, so we do not know whether they are in a
stronger position than their parents.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000121">&#160;</a>

money does not matter and that other mechanisms can replace it. Many
other mechanisms are important, such as education, financial expertise,
good health, and so on, but money is an important factor in delivering
good outcomes for children, young people and adults. This asset would
have helped to provide that additional resource to improve the outcomes
for our most vulnerable people. I hope, therefore, that the Minister
and the Government will think again and accept the amendment. As my

                           </strong> The inter-relationship between the measure and
the care system is important. I am well known to be critical of the
care system—a lot of children are in care who should not be, and
there are those who should be and are not. To cite an example from my
constituency, some children smashed up a children’s home to get
moved home, and they were. A study by Southampton university that
looked at 473 people who had left care showed that 70% of people went
back to their
parents.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000126">&#160;</a>

is important to remember that every child is different and every
child’s circumstances are different. Some maintain links with
their families, whereas some do not, and the families of some will have
died. We had a meeting with children in care just a couple of doors
down a couple of weeks ago. There is no question but that we do not
look after children after they leave the care of the state. The process
for assisting them through that is not
good.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000127">&#160;</a>

question today is whether it is worthwhile to pay £50 million a
year to maintain infrastructure that delivers £1 million that is
not necessarily well invested, and that at the end of the process
delivers a couple of thousand pounds to a child in care, or whether the
£50 million would be better spent if it was sent straight to
people on leaving
care.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000128">&#160;</a>

families and different trajectories of maturity. I invite him to work
with me on this issue that concerns us both and to consider how the
Bill can be improved to ensure that we have a savings model that
delivers flexibility, while ensuring that we have the benefit of the
child trust fund model, which recognises the particular costs that
children face when they transition into adulthood at the age of
18.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000129">&#160;</a>

to deliver this. The conclusion may be that we should use a model
similar to the child trust fund. The difficulty is that there is a cost
to opening and maintaining lots of empty accounts, even if computer
systems are used. It would involve sending all children born in this
country a note, every birthday for 18 years, that for most people will
say, “You’ve got no money.” As well as being a
rather futile exercise, that would cost at least the postage and the
running costs, which must add up to at least 70p. The problem is that
there is an infrastructural cost in keeping the scheme running. That
cost must be dealt with. There is no sense in spending £52
million to pay people £2
million.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000136">&#160;</a>

is all very well for Members supporting the Government to say
constantly, “This would be better”, “That would be
better”, “Perhaps we could do this” or
“Perhaps we could do that”. Regrettably, the amendments

what is being said, clearly a lot of things have not been given proper
consideration. There may be aspects of the child trust fund that could
be looked at again or that might not be ideal; or, as has been
suggested, universality might be difficult to afford—that is not
necessarily a view I share, but I can understand where people are
coming from. On that basis, it is not beyond us to look at the
possibilities of, for example, reducing overheads.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to see the detail on the figures that we have just heard, but if they
are correct, I do not see why keeping the child trust fund available
for the three categories covered by the amendments—children in
care, children with disabilities and the poorest
children—necessarily requires us, as the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Yardley suggested a few minutes ago, for example, to send
out in effect blank birthday cards to every child in the
community.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Just
because all children covered by the child trust fund—those born
since 2002—are currently getting an annual communication does
not mean that if we limited the child trust fund to the defined
categories, all other children would have to be sent a letter saying,
“You’ve got nothing.” That is absurd and, surely,
only a regulatory or small change would be needed to stop it happening.
Putting up such an objection to a proposal of this nature is putting up
a straw man, rather than addressing the issues
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to address some of the misrepresentations, or
misinterpretations, of the evidence we heard from Marc Bush. He spoke
about the difficulties that some families had encountered with the
authorities; some officials, apparently, argued that the asset involved
in a child trust fund might affect benefit. However, he was
illustrating a practical problem that some of the people his
organisation dealt with had encountered. As far as I am aware, for that
to happen is not the policy of the previous Government or of this
Government, but anything in the rules that causes that to happen can be
changed. That small glitch could be
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
sounds far more likely is that some officials were themselves
misinterpreting the regulations. What Marc Bush
said—clearly—was that other forms of saving were
particularly difficult for families with disabled children, and that
the child trust fund was one of the best because it did not involve
such difficulties. Other forms of saving would have that effect on the
receipt of
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I heard Marc Bush—it is written down clearly—he was
saying that of the savings choices for families of disabled children,
this particular one was the best articulated and the best integrated
with the benefit system, so he supported it and felt it important that
it should continue. Rather than being evidence against continuing it, I
submit that his evidence was strongly in favour of continuing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000144">&#160;</a>

appreciate that we are not meant to stray into too many of the wider
issues about benefits and the other changes that are being made, but we
should not ignore them entirely, or suggest that taking benefits away
does not matter because disabled children may receive moneys in other
ways. Families in my constituency have been told in recent months that
their disabled children coming up to adulthood would no longer qualify
for the independent living fund, for example, because it is only
available for people who are definitely in employment for 16 hours or
more a week. I now understand that the independent living fund is to
disappear altogether, and that alternatives to such benefits will not
necessarily be available.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000145">&#160;</a>

assertion that the overall priority is to reduce the deficit very fast,
which is highly dangerous in economic terms. Even if that is the
priority, looking at longer-term social policy measures to deal with it
seems perverse. If the Government are right and the deficit is reduced
within five years, with the economy thereafter flourishing as a
result—that appears to be their position—it is all the
more important that long-term social policy measures are not
interrupted now. They are the very measures that should be kept in
place as, if that happens—the Government are confident that it
will—it seems particularly perverse to cease such measures and
not to be sufficiently optimistic to say, “We will restrict
payments to these particular groups at the moment, if necessary, but we
can reinstate the fund in future without any great difficulty and
without having to reinvent the wheel by coming up with a new
policy.” The families of disabled children are such a
disadvantaged group, and disabled young people, as they move into
adulthood, face such a huge number of problems that they need anything
that can assist

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
it has been suggested that the last Government thought that the
measures, including the child trust fund, that are marked out in the
Bill, would somehow resolve poverty and deprivation. That is not the
case, as each of the measures was a small part of a much wider
programme. We are not suggesting that because a young disabled adult or
a young person leaving care would receive the money, it would overcome
all the other disadvantages they may have, or that in itself it would
be enough totally to transform their life. Of course, other factors
have to be taken into account as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
child trust fund was a measure designed to enhance the life chances of
such young people. It is important to keep it in operation,
particularly for such groups, at what is a relatively modest cost, to
enable us to move forward in the future. I hope that that would be the
case with various measures that I hear Government Members espousing and
encouraging, and which I hope will work. But that should not be to the
exclusion of our proposal, so I urge Government Members to support the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000150">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to turn to an area that has not been
examined enough, which is the long-term savings habit that is
engendered by the child trust fund. From my work in financial
capability and in schools, I believe that all the studies suggest that
children learn from their parents. Where are looked-after children to
learn from? We are the parents in that case and we have to give that
example. The child trust fund has given a practical example to a group
of children who quite often—not in all cases—have no
practical examples of saving. It is not the same simply to give those
children a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 182<a class="bkMark" name="Column182">&#160;</a>
                           </div>lump of money at 18, and say, “Here you are. Go out and do
something with it.” It is about teaching the idea that savings
bring prosperity and life chances. The child trust fund is doing that
for looked-after children in particular. It is decreasing the divide
between looked-after children and those who are in the care of their
family. It is also giving them a lump sum, which gives them extra
support at 18 years old, when they leave care, go into their own
properties, have to fend for themselves and have to get financial
products if they are at work or at university. It gives a practical
example of a financial product and how it works, and that makes people
engage.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East has mentioned, Marc Bush
said that there are no suitable products for disabled children. The
problem is that often other products—not the product he
mentioned—are taken into account for benefits. People want to
save, but they cannot find the products. The value of the child trust
fund is that the Government put the money into a product that is
suitable.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
stress on parents with a disabled child is particularly great. The
phrase that Marc Bush used, which particularly affected me, was
“a cliff edge”. He said that the cumulative effect of
these changes, including the withdrawal of the child trust fund, is to
push those people over “a cliff edge”. I want people to
look at how expensive it will be to rescue those who have gone over a
cliff edge, when some preventive work could have stopped it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the
poorest third, what affected me was the phrase “assets mean
choices” and the increase in social mobility. I want to return
to the examples of saving. We have had much debate about when is the
right time to save. Is it when people are particularly stretched for
money, or when they have a little to put aside? From my work experience
in financial capability and debt work, children learn about saving from
example. Practical examples are needed and that is what the child trust
fund has given them. A junior ISA, which is not applicable to families
who do not pay tax, is not an example to children. The child trust
fund, which can be used as  an example in schools and in
financial capability lessons, gives encouragement for people to save.
As Anne Longfield said, it is the simplicity of the product that
counts. Can the Financial Secretary say whether that has been taken
into account as
well?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000154">&#160;</a>

build on the points my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield has just
raised. The amendments are significant, because we have an incredibly
important decision before us. We are looking after some of the people
who have least in our society. I was struck by some of the answers that
the Minister gave in evidence to the Committee last week. In respect of
amendment 22 and the possibility of a junior ISA, in response to my
hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
aspiration is admirable. It is the reason behind the amendment.
However, as for the possibility of an alternative, which lots of the
argument has turned on today, will the Minister tell us the plan for
making the vehicle accessible to low-income families? How will the
junior ISA work in relation to that? In my experience, there would
usually be a plan aligned to a policy such as junior ISAs and it would
help the Committee if we could know more about making sure that junior
ISAs are accessible to low-income families. With the advent of child
trust funds, tax credits and pension credits, we know a lot as a
country about how we ensure that financial products to assist those on
the lowest incomes are taken up and used in ways that we would all like
to see. I would be interested to know the Treasury’s assessment
of how it will make it
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000157">&#160;</a>

addition, if our amendment is not accepted, and one, two or three years
down the line junior ISAs are not taken up by low-income families, what
is the Minister’s plan? What will we do then? Colleagues have
already commented on the sometimes rushed nature of legislation and it
would be worth while if the hon. Gentleman can explain how we might
engage families on low incomes in savings plans? I did not come from a
particularly wealthy family, but I experienced the culture of putting
away £1 here, £10 there and working towards a better
future. I hope that we have some expertise in engaging low-income
families in savings, and I shall be grateful if the hon. Gentleman will
describe how best to protect such a policy in the time to

it is a slightly odd statement to come from an hon. Lady who stood on a

                           </div>saving and—with the caveat that we are still fairly newly into
the culture of the child trust fund—that must be a good thing.
We must secure the amendments to the Bill so that we can maintain the
child trust fund and keep reflecting as a country on what more we can
do to build up the savings culture. That will have the benefit not only
of assisting those on the lowest incomes to save—where children
are in care or have disabilities—but will also encourage a
broader savings culture. The financial services sector in our country
needs that culture of more savings and more deposits at this
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000163">&#160;</a>

20, I want to reflect on the importance of retaining the savings
facility for children in care. It is especially important to know the
estimation that the Minister and the Treasury have made of the
likelihood that such children will have junior ISAs taken out for them.
I would be interested to know whether an assessment has been made of
that; if not, it ought to be. Before we dispose of a savings product
for children in care and offer a different one in the years to come,
should we not ask ourselves about the likelihood of such a product
working for them?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000164">&#160;</a>

outlines what the true nature of the junior ISA will be? He is asking
us to support clause 1, which abolishes the child trust fund, but he
has not yet provided clarity about what the junior ISA or the cap will
be, how the mechanism will work, or how the scheme will operate

point that I want to make. It is bad policy, generally, to abolish a
scheme that has had at least some success according to some of the
people who gave evidence in Committee. I recall specifically the
evidence from the mutual side of the financial services sector, which
was that the product was successful and that it was going well. We have
not heard enough detail about the junior ISA to make an assessment of
that proposal, and that we are asked to abolish the child trust fund in
total ignorance of what—if anything—might replace it,
seems to be faulty policy
making.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000166">&#160;</a>

false assumption. The misplaced premise of his argument is that the
only benefit of the policy is that which will be received by the child
in 18 years’ time. We have heard evidence in Committee that the
economics that matter concern not only the transfer payment from the
Government to the family now, but the culture and the habits that are
formed along the way. Such habits have economic and financial benefits
to families, which is why the child trust fund has been so successful
as a product and as a policy. That is why I support the amendments,

earlier intervention. It is all very well for him to assert that there
is a cost to the child trust fund infrastructure, but in the absence of
any detail about the cost of the junior ISA infrastructure or how
effective the junior ISA will be in continuing the culture of saving
that the child trust fund had built up, the hon. Gentleman is
addressing only one side of the question. It is not good policy making
to assume that because we can chop a bit off in one place, another cost
will not arise somewhere else and that we would not have been better
sticking with the original policy.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000174">&#160;</a>

bit of progress. In addition to some of the questions that my hon.
Friends and I have already asked, I want to ask the Minister about
amendment 21. Will he discuss further how the junior ISA might affect
disabled children? Will it be an appropriate product? Would there be
any interplay between the junior ISA and the benefits that exist for
disabled people now? Obviously, the position is changing for those on
disability benefits, but it is important, in abolishing what was
described to me as one of the best financial products available for
children with a disability, to know what might replace it. If the
answer is, “We don’t know what might replace it,”
and there is no proper option for children with a disability, it would
be helpful to know that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000175">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On amendments
20, 21 and 22, the Minister made some comments, and evidence was
provided to us, about the importance of lock-ins. We heard evidence
from the expert witnesses about the child trust fund’s
importance in assisting in locking parents into saving. That was seen
as a real benefit, especially for parents on low incomes, who knew that
they could not get out the money that they put away. That was a really
helpful way to save. That is not the normal culture with the ISA

that the Government would seek to preserve the culture under the child
trust fund in the junior ISA, and I would fully support that important
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000176">&#160;</a>

about how flexibility might be developed. We have quite a certain
picture of how the child trust fund works and quite a particular model,
so it is important to hear how the lock-in might work, how it would
relate to other ISAs and what work the Treasury has been doing to make
sure that this financial product could be sustainable, because people
want continuity of the culture of saving that we had started to

                           </strong> Let my try to focus on the points that were not
discussed in last week’s scrutiny session and on the three
amendments. We all recognise that there are vulnerable groups in our
society who need more help than others. Is the child trust fund the
most effective way of providing support to those groups? We do not
believe that continuing with the child trust fund eligibility would be
the best way of delivering such help. Furthermore, once eligibility for
child trust funds ends for children born from January 2011, it will not
be practical to retain the infrastructure and processes necessary to
give specific groups of children a child trust fund. It refers back to
the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley. I
hesitate to correct him, but  I will.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The current
child trust fund system costs the taxpayer about £5 million a
year. If we move to a reduced scheme, there will still be costs
incurred. Prior to discussions with child trust fund providers, it was
apparent that it would not be economically viable for them to run child
trust funds at the lower level, as set out in the statutory instrument
that the House passed in July. The chief executive of the
Children’s Mutual was an exception to that, but the meetings
that I had with stakeholders back in July indicated very clearly to me
that if we were to continue to run the regime that has been in place
since July, it would not be viable and we would have the same problem
that we see with saving gateway, with insufficient numbers of people
providing that product for it to
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn to amendment 20 and the proposal to continue the scheme for
children in care born on or after 3 January 2011. I will not pick up
the drafting problems of the right hon. Member for Delyn, but the
amendments are significantly defective in the way in which they have
been prepared. There are significant problems with continuing CTF
eligibility. It would require local authorities to continue to retain
the information systems that forward information to HMRC about children
in care. They would need to keep staff to process that information or
deal with any problems. As I said, it is unlikely that the providers
would continue to offer the accounts. There are costs to local
authorities of making top-up payments as well. It costs £22 on
top of the amount to make those payments. Clearly, that is money that
could be spent on improving the life chances of children who are in
care. There are other ways of helping. We have talked about the pupil
premium.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000181">&#160;</a>

contribute towards the junior ISA, to help provide a sum for children
who are in care. It is worth bearing in mind that children remain in
care for three years on average, so we are talking about a potential
contribution of £300 for most children in care. I have mentioned
the pupil premium and the possibility of local authorities acting as a
corporate parent in connection with the junior ISA. Children who are in
care at the age of 18 and who go on to higher education will be in
receipt of a £2,000 bursary from their local authority. That is
a statutory requirement. There is a danger of looking at the child

                           </strong> The hon. Lady makes a point, but let us look at the
facts. Just 13% of families from the lowest income groups made a
contribution towards their children’s CTF. That does not suggest
strong evidence that the CTF has provided for or created a savings
culture in this country. I would cite that evidence. The big question
is: how do we use the resources we have in the most effective way to
improve the life chances of children in that income group? We believe
that it is more important to provide that financial help now for those
who need it, instead of locking away public expenditure on assets that
cannot be touched for 18
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000201">&#160;</a>

reflected in the coalition agreement. That agreement is the programme
for government that we are implementing, and which underpins the
measures in the Bill. I do not apologise for implementing that
agreement; it is an agreement that we reached. The decisions are not
straightforward, and there might be others that we would prefer to make

                           </strong> There is a clear school of thought among Labour
Members, which the hon. Member for Edinburgh East expressed well, as
did her hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South. They would much rather
preserve long-term programmes, at—I think the implication
was—the expense of short-term programmes, or through higher
taxes or more borrowing. They never quite articulated what would
replace our spending reductions. Carl Emmerson of the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, again pointing to the argument about trying to use
money carefully and wisely now to improve children’s life
chances,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I

                        <p>That is
an important and powerful point. We should be taking steps now to

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are scrapping the child trust fund, and there are other ways in which
we will tackle some of the issues around life chances; I mentioned the
pupil premium earlier. When we looked at the options for reducing the
spending on the child trust fund earlier this year, we decided that it
was right to end eligibility altogether, including for those on lower
incomes. That maximises the savings that we can make on child trust
funds, and the money will therefore be available for the other
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000209">&#160;</a>

are some practical problems with keeping the CTF in place for children
in lower-income families, as in the amendments. How do we go about
calculating who the poorest third of children are? The Opposition

that decisions should be based on someone’s income at birth.

                           </strong> No. The right hon. Gentleman is getting terribly
excited. Just because a family is on a low-income when a child is born
does not mean that it will be in the same financial situation when the
child reaches 18. So, the amendments are neither fair nor well
targeted. It is not clear how determining the poorest third of
households could operate in practice. The right hon. Gentleman suggests
that the Office for National Statistics would advise the Chancellor,
but ONS data are, of course, annonymised, so it would be hard to
identify to which households Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
would be required to make the
payments.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000212">&#160;</a>

to his May manifesto, the scheme would have applied to the poorest
third. Had he won a majority in May, presumably he would be introducing
a scheme that included the poorest
third.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000213">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Being a practical man, I would have simply linked
the child trust fund to an existing benefit. We would have gone down
the passporting route. There are plenty of examples of passported
benefits that one could have used in constructing the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, the Opposition’s arguments do not take into account
the practical problems attached to making the payments to these groups.
Taxpayers’ money would have to be spent on keeping the scheme
alive and CTF providers are reluctant to continue on the current low
payment levels. The money involved will be spent more wisely by
investing in the pupil premium and by reducing the deficit, which will
in turn reduce the interest costs that we pay. I believe that the
measures in the Bill are practical answers to the problems that we
face. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to reflect carefully on his
commitment to spend taxpayers’ money on unnecessary
administration costs, and on whether there are better ways in which we
might help these disadvantaged
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000215">&#160;</a>

resources of the Treasury and parliamentary counsel. However, we have
tried to raise issues. I would be happy not to press the amendments if
the Minister said that he would put the might of the Treasury and

                           </strong> This is not a general debate about the pupil
premium, but I will answer. The pupil premium affects the education
budget and it applies to England. The right hon. Gentleman is aware
that through the Barnett formula, increases in education and health
spending flow through to the resources available for the nations of the
UK. It is down to the devolved Administrations to make choices about
those
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000219">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are straying into the next set of amendments,
but has the Minister discussed with the devolved Administrations the
implications of the pupil premium and the withdrawal of the child trust
fund? He has introduced the idea that the pupil premium is some sort of
salvation from ending the child trust fund, and that it will deal in
particular with the children in the poorest third of households, who
are specified in amendment 22. He knows that the pupil premium is an
England-only invention. It does not apply to children in my
constituency in Wales, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member
for Edinburgh East in Scotland or in the constituency of the hon.
Member for South Down in Northern Ireland. It therefore will not help
the poorest third of children across the United Kingdom, as would
amendment 22. The pupil premium is a red herring in relation to that
amendment and the Minister knows it. Even under the Barnett formula,
the Welsh Assembly Government will lose £1 billion of resources
over the next four years because of his Government’s
comprehensive spending review. The pupil premium will have no impact on
the objective of amendment
22.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000220">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point we have been making is that existing
recipients of the child trust fund—again, I must declare an
interest because one of my children is an existing
recipient—will be managed for the next 18 years by a
computer system operated by HMRC. A child born on 3 January 2011 will
reach their 18th birthday on 3 January 2029, and the scheme will
operate for those years, irrespective of clause 1, because it is still
operating, with children receiving a lower payment since August and a
higher payment before August. The costs are still there, and the three
amendments therefore simply represent additional costs as a result of

there is a cost to the providers, which they are happy to absorb.
Smaller providers will find it difficult—that is the nature of
the position the Minister has put them in—but the largest
provider will find it easy. There will be costs to the Treasury in
maintaining the system for the next 18 years, unless the Minister comes
back with a Bill in a year’s time, when the dust has settled,
and says, “Let’s cease the child trust fund operation to
date.” Who knows what he might be capable of in due course? As
of today, however, the scheme will run until 3 January 2029
for a child born on 3 January 2011, so there will be a continuing cost.
The marginal increase in the costs for all three groups is a price
worth paying to support looked-after children, the poorest third of
children and children on disability living allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000230">&#160;</a>

genuinely to the Minister that the amendments might be flawed and might
not meet the requirements of Treasury counsel in their entirety, but
they meet the objectives that he set as a shadow Minister when the
Conservative party’s manifesto was compiled. If there are policy
difficulties with the poorest third, disabled children and looked-after
children, that would have been reflected in his manifesto commitment.
With another 20 seats in Parliament, he would presumably have been
fulfilling that manifesto commitment.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000231">&#160;</a>

so that they are acceptable to the Minister. The Minister could then
vote for his manifesto commitment and achieve what he said he would do
in May. Otherwise, I will have to accept that he does not want to meet

clause 1 and to withdraw the amendment on looked-after children or it

asked, how do we get people to save who have a low asset base and whose
parents are dead, in prison, not interested in their children’s
future or incapable through drugs or alcohol or for other reasons? The
reason why children are in care is that parental involvement is absent.

parents—perhaps the hon. Member for Wirral South would like to
listen—to contribute to junior ISAs on behalf of looked-after
children. They could take that responsibility. In the same way that
they contribute to CTFs now, they could contribute towards junior ISAs
for looked-after children. That is a clear way to respond to the gap

might take the view that looked-after children are particularly
important, and might reflect some of our amendments. Given that the
Bill must be enacted by  3 January and that another place might
want opportunities for long discussions of it, the Minister has a tight
timetable. I suggest that he consider the matter urgently with my right
hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East and propose a
suggestion. Otherwise, he might find that Members in another place
spend a long time asking why an alternative is not in place and

the record, since this debate began, evidence has come to my attention
from the Runnymede Trust, which is focusing on the decision to scrap
child trust funds and saving gateway accounts and the disproportionate
effect that it will have on black and minority ethnic people, who,
sadly, form the majority of the poorest cohort of our society. The
Runnymede Trust’s evidence to the Committee has assessed why
assets matter in a report. Paragraph 2 of its evidence
says:<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000242">&#160;</a>

suggests that he would not. On that basis, flawed though these
amendments may be in their drafting, they establish key principles that
the Opposition wish to see maintained. I have moved a long way in
saying that we will accept a lower rate for these three groups in order
to salvage something from the child trust fund. The Financial Secretary

this section shall not apply until formal consultation has been
undertaken with the Welsh Assembly Government, Scottish Parliament and
Northern Ireland
Executive.’.<p>I
have tabled this amendment for several reasons. We have just seen an
example of why consultation is required in the last contribution. Even
then, the Minister indicated that the pupil premium was the solution to
many of the issues relating to looked-after children when he knows that
that does not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and is an
England-only matter. More than that, it is important that we consider
the impact of the abolition of the child trust fund on Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000318">&#160;</a>

                           </div>I live two miles from the English border but because of
that—again, I declare an interest—my youngest child,
Daniel, is in receipt not only of a child trust fund from the UK
Government, but a top-up grant from the Welsh Assembly Government. What
discussions, not just at official level but at ministerial level, has
the Minister had with those who are elected to the Welsh Assembly and
who are currently paying additional resources into the child trust fund
for the Welsh Assembly Government?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
As hon.
Members may not know, a £50 top-up is payable by the Welsh
Assembly Government to the child trust fund over and above the existing
contributions from the UK Government. To qualify for a £50
top-up in 2010 and 2011, the child must have been born between 1
September 2004 and 31 August 2005. This top-up is paid at a later stage
of the child’s development than the initial payment. I declare
an interest as my last child was born in 2003, and received a
£50 top-up as a result of the Welsh Assembly Government’s
decision. The Welsh Assembly Government’s criteria
are based on the date, already having a child trust fund account, and
the fact that the individual is living in Wales on 15 September
2010.<p class="tabbed">In
addition, the Welsh Assembly Government currently pay an additional
premium to individuals on lower incomes of £100 top-up, which is
for those children in receipt of free school meals or of child tax
credits in 2009-10 when the household income was not greater than
£16,040 or, indeed, in receipt of child tax credits in 2009-10
and claiming income support, income-based jobseeker’s allowance,
pension credit, employment and support allowance. Importantly, the
claims must be made by 31 January
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000320">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Unfortunately
earlier this year the UK Coalition Government made a decision to end
the Child Trust Fund which will clearly disadvantage children in Wales.
 This runs counter to our aim of reducing the chances of poorer
children in Wales becoming poorer
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

this announcement does have a knock-on effect on what we can do in
Wales.  I want to assure everyone that the Welsh Assembly
Government will do everything it can to explore ways in which our
existing investment in setting up Child Trust Funds in Wales can be
protected and to see what we can do to maintain our commitment to

                        <p>The
key point is whether the Financial Secretary has met the Minister for
Children in Wales? Has he had discussions at an official level with the
Welsh Assembly Government about the development of the child trust fund
in Wales? What is his view of the Welsh Assembly Government’s
continuing payments post-3 January to any particular system in place,
given that the Treasury is

                           </div>still running the scheme for those who exist before 3 January
2011? What is his view on allowing the Welsh Assembly Government to
continue those contributions after 3
January?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000322">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be helpful if the Minister can clarify his view on the
discussions and the Welsh Assembly Government because the Assembly has
to prepare the draft Budget, which will be published on 17
November—in a couple of weeks’ time—and the Welsh
Assembly Government need to make decisions about their contribution to
the additional payments and thus to the payments of children in Wales
as a whole. The Welsh Assembly Government are not controlled solely by
my party. Interestingly enough, they are part of a coalition of my
party and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalists. They have determined
that they want contributions to the child trust fund and, as far as I
am aware, they have come across no opposition from either the Liberal
Democrats or the Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly Government. I
should be interested in whether there is scope for the Financial
Secretary to examine such issues in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Welsh Assembly Government have undertaken those payments, because they
recognise that there is great poverty in Wales, particularly in many of
the valleys and inner cities, including areas of my constituency. It is
a poverty of opportunity, of aspiration and of assets for people at age
18. It is highly unfair that the Welsh Assembly Government can take a
political decision to use their resources to support the child trust
fund, but that at the same time the Government are not listening to
what is being said about the need for that in Wales as a whole. Can the
Financial Secretary tell me whether he has met, is meeting or will meet
the Minister—not just officials—to discuss the
implications of the policy
decision?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000324">&#160;</a>

McGovern:</strong> My right hon. Friend mentioned earlier that our
constituencies are close to each other, on the border of the River Dee.
It is important for those of us who represent English constituencies
very close to Wales that there is a high level of co-operation,
discussion and consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government. That
enables such discussions to be embedded in whatever policy is taken
forward, so that it works well across the piece and so that people on
the English side of the border understand Government policy at the UK
level. Does he agree that it is important that those people know that
there is co-ordination with their near neighbours in
Wales?<a class="bkMark" name="10110953000325">&#160;</a>
