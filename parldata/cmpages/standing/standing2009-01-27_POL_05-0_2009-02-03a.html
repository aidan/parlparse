<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000288"></a>The
Chairman:</b> From the Chair, I welcome all those Members who
are in the House of Commons. I congratulate those who have come some
distance&#151;there are one or two here, including myself&#151;and
have managed to cope with the severe weather, particularly on Sunday
evening.</div><a name="09020355000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today,
we begin the meat of a Public Bill Committee, going through the Bill
clause by clause, line by line and, almost, word by word. We start with
clause 1, properly and
inevitably.</div><a name="09020355000007"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4><a name="09020355000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Duty
of police authorities in relation to public
accountability</div><a name="09020355000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020355000289"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): I beg to move
amendment 76, in
clause 1, page 1, line 7, after
&#145;people&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;, local
authorities, the business sector and voluntary
sector&#146;.</div><a name="09020355000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000290"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 48, in clause 1, page 1,
line 10, leave out from &#145;insert&#146; to end of
line 11 and insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;the requirement to have
regard to the views of people and the business sector and the voluntary
sector in its area about policing in that area (to be measured by
independently conducted local attitudinal surveys of public
satisfaction) and its compliance
with&#146;.</div><a name="09020355000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
77, in
clause 1, page 1, line 11, after
&#145;people&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;, local
authorities, the business sector and voluntary
sector&#146;.</div><a name="09020355000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000291"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> It is always a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, and you are correct that this sitting marks
the beginning of the meaty scrutiny of the
Bill.</div><a name="09020355000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to place something on record&#151;and I am sure that these
are sentiments that the Minister shares&#151;because the part of the
Bill to which the amendments relate is entitled &#147;Police
reform&#148;. It would be wrong of me not to begin scrutiny of the
Bill without bearing testimony to the hard work that policemen and
women of all ranks do up and down the land. It is a dangerous and
demanding job, and the office of constable imposes on those men and
women constraints that many ordinary employees are not under, such as
restrictions on what they can do when they are off duty. I wish to
begin on that positive note. Clauses in this part 1, on police reform,
are important to me as the shadow Police 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>Minister. My hon. Friends and I wish to conduct the debate in the spirit
of instructive scrutiny, particularly in relation to the
police.</div><a name="09020355000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
76, 48 and 77, standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Hornchurch, go to the very heart of the accountability
debate. Sir Ronnie Flanagan, in his final report on policing in spring
last year, which was instigated by the Home Secretary&#146;s
predecessor but accepted and welcomed by the current Home Secretary,
said at paragraph 7.12, page
81:</div><a name="09020355000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a body of citizens is dissatisfied with the service they receive or the
scrutiny of it, they have little means of
redress.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to talk about the need for more accountability in the scrutiny
of the performance of the police service in England and
Wales.</div><a name="09020355000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all agree on that. Later in our proceedings, the Liberal Democrats will
explore their view, with their alleged enhancement of police
accountability. We have our own view, which is for a single directly
elected police commissioner. In the clause stand part debate, we shall
talk about the Government&#146;s initial position in the Bill and
their position now. My hon. Friend and I have sought an amendment to
put a duty on police authorities to consult not just with people but
with certain bodies. We are not confident that the views of local
businesses, or even local authorities, are being taken account of by
police authorities, and we think that the clause as drafted does
nothing to redress that problem.</div>
<a name="09020355000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
reference in the amendment to seeking the views of the &#147;business
sector&#148;. Why the business sector? The Federation of Small
Businesses has&#151;over many years, not just recently&#151;worked
long and hard to point out that crimes targeted against business are
not, in the experience of its members, given due attention by some
police forces. In short, businesses do not believe that they are
listened to when it comes to reporting crime. That is not a new point
in any shape or form. The business sector, particularly in this dire
economic climate, should be listened to in many forums. Press reports
show that as long ago as last August, Her Majesty&#146;s Government
and the Cabinet Office were predicting an increase in acquisitive, or
property, crime as a result of the economic downturn. If acquisitive
crime is on the increase, we need to pay more attention to the views of
the business sector than we would do in boom times.</div>
<a name="09020355000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
at some facts. Figures presented to me by the Federation of Small
Businesses show that crimes against business make up a fifth of all
recorded crime in the United Kingdom. According to the federation, only
45 per cent. of businesses report crime, because&#151;rightly or
wrongly&#151;of their lack of faith in the system of police response.
I think that that is too much of a blanket criticism, but it is
certainly the case that in some police force areas, businesses do not
report crime even through they have experienced it. They are not sure
that it is worth the time and trouble to get what will perhaps be an
inadequate response from the local force.</div>
<a name="09020355000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020355000292"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): My hon. Friend makes a
good point about the interconnection between business, policing and
enforcement. Does he agree that the Government have not helped the
situation by telegraphing a message through the policing Green Paper
that implied that the police do not have to worry about targets, in
particular those relating to shoplifting? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>Shoplifting was mentioned specifically in the Green Paper as something
that the police almost did not need to bother
about.</div>
<a name="09020355000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000293"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> With typical perspicacity, my hon. Friend has
focused on something that is a live issue, now more than ever, given
the dire economic climate faced by the country. We face an increase in
acquisitive crime and the question&#151;it is only a question, which
my hon. Friend and I have been pondering over the last few
days&#151;is whether it is always an adequate response for the
public, or indeed retailers, to see repeat shoplifters only ever
receive a fixed penalty notice. The allegation&#151;much of it
anecdotal, but no doubt the Minister will give a view&#151;is that
there is no likelihood of magistrates court proceedings for the
mythical theft of a Mars bar, for example, a couple of times from a
corner shop.</div>
<a name="09020355000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is whether there should be harder interventions for high-volume crime
of a low-level nature. What should be the response of the police in
that situation? Should they exercise discretion as the crime is
low-level or, where there is a pattern of persistent shoplifting by an
individual, should they throw the book at them? I would be grateful to
hear the Minister&#146;s response, as we are talking about how,
through this clause, the business community will be able to seek
greater accountability from local police. That is the purpose of the
amendments.</div>
<a name="09020355000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">To continue
with some salient facts, according to the FSB, 45 per cent. of
businesses fail to report crime because of their apparent lack of faith
in the system. Over two thirds of businesses are not even aware of the
neighbourhood policing units that have been rolled out across this
country. The Home Secretary and the Minister are proud of saying that
neighbourhood policing units&#151;the teams that have been rolled out
across the country&#151;are an initiative that is working. Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition support it, although we think that it can
work better. I have seen work to the effect that neighbourhood policing
budgets are going to be ring-fenced for an extra year. That is a good
thing but, according to those statistics, over two thirds of businesses
are not even aware of their existence. It is clear that any
accountability body, whether a police authority&#151;or under the
Conservative model, an elected police commissioner&#151;which is a
democratic, lay representative, overseeing police performance, should
actively seek the views of the business community. If those views are
taken on board, that should be better reflected in the distribution of
resources and the crime-fighting priorities of a chief constable and
his officers.</div>
<a name="09020355000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scale of
the problem should not be underestimated. The FSB indicates that the
average cost of crime per annum is against them. Averages do not mean
much to the typical business because the problem is widespread, but the
cost is &#163;13,000 a year, which affects profitability and staff
morale. If people consider the FSB unrepresentative of the business
community of England and Wales, I would pray in aid the views of the
British Chambers of Commerce, whose 2008 crime survey provided data
that supports the FSB&#146;s view. There was a worrying decline in
the confidence that businesses have in work to tackle crime against
business in their community. The survey, which formed part of the
representations for the Green Paper last year,
said:</div><a name="09020355000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Two
thirds of businesses did not display confidence that police were
dealing with these issues.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020355000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three in ten
businesses&#151;nearly double the number in the 2004
survey&#151;are choosing not to report all crimes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>committed against them. The majority of businesses surveyed felt that
there should be a greater role for the business community in local
crime and disorder partnerships. Over 80 per cent. of businesses
believe that crime against business is a problem in their local
area.</div>
<a name="09020355000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than
listen to me list businesses&#146; concerns, it might be useful for
the Committee to understand why there is a systemic problem. It is not
just the business community having a go and wanting things to be
better. It is a structural problem, which goes to the heart of how we
measure business crime. As many Committee members will be aware, the
British Crime Survey, on which the Home Secretary relies a great deal,
measures the victimisation experience of households and individuals
over and above recorded crime, but it does not measure the
victimisation of commercial businesses or industrial concerns. The last
commercial victimisation survey, which is not part of the annual BCS,
was conducted in 2002. These are one-off, ad-hoc surveys of the
victimisation experience of businesses. They are not in the annual
British crime survey, which covers the experiences of individuals and
households rather than of businesses. In 2002, it was estimated that
there were 14.6 million offences which would not be included in the
annual British crime survey. A fuller picture of crime in this country
should include, on a more regular basis, what happens to businesses and
industrial
concerns.</div>
<a name="09020355000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should we
have regular surveys of crimes against businesses, as judged by surveys
of the victimisation experience of businesses? The Minister will no
doubt say that such surveys are expensive to carry out. Having
considered the matter, my view is that the sample size and the
attendant costs of a proper business survey in this country should at
least be considered every two years, so that we had useful trend
evidence of what the business community is complaining about. By
reference to statistics and research, I have set out those concerns in
detail.</div><a name="09020355000259"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09020355000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch refer to the voluntary sector because voluntary sector
bodies and charities also have offices and are not comprehensively
covered in the annual British crime survey. Like businesses, their
offices can be broken into and office equipment can be stolen, and
fraud can be committed against them. Voluntary bodies are concerned
about crime and whether it is always worth reporting it to the police.
The views of the voluntary sector need to be understood
better.</div>
<a name="09020355000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
category in the amendments is local authorities. Let me say at the
outset that I do not agree with everything that local authorities say
about making the police accountability arrangements more modern and
more focused, but on this matter, I and my hon. Friends agree with the
Local Government Association. In connection with the original Green
Paper arrangements, which we will get to on clause stand part, the LGA
said that the police and the crime and disorder reduction partnerships
need a much closer working relationship and that the police authorities
need to do more to consult district and borough councils. It asks,
quite
rightly:</div><a name="09020355000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Who,
after all, are the partners with the police in CDRPs&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="09020355000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether we
pursue the model of policing authorities as allegedly modernised by the
Bill or the model of a directly elected commissioner as proposed by Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition, we can all agree that local authorities
will continue to have budgetary control over some crime-fighting moneys
and resources and that CDRPs, under the Government&#146;s model or
ours, will continue to work collaboratively. As I never cease to repeat
in public forums, the police cannot fight crime on their own and we
should not expect them to
try.</div><a name="09020355000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
world has moved on: the police have a critical role, but not without
strategic advice and the local authorities&#146; work on the ground,
especially on antisocial behaviour, primary care trusts, drug action
teams and such. Partnership working is essential right across the
board, as it would be under any future Conservative Administration.
What is in the clause to give comfort to local authorities? What is
there to show them that their hard work and efforts will be recognised
when, under the current regime, police authorities set priorities with
chief constables? What is there to show them that police authorities
will take account of the views of local authorities when those
priorities are set with the chief constable? That is the purpose of the
amendment, which refers not only to the business and voluntary sector,
but to local authorities.</div>
<a name="09020355000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
conclude my remarks on the amendments by observing that the clause as
drafted appears to place a new requirement over and above what is in
the Police Act 1996. The Act will be amended to include the requirement
to take into
account</div><a name="09020355000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
views of people in the authority&#146;s area about policing in that
area&#148;.</div><a name="09020355000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Bill, upgrading the 1996 Act, that is coupled with an extra
responsibility for Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary to
carry out an inspection and report to the Secretary of State on the new
requirement under clause 1 as drafted. Does it make a significant,
practical change to the 1996 Act? That Act already gives police
authorities a duty to make arrangements for knowing the views of local
people on matters concerning their policing area, and obtaining
co-operation and preventing crime under section 96. As a lawyer in a
former life, albeit I did not practise for long before becoming an MP,
it seems to my tired, legal brain that there is not a significant or
notable difference between the clause and the precursor legislation in
the 1996
Act.</div><a name="09020355000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister reflect on what Liberty said about the clause and the part
of it to which the amendments refer? Liberty takes a different view
from Opposition and Government Members. It thinks that the idea of
greater lay accountability is bad, but it is surely right of Liberty to
make an interesting drafting point by querying how people are to be
defined and
asking</div><a name="09020355000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
just one or two people in the area express their opinion must the PA
take that into account in discharging its
function?&#148;</div><a name="09020355000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
many people? Can we put a number on it? Liberty observes that the
community</div><a name="09020355000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
in reality consist of a number of
communities&#148;</div><a name="09020355000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
different communities that are judged
by</div><a name="09020355000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ethnicity,
gender and socio-economic
status.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be useful if the Minister explained whether he is relying on a
common-sense meaning of the words, or whether he has an idea of the
number&#151;the quantum&#151;of people or communities that he
anticipates would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>caught by the clause. The part of the clause to which the amendments
relate is designed to enhance accountability, but my first problem
arises from how it differs from the 1996 Act in a material
sense.</div><a name="09020355000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second and final question is about important information to enable the
Committee to understand about where the Government are coming from on
accountability generally. That question is in order for reasons that I
hope will become clear in a minute. At the time it was passed, the
Government made much of the Police and Justice Act 2006. That Act
places on local councillors a duty to respond to what it calls a
&#147;community call for action&#148; from anybody living or
working in an area on a matter concerning crime and disorder, including
antisocial behaviour and behaviour adversely affecting the environment
or substance abuse in that area. Such matters are covered by section 19
of the 2006 Act.</div>
<a name="09020355000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
suggested that the response of the councillor in the ward must show
what, if any, action that councillor proposed to take to resolve the
subject of the complaint by the individual citizen in the area. Because
that goes to the heart of accountability&#151;the key to that part of
the clause&#151;can the Minister say whether that provision is in
operation and, if so, on how many occasions it has been utilised? If we
do not have an answer to how the existing legislation on local
democratic accountability is being utilised, we cannot get to the heart
of why the amendments&#151;or indeed the whole clause&#151;are
important.</div><a name="09020355000040"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000294"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend has latched on to an important
point in the community call for action. I remember the debate in the
relevant Bill Committee on the 2006 Act. One concern expressed at the
time was that the community call for action might get in the way of
existing arrangements that the police had established&#151;ward beats
and ward panel meetings&#151;and a formal requirement such as going
to a new committee at the local authority might add to the levels of
bureaucracy that the police already have. Is that a concern that my
hon. Friend has picked up or that he
shares?</div><a name="09020355000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000295"></a>Mr.

Bill, is entirely right. It is a concern that I have picked up. Police
with whom I have spoken are sceptical of the concept. In fairness to
the Minister, it is also right to say that many police&#151;not
all&#151;are sceptical of the arrangements that the Government
outlined in their Green Paper, but are not wholly in agreement with Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition. However, on the community call for action,
police sceptics are surely right. It is more bureaucratic and shows no
signs of being implemented in any significant way. Like so much
criminal justice legislation since 1997, it seems to be a case of the
legislation being put on the statute book, announced with a fanfare and
getting a press release and a bit of coverage on the airwaves, only for
silence to follow. Nothing happens and the police say that it is
another bit of useless legislation. That, in answer to my hon. Friend,
would be my assessment, unless the Minister&#146;s reply tells me
otherwise.</div><a name="09020355000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000297"></a>Mr.

to intervene, I shall let him.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div><a name="09020355000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000298"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I can be specific on this point, which I hope is
helpful to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend. The community call
for action has become the council call for action, as he will be aware,
and is to be implemented in April this
year.</div><a name="09020355000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000299"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I hope that he
will have even more important points of information that he can share
with the Committee, but with that I conclude my remarks. I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s answers to some of the wider points,
particularly in relation to business
crime.</div><a name="09020355000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020355000300"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): May I echo the comments about
the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas? Like
you, I travelled down from the north, but yesterday rather than Sunday.
I shall only observe that it is amazing how the south grinds to a halt
when we get a little bit of
snow.</div><a name="09020355000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the business in hand, in principle we agree with the thrust of the
amendments. Should the police consult business about local crime
problems and how they should be dealt with? Of course they
should&#151;that is self-evident&#151;just as they should be
consulting with every section of the community. The British Chambers of
Commerce original submission in response to the Green Paper, which has
already referred to, gave some excellent examples of how business feels
that it is often not consulted by the police and how problems such as
business crime on out-of-the-way industrial estates or shoplifting are
ignored. The submission also gave some excellent examples from places
such as north Staffordshire, Barnsley and Rotherham, and Greater
Manchester, where local action and partnerships between chambers of
commerce and police forces led to some very good effects on crime on
those
patches.</div><a name="09020355000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course we support the principle that the police should consult with
business, as with every other part of the community. Like other MPs, I
can draw examples from my local patch. Recently, a group of business
men came to see me about an outbreak of petty vandalism and arson,
which could have led to a death in one case, that was affecting one
road&#151;about six or seven businesses&#151;near to where I live.
There was a mixture of businesses, from a corner shop to a
hairdresser's to an accountant to a picture framers and several others.
As I sat talking to them about this outrage, which had taken place over
a month or two, the first question was, &#147;Have you reported it to
the police?&#148; Two out three of the people who came to see me
said, &#147;No, of course not, there is no point because we&#146;re
not going to get a response.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020355000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09020355000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
pointed out that I know that Derbyshire police pursue an intelligence
leg of policing whereby each week they review the computer profile of
where the calls are coming from, be they nuisance calls or calls about
vandalism, shop break-ins, burglaries and so on, and they direct the
scarce police resources to the pressure points. I pointed out to the
business men that, unless they reported these incidents, providing
something to be logged on the police computer, the police would not be
alerted to the fact that a pattern was emerging in one particular area
of town&#151;in this case, around the small row of shops and
businesses where they operate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div><a name="09020355000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
last year some publicans came to me about Pubwatch, which they have set
up with great enthusiasm in Chesterfield town centre. However, they
felt that they were not getting a good enough response from the
authorities to make Pubwatch work effectively. They had looked at what
the scheme had done in other parts of the country, where local
businesses&#151;in this case publicans&#151;were working well with
the police and the local authorities to tackle the crimes of
alcohol-fuelled misbehaviour and violence around the town centres. They
said that they want more of that in their area, but they felt that they
had to come to their local Member of Parliament to ginger up the police
and authorities to be a bit more responsive. There are a lot of
examples like that, which everyone could recount.</div>
<a name="09020355000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like so many
other parts of the community, businesses feel that there is no point in
reporting crime and that they will be ignored if it is relatively
low-level, petty crime, or the sort of victimless crime involving
property rather than people. They feel that the police and authorities
will not pay attention to them. As the British Chambers of Commerce
submission and examples such as Pubwatch show, if the two sides
interact they can get excellent results. There are some superb examples
of partnerships.</div>
<a name="09020355000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
principle applies in parish councils and town councils. I was a parish
councillor for four years and I well remember the local beat constable
coming along regularly to report what was happening in the patch and to
get the feedback from members of the community who attended those
meetings. I chaired one of the local community forums for Chesterfield
borough council, and we always used to have the local beat officer
along. We used to make a big point of moving the beat officer right to
the top of the agenda, because there was nothing worse than a beat
officer having to spend the whole of a two or three-hour meeting
listening to all the business that was on the agenda before it got to
the point that was relevant to them. That would have been two or three
hours that they could have spent pursuing their duties elsewhere. We
can impose duties to consult and to listen to all sorts of groups on
the police, but we need to do it in a way that will not tie the police
up in yet more bureaucracy and meetings to no avail.</div>
<a name="09020355000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
agree with the principle behind amendments 76, 48 and 77, I
have one or two questions. One relates to the obligation that would be
imposed on the police to carry out regular, independent surveys through
an opinion poll company or similar, to find out what the local
community felt about policing and what the issues and the responses
were. How regularly would those independent surveys be conducted? Who
would bear the cost of them? What response would the police then be
required to give?</div>
<a name="09020355000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are now
back into the territory that we discussed on Second Reading and when
taking evidence from witnesses last week. The Bill as drafted states
that local police authorities and police forces will &#147;have
regard&#148; to what the local community tells them. What exactly
does &#147;have regard&#148; mean? In this case, it means they must
have regard to the findings of frequent opinion poll surveys of
business people, but how are the police to decide to which source of
information and views they should give priority, especially when the
Bill gives Ministers extra powers to direct police authorities to do
certain things? We have already raised that question in previous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>debates: what happens if the Minister&#146;s direction and the local
community&#146;s response of, &#147;No, this is what we
need,&#148; clash?</div>
<a name="09020355000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes us
to the territory highlighted by Liberty, which has already been
discussed, relating to what will now be called the council call for
action. I will come back to the issue when we discuss new clause 2 and
new clause 4, which stand in my name. The call for action in the 2006
Act calls for a local councillor to take prompt action when approached
by members of their ward, which in this case could be local businesses.
Councillors must indicate what action they propose to take to resolve
the problem.</div>
<a name="09020355000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">What can that
individual councillor do? A district or a borough councillor has no
direct input to the police authority. A county councillor or a city
councillor who is not on the police authority has no direct input to
the police authority, either. Through the local crime and disorder
reduction partnership, individual councillors might be able to have
some impact, but by and large they will not. Do not the provision in
the 2006 Act, the provisions in the Bill about ministerial direction
and having regard to community calls, and the amendments&#146;
requirement to have regard to views of businesses gathered through
independent surveys carry the risk that the police authority will be
unable to reconcile all the different people instructing it? It is a
balancing act.</div>
<a name="09020355000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the police
authority is constantly going to be directed from London, as well as be
expected to take notice of local opinion, there will be a tension. When
I asked about this last week, I was told that it would sort itself out,
but it is not that simple. If responsibilities are being placed on the
police to do this, this, this and this, especially when they do not
have control over their own funding and manpower levels, at some point
they will have to take decisions. They will ignore that instruction, or
that request from the community, or that request from business in order
to do something else.</div>
<a name="09020355000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that we should give the police authorities more independence to take
those decisions purely in the light of local circumstances. In
principle, I support the amendment, but I should like some
clarification of how frequent the surveys should be, who will bear the
cost and how the police authority will have regard to what these
surveys reveal in their regular
reports.</div><a name="09020355000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000301"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> This is the first time, apart from an
intervention, that I have got to my feet in this Committee. May I start
by welcoming you to the Chair, Sir Nicholas, of this formal part of our
proceedings?</div>
<a name="09020355000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
welcome all other members of the Committee. As is customary, I welcome
to the Committee my shadow, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. He,
the hon. Member for Hornchurch and I have had many interesting and
informative debates. I will try to answer all questions I am asked.
Although I may not always agree with people, I will try to make
progress and to take account of the opinions and views expressed. Where
possible and where I believe it appropriate, I will try to change and
adapt. It is good to be here.</div>
<a name="09020355000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I join the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds in his generous tribute to the work
done by police officers and staff up and down the country: they do an
excellent job. As he said, they often do that job in difficult and
dangerous circumstances. I am sure that the hon. Member for
Chesterfield shares those sentiments.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div><a name="09020355000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important debate and the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has raised
some interesting points. He and the hon. Member for Chesterfield spoke
about businesses not reporting crime and people not feeling confident
about reporting crime because they do not feel that it will make any
difference. It does not matter whether it is a business, an individual,
a youth club or a family: everybody should report crime. That is a
basic principle and a basic standard. I take the point that sometimes
people say it is not worth it, but the starting point has to be that
people should report crime when it occurs. I know that the hon. Member
for Chesterfield would agree with that and I know he was making a
particular point about business, but it is important to set out right
at the start that reporting crime, regardless of the category one could
be put into, is of particular importance.</div>
<a name="09020355000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
businesses say what the hon. Gentleman recounted. My hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department is working hard on
some of the issues that businesses have raised, such as dealing with
repeat offenders. I talked to the police and the Crown Prosecution
Service about that when I had responsibility for that area and I know
that my hon. Friend has done so,
so.</div><a name="09020355000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Variation
across the country is an issue. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
made the point that, in some parts of the country, businesses do not
feel that they are included in neighbourhood policing work and CDRP
work. However, in other areas of the country, businesses say that they
have a fantastic relationship and that they do brilliant work; they say
that the police respond quickly and appropriately, as does the local
authority. As the hon. Member for Chesterfield said, the challenge is
to ensure that we bring everybody up to that standard. At local level,
the CDRP can prioritise business crime as a particular challenge in its
area. Important though we think business crime is, we are all for local
decision making, so we will not dictate that CDRPs must do
that.</div><a name="09020355000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will deal with a couple of the other points raised by the hon. Members
for Bury St. Edmunds and for Chesterfield before making some more
general comments on the amendments. The hon. Member for Bury
St. Edmunds is quite right to talk about the ring-fencing of
the neighbourhood policing budget for a further year next year. It will
be uplifted, subject to tomorrow&#146;s announcement, by 2.7 per
cent. to &#163;332
million.</div><a name="09020355000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the difference between clause 1 and what is
in the 1996 Act, which also came up in the evidence session. It is
important to recognise that the 1996 Act talks about &#147;obtaining
the views&#148;, whereas we are placing a duty on police
authorities</div><a name="09020355000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
have regard to the
views&#148;.</div><a name="09020355000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
lawyers tell me that that is a much stronger obligation. I often
approach such issues from a common-sense point of view and it seems
much stronger to me. The vast majority of people would see &#147;must
have regard to&#148; as a much stronger requirement on police
authorities than simply &#147;obtaining the views&#148;. With the
latter, the views can just be collected in, the box ticked, but nothing
done. If regard must be given to the views, it must be possible to
demonstrate in inspections that account has been taken of the
views.</div><a name="09020355000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked who are &#147;the people&#148;. There is
no new definition: they are the same people to whom section 96 of the
1996 Act refers. There is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>strict definition. He asked whether we should assume that it refers to
the common-sense definition of &#147;the people&#148; that we would
all understand. The answer is yes. It has been interpreted as all the
people, or at least a representative sample of people who live and work
in the area. Hopefully I have gone some way towards answering his
question.</div><a name="09020355000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chesterfield asked whether the clause gives local
people the power to interfere in policing matters. It does not require
the police authority to follow somebody&#146;s views automatically
simply because they put their hand up at a public meeting. That would
be ludicrous. We have all been to public meetings where people have put
their hands up. That is clearly not the intention behind the measure.
However, clearly, we can also not ignore people&#146;s views. That is
why the clause says that authorities must</div>
<a name="09020355000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to
the views...of
people&#148;.</div><a name="09020355000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be ludicrous if five people in five different meetings put their
hands up and said, &#147;We think this or that should be
done,&#148; and could automatically expect any police officer or
police authority to do
it.</div><a name="09020355000261"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
<a name="09020355000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry if
I gave the hon. Gentleman the impression of being dismissive when I
gave evidence; I was not trying to do that at all. However, there comes
a time when judgments have to be made. We have different views on how
to make people accountable for making those judgments, but people
nevertheless have to make judgments about what they should or should
not do.</div>
<a name="09020355000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to do
that as Members of Parliament. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents
will go to him with a view about something, and say that everybody
agrees with them; five minutes later, someone else will have a
completely different view about the issue and say that everybody agrees
with them. Members of Parliament, police officers and police
authorities alike must, at the end of the day, demonstrate that they
have listened and had regard to people&#146;s views, but there will
be times when they have to make a judgment. Is that representative? The
duty to ensure that views are represented is required under section 96
of the Police Act 1996, and under the
Bill.</div><a name="09020355000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree to an extent with the point made by the hon. Gentleman, but the
amendment is unnecessary. Why? I agree that the views of local
authorities, and the business and voluntary sectors, should be
considered when the police authority carries out its functions. To that
extent, as I said, I accept the sentiments that are behind the
amendment. However&#151;there is always one of those&#151;the hon.
Gentleman seems to think that &#147;people&#148; does not include
local authorities, businesses and the voluntary sector. The Committee
should be clear, as I am, that</div>
<a name="09020355000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the views of
people
in&#148;</div><a name="09020355000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
authority&#146;s area is a wide standard. It can include people who
live and/or work in the area; people in businesses; people in the local
authorities; and people in the voluntary sector
organisations.</div>
<a name="09020355000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman puts those groups in the Bill, why not include the charitable
sector, lobby groups or pubs? Why not include a range of other people
and organisations?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000302"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On two of the examples that the Minister just
listed, pubs would come under &#147;business sector&#148; and
charities under &#147;voluntary sector&#148; under the terms of the
amendment.</div><a name="09020355000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000303"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That would not change the fact that if we list
people in the Bill, others could be left out. We expect the duty to
reach everyone within a community. That does not mean that people who
are part of organisations should be ignored, but it does mean that they
should be considered as individuals, not members of a specific
body.</div>
<a name="09020355000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020355000304"></a><b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): I listened to the
Minister&#146;s exchange with my hon. Friend. As he rightly says,
pubs are businesses, and are thus included in the amendment, and
charities are part of the voluntary sector. I am struggling to think of
an example of a sector that would be different from the wider sectors
in the amendment. Will the Minister offer
one?</div>
<a name="09020355000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000305"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Whether or not I come up with an example, the
point is that as soon as we designate a list of organisations in a
Bill, other organisations will come forward and say, &#147;We
don&#146;t fit into this or that category&#148;. All the things
that the hon. Gentleman and hon. Lady want included are included in any
common-sense understanding of the word
&#147;people&#148;.</div>
<a name="09020355000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020355000306"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): Would a compromise
between the two sides be&#151;so there could be no doubt&#151;if
the Bill said, &#147;after &#145;people&#146;, insert
&#145;including local authorities, the business sector and the
voluntary sector&#146;&#148;? That would put them on the face of
the Bill, and &#147;people&#148; would still comply with the
Minister&#146;s definition of
&#147;people&#148;.</div>
<a name="09020355000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000307"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It is unnecessary to do that, because those are
included in the definition of the term &#147;people&#148;. There is
not actually any disagreement between us. I agree that the voluntary
sector should be consulted.  I agree that businesses should be
consulted, as I agree that any of those on the other lists that I have
put forward should also be consulted. It is not necessary, however, to
include them on the face of the Bill. There are regulations with
respect to the Police Act 1996, as with respect to this Bill, about who
should be consulted. We want a wide range of people to be consulted,
and that is what will happen as a consequence of the Bill and the
arrangements that will be made.</div>
<a name="09020355000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds did not say much about local attitudinal
surveys, but I thought the point he was getting at was the same sort of
point he is making with respect to &#147;people&#148;. What he is
concerned about&#151;he is quite right to be concerned about
it&#151;is what consulting people actually means. I thought that, as
well as the points he was making about &#147;people,&#148; he was
going to talk about the meaning of local attitudinal surveys.</div>
<a name="09020355000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to be helpful to the Committee. I said at the evidence session that I
do not believe that consulting the public should be just a leaflet
pushed through the door. There are those who would say, &#147;Oh, we
consulted with the local people. We gave out a leaflet.&#148; That
might be how some of our police authorities would say they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>had fulfilled that duty. That is not sufficient. They may well need to
survey, whether or not it is a local attitudinal survey. The hon.
Member for Chesterfield is right to raise what that means, who would
pay for it and other issues around it. That would be a matter for
people to sort out locally. But there are issues about surveys and
about how they should be included. There are issues about public
meetings and how they fit in with the neighbourhood policing teams, the
pledges and all the other things that people are committed to. There
are also other ways of doing it, such as inviting people to write in.
Not only is it about who should be consulted: there is a big issue
about how they should be consulted, and ensuring that they are
consulted in an effective way. Surveys should be part of the
consultation, whether or not they are local attitudinal surveys, but
they do not need to be put on the face of the Bill. The arrangements
that we will put forward deal with this.</div>
<a name="09020355000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, it
is important to ensure that we do not just survey, send leaflets or get
to public meetings. The same people always turn up at public meetings
and respond to surveys. Part of this has got to be about trying to get
to those people who usually do not respond. We can call them
hard-to-reach groups or anything else, but there are often a number of
people whom we ordinarily do not reach.</div>
<a name="09020355000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
extremely important. I do not want the situation that sometimes
occurs&#151;I am sure that we have all experienced this&#151;where
one goes to a meeting about hospital closures and meets a group of
people there, and then one goes to a meeting about a level crossing,
and the same people turn up. We must find a way to encourage more
people to
participate.</div><a name="09020355000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been an important debate. There is a distinction between
&#147;obtaining the views of&#148; and &#147;having regard
to&#148;. We need to ensure that we consult the widest possible group
of people. We also need to consider how we consult them. It should not
just be a question of putting out the odd leaflet; it should be a wide
range of things. I would say that that should include surveys, although
they would not be the only measure. Again, I would not put that in the
Bill, but I have read those things into the record and they are
important.</div><a name="09020355000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many respects, the points that I have made agree with the points made
by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. The only difference between us
seems to be that he believes that those things should be in the Bill,
whereas I think that they are implicit in the work that has been done
since 1996, following the Police Act. In addition, the comments that I
have just read into the record take into account the points made by the
hon. Gentleman and demonstrate the importance that we attach to a wide
range of people being consulted, in exciting and innovative ways, so
that we obtain the views of the broadest cross-section possible of
people, businesses, voluntary organisations and
others.</div><a name="09020355000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000308"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am not sure that the Minister has touched
on the community call for action or councillor call for action that my
hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds raised and the concerns
highlighted during the brief comments made on that. Will the Minister
expound on how he sees the councillor call for action operating and
what impact it will have in the context of the various points that he
has highlighted?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="09020355000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000309"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was quite
right to point out that there is often legislation that is not
implemented.</div><a name="09020355000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000310"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> There is a lot of
that.</div><a name="09020355000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000311"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Well, some legislation is not implemented, but
quite a considerable amount is implemented. The hon. Gentleman
specifically asked when what was the community call for action would be
implemented. That has been announced before, but clearly it has not
reached as wide an audience or cross-section of people, including
members of the Committee, as we would have hoped. As the hon. Gentleman
will know, the overview and scrutiny committees were set up under that
Act. One specific part of it required a trigger to get that going: the
crime provisions. For the overview and scrutiny committees of local
authorities to consider the crime reduction aspects, there had to be a
trigger, and we have announced the implementation of that. It will
start in April
2009.</div><a name="09020355000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the councillor call for action, the councillor will receive, in the way
that the hon. Member for Chesterfield pointed out, information or
requests from somebody in their community. The councillor will then
have to decide whether they will take that forward. From April 2009,
they will be able to take it to the overview and scrutiny committee.
They will be able to say to the committee, &#147;This point has been
raised with me by somebody and I am bringing it to the
committee&#146;s attention.&#148; The overview and scrutiny
committee has a legal obligation to consider that point. It has a legal
obligation to decide what it will do with that. In the normal way in
which people are held to account, it will have to consider
that.</div><a name="09020355000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point, which I was asked about directly by the hon. Member for
Chesterfield, is why that is important&#151;I am trying to remember
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. It is important because it is
about partnership. Reducing crime and disorder in an area is a matter
not only for the police but for the local authority&#151;the hon.
Gentleman reflected that in his comments. The accountability that he
mentioned is that of the local authority to reduce crime in their area,
as well as that of the police. Alongside the measures relating to the
police, it is exceedingly important to have a local authority
responsibility clearly laid out in the councillor call for
action.</div>
<a name="09020355000262"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09020355000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000312"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Does the Minister envisage that disciplinary
proceedings could be brought against a councillor who simply fails to
respond to a constituent, given that this is a statutory obligation
that will be implemented from April?</div>
<a name="09020355000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000313"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> No, I do not think so. If the hon. Gentleman
thinks about it, a local councillor operates under a huge number of
statutory obligations relating to a whole range of different measures.
For example, local councillors have to take account of planning and
housing matters, and there are statutory obligations regarding leisure
and recreation. There is a huge range of measures that a local
councillor must have regard to and take responsibility for. That does
not mean that they are legally liable in any way when they try and
operate those functions, but it means that they have a responsibility
to act within that legal framework.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div><a name="09020355000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legal
framework is set out with respect to houses, recreation and leisure. It
will be exactly the same with the councillor call for action. As long
as the local councillor has shown due diligence and has operated
appropriately, actively and according to the law, that will be the
correct way forward.</div>
<a name="09020355000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has been
an important debate. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for
Bury St. Edmunds that the amendments are not necessary for certain
measures to be included in the Bill. I agree with the sentiments that
he has expressed about people and businesses and so on, and I hope that
he will withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09020355000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000314"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I know that the Minister has many gifts, but I
did not know that he was a great environmentalist. I did not think that
he was capable of such recycling of announcements. He has recycled, or
reannounced, the councillor call for action, but I do not know whether
he will get as much coverage as his predecessor when that was announced
it a couple of years ago.</div>
<a name="09020355000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000315"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> This time it is going to
happen.</div>
<a name="09020355000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000316"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s honesty
on at least that point&#151;the measure was announced with a fanfare
but nothing much came of it. Second time lucky perhaps. We have
fundamental objections, some of which were touched on by my hon. Friend
the Member for Hornchurch, particularly in relation to how the police
will react to this. However, let us see the operation in practice, as
this has not been tried before.</div>
<a name="09020355000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
detain the Committee much longer, but I wish to make two points. First,
I am not entirely convinced that the &#147;must have regard
to&#148; new duty is significantly different from what is in the 1996
Act. I heard what the Minister said, but I am still not
persuaded.</div>
<a name="09020355000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
raised a point about the Opposition not talking about attitudinal
surveys. He has probably read my remarks on that subject&#151;I am a
great believer in such surveys. I am sure that he has seen in the west
midlands and elsewhere very good examples of where attitudinal surveys
operate not just to give high levels of satisfaction to the
public&#151;because they think they are being listened to&#151;but
as an important source of feedback for the police operationally. We
will touch on that during the clause stand part debate, should I be
fortunate enough to catch your eye, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="09020355000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
finally say that there has been an important interchange regarding the
business community. As I have said, business should not be privileged
among other victims of crime&#151;I think that was the gist of the
Minister&#146;s speech. My remarks were a modest plea to flag up the
fact that in this dire economic climate, in which acquisitive crime is
on the up, businesses need to be heard even more than they normally
would. The statistics that I cited show that there is a deeper
structural problem&#151;the Minister did not touch on that, but
perhaps we can address it later&#151;that goes to the heart of how
crime is perceived.</div>
<a name="09020355000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crimes
against business property and other related business crime are not in
the British crime survey and the commercial victimisation survey is
very much an ad hoc affair&#151;it is not published annually. We in
this House, the police service and the wider public do not get a clear
read-out of the amount of crime committed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>against business. That was one of the motivations that drove me to table
the amendments. I was not persuaded by what the Minister said, so I
wish to press the amendments to a
vote.</div><a name="09020355000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000317"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Let me help the hon. Gentleman. I am, naturally,
prepared to allow a vote on the lead amendment, but the other two
amendments in the group are down only for debate, not a decision. Of
course, should he wish to bring forward one of the other amendments
over the lead amendment, I would grant him a Division on
that.</div><a name="09020355000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000332"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The clause is interesting because of what it does
not say. The previous debate indicated that it was a limited reform of
police accountability&#151;a very modest change. Of course, however,
that was not what Her Majesty&#146;s Government promised us, or
indicated that they wanted to do, last summer. Sir Nicholas, you will
recall the publication of the policing Green Paper in the middle of
July, just before the House rose. It was an important document that
borrowed from, but did not follow too closely, the final Flanagan
report of February
2008.</div><a name="09020355000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Ronnie Flanagan was surely right, as was the Home Secretary last July
when she introduced the Green Paper, in thinking that, to quote Sir
Ronnie:</div><a name="09020355000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a body of citizens is dissatisfied with the service they receive or the
scrutiny of it, they have little means of
redress&#148;</div><a name="09020355000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">under
the current arrangements. He went on to say in paragraph 7.23 of his
final report, which, as I say, informed the Green Paper that was
published last
July:</div><a name="09020355000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
most critical shift which needs to occur is to enhance the
responsiveness and answerability of policing services in local
communities. To achieve this, we must bring about an acceleration in
fully adopting a citizen-focused approach to policing; putting customer
service and the interests and needs of local people at the core of
priority
setting.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was worth reading that out, because it was not a politician saying that
there needed to be improved police accountability, but Sir Ronnie
Flanagan, a massively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>distinguished serving officer in Northern Ireland and, of course,
&#147;the head of profession&#148;, as many police officers would
describe the position of Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of
constabulary. This is not prating, complaining or grumbling by lay
people or politicians.</div>
<a name="09020355000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
believed until last summer, when I heard what Ministers were outlining,
that they broadly agreed with the thrust of what Sir Ronnie was saying.
Of course, the means of achieving such greater accountability will be
different, depending on one&#146;s political party and political
taste, but I thought that there was at least an understanding that
something had to be done.</div>
<a name="09020355000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was not
just Sir Ronnie Flanagan who flagged up the problem with the amount of
accountability that the public have in respect of police performance in
their area. The crime and communities review conducted by Louise Casey,
a Government official, made the point even more effectively than Sir
Ronnie&#146;s excellent review, because she gave statistics. The
Casey review, which was also published last summer, found that 67 per
cent. of people did not know who to complain to if they were not happy
with how their local area was being policed. According to that
review&#151;the Government&#146;s own review&#151;only 7 per
cent. of people understood how police accountability worked in
practice. The review also found that 68 per cent. of people agreed or
strongly agreed that there should be a person elected by local people
to hold the police to account on behalf of the community, which is an
argument for direct election of some kind.</div>
<a name="09020355000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that
although the Conservative proposition would be a single elected police
commissioner, the Government have certainly contemplated an element of
direct election to a body that would hold the police to account. As we
know, there are county councillors on police authorities at the moment,
but they are indirectly elected. Those elected county councillors are
nominated on to the police authority and thus serve
indirectly.</div>
<a name="09020355000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Secretary went into some detail in the policing Green Paper on how the
accountability gap diagnosed by Ms Casey and Sir Ronnie would be
solved. In paragraph 1.71 of the Green Paper, she set out something
very pertinent to our debate about the clause&#151;I observe the fact
that you are a strict taskmaster in this respect, Sir Nicholas. In the
paragraph, which mentions legislation, the Home Secretary
said:</div><a name="09020355000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will legislate to reform police authorities, making them more
democratic and more effective in responding to the needs of the local
community. We will retain the crucial role that independent members
play, and they will be appointed as they are at
present.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
went on to
say:</div><a name="09020355000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
majority on each police authority will, however, no longer be formed
from local councillors...Instead, people throughout England and
Wales will directly vote for individuals, known as Crime and Policing
Representatives (CPRs), to represent their concerns
locally.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have quoted the Green Paper verbatim because it will assist our
deliberations on the
clause.</div><a name="09020355000263"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09020355000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
paragraph 1.73, the Home Secretary said that the CPRs, which are to be
directly
elected,</div><a name="09020355000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
sit on their local CDRP (England) or CSP (Wales), ensuring that local
issues are being addressed through existing partnership
structures...One of the CPRs in each area will also chair the
CDRP/CSP. Second, they will sit on the force&#146;s police authority,
and, amongst their other duties, will ensure that local issues are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>reflected at the force level. Police Authorities&#151;newly
constituted&#151;will retain their current responsibilities
particularly around ensuring forces are working together to address
regional and national
issues.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the vision of direct election that, last July, the Home Secretary
said that she would legislate for. She did not say that she might
legislate for it, or that the Government would review certain detailed
prescriptions&#151;she said that they would legislate. It was
therefore somewhat surprising to discover in the autumn that all that
was to be set at nought, and that the Government had changed their
mind. That is certainly one of the first questions to which I would
like the Minister to respond. Given the wealth of detail that I have
just mentioned, given the work that was clearly being done in the Home
Office on directly elected representatives, and given the detail of the
proposition, will he tell us why it has all been
junked?</div><a name="09020355000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
proposal did not find favour with everyone. ACPO indicated, among its
many objections, that such a system would not enable the delivery of
strategic protective services. It was concerned that collaboration, and
other arrangements to close the level 2 gap, to use the shorthand,
would not be properly addressed. It made comments to the effect that
there would be an unhealthy local populism&#151;in other words, that
directly elected representatives would pay too much attention to parish
pump politics and local crime, and lose the big picture, for example,
of what was happening in serious organised crime across the region. I
disagree with the ACPO argument, because it did not give enough due to
democratically, directly elected representatives, whether under the
Green Paper model of Her Majesty&#146;s Government or our model. More
respect has to be given to elected representatives and their ability to
do the right thing, whereas ACPO has argued that they would not pay
attention and not do the right thing regarding the more high-flying,
strategic jobs that local forces have to do in delivering more
joined-up responses on protective
services.</div><a name="09020355000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Police Authorities did not much like the initial
Government proposals, which were set out in detail in the Green Paper
and which the Government said they would legislate for in this Bill,
either. The association did not much like the idea of direct elections.
Some of its objections were well made, but one struck me as being a
non-sequitur. In its response to the Green Paper during the
consultation phase, APA
said:</div><a name="09020355000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Direct
elections would not increase the opportunity for greater equality in
police authority appointments and diversity in the
membership.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020355000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder why the APA
takes such a dim view of directly elected representatives, suggesting
that they would have no interest in greater equality in police
appointments. What possible evidence base is there for anyone to say
that directly elected representatives would not care about those
things?</div>
<a name="09020355000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The APA went
on to talk about the potential for the politicisation of police
authorities. It is incumbent on me at this point to say that the
Conservative party believes that the best reform&#151;I shall not go
into detail, because I do not wish to be out of order&#151;would be a
single, focal point of police accountability. In the words of my right
hon. Friend, the Leader of the Opposition, it would be a person whom
people knew and had seen; one person to whom they could complain to get
something done if policing was not as it should be in a police force
area, and they would be able to kick that person, that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>elected commissioner, out at the ballot box every four years if he or
she did not deliver an improved service through their scrutiny of a
chief constable&#146;s work.</div>
<a name="09020355000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses state their own view of how to inject more direct democracy
into the current arrangement, but can we just agree on something? It is
a modest plea. For the APA and others to say that nefarious and
improper politicisation will take place is to argue against democracy.
We do not say for a single second that one man cannot oversee Greater
London, which is one of the greatest metropolises, if not the greatest
metropolis, on planet Earth, with several million citizens. We do not
say, &#147;We can&#146;t have a directly elected mayor, as it would
be wrong. How could so much power reside in one man?&#148; Parliament
passed an Act stating that there would be a directly elected mayor,
and, since then, we have had Mayor Livingstone and Mayor Johnson. No
one said, &#147;The direct election of one person could result in a
British National party individual becoming Mayor of London.&#148;
Arguments for democratising police authorities must not morph into
criticisms that reform might turn up left or right-wing extremists,
because that is an argument against local council elections if ever
there was one.</div>
<a name="09020355000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
move on, but first I want to go through the list of critics of the
Government&#146;s original proposals, including the APA and ACPO. The
Police Federation, in its response to proposals for crime and policing
representatives in the Green Paper,
said:</div><a name="09020355000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are unconvinced that directly elected members would ensure greater
representativeness of the local communities that a police authority is
there to
serve.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
even when those critical views were made known, the Government said
that they would press ahead with directly elected CPRs. As recently as
5 November 2008, the Home Secretary said in a
speech:</div>
<a name="09020355000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are committed to greater accountability at neighbourhood level through
neighbourhood policing. It is right that we also provide a direct link
to the public within police
governance.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the indications were that legislation would be introduced in a police
Bill, and I, like those who are interested in police reform, should
like to know when the Home Secretary suddenly decided that directly
elected CPRs were a bad idea, because, in the first week of November,
she still seemed to be in favour of it.</div>
<a name="09020355000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses were tabled not by me but by the Liberal Democrats, but it
might be useful if I comment new clause 2. New clause 2(3) refers to a
police authority&#146;s representatives
being</div><a name="09020355000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;directly
elected by Single Transferable
Vote.&#148;</div><a name="09020355000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument about politicisation, which has been made many times, is not a
silly one, and I am not saying that it should not be made. The idea is
that direct elections in any form&#151;whether Liberal Democrat,
Conservative or the original Government form from last July&#151;will
lead to the election of extremists, whether on the left or right. The
British National party is normally mentioned in connection with the
right, but obviously the argument does not apply to extremists on the
right only&#151;there are extremists on both wings of the political
spectrum. A single transferable vote, rather than the popular
vote&#151;the first past the post vote&#151;is more likely to lead
to representation from extremists. I wonder, therefore, why the Liberal
Democrats have drafted subsection (3) in that way. I know that they
have a long-standing, touching attachment to a new voting system of
proportional representation, which in various versions relies on
STV.</div>

1918.</div><a name="09020355000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000334"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Yes, I think of the Asquith Government, then the
Lloyd George Government, which were the last fully functioning majority
Liberal Governments. However, since then, they have changed their view,
if my history is right&#151;I stand to be corrected, but I think that
it
is.</div><a name="09020355000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those who are worried about the politicisation that would come with
direct election to police bodies, the reference in subsection (3) to
the single transferable vote poses a massive problem for the Liberal
Democrats. Statistically, it is much more likely that an extremist will
gain some representation under STV than under a first-past-the-post
system. Will the Liberal Democrats answer that point when they speak to
their new clauses? I have been very open in conceding&#151;I would be
a fool not to concede&#151;that there are concerns about the
politicisation that comes with direct election. My basic answer is that
that is an argument against democracy, and I have pointed to the
example of councils. We allow people to vote in council elections on a
first-past-the-post basis. We do not say that they should not have a
vote because an extremist might be voted in. Of course, those on the
centre ground of modern British politics, such my hon. Friends and
myself, hope that extremists of whatever stripe do not reach public
office. We believe that government in this country, whether at the
local or central Government level, should be from the centre, where
common ground can be found. Nevertheless, one cannot argue that the
potential election of extremists is a reason to deny people a vote in a
direct election. However, the Liberal Democrats have to answer the
question that pops up regularly about the election of the
BNP.</div>
<a name="09020355000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
refers to the setting of performance targets. The Liberal Democrats
wish to amend related provisions in existing legislation. Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition have long railed against the performance
culture taken to extremes. I am a reasonable man, and I have had
constructive debates with the police service and Ministers. The
Conservative position is not that all performance data must be
abolished. No serious politician in, or aspiring to, government could
argue that there should be no measures of police performance. The
Government are seeking to enhance the measures in place for the
assessments of policing and community safety&#151;the successor to
the police performance assessment framework&#151;but that is still
being worked out. We understand that, but there are all sorts of
questions about what kind of duty there is on police forces to comply
with a rigid APACS regime. We do not know what the final version of
APACS will look like but, from what I have seen as a member of Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition&#151;I am not in government, so I am not
privy to all the detailed briefings&#151;I have reservations about
it. However, it is certainly the case that a performance management
regime is required, whoever the Government are. Otherwise, how can the
police service possibly navigate the delivery of good policing and how
can any inspectorate possibly work out whether a police force is doing
a good or a bad job? The reform of targets which is touched on in this
new clause is important.</div>
<a name="09020355000264"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09020355000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am afraid that I am not seduced by the big claim from the Home
Secretary that all performance targets have been abolished save for one
target relating to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>public confidence. We often hear that bandied around, albeit without too
much conviction in front of police audiences, because the police know
it is at best, wishful thinking, and at worst a dreadful hoax. Of
course, there are many more targets behind the priority actions under
public service agreements, which are targets by any other name. My
understanding is that Home Office Ministers say, &#147;No, no, no,
these are understandings between the Home Office and the
Treasury.&#148; There are four targets relating to the Home Office,
all of which have priority actions underneath them. The police I speak
to&#151;and my reading of these agreements&#151;suggest that they
are targets. They have not been abolished, so for the Home Secretary to
argue that there is one target left is, shall we say, a terminological
inexactitude.</div>
<a name="09020355000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends and I would like to take a new look at targets. We concede that
there must be some performance data, but we want to drive down the
setting of local priorities to police force areas. Our proposal would
not be in the form proposed by the new clause, but we certainly see a
role for local priority setting by the directly elected police
commissioner. They will stand on a platform at the ballot box and they
wish to be re-elected, they must stand again on their record and
whether or not they have delivered local priorities. The priorities in
West Mercia will be different from those in Essex, and the priorities
in Suffolk will be different from those in Kent or Northumbria, because
there will be different locally elected commissioners.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I see the hon. Member for
Chesterfield nodding.</div>
<a name="09020355000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we
support different means&#151;the hon. Gentleman believes in greater
local priority setting and his clause attempts to achieve
that&#151;we should not have national targets imposed from on high,
from Whitehall. Neither do we want to hear the phrase &#147;Well,
it&#146;s a postcode lottery&#148;. There will be different
priorities in different parts of the country, which is a good thing,
but I am not satisfied that new clause 4 delivers that as well as the
Conservative proposal. We certainly see a new role for directly elected
representatives&#151;in our case, our representatives&#151;to set
targets, and we would measure the performance of locally elected
commissioners.</div>
<a name="09020355000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there
should be a simple level of total crime that is published annually,
supported by local detection rates. That would be the first measure of
the performance of a commissioner and indeed the chief constable and
force that the directly elected commissioner would be scrutinising and
overseeing. Secondly&#151;and I am coming on to the attitudinal
surveys that the Minister spoke about&#151;we would want to measure
not just total crime but the fear of crime by introducing robust,
independently conducted attitudinal surveys. The third measure would be
public confidence and satisfaction. Again, that would be measured
through robust, independent attitudinal surveys, with particular
reference to the views and experience of those who come into contact
with the police, whether as victims, witnesses or individuals reporting
crime.</div><a name="09020355000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000335"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> To help me understand what the hon. Gentleman is
saying about attitudinal surveys, does he envisage the survey being
done at a fixed point or over a period of time? I ask that because a
problem with fixed-point measures, which try to understand the fear of
crime, is that someone only has to cite something that has happened
recently in the local area&#151;a terrible knife crime or something
like that&#151;and it completely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>skews the result of the survey. How one finds a true measure of crime
that is not influenced by an abnormal act is a real problem, and it is
something with which we are wrestling. Does the hon. Gentleman think
that a fixed-point survey or something that takes place over a period
of time is appropriate in respect of that
problem?</div><a name="09020355000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000336"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> It would be something taking place over a period
of time. The hon. Gentleman will have spoken to forces that do these
attitudinal surveys. He makes a good point that relates to the whole
issue of the measuring of crime and the fear of crime. There is a good
book called &#147;Nudge&#148;, which refers to social norms and
other things that were fashionable before the dire need for state
interventionism that was necessary as a result of the credit crunch.
The author talks about how, psychologically, people are
disproportionately affected in their behaviour by things that happened
to them recently. It seems an obvious and trite point, but it does
relate to the point about
crime.</div><a name="09020355000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000337"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> In my constituency, there was an example of
exactly what the Minister and my hon. Friend have been discussing. Hon.
Members will be aware that a post office worker was recently murdered
in my constituency in what is normally an incredibly safe and lovely
area in which to live. Inevitably, I have had a lot of correspondence
from people who feel vulnerable, troubled and upset. That is bound to
express itself in the surveys about which the Minister and my hon.
Friend have been
talking.</div><a name="09020355000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000338"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Indeed,
in terms of crime levels, West Mercia is one of the more
fortunate&#151;or perhaps I should say successful&#151;forces in
the country because it seems to keep them below the average. I am sure
that all Committee members have had such an experience. I remember that
five years ago, in the rural part of my constituency in Suffolk, we had
the third lowest crime rate in England and Wales. However, there was a
spate of two burglaries in one village. Of course, the local newspapers
in that part of mid-Suffolk were full of nothing but that crime wave
for two weeks, because that particular village had not had a burglary
for a long time. Two burglaries occurred pretty much at the same time
and everyone was full of fear that their houses were going to be
invaded.</div>
<a name="09020355000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
party political point at issue here, but if we all want good
attitudinal surveys, they must be independently conducted. They should
not be a snapshot and, above all, they should not be a replacement for
hard data on the total level of crime. Such surveys are a supplement to
that data. All of us who are involved in what will be an ongoing debate
about improving police accountability should focus on the fact that
there will be two parts to it. There will be a greater focus on the
main concern in local communities, which is whether fear of crime is
being reduced, whether people are satisfied when they come into contact
with the police and whether the police return calls in a timely fashion
and investigate incidents. However, the Opposition believe that there
will never be any substitute for a total crime number in an area. We
are not devaluing the importance of total crime levels by talking about
attitudinal surveys. Those surveys support the crime figures; they do
not replace them. We must be extremely clear about that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="09020355000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that
the debate was ongoing for one reason. We have interesting ideas on
which we are consulting as an Opposition who hope to form a Government
if we are fortunate enough to win the election; one would expect
nothing less. However, it is to the credit of the Minister and to Home
Office Ministers that although they may have temporarily junked the
detailed crime representative proposals that I outlined at great length
at the start of my remarks, they have not junked them fully. I
understand&#151;perhaps the Minister will touch on this when he
responds&#151;that they have merely parked them in a review that is
being conducted by the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside
(Mr. Blunkett), with a view to publishing a new form of
police accountability arrangements.</div>
<a name="09020355000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister will tell us whether his right hon. Friend is consulting on
whether the CRP proposal should be put into the Labour party manifesto
at the next general election. Should Labour form a Government of any
kind during the next Parliament, they will seek to enact that manifesto
promise. It would be extremely useful, particularly as we are debating
clause stand part, to get a clearer understanding of whether the
Government and the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside are
consulting on the CRP proposals in the Green Paper, which, alas, we do
not see in the Bill&#151;more&#146;s the pity. We could have had a
much fuller debate about direct democracy, which the Minister or the
Home Secretary do not wish us to have at this
stage.</div><a name="09020355000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000339"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind Committee members that we are debating
the question that clause 1 stand part, but that with it are allied two
new clauses in the name of the hon. Member for Chesterfield and his
colleague.</div>
<a name="09020355000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000340"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The Minister, in closing his comments during the
previous debate, said that he was sure that I would add my support to
the admiration expressed for the police. That is certainly true. About
two days before Christmas, I was on late-night patrol with a police
community support officer in Chesterfield. A few weeks before that, it
was the special constables, and in previous years, it was regular
officers on the beat, traffic police, response cars and so
forth.</div>
<a name="09020355000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
great admiration for the work that the police do in difficult
circumstances. I suppose that it began back in the early &#146;70s,
when I was still a schoolboy and my older brother was a police
constable in Sheffield. To this day, he still has a &#147;Life on
Mars&#148; attitude, and he cannot see why that popular TV series was
so controversial in the attitudes that it depicted. None the less, a
brave police constable on the beat is one of the first things that
inspired me to appreciate the work of the
police.</div><a name="09020355000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1, as we have heard, is a bit of a damp squib. It talks about
increasing police accountability, but it does so by using the phrase
&#147;having regard to&#148;. We really do not know what that
means. The chair of the Association of Police Authorities, while giving
evidence last week, said in response to that question, &#147;Well, it
won&#146;t really make that much difference.&#148; Obviously, the
Minister disagrees, but in terms of creating more police accountability
and responsiveness, it is a damp
squib.</div><a name="09020355000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been pointed out, it is not what the Government originally
intended. Front-Bench Members of all three parties represented here
want a more directly elected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>and accountable system of police authorities, although they differ about
what format that might take. We know that the police authorities and
ACPO, for example, do not want any change in the existing system, and
we know that the police on the one hand and Liberty on the other fear
that any change might lead to politicisation. I have found that point a
little hard to understand completely, given that police authorities are
already political&#151;the majority of people on existing police
authorities are elected politicians, albeit elected to one authority
and seconded to the police authority. They are still elected as
politicians.</div><a name="09020355000265"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.
15
pm</div><a name="09020355000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000341"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> That is an obvious point, although well worth
making. Would the hon. Gentleman agree that it is also the case that
the precept-setting power is very much in the hands of the elected
councillors and that they have the whip hand? The majority of those
indirectly elected councillors have to approve the precept. The engine
room of police authorities, which one could argue is precept-setting,
is essentially the province of the indirectly elected councillors, not
the independent or other members.</div>
<a name="09020355000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000342"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I agree absolutely. In fact, the hon. Gentleman
has stolen my next sentence. Not understanding the fear of politicising
police authorities, which are mostly elected politicians anyway, I was
going to make the point that politics certainly does enter into the key
issue of setting the precept. Last year in Derbyshire, the police
authority took a decision very much based on a direct political
instruction from the majority party group on Derbyshire county council.
That group instructed its councillors on the police authority not to
agree to a higher precept, which everyone else on the police authority
wanted in all departments to offset the fact that Derbyshire is
&#163;5 million underfunded every year, by the Government&#146;s
own admission, under their formula&#151;something we might return to
tomorrow in the Chamber. Therefore, politics is already
there&#151;elected politicians sometimes take clearly political
decisions on something as important as setting the precept.</div>
<a name="09020355000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative party has made it clear that it sees the solution as a
directly elected commissioner. Less kind people refer to that as a
directly elected sheriff or robocop to express their fears about having
one individual&#151;a sort of hero-worship&#151;at the apex of
power who can take decisions without necessarily having to consult too
widely. That is one of the failings in the operation of elected mayors
in some parts of the country. That is one way of approaching the issue
of introducing more accountability, power and independence for police
authorities, so that they can operate more in response to their
communities and less in response to the Government of the day
instructing them from
London.</div><a name="09020355000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government wanted directly elected authorities, as has already been
alluded to, and were very firm about that right up to the last minute.
On Second Reading the Secretary of State
said:</div><a name="09020355000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
remain convinced of the merits of direct election as part of a
responsive and fully accountable police
service&#148;.</div><a name="09020355000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
she went on to say that</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div><a name="09020355000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I believe that
it is right to do more work in this area before pressing
ahead&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 19 January 2009; Vol.
486, c. 521.]</div>
<a name="09020355000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">with a proposal on how
to achieve
that.</div><a name="09020355000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a spirit of helpfulness, for which Liberal Democrats are well known, I
will put forward some alternative routes, which I hope will inform the
internal deliberations of the Secretary of State and the Minister
before they come up with a new proposal for directly elected police
authorities.</div>
<a name="09020355000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The essence
of what we suggest is in new clauses 2 and 4. New clause 2 is about the
direct election of police authorities. New clause 4 is about giving
that directly elected police authority complete control over setting
its precept, without being subject to the directives of central
Government and, therefore, without the rate-capping and precept-capping
powers, for example, that we have lived with for 20-odd years or more.
It also talks about giving the police authority more power and
independence to set its own objectives in response to its own local
needs, community and electorate. As was pointed out by the hon. Member
for Bury St. Edmunds, those objectives would differ in different parts
of the country. We hear about postcode lotteries but to some extent
that has to be accepted. If local bodies are elected, whether they be
health bodies, local councils or police bodies, to represent local
views, there will be some differences in where communities in different
parts of the country prefer to put the
emphasis.</div><a name="09020355000176"></a>

about local policing. However, I do not understand how the model that
he is proposing will allow regional and national priorities to be
addressed as well as local ones if the only electorate that provides
accountability is the one he has described. I would be grateful if he
explained that to me and the Committee. We will discuss that challenge
further under later clauses. If the only emphasis is that described by
the hon. Gentleman, there is a danger that the police may not deal with

that?</div><a name="09020355000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know from conversations with the chief constable of Derbyshire about
the concern over issues such as serious and organised crime. Derbyshire
is seen as a lovely shire county, but the Peak District national park
is within one hour&#146;s drive of 20 per cent. of the UK&#146;s
population, based in cities such as Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield and
Manchester. If it is within one hour&#146;s drive of 20 per cent. of
the population, it is within one hour&#146;s drive of organised
crime, such as drug pushers and organised gangs of car
thieves.</div><a name="09020355000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was in the control room in Chesterfield at 2 am at the exact time when
CCTV cameras caught somebody breaking into a car. When the police
arrested them, it turned out that they were from a Sheffield gang that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>regularly drove the 20 minutes down the bypass to carry out their
operations in what they regarded as the softer police authority of a
shire county. They turned out to be wrong because they were caught and
arrested. Perhaps they also went there because they were less well
known in that area. With the magic of the motor car they could get away
from their home patch to another
area.</div><a name="09020355000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
problems exist, so what chief constable or police authority would not
want to collaborate with other authorities? Derbyshire and the east
midlands forces are starting to collaborate extremely well in a number
of areas. What chief constable or police authority would not work with
central Government on national issues such as terrorism? Again,
Derbyshire is a wonderful shire county and people may think that there
is no problem there. However, a number of terrorist alerts from the
security authorities come to Derbyshire, centring around Derby and
south Derbyshire. Of course forces will work together and with national
Government because it is sheer common
sense.</div><a name="09020355000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not as if this system would be brand new if introduced in Britain.
It exists in most other countries. Rather like the argument on
proportional representation that we will come to later, this is not
some wild, crazy idea that we have for England. It is the norm in most
of the democratic world. I have been in small towns and states in the
USA, Sweden and Norway and I have seen how their systems operate. The
system we are proposing is not the centralised top-down system that
this country tends to
have.</div><a name="09020355000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000345"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that new clause 4(4),
which he quoted, says &#147;to consult&#148; and &#147;to take
account of&#148;. He will accept that that is considerably weaker
than the current power, which allows the Secretary of State to make
strategic direction when she considers it to be in the regional or
national interest. I accept that he can paint a picture in which
everybody will consult, but his proposal would be much weaker in
achieving what he has described. Not all regions are as good as his and
mine in the east midlands. Why does he want to weaken this power, which
would be a good reserve power to have should the picture he has painted
not
happen?</div><a name="09020355000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000346"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> There is a fundamental difference of approach.
Britain is the most centralised democracy in western Europe, especially
with regard to how it raises taxes. Some 90 per cent. comes into London
and is handed out to the regions by the various Departments with the
appropriate strings attached. That happens regardless of whether it is
health, local government, policing or social services.</div>
<a name="09020355000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are a
highly centralised nation and, as such, untypical of democratic
countries. As Liberal Democrats, we believe that we should reverse
that. I know that localism has been in vogue as a buzz term for the
past two or three years, but devolution and decentralisation is
something that the Liberal Democrats have believed in for many decades.
By that I mean giving up some of the power and some of the grip from
the centre. There could be problems if, for example, police authorities
or health authorities go off in directions that the Government at the
centre are not sure about. None the less, in most democratic countries
that is they way it is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="09020355000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The US was
founded on that very principle. If one goes into the US, many
Scandinavian countries, France, or Germany, there is not the same
degree of central direction on anything that is to do with domestic
policy, including the police. There are other ways around it. If these
more powerful, directly elected, locally accountable police authorities
were failing to co-operate&#151;although I do not know why any
serious chief constable would do that in a world in which we are all
aware of international terrorism, drugs gangs and serious and organised
crime&#151;would alternative solutions be considered? The US has the
FBI and certain national levels of policing as opposed to local levels.
That is one way of doing it. We have done a little bit of that in this
country. We have set up specialist squads to deal with matters such as
the proceeds of crime. Such squads try to overcome the purely localised
aspects of policing.</div>
<a name="09020355000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving to a
serious belief that locally elected communities can govern their own
affairs is a change of direction. They do not need a nursemaid or a
nanny, or to be controlled from the centre. We would apply that belief
to every area, including local government, education, police, health
and to all such domestic policy issues. Most countries&#151;certainly
most western-style democracies that I have visited&#151;take that as
read; that is the way it is. The idea that someone sitting in the
capital city&#151;whichever one it is&#151;tells them what to do
with their local police, schools or hospitals is anathema in most
democratic countries. Therefore, it requires some shift in
thinking.</div>
<a name="09020355000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In proposing
that greater independence and power, we are not accepting the status
quo; the way that the police authorities work at the moment. There has
been disquiet from councillors&#146; groups and the Local Government
Association, which have said that they do not want to change the
system. We could see the point of not rocking the boat if we were
talking about just the existing system. The Liberal Democrats propose a
substantially altered devolved, decentralised system.</div>
<a name="09020355000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">If police
authorities are being given the power to levy their own precept without
rate-capping from the centre, their power is being significantly
enhanced. We are not talking about the status quo. If we give the
police authority&#151;as we propose in new clause 3, which we will
discuss elsewhere&#151;the power to appoint chief constables without
having to go cap in hand to get the approval of the Minister or the
Secretary of State in London, that is a significant step forward in
power for a police authority. It is not the status
quo.</div><a name="09020355000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000347"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Just so I am clear about capping, does the hon.
Gentleman say that any new capping regime should be subject to a local
referendum along the California model? It would be useful to understand
the Liberal position. Is he talking about lifting the cap completely,
which would mean that exorbitant increases&#151;there being no
cap&#151;would be subject to disapproval at an election rather than
at a local referendum in between
elections?</div><a name="09020355000266"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09020355000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000348"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> We are lovers of the single transferable vote.
There are dozens of varieties of proportional representation. We picked
just about the worst one for the European elections. The single
transferable vote is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>one of the more common ones that is used around the world. New Zealand
adopted it when it moved to proportional representation. One reason for
doing so is that if local authorities&#151;in this case police
authorities, but this would apply equally to local authorities in
general or to health authorities&#151;are given that power to raise
funds without capping from the centre, there could be a danger, as has
been pointed out, of local taxes soaring away.</div>
<a name="09020355000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, under first past the post, there is no effective democratic
control, as was seen widely in the &#146;70s and early &#146;80s,
before capping was introduced. Under first past the post, there are
massive distortions in the way that people vote, and it is hard for any
party other than the one or two that are already dominant to break
through. That can be done, but it is difficult; in Chesterfield, we
have totally reversed the political structure in the past 20
years.</div><a name="09020355000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">First
past the post is an electoral system that has many inbuilt barriers to
reflecting properly the democratic views of a local population.
Proportional representation of various kinds&#151;one of the best
being the single transferable vote&#151;is a democratic
accountability mechanism that would make it much more difficult for a
council, police authority, health authority or other body to introduce
massive tax increases and not be accountable at the ballot box. That
accountability is one reason why we are so keen on proportional
representation, particularly STV. If over years of experience that were
found to not be working well enough, there would be the other routes.
One or two councils have already experimented with referendums such as
those proposed, and some countries have them automatically built into
their political systems. There are other ways of working, but having a
properly accountable reflective electoral process, such as STV, would
put that brake on what people
do.</div><a name="09020355000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Greater Stockholm, an area with 2 million people, the authorities are
in charge of everything. They run the health service, the police, the
fire brigade and the schools, with no interference from the Government,
even though they are based in Stockholm. That is true of all nine areas
into which Sweden is divided. There is absolute local control over
local domestic political issues, and the fundraising to go with it.
When I visited Stockholm, we talked about Alzheimer&#146;s drugs not
being available, because the funding was not available. They said,
&#147;Yes, we had that problem, too, and in Stockholm at election
time, we had a referendum and asked people if they wanted to pay some
extra taxes and have the drugs. They said yes.&#148; Somebody from a
more rural part of Sweden said, &#147;We did that and they said
no.&#148; That was a postcode lottery; through a democratic system
people in one bit of Sweden chose to do it one way, and people in
another bit chose to do it
another.</div><a name="09020355000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000349"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks. I understand that Liberal Democrat policy is to abolish the
police precept cap, but is it also the party&#146;s policy that,
whenever a high precept is levied, any excessive increases should be
ratified in a one-off local referendum, before the elections under STV?
Are referendums part of Liberal Democrat
policy?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="09020355000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000350"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are straying a little from the clause.
I have allowed certain discretion, so that various areas can be
explored. Perhaps the hon. Member for Chesterfield might briefly answer
the question from the Opposition and then make
progress.</div><a name="09020355000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000351"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. As the clause makes
clear, there is provision not for referendums, but for directly elected
police authorities through STV. Referendums and other mechanisms would
be either for future constitutional changes or for local authorities to
introduce, as some have already done
experimentally.</div><a name="09020355000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will give again the example of Derbyshire police authority. We want
absolutely to give police authorities the power to raise precepts under
the clause. Derbyshire has been underfunded&#151;it was one of the
F40 group that campaigned until 1997&#151;so the Government changed
the formula and said, &#147;Yes, you&#146;ve been underfunded, but
you can&#146;t have your money for about another 10 years.&#148; So
we remain &#163;5 million a year underfunded, and over the past three
or four years, the police authority has therefore put up the precept a
number of times by more than inflation, more than the county council
rates and more than the borough council rates. In my experience, voters
in my area have not objected to that, because they could see a clear
link between paying a higher precept to the police authority in
Derbyshire and getting more police on the beat there. They could see
that link as opposed to saying, &#147;Let&#146;s pay a bit more
income tax to the Government in London and we might get more
police.&#148; No one believes that, whether or not it is true, but
people are willing to act in relation to a local
precept.</div><a name="09020355000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to a police statement in the Chamber, the then Minister with
responsibility for the police spoke in glowing terms about one
authority. I am not sure whether it was Surrey or Sussex&#151;it was
somewhere near London&#151;but the police precept was already
providing about 50 per cent. of local police funding, with
only 50 per cent. coming from the centre. The Minister said that that
was perhaps the way in which we needed to go. I can understand the case
for local people saying, &#147;This is our police authority. We
elected it directly. It takes decisions for us. We can see the link,
and if we think that we need more police on the beat, we would be
willing to pay more money.&#148;</div>
<a name="09020355000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000352"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for telling
us about his experience of Derbyshire. However, in my experience of
Worcestershire and Bromsgrove, I have never received a letter from a
constituent saying, &#147;Yippee, they have put up the police precept
and I am really happy to pay an extra 10 per cent.&#148; About five
years ago, we had massive increases. I received shed loads of letters
saying how dreadful that was. It was interesting to hear what the hon.
Gentleman said about Derbyshire, but I am not sure that it applies to
the rest of the
country.</div><a name="09020355000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000353"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> What mail is received could be a matter of
political party perspective, but the difference could also be due to
variations between urban, rural and affluent areas. The right hon.
Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin), who is also a
member of the Conservative party, made the point that some of his
constituents are not keen on the precept increasing, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>because they never see a police car in their villages. However, in the
last few years, people in Chesterfield have seen the difference as a
result of PCSOs and police, in particular, being back on the beat in
areas from which they had disappeared for years. They can see the
connection. I have been a Member of Parliament for eight years and I
was a councillor before that, and I have heard nothing but good
comments from people in Chesterfield about that change. If people were
aware that direct elections were held for police authorities and that
they set their own precept and could levy more money&#151;or not,
depending on whom we elect&#151;they would better understand the
link, whereas most people do not really understand how the police are
financed at the
moment.</div><a name="09020355000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thrust of new clauses 2 and 4&#151;new clause 3 is part of the
package, but will be debated at a different time&#151;is to give much
more power, independence and accountability through the ballot box to
local police authorities and to the chief constables that they would
appoint to run their local police force. That means considerable
changes in financing and in the amount of micro-management that we
receive from the
centre.</div><a name="09020355000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the councillor call for action under clause 1, which has been
discussed already, I do not see how it will make much difference. Let
us suppose that the local borough, district, county or city councillor
gets the call from people in their ward that they want more police to
deal with vandalism, shoplifting, groups of kids drinking in the park,
businesses that are being robbed and speeding traffic&#151;all the
usual stuff. The councillor would then go to his committee and explain
the issues, as would all the other councillors in the area, and the
committee might say that it will have to pass them on to the police
authority. The police authority might say that the Government will not
let it have enough money to employ more police to do anything about
such matters. The danger is that things will then go round in a big
circle. The people who said at the start that they were using the
wonderful new power under the Police and Justice Act 2006 to get action
would have to say a year later that absolutely nothing had happened. A
directly elected policy authority, with its own precept-setting power,
would mean accountability with power, whereas the Bill will provide
accountability without the power to do anything about
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000354"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman made an unusually cynical point
for him. Clause 1 deals with police authorities in a broad sense. The
councillor-call-for-action process is trying to respond to local
authorities, local councillors and local CDRPs, by saying that the
councillor should have a role in bringing to the attention of local
authorities things such as graffiti, damaged fencing, street lighting
and so on. I should have thought that a councillor would be able to do
that, and whether they respond well when a member of the public raised
such matters would be up to them. To use the logic used by the hon.
Gentleman in the rest of his arguments, how well the councillor deals
with such matters would be one of the things that people would use to
judge whether they should re-elect him or
her.</div><a name="09020355000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000355"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I agree with the Minister to a point. But, again,
I cannot see how any decent councillor does not do that now. I
certainly would not expect any of my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>councillors in my town not to do that when their constituents and ward
voters brought them such an issue. The obstacle is that, having run
around and brought it to the attention of this or that committee, the
answer that comes out is that there is not enough money or police to do
anything about it. We want to give police authorities some real
accountability: they should be directly elected, respond to the
community, raise the funds and put on extra policing if that is what
the community wants, but the community must also realise that it has to
pay for it. It is not something that just appears, like manna from
heaven.</div><a name="09020355000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final issue that I want to tackle is politicisation. The problem with
one alternative&#151;the directly elected single figure, the
commissioner, the sheriff, the Robocop, however we wish to term
it&#151;is partly that I have never quite understood the desire for
the single heroic figure who is right at the centre of everything. As
we have seen with mayors in some parts of the country&#151;I am
thinking about the north rather than London at the moment&#151;they
can just ride roughshod over what the majority of the councillors in
their area want and go off on their own personal tack. There is a big
danger in that, and we have seen part of it here in London.</div>
<a name="09020355000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Mayor of
London played a very active public role in getting the police
commissioner to resign and to be replaced by another. Is that quite the
role that we want an elected politician to play individually? We see
the Mayor of London going to the press after an MP is arrested and
their office is searched&#151;whatever the rights and wrongs of
that&#151;and almost immediately saying, &#147;Well, I&#146;ve
looked into this and I don&#146;t think that anything will come of
it.&#148; Is that what we want elected police commissioners of some
kind to be doing all over the country?</div>
<a name="09020355000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look at
the example in the US that that would be modelled on, we see that the
average commissioner lasts about two years in the job before they are
pushed out of office either as result of electoral fortune or political
circumstance. In this country, chief constables sign a five-year
contract and quite often serve at least two terms. Certainly, the
previous chief constable of Derbyshire, who retired last year, did. Do
we want commissioners who are politicised on the American
model&#151;directly elected individuals, subject to all sorts of
highly political pressures, who demand action because they are up for
re-election and get shoved in and out of office very
quickly?</div><a name="09020355000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020355000356"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): The lobbies that I got from
the west midlands were about the single person&#151;the commissioner
and that focus. I do not know sufficient about Chesterfield or Bury St.
Edmonds to know about the local political set-up there; but in the west
midlands, we have a significant problem with the British National
party. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was talking about
democracy, but I feel that the BNP is an affront to it. BNP candidates
have been elected as local councillors on low turnouts. It is quite
possible that, on a similarly low turnout, that could happen in this
case. That would be horrific for any part of the west
midlands&#151;Stoke, Dudley, Sandwell&#151;where we have
significant problems. That is what really got to the police authority,
as I understood from lobbying by councillors. To have the BNP in charge
of policing across the west midlands would be absolutely
horrific.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000357"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I agree with those comments, and I will return to
the question of the BNP in a couple of minutes, as I finish this last
section.</div><a name="09020355000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to consider new clause 2 with regard to how one would directly
elect a police authority and why that would be better than direct
election under first past the post&#151;which is what the Government
initially proposed but have now withdrawn, perhaps
temporarily&#151;or directly electing a single person as a
commissioner. We propose the direct election of the police authority by
single transferable
vote.</div><a name="09020355000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we were to start from scratch, we would not start with the local
government system that we have in this country, which has developed
over 200, 300 or 400 years and is a bit of a mish-mash. Problems arise
whenever people try to reform it. If we could simply say,
&#147;We&#146;re going to give all these powers to the police
authority and give it independence from London. We&#146;ll let the
local councils do it, because they exist and are elected
already,&#148; that would be fine. Eight police
authorities&#151;only eight out of 43&#151;are coterminous with
elected councils. What do we do about the other 35, when we cannot just
say, &#147;We&#146;ll let the locally elected council also be the
elected police
authority.&#148;?</div>
<a name="09020355000267"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09020355000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fudge that we have at the moment, with far less powerful police
authorities, is that people are co-opted: they get elected to the
county or city council, or unitary authority, and then indirectly to
the police authority. They are still elected politicians, but there are
lots of barriers and buffers between them and the people who voted for
them. If we went to Chesterfield, for instance, and asked people who
their representative is on the police authority, many would not have
the slightest clue, and they would not really know the difference
between the police authority and the council.</div>
<a name="09020355000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the 35
police authorities and councils that are not coterminous, we would
elect two thirds directly by single transferable vote. The other third
would still be appointed from the councils that make up the composite
area that the authority covers. In that way, the councils would get
some input, and two thirds would be directly
elected.</div><a name="09020355000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would provide that independent people such as magistrates could still
be appointed. That is a great strength of the current system. Why not
make that a third of the authority, as it is now? Simply put, under the
single transferable vote, there would not be much need for it. Most
people to whom I have spoken, or who gave evidence, said that one
virtue of the one-third appointed system is that that third can
represent all the under-represented groups in society, meaning women,
ethnic minorities and so forth&#151;people who are not white,
middle-aged councillors or MPs, if we were talking about this place.
They are the ones who tend to get picked for co-option to redress the
elected
imbalance.</div><a name="09020355000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
great virtue of the single transferable vote&#151;they found this in
New Zealand almost immediately after its introduction, and in
Scotland&#151;is that it creates a much better balance of elected
candidates. Under the first-past-the-post run-off, when the winner
takes all, people tend to go for the safe figure&#151;it might be
someone who has always been a politician, meaning, by and large, a
white, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>middle-aged male. Under the single transferable vote, panels of people
are elected, so a greater mixture of people tends to get
elected.</div><a name="09020355000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
New Zealand, not long after the system was introduced, more women and
ethnic minorities&#151;Maoris and South Pacific islanders, for
example&#151;were elected. That did not happen because of all-women
or black and minority ethnic shortlists, or any of the mechanisms that
we consider using in this country, but because the electorate said,
&#147;I&#146;m electing four people for this council area. I can
spread the way I vote and pick different people.&#148; The proof is
how such systems operate in the real world. As I said, this is not a
wild, mad idea that we want to introduce in England even though it has
never been tried anywhere: it has been tried and tested all over the
democratic world, and it works. It produces better democracy and
accountability, and a more mixed slate of councillors, as it would of
MPs, if it were used in our election
process.</div><a name="09020355000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we heard, there is a danger that members of the BNP could be elected,
but they could be elected under whatever system&#151;some 50 or 60
BNP councillors out of about 12,000 in the country were elected under
first past the post. Under STV, people have to get a quota to be
elected. It is not like the Israeli system, by which if a party gets 1
per cent. of the vote, it gets 1 per cent. of the representatives. Only
a serious, organised group has a chance of getting people elected under
STV. As the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds pointed out, we should not
say that we cannot have democracy because people whom we do not like
might be elected. They could get elected in any democratic system. The
STV tends to work against that and produce much broader
slates.</div>
<a name="09020355000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things about having an elected police authority with, say, 17
councillors, rather than one police commissioner, is that there is a
broad and balanced group, and eight or nine of the group have to be
convinced to vote a certain way. A single police commissioner has much
more dictatorial power, certainly with the press, whatever
constitutional restraints are placed on him or her. If that person, who
might cover an area such as Stoke, which I know reasonably well because
I have friends there, happened to be BNP, he or she would have a lot of
power, but that could happen under any electoral
system.</div><a name="09020355000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000358"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is
STV-positive. I am enjoying his analysis, which has a wealth of
information and evidence behind it. In his travels around the country,
has he found a police authority, or anyone in the APA or ACPO, who is
supportive of his proposals?</div>
<a name="09020355000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000359"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> From police authorities, ACPO, Liberty or the LGA,
no, but neither have I found anyone supportive of what the Government
or the Conservative party propose. We are generally agreed there should
be directly elected and accountable police authorities, but we differ
on the mechanism and the process. They want the status quo, but for
different reasons. Some want it because it works well, as a very close
friend of mine in Chesterfield who is on the police authority says.
Liberty and the police, seeing it from opposite directions, fear
directly elected authorities with more power because it might make
authorities politicised. I have not found the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>police or the LGA to agree with my view, but then they do not agree with
the view of either of the other two party spokesmen. Sometimes one has
to lead from the
front.</div><a name="09020355000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point about what the Government proposed but have now
withdrawn&#151;perhaps only temporarily, from what the Secretary of
State said&#151;is that if an authority was directly elected under
first past the post, as opposed to STV, which we now use in Scotland
for example, it would lead to those huge electoral distortions that we
always see. University research found that if we applied the 2007 local
election results to the directly elected police authorities proposed by
the Government, there would be massive electoral distortions. For
example, outside London, the Conservatives, with 38 per cent. of the
vote in 2007, would get 66 per cent. of the seats on those authorities.
The Lib Dems, with 26 per cent. of the vote, would get 14 per cent. It
does not take a great genius at electoral arithmetic to work out that
that leaves 20 per cent. for the Labour party, the Greens and others to
share between them. That would not be a very good democratic electoral
outcome, in terms of the votes cast for people. That, again, is why we
should go back to PR&#151;preferably STV, but there are other
varieties&#151;for this
system.</div><a name="09020355000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am under no illusions that the Government will accept the two new
clauses, but I hope that the debate helps the Secretary of State and
the Minister in their pursuit of a suitable method of directly electing
an accountable and independent police authority, which on 19 January
the Secretary of State said she was going to
consider.</div><a name="09020355000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000360"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>From the Chair, I perhaps interpret
democracy slightly differently. My interpretation of it is that the
whole of the Bill should be scrutinised by this Public Bill Committee.
We are making slightly slow progress today. I hope that hon. Members on
both sides of the Committee will take account of that, so that slightly
faster progress can be made and the whole Bill, all of which is
important, can be
debated.</div><a name="09020355000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020355000361"></a>Miss
Kirkbride:</b> I want to begin, as others have, by commending
my own police force, West Mercia&#151;an excellent force that
delivers a first-class service, while receiving among the least amount
of money. The force does an excellent job, is ably led by Paul West
and, I might add, has a good relationship with its police authority,
especially when it came to opposing Government plans for merging police
authorities, which would not have been satisfactory in my
area.</div><a name="09020355000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was interested in the exchange of views that took place. I start by
accepting the premise that there is a democratic deficit in how police
forces are accountable. I see it from my own experience as a
constituency MP, very much recognising the figures mentioned by my hon.
Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds on how many people know how to
complain about the police service, when that is necessary. People come
to me because it seems an obvious port of call, but they are not aware
of the structure. I was not at all surprised to hear those figures on
how many people understand how the system works. Very often, especially
when it is aggravating behaviour, the public feel genuinely aggrieved
that they have no real mechanism of forcing people to take action to
address their concerns. I fully accept that that is a serious
problem.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div><a name="09020355000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes wider
than the public&#146;s experience, however. In our household, we have
a particular view of one of the chief constables in Wales, who seems to
have an obsession with speeding rather than anything else that the
public might get aggrieved about. While I am sure that that is
extremely important, it would not be my priority when it came to police
resources. How does one curtail and contain a chief constable&#146;s
obsession and look at the public&#146;s wider concerns?</div>
<a name="09020355000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
sympathy with the argument that we have not got it quite right, but at
the risk of upsetting my hon. Friends, I also have sympathy with the
Government&#146;s desire to proceed with caution. The important thing
is to make the system better, and not just to reform it for the sake of
reforming it because it is not as good as it could be at the moment. We
have to consider how we proceed on that
basis.</div><a name="09020355000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elections
are clearly the most tempting way forward. All parties represented in
the room today are not just flirting with the idea, but looking at it
with great seriousness. One of the things that has been teased out by
the debate is just how many forms of democracy there are, and therefore
which, if any, it would be preferable to take forward. I shall look
with interest at my party&#146;s and the Government&#146;s
conclusions on how we should proceed. Compared with how we have
operated our police service over time, this will be a new way of going
about things.</div>
<a name="09020355000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
America. I applaud the way that America is very democratic and requires
a democratic input to its public services, but it is an alien structure
to us. Americans are used to knowing that it is a police commissioner
who is responsible for the kids at the end of their road and what the
responsibilities are of the attorneys and everyone else they elect.
They are completely signed up to that system. It is how they operate
their democracy, and I believe it works. I was interested to hear that
the commissioner gets changed every two years if he or she has not done
the job properly or to the satisfaction of the voting public. It is,
nevertheless, part of the way they operate. It has not been part of the
way that we have operated, up until now. Therefore, while I do not wish
to get into bed, so to speak, with Liberty or police constables, I
understand where they are coming from.</div>
<a name="09020355000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sympathise
with the view of my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for
Stourbridge, that there would be a terrible risk of the BNP being
elected for the West Midlands force. That cannot be a good thing. Quite
a few hon. Members have said that we must not be afraid of democracy,
that it is great and that whatever the outcome, it is acceptable, but,
at the risk of upsetting you, Sir Nicholas, some countries around the
world&#151;Israel, perhaps&#151;might want to change their form of
democracy. If Israel did things slightly differently, it might be
better off in relation to the answers that it seeks in the middle east
peace process.</div>
<a name="09020355000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Democracy has
a variety of forms. The way in which a democracy is organised has a big
impact on the outcome of an election. We should not proceed merely on
the basis of the mantra of democracy, as if that were the only way
forward, which cannot be gainsaid because it has to be a wholly good
idea.</div>
<a name="09020355000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
think carefully about how we make the police responsible to an elected
representative. Today&#146;s ideas on how we could do that, and
whether it should be one person, were interesting. Although the idea of
having one person is attractive, the problem in my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>police area is that there is not a complete community of interest. It is
a collection of counties. Bromsgrove is a very long way from most parts
of Shropshire. How does that one person become relevant to all the
people whom he is supposed to represent? Will people feel comfortable
with that person representing them? How tempting would it be for
someone to seize on a dreadful murder, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>such as the one that happened in my patch, and exaggerate its impact to
acquire the votes that he needs to be re-elected? That is a huge
risk.</div><a name="09020355000268"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
