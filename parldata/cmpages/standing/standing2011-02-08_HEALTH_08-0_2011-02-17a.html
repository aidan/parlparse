have tabled the amendments is not semantics, but real concern that
there needs to be clear and strong duties for the Secretary of State

consortia to improve
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000012">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point relates to what the Minister said about education, training
and strategic health authorities. I am well aware that the Government
are consulting on the proposed changes to education and training. My
concern is that SHAs will be abolished under clause 28 before we know
what is to happen in education and training. As that is so important to
quality, I urge the Minister to be clear about the
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000013">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is regional co-ordination on education,
training and workplace planning. The deaneries are closely involved at
that level. That point was raised with us by the junior doctors

                           </strong> The hon. Lady rightly raises an important subject.
We all want to ensure that the highest standards of education and
training are maintained and that, where need be, standards are
improved. As she rightly says, consultation is ongoing. I assure her
that the matter will be resolved before the SHAs are abolished, because
we do not want any hiatus whatsoever.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000016">&#160;</a>

section 1A(3) of the National Health Service Act 2006, inserted by

services and the quality of patient experience. Effectiveness, safety
and patient experience are crucial elements of a high-quality service,

                        <p>He
referred to standardised mortality ratios. Surely whether some is dead
or alive is clear, but in fact, the point emphasised by Nigel Edwards
was that it is difficult to get from those standardised mortality
ratios a clear understanding of whether, for example, the issue is the
case mix of a particular hospital. If a hospital deals with very
difficult cases, its standard mortality ratio will be much higher. Dr
Jennifer Dixon said

                        <p>We need
to look at inputs and processes as well as outcomes. That is rightly
acknowledged in the Government’s outcomes framework, which says
that there is no pure outcomes-alone approach that we can measure all
quality on. I am not going to repeat the arguments about why it is
important to define quality, but I believe that the provision would
benefit from greater specificity and
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members
of the Committee will be aware that a huge amount of work has been done
in this country and internationally on the different elements that make
up a high-quality service. The most groundbreaking work was done 10
years ago by the Institute of Medicine in the United States. Its
report, “Crossing the Quality Chasm”, began the efforts
to improve quality internationally and in this country. The Nuffield
Trust report, “The Quest for Quality”, built on that
report, and has been influential in shaping thinking, including that
reflected in Ara Darzi’s report. Both reports identify six key
areas that go to make up quality health
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
the reports specify safety, which the clause already includes, saying
that care should avoid injuries to patients from the care that is
intended to help them. The second element is effectiveness—in
health care that usually centres around the need for services to be
based on scientific knowledge, so that all who could benefit from them
do, and to refrain from providing care from which patients are not
likely to
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third element of quality is to do with care being patient-centred. I am
sure that some people will again think that that is semantics. Patient
experience is vital to measuring the quality of care, but a
patient’s experience is not the only thing that makes care
patient-centred. It is also about whether services are tailored to meet
individual needs, whether they include the views and concerns of family
members, and so on. Patient-centredness is a much better way of
expressing those
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
fourth element is that services should be timely. I am not going to
open up a huge debate about waiting time targets and whether they are
politically motivated; suffice it to say that the timeliness of
services is vital to their quality. There have been big debates about
the outcomes of cancer care and whether this country does 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 282<a class="bkMark" name="Column282">&#160;</a>
                           </div>worse than others. In fact, it is on the very first set of diagnoses
that we often fall behind. Timeliness is vital not only in clinical
care, but because patients want it—at the top of their list of
concerns and priorities is the wish for care to be
timely.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
fifth element of quality care—I am surprised that it has not
been specified by a Government who are rightly concerned with
spending—is the concern that services should be efficient and
avoid waste, not only waste through bureaucracy but the waste of
equipment, supplies, ideas and
energy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
sixth element of quality is that care should be equitable. It should
not vary in quality because of a personal characteristic such as
gender, ethnicity, geographic location and socio-economic status. I am
sure that we discuss equality and the duty to promote it at greater
length under the next clause. Although the new section 1A(3)
that clause 2 would insert into the 2006 Act attempts to set out the
key features of quality, I firmly believe that it does not go far or
deep
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
health care system that made improvements in those six key areas would
be far better at meeting patients’ needs. If quality is really
at the heart of the Government’s plans for the NHS, clause 2
should spell that out in greater detail. The clause says only that
safety, effectiveness and patient experience are key to quality. I
think that we should go much further, and amendment 40 would achieve
that broader and clearer
definition.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000061">&#160;</a>

Lady’s argument. She made several good points and the additional
four aspects of services—that they should be patient-centred,
timely, efficient and equitable—are all extremely valid. I would
add two or three others; they arise from my experience at Stafford, but
I think that all right hon. and hon. Members will be aware of them. I
have in mind the importance of care, respect and
dignity—particularly respect and
dignity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000062">&#160;</a>

this week have revealed many cases from around the country of
insufficient respect and dignity for elderly patients. Although I have
a lot of sympathy with the points made by the hon. Lady, and
acknowledge that the wording of the Bill could perhaps be improved if I
could think of the correct word—I cannot—the phrase
“quality of experience” includes those softer aspects
such as respect and dignity that are not included in the harder, more
measurable outcomes that she has set out in the amendment. I believe
that Bill’s wording encompasses more of what we want to see in
quality of care, even though I understand her reasons for proposing the
outcomes listed in her amendment, which I think are important and need
to be taken on board by anyone involved in the health service. I am
sure that Ministers are doing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000063">&#160;</a>

of quality. In a way, this debate is linked to the one we had on the
previous group of amendments and it picks up on the concern expressed
by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East, who before lunch
accused the Government of not defining quality or outcomes in the Bill.
It is quite clear that early in the Bill—on page 2, in
fact—we have done so.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What is
interesting, and the reason why I welcome the conversion of the hon.
Member for Leicester West and her party, is that Lord Darzi was
desperate for the previous Government to define quality and outcomes in
primary legislation, but that was resisted by the Labour Government. In
one way, we are all taking  a giant step forward because
we—certainly on the Government side of the
Committee—recognise the need to put down a comprehensive
definition, so that no one can doubt our commitment to improving and
enhancing quality and to ensuring that we, with everyone else in the
health service, work in that ongoing
endeavour.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
duty to seek improvements in quality sits at the very centre of the
Bill and the definition of quality used is the one that was agreed and
embraced by both clinicians and the public during the next stage review
of the NHS. I accept that Opposition Members are seeking to improve the
Bill, but I fear that the amendment would do little to bring clarity to
the meaning of quality. In fact, it would make extremely unhelpful
distinctions. I know that that they are not doing that deliberately,
but there is always the law of unintended consequences. If the service
is timely, it has to be delivered safely, effectively and in a way that
improves the patient experience—it cannot be otherwise. Our
definition of quality does not distort clinical priorities but supports
our work on the outcomes framework. That is why our definition is the
accepted one. It works, and it has the bonus of being recognised by
both clinicians and the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
three domains of quality—patient safety, patient experience and
effectiveness—were identified following a review that was led by
2,000 front-line clinicians and other local health and social care
staff, involving thousands more staff, patients and members of the
public. Opposition Members will no doubt remember that. Given that the
review was published in 2008, I suspect that the hon. Lady not only
remembers it, but may well have been involved in the work leading to
the publication of the review, as she had the distinction of being a
special adviser to Patricia Hewitt in the Department of Health until
the change of regime in June 2007. As she probably knows, the review
concluded:<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“If
quality is to be at the heart of everything we do, it must be
understood from the perspective of patients. Patients pay regard both
to clinical outcomes and their experience of the service. They
understand that not all treatments are perfect, but they do not accept
that the organisation of their care should put them at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000468">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">For
these reasons, the review has found that for the NHS, quality should
include the following
aspects.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000469">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
went on to name them as safety, experience and
effectiveness—precisely what we have put in the Bill. Because
the wording is all-embracing in many ways, it should go a long way to
reassuring my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford, who made some
extremely valid points about the patient experience and how patients
feel about their treatment by the NHS. Extending and rewording the
definition of quality would only add confusion to a principle that is
understood, accepted and owned within the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
those reasons, I believe the changes proposed in the amendment are
wholly unnecessary. The issues raised are of course important, but the
Bill already places a duty on the Secretary of State to reduce
inequalities, as 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 284<a class="bkMark" name="Column284">&#160;</a>
                           </div>well as duties on the NHS commissioning board and commissioning
consortia to reduce inequalities, to promote patient involvement and
choice, and to exercise their functions
effectively, efficiently and economically. The duty to seek to improve
quality would need to be considered alongside those other duties,
although I find it inconceivable that there could be quality alongside
inequality, inefficiency or a service that did not take into
consideration the needs of its users. The Royal College of Physicians
picked up on that point in its response to the consultation on the NHS
outcomes framework, acknowledging that health care that is not safe
could not be described as efficient, effective, or
sustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
definition of quality is comprehensive and clinically owned. The
amendment adds nothing. I ask my hon. Friends to vote against the
amendment if the hon. Lady is not prepared to withdraw it. While she
reflects, let me say that we are united with the previous Labour
Government on the definition of quality and outcomes that we have
chosen to put in the

raised the issue of respect and dignity. I am sure we could go around
the houses about the meaning of patient-centred care and the patient
experience and so on. I simply want to put on record that I absolutely
support him in wanting to achieve that

                        <p class="tabbed">My
third and final point is to put on record for Government Members that
quality is difficult to define, and outcomes are difficult to define.
We had a brief debate about politically driven targets. I believe that
the previous Government’s targets were always about improving
quality and outcomes for patients, but there are different ways to get
those outcomes. Sometimes we have to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 285<a class="bkMark" name="Column285">&#160;</a>

treatment, because the ultimate outcomes are often difficult to
measure. I therefore respectfully urge hon. Members not to think that
defining quality or outcomes is simple; it is a difficult process. The
definition has to be as broad as possible if we want to improve patient
care. On that point, I would like to press the amendment to a

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 40, in
clause 2, page 2, line 39, at
end insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>‘(5) In
discharging the duty under subsection (1), the Secretary of State must
ensure the people in a local area are consulted before significant
changes to their health
services.’.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment provides that when Secretary of State is discharging his or
her duty to act with a view to continuously improve quality, he or she
must consult local people before any significant changes are made to
their health services. The Committee has been given clear evidence, and
it has been the experience of the NHS over the past 10 years, that
achieving a step change in quality, particularly of hospital services
and care, will require significant changes to the way services are
provided. We know that, for many aspects of specialist care, the
chances of patients surviving and doing so with fewer disabilities are
greater in specialist centres—I refer to services such as stroke
and trauma care and children’s heart surgery, with which I am
closely involved. Changes to services at regional level will also be
extremely important if the NHS is to meet the efficiency challenge set
by David Nicholson, chief executive of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
couple of witnesses last week mentioned stroke care in London, which
was also raised on Second Reading by the hon. Member for Ealing Central
and Acton (Angie Bray). I shall go into that in a little detail to
explain what we are seeking to achieve through the amendment. As some
hon. Members will know, NHS London, which is the strategic health
authority for the capital, went through a controversial reorganisation
of stroke care in which eight hyper-acute stroke units were
established. That was very controversial at the time, but in just five
months those specialist centres have more than tripled the number of
patients receiving clot-busting drugs to the highest rate of any large
city in the world.

			Column number: 286<a class="bkMark" name="Column286">&#160;</a>
                           </div>It is estimated that that will save 400 lives a year, as well as

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, that reorganisation was controversial, but the strategic health
authority worked hard to involve patients and the public, as well as
clinicians, to achieve those service improvements. I do not want to go
beyond the scope of the amendment, but when we get to the provision
abolishing strategic health authorities later in the Bill, people will
rightly ask how those big regional-level service changes will occur if
there is no longer any kind of regional tier in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
witnesses have said to the Committee, commissioning consortia could
take on such a role if they work together across larger areas. However,
witnesses, including Stephen Thornton, said that the Health Foundation
has done a lot of research into the issue, with initiatives that have
involved GPs in commissioning. That research shows that GPs tend to be
better at making changes in out-of-hospital care—community
health services and so on—rather than at the hospital
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also need
to remember that commissioning consortia will not hold contracts with
providers until April 2013. Strategic decisions that can improve the
quality of care should be being made now, but they are being delayed
because people are uncertain of what the reorganisation will
mean.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn back to the amendment. If we are going to have a duty to improve
quality continually—whether that relates to the Secretary of
State, the national commissioning board or GP consortia—that
will inevitably mean changes to services. Sometimes there will be very
significant changes to services, such as the one I described in stroke
care in London. Those big changes must involve patients and the public,
as well as clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have,
perhaps wrongly, anticipated the point that will be made against the
amendment. I know that further on in the Bill we will discuss the duty
to involve the public and patients in more detail, but I hope that the
Committee will see why including a duty for public consultation should
also be identified early on, up front and at the top of the Bill, where
this very important duty to improve quality is
contained.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000115">&#160;</a>

issue of quality and the amendment that we are discussing, the Minister
was right to say that the next stage review was the next stage on from
where the previous Government had the national health service, to bring
in a better measurement of quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000118">&#160;</a>

that was taking place in the north-west. That pilot scheme was based on
a United States health provider called Premier—a not-for-profit
provider—and considered in great detail how we

                           </div>could measure better quality in our system, as opposed to the quantity
that we have been good at measuring for many years. I want to ask the
Secretary of State—sorry, the Minister of State, although he may
have some ambition—whether he can help me in relation to the
clause and, in particular, subsection (4), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>“In
discharging the duty under subsection (1), the Secretary of State must
have regard to the quality standards prepared by
NICE.<p>This
will be crucially important if we are to advance a best practice in the
NHS. Indeed, in the evidence we took last week, both the chief
executive of the NHS and the Secretary of State spoke about improving

                        <p>I
assume by that that the commissioner—whether it is a GP
consortia or a national commissioner endorsed by the national
board—will have to endorse the quality standard. That is my
reading of it. I ask the Minister how that relates to clause 4, on duty
as to promoting autonomy, which says that
persons<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000122">&#160;</a>

that<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000127">&#160;</a>

that—certainly in the case of Enfield—there was not

This came about because the acute hospital chose not to apply to be
considered and GPs were not consulted. That is the situation we are

                           </span> I am aware that there are
time pressures so I will try to be disciplined and confine my remarks
to the wording in amendment 40. I speak in support of this
amendment, which essentially seeks to give some additional
responsibilities to the Secretary of State in respect of
responsibilities on consultation. As the Bill stands, the duties of the
Secretary of State, if not entirely conferred or devolved onto
subordinate bodies, could be weakened. Clause 2, subsection
(1) says that the Secretary of State must
act<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“with
a view to securing continuous improvement in the quality of services
provided to

                        </p>
                        <p>and
indeed<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>“In
discharging the duty under subsection (1) the Secretary of State must
… act with a view to securing continuous improvement in the
outcomes that are achieved from the provision of the
services.”<p>This
includes his public health functions, those functions the Secretary of
State exercises in relation to the NHS and its commissioning board, and
the GP commissioning consortia. The amendment would add a significant
but fairly simple function that Members could support irrespective of
party, especially given the remarks made by the hon. Member for Enfield
North and his fellow Government Members on the need for full public
consultation about various issues that affect the delivery of local
health
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we know from our discussions on clause 1, the current duty on the
Secretary of State to provide or secure the provision of services for
the health service has in effect been removed. Opposition Members are,
therefore, genuinely concerned that there might be a democratic
deficit, whereby Members of Parliament of all parties are unable to
hold the Secretary of State to account on issues related to the health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would strengthen democracy in the NHS, although not by far
enough. It would ensure that the Secretary of State consults local
communities where significant changes to health services are to take
place. The function of the Secretary of State is to
act<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000134">&#160;</a>

individuals”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000473">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>So
significant changes may well occur that affect services within or
across
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
clause 2 addresses the Secretary of State's duty to improve the quality
of services it seems appropriate that, as part of the
Government’s slogan or mantra, “No decision about me,
without me”, there should be local involvement in service
changes. I understand that we will be moving on to the issue of service
providers failing, perhaps due to market conditions, later in our
consideration of the Bill. Therefore, I do not intend to address it
now, but it might exercise local communities that are considering these
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
there are service changes, perhaps as a consequence of the Secretary of
State, or a local authority acting on his behalf, seeking to secure
improvements in outcomes, why should there not be a safeguard in place
to ensure further accountability? My fear is that some

elected officials such as Members of Parliament and, by default, our
constituents. So I would urge Members on both sides of the Committee to
support the

will probably be told by the Minister in a few minutes that the
amendment is redundant, which is a common ploy when amendments are
moved in Committee. One could argue that the legislation actually
provides what the hon. Lady is seeking, it just does not ask the
Secretary of State to ensure that it is there. One could also argue
that there is something rather odd about asking the Secretary of State
to see that the law is enforced, because one assumes that is what the
Secretary of State would like to do. The hon. Lady, however, seems to
have a point, so I will address what I think is the real nub of the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is work in progress. If the hon. Lady wishes to move it on
Report, it is probably advisable not to press it to a Division now. She
is suggesting that there should be a level of consultation on regional
services. It is not obvious that the amendment applies exclusively to
regionally important services, but one can see why people would want to
be consulted on regional
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady mentioned children’s services. She might be aware that
some time ago it was proposed that Alder Hey, which is a significant
children’s service in the north-west, would move out of
Liverpool. People have a right to be consulted about such things, but
it is not clear what rights people currently have if such proposals are
made, or what rights they will have under the Bill. Obviously, such
matters would not necessarily be dealt with by health and well-being
boards.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a question about what voice people have when services that might not
be distinctly local—they might be bigger than that—but
are important to all local people are subject to a reconfiguration
proposal of one kind or another. The Alder Hey case is one that leaps
to
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment does not focus sufficiently precisely on that. It uses words
such as “local area” and “significant
changes”, which obviously are debatable. What is a local area,
and what is a significant change? In dealing with the legislation, we
have to bear in mind when we talk about local areas that the concept of
area is up for debate as well. At one time, under the primary care
trust arrangement, it was possible to talk about a health area and a
local authority area, but now the commissioning units will not be
area-based, and that problem will go right through this legislation as
we try to read through the
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000142">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Leicester West has a perfectly valid point. I dare say
the Minister will put us at ease in respect of some of the issues that
she raised, but we need an explanation from him, in terms of the
legislation, of exactly what will happen when services of enormous
regional popularity and significance get modified in some way. For
example, what will happen if Alder Hey decides in the future to move
out of Liverpool and go to Widnes, as it has said it may? What voice
will the public have, and how will it be
expressed?<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000143">&#160;</a>

                           </span> My point follows on from the one
made by the hon. Member for Southport. In essence, it is a simple point
about strategic planning. The amendment seeks to offer an additional
safeguard in respect of strategic planning, which is an aspect of the
NHS that we feel will be undermined as a result of the
changes being made elsewhere in the Bill, notably the abolition of SHAs
and
PCTs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
concern we have is that services may be reconfigured, either as a
result of changes in demand by GP commissioning consortia determining
that they want to change the nature of the services, or the nature of
the provision that they can access locally—Sir David Nicholson
seemed to suggest in his evidence that that might happen—or
supply-side changes, whereby NHS trusts determine that they want to
change the nature of the service that they offer, perhaps through
merger or reconfiguration in other
respects.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
concern is that the only way in which those potential changes might be
held up is if they are deemed by Monitor, the economic regulator, to be
in breach of competition law. However, there may be other reasons not
related to competition law such as clinical reasons or political, with
a small “p”, long-standing views on the part of the local
population which lead them to believe that it is important that
services be locally held, or that the current configuration ought to be
maintained.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is simply about trying to put in an additional safeguard,
and, in keeping with the spirit of localism that the current Government
are so keen on in this Bill and elsewhere, it simply seeks to ensure
that the Secretary of State observes that and makes sure that local
people have a say if the services that they deem to be important to
their local population are in jeopardy. For that reason, I support the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000147">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West spoke about reconfiguration occurring.
That was recognised by those who gave evidence last week, and strategic
decisions are currently being made. She spoke about heart services. I,
too, am a Leicestershire MP and am also concerned about the future of
children’s heart services at Glenfield hospital. Speaking as
someone who was very involved in the campaign for the Loughborough
walk-in centre, which is an essential part of the health service in
Loughborough, my concern with the amendment is that it states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“the Secretary of
State must ensure the people…are
consulted”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000474">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
trouble is, as the hon. Member for Easington said, that there is a
semantic difference between consultation and involvement. I am sure
that we will speak about that a lot when we deal with patient and
public involvement, but consultation is not
involvement—involvement goes
wider.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern about consultation in this context is that it is very easy for
the Secretary of State to say that people must be consulted, but as we
have heard today—all power to the Government’s elbow in
relation to the dreaded word “forests”—we have
heard people, we have listened and we have changed what we are
consulting on. We are to be congratulated for listening to what people
have said. That is something new and refreshing in politics in this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Member for Pontypridd talked about localism. I do not think
that the Secretary of State has a place in localism; the whole point
about localism is that services are delivered and decisions are taken
closer to people. That is why the patient and public involvement parts
of the Bill will deal with the concerns of the hon. Member for
Leicester West. We will discuss those further when we get to the
relevant
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000153">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough has
covered most of what I wanted to say. I just stress the importance of
going into some detail about public involvement and consultation later
in our deliberations. There are some questions about what precisely
public involvement and consultation means. Looking ahead, I see that
public involvement can refer to being provided with information, and
that alone. That, I believe, will not be sufficient. I rest my remarks
there. I will not support the amendment, but the discussion will be
important later, along the lines that my hon. Friend has pointed
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000154">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment, as has become abundantly clear
during the debate, would require the Secretary of State to ensure that
local people were consulted before significant changes were made to
their health services. We fully support the involvement of local people
in shaping their local health and social care services; that is why we
have put forward proposals to enhance significantly the role of
councils and local authorities in relation to health services and to
increase their local democratic legitimacy in health.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000155">&#160;</a>

more local involvement and for the voices of local people to be fully

                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
have done a number of things since last May and my hon. Friend the
Member for Loughborough touched on one of them. When the Secretary of
State was concerned that not enough consideration was being given to
the views of local people and local clinicians with regard to
reconfigurations, he strengthened the criteria substantially on any
reconfigurations that had to go through, ensuring that when a
consultation process is happening, those criteria are fully met before
a proposal advances
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
keep within your ruling, Mr Hood, I will stop there on that narrow
point so that I do not explain the full procedures of reconfigurations
in great detail. We will deal with those later. However, before coming
back to the hon. Member for Leicester West’s overarching points,
I will pick up one or two points raised by the right hon. Member for
Rother Valley. First, he reiterated his point from an earlier debate
about the north-west pilot scheme and what has been learned from it. I
can tell the right hon. Gentleman that the North West Strategic Health
Authority responded to the Department of Health’s consultation
on the outcomes framework, and the Department is working with them to
share best practice and learning as we continue work to develop the
outcomes framework. I hope that that helps to clarify the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman’s other point was about the identity of the
commissioner. In that context, the commissioner is either the Secretary
of State or the board, but it could be both. In that context
the commissioner is either the Secretary of State or the board, but it
could be both. NICE provides a quality standard when asked to do
so—on matters of public health or social care  if asked
by the Secretary of State, and on the NHS if asked by the NHS
board—but both can ask for a care pathway. The standard is set
when the Secretary of State or the board endorses it, which is right,
as they are accountable to the service and NICE is not. I hope that
that goes some way to helping the right hon. Member for Rother
Valley.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the more complicated and slightly distracting amendment to clause 4, I
hope that the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me; I shall respond to
him, but I would rather do so on clause 4, as I do not want to fall
foul of you, Mr Hood, and wrongly expand our debate when we are dealing
with a relatively narrow amendment to clause 2. I hope that the right
hon. Gentleman appreciates that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A specific
question was asked by the hon. Member for Leicester West, who wanted to
know how regional changes will happen without strategic health
authorities, and whether clusters of consortia can manage. I shall
explain the first point. NHS commissioning boards will consult on
specialist services. If the proposal covers  a number of local
authority areas, the commissioning

			Column number: 293<a class="bkMark" name="Column293">&#160;</a>
                           </div>board will consult all the relevant local authorities—as she
would expect. If appropriate, the local authorities can establish a
joint scrutiny function to consider the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000165">&#160;</a>

whether the mechanism is in place. It does not seem to be. I know that

saying that if a proposal goes out—it is not necessarily a

that diversion towards later parts of the Bill—we will be coming

of the 2006 Act. We are amending those duties to apply them to the new

right thing to do, because with reconfiguration of services at whatever
level—whether designated services in the case of the NHS
commissioning board, local service provision through providers or

proposal for duplicating section 242 of the 2006 Act is in addition to
our proposed changes to section 244 of the 2006 Act, which
will enable us to retain existing duties to consult with respect to
local authority scrutiny on proposals for significant service
reconfigurations of designated services and to extend, for the first
time, the regulation-making powers to enable scrutiny of all providers
of NHS services, including private and voluntary sector providers. I
hope that putting that on the record will help the hon. Member for
Halton, because he perked up when I mentioned the whole question of
designated services. I am talking about regional reconfigurations of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000178">&#160;</a>

together, the current duties and proposed modifications in clause 175
already ensure that there will continue to be legal duties to consult
local people on proposals for substantial service reconfiguration. To
accept the amendment would be to add to the duties unnecessarily, and I
urge the hon. Member for Leicester West to withdraw it. If she will
not, I urge my hon. Friends to join me in rejecting the amendment.

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Loughborough has rightly said
that some decisions about big changes to services are taking place,
such as to children’s heart surgery. Those are the
responsibility of the national specialist commissioning board, so it
has not been affected by the re-organisation. My point was that there
are some decisions, both at local and regional
level—particularly about the much-needed changes to trauma
services that I was involved with when I worked at the ambulance
service—being put on hold because they are tricky and they are
difficult. I am concerned about that with regard to patient
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The point
about regional-level decisions is important. Indeed, the chief
executive of the NHS, in his evidence—not to this Committee, but
to the Public Accounts Committee and the Health Committee—has
been pushed many times to say that they are looking at whether there 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 295<a class="bkMark" name="Column295">&#160;</a>
                           </div>should be some kind of regional outpost of the national commissioning
board. He, at least, recognises that there are going to be challenges
with GP commissioning groups coming together to make a really big
decision on issues such as the future of trauma services. So, we will
come back to the issue of a regional tier, to improve quality and
effectiveness, later on in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000181">&#160;</a>

to return to a point made by the Minister. I do not want to stray, but
it is important, because the Minister made it in his closing comments.
At the moment, if local authority health scrutiny committees do not
like a re-organisation, they refer it to the Secretary of State, and
the Secretary of State refers it to the independent reconfiguration
panel. I am not clear how what the Government propose is any different.
We will come back to that point, but the Secretary of State has said
that the proposals on patient and public involvement and local
democratic scrutiny will transform patient and public involvement. The
Minister has just said that the process will be exactly the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We will go into that in far greater detail, but
briefly, so that the hon. Lady understands, there will be differences
in reconfigurations at the local level that have been driven by
providers or consortia. There will be a far greater involvement of
local government, including the full council of the lead local
authority voting on the views put forward by their scrutiny committees,
in what shape or form it does. The structures and the procedures are
more or less the same, except for a greater increase in the involvement
of local authorities. The crucial thing that has changed already, which
my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough mentioned, is the change in
the criteria, on 20 May 2010, that strengthened the rights and powers
of members of the public and local clinicians in the consultation
process, and having a check system to ensure that those criteria are
adhered to during a consultation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000183">&#160;</a>

come back to me on that. Under those so-called strengthened criteria,
would he like to tell Members how many of the proposals have still gone

my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to the IRP. I cannot, off
the top of my head, think of any others at the moment. The process is

under those criteria and say whether any have been stopped as a result.
I am not yet convinced—we will come on to this point—that
any of the changes on public scrutiny and accountability will make a
difference if, in the end, the local authority still refers it to the
Secretary of State, who refers it to the IRP.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000186">&#160;</a>

is very important for this Committee when we are considering these
matters—and I know m’learned friend, the hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull East, will agree with me—that, if we are
talking about the law of the land, it should be in simple English that
English people will understand. We should not be using language which
is unnecessarily complex. That is the purpose of our subsequent

                        <p class="tabbed">Equality is a
principle of such importance that it brought many of us into politics.
Our national health service is a manifestation of that commitment to
equality. It is at the heart of the NHS. There is a belief that no
matter who someone is, or from what background they come, they must be
allowed access to the best care and treatment, and that treatment
should be free. That is seen as idealistic, but may I join the Nye
Bevan club again, and quote his remark that

                        <p class="tabbed">That is
absolutely right. Although it may be regarded as unfashionable to be
idealistic, all the people I know who work in the national health
service are idealistic. They want the national health service to work
in this way and for us all to have equal
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason I begin with this broad sweep is that we have a fundamental
concern that the legislation undermines equality and equality of access
in the national health service. That is why we are completely against
this measure. We are against the Bill in total and this clause in
particular. If this is the clause that relates to equality, it needs to
be a great deal stronger to hold back the difficulties that this Bill
will introduce by undermining equality of
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
King’s Fund has conducted an assessment of health care policies.
It judged that the basic funding structure of the NHS—this is in
an assessment of the NHS between 1997 and 2010—which has few
financial barriers to accessing services, is broadly equitable,
although the way in which services are arranged can create problems.
For instance, there are fewer GPs in areas of greater need. Despite the
public service agreement target, reducing inequalities in health
outcomes, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, is proving
hard. The targets based on closing the gap between poorer areas and
average areas were abolished by the incoming Government in May 2010. If
those targets had remained, they would almost certainly have been
missed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">No
one is saying that it is easy and no one is saying that it has been
achieved, but we must continue to work at it. We argue that this
measure is not helping in the absolutely vital work of the NHS of
trying to equalise health outcomes. The fundamental problem is the way

			Column number: 298<a class="bkMark" name="Column298">&#160;</a>
                           </div>in which the Bill allows the market to walk into the middle of the NHS,
thereby directly impacting on equality. The Government talk about
patients having more information and being able to sit down with their
GPs and making a choice about the most appropriate treatment. Perhaps
that is some sort of working of the market. Perhaps, in some
superficial way, patients feel that it is an improvement to be given
proper information, to discuss it with a GP and to get the best choice
and help that they can. For some groups, it may be effective. The
difficulty is that it does not work for everyone. In fact, it can
exacerbate the inequalities that exist at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000200">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me give another example. We all know that some foundation trusts are
not as strong as others, but will this legislation, which will see
people deciding to go to the stronger foundation trusts as opposed to
the weaker foundation trusts, simply exacerbate the differences? As a
foundation trust gets weaker, has fewer people going to it, generates
less income and perhaps even goes bankrupt, what about its patients?
What kind of equality of outcomes are they getting if they are going to
a weaker foundation trust that continues to get weaker? What happens
about GP
consortia?<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000201">&#160;</a>

carried away, may I assure him that I will never give up my principles?
My fundamental principle is an absolute commitment to equality. If
Monitor were to have its role taken away, in terms of the support that
it gives to financial trusts, and instead morphs into some kind of
monster within the NHS that is pushing a market on to the NHS, the
Minister would not be defending equality of access to patients in the
NHS, but instead, be doing the opposite. That is a great danger, and
that is why we need a stronger clause than the one before us. It is not
just me who is saying this. The Committee has heard from many
witnesses, and much of the evidence, which I know the Committee
listened to carefully, supports the arguments that I am
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000205">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have made the argument that a foundation trust may flounder. What
happens to the patients who use that foundation trust? They will get an
increasingly weak trust and increasingly bad health care. There is an
additional problem if the GP commissioning consortium

                           </div>that covers someone’s area is not strong. Under the influence of
the market, it would become increasingly weak. Who falls through the
cracks? The most weak, the most vulnerable and those who will find it
most difficult to move from one consortium to another. We will
exacerbate health inequalities by promoting this measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000206">&#160;</a>

to the picture of the patient sitting down with the GP who, with the
additional information, can make a decision, what happens when the
patient himself or herself is so sick as to be unable to simply sit
down and make that free choice? We had the great privilege of listening
to Jenny Bogle—the only patient who appeared before
us—who, despite being diagnosed with terminal cancer, gave
compelling evidence to the Committee:<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000207">&#160;</a>

tell you that when that happens out of the blue, you are physically
ill, you have massive things to take on board, and however clued up you

controlling—trying to sort out which is the best hospital for
you, or the best consultant, or the best treatment. You are not an

convenience or whatever are fine, but what can be overstated is the

that evidence. As the hon. Lady said, it was compelling. However, there
are carers who can accumulate a large amount of expertise, given the
amount of information that is available through patient groups, the
internet and so forth. They are in the position to help the patient
become more informed and able. Many patients want to take more of a
role in the decisions affecting their treatment, beyond the choice of
hospital and consultant and so forth. The hon. Lady rather
underestimates the potential of patients, the public and carers in this
respect.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000210">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point that the hon. Lady makes is a good
one. If, by attempting to make my point powerfully, I seem to
underestimate the power of some patients, I take that back, because I
do not mean to do so. People with a long-term condition in a relatively
stable state, such as those who live with multiple sclerosis for a
number of years, can develop expertise. I have met MS sufferers and
their carers who are experts in that condition in a way that some GPs
are not. I understand that, and people can develop an expertise in
other conditions, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000211">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
difficulty, as I am sure the hon. Lady is aware, is that there are
other groups. People might have a mental health condition with a
complex range of difficulties. They might not speak English as their
first language; they might not be in secure accommodation; they might
have alcohol problems; and they might have a chaotic lifestyle. The
idea that such people can sit down with their GP and make a decision
about the best outcomes of their care highlights my case. On the one
hand, there might be someone with those conditions, and on the other
there might be a university graduate who has MS, who might be supported
by a family and be able to sit down with a GP and make such decisions.
My point is that it is not fair—it is not
equal.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000212">&#160;</a>

that, because there is a misunderstanding, deliberate or otherwise,
about of our position. There are times when the public can make
decisions on a managed market basis. For example, if a patient had a
hernia condition, they might be able to sit down and talk to their GP.
It is a completely different matter, however, to bring in a measure
that relates to all care and drive it into the centre of the national
health service. To release the NHS, to allow the market to affect
everything, will mean that the protection that is needed for the most
vulnerable, which comes with a managed market, is no longer
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000214">&#160;</a>

Before the hon. Gentleman spoke, however, I was trying to address the
point that he has made. We need a market in some areas of the NHS, but

it attacks the principle of equality.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000216">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for letting me intervene
again. She confuses the concept of market and any willing provider, and
the concept of choice. It is about who is providing certain services on
the one hand, and patients choosing where to go and whom they want to
be treated by on the other. Although the two overlap, they are distinct
parts of the Bill and what it tries to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000217">&#160;</a>

glancing blow before I move on, that the Government parties seem to
confuse the idea of democracy with shopping. Someone going to a GP and

Bill’s weak provisions that relate to democracy do not help with
equality, pushing up services or standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000218">&#160;</a>

importance of equality are vital. However, I should like to press her
on one thing. In my experience and that of a lot of people, it is not
so much the structures that lead to local inequalities, but the people
involved and the professionalism, or otherwise, of—let us be
frank—the PCTs or GPs. At the risk of making a speech, I would
like the hon. Lady to comment on that and how her amendment would deal
with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000230">&#160;</a>

talk and write about structures, but it is people who deliver health
care. That pushes me back to the arguments that I was making earlier.
We know that when a hospital is successful, it attracts people. When a
cancer network works well, people want to work there. However, if the
differences between good and bad become exaggerated by the market
system introduced in the Bill, excellence will get stronger in some
areas and weaker in others. The best people will know that it is not
worth remaining in an area where a cancer network is getting
weaker.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000231">&#160;</a>

people are only people. They want to work with the best and deliver the
best services; they do not want to come home at night and worry that
their service is not as good as it should be and as they would like it
to be. That is why I respectfully submit that we need more regional
management of the health service than we will ever have if the Bill is
passed as it is, to ensure that we keep the service together rather
than allowing it to fragment and hoping for the
best.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000232">&#160;</a>

within the structures for which I have been arguing, there are times
when things do not work. At the moment, NICE can write best practice
and make recommendations, but there are times when GPs simply ignore
it. Paul Farmer said rather
elegantly:<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000235">&#160;</a>

will it be made equally, and who holds the reins? The Bill throws up
such difficulties, which go to the heart of the idea of equality of

Of course, in the end, limitless money for limitless services will not
be available. However, if the organisations or individuals
commissioning services cover a small area and have a relatively small
budget, the decisions that they must make at the end of the financial
year will be more exaggerated and could be more extreme.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For example, a
GP or GP commissioning consortium might suddenly find that two new
families have moved into the area. I met a family yesterday that had
two boys with extreme disabilities. If that family moved into a GP
consortium’s area, that could make a huge difference to the
money spent by that consortium. They are a lovely family, and no one
would want to say that they are a burden, but they would make a great
difference to the budget of a particular GP consortium.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000241">&#160;</a>

four such families suddenly moved into an area, or if, for example, a
housing association changed its lettings policy and decided that it
would only allow in people who had disabilities, who would have
sufficient points to be able to be housed—this happens with many
housing associations in areas of acute housing need, such as
mine—we might find a concentration of people with disabilities
living in particular geographical areas. That could have a great effect
on a GP consortium’s budget. That is neither equal nor fair, and
it is not what the NHS ought to be
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000242">&#160;</a>

agreement that there is a minimum size. I do not remember which witness
suggested this, but someone said that about 100,000 patients appears to
be the right minimum size. The argument is not against GP consortia in
favour of PCTs; it seems to be about where the level for a minimum
reasonable patient number should sit to aggregate risk
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000243">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Anyone can see the point that I am about to
make. The risk for a larger area, such as a PCT area with assistance
from an SHA, is clearly not going to be the same as the risk for a
fragmented system of many small GP consortia. On the one hand, the
Government argue that there is a best size for GP consortia, and on the
other they argue that they are not going to dictate to GP consortia
what size they should be. The Government cannot have it both
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Bill is focused on measuring outcomes, and its success or failure
is outcomes-based, what priority will be given if someone has a
condition that does not have an easily measurable outcome? For example,
if I was suffering from schizophrenia and went to see my GP, they would
not, no matter how hard they tried, be able to cure me of it. There
would not be a box that said, “That is an
outcome.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
schizophrenia could be managed, but that is not the same as an outcome.
In those circumstances, if a GP is trying to commission things and
focus on outcomes, then people who have conditions that do not involve
dramatic changes or outcomes are in danger of being pushed down the
priority list.

the advocate who Government Members will find most compelling is the
BMA. It said, on a different point, that if in making decisions the
easier conditions and patients are focused on rather than the more
difficult patients with complex needs, there is a danger that
cherry-picking treatment for the less complex conditions will
destabilise other provision, so the treatment of more costly, complex
and time-consuming conditions becomes unsustainable or significantly
reduced. How bad does it need to be? The arguments and evidence that
hon. Members have heard on this is alarming.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000252">&#160;</a>

move on to the specific points in the amendment. Given the dangers
inherent in the legislation, equality provision must be much stronger
than it is. Frankly, we have come a long way on equality legislation.
After the Equality Act 2010, passed by the previous Government, it is
surprising that the clause deals with equality in such a “wave
of the hand” fashion. I am sure that that was unintentional, but
it is important when dealing with equality that the benefits are spelt
out better than they are in the Bill. Inequality is such an important
subject that we can do better than
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000253">&#160;</a>

reason why we particularly wish to spell out in the Bill the different
groups whose inequalities we ought to focus on is the treatment of the
elderly, which I am sure is at the forefront of hon. Members’
minds given the terrible publicity that it has received in the past few
days. The Bill should talk about the importance of treating the elderly
in a fair and equitable way.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000254">&#160;</a>

move on and focus on how elderly people are not treated fairly or

                        <p class="tabbed">We
all heard the evidence coming out from the health ombudsman. For the
Health and Social Care Bill to achieve more positive health outcomes,
it must be explicit that improvements are to be achieved across a whole
population. We know that older people’s needs are often
under-prioritised and under-recognised in the NHS. We also know that
ageism in clinical practice persists, with older people often lagging
behind other groups in terms of better health outcomes. A clear
obligation is needed in the Bill to demonstrate that improvement is
being achieved across a whole population. That is what the amendment is
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000258">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, despite improvements in cancer outcomes, a 2007 study of
breast cancer patients in Manchester found that older women are less
likely than younger women to receive standard management for breast
cancer and are less likely than younger women to have surgery for
operable breast cancer, even after accounting for differences in
general health and
co-morbidity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000259">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
health ombudsman’s recent report showed terrible failures in the
care of older people. Of the 9,000 complaints to the ombudsman about
the NHS last year, 18% were made about the care of older people. The
ombudsman accepted twice as many cases for investigation about older
people as for other age groups put
together.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000260">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
aim of amending the Bill in the way proposed is to ensure that the
Secretary of State’s duties are clear and specific, that he has
a proper focus on the elderly and that people across England can be
sure that their access to health care, and the quality of the health
care that they receive, will be assured regardless of who is providing
the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000261">&#160;</a>

areas where the Secretary of State can demonstrate improvement to
reduce inequalities should be balanced and fair in their focus.
Otherwise, the risk is that commissioners across the NHS will be
incentivised to invest their efforts in improving health outcomes for
those groups for whom they believe they can make the easiest and
quickest gains. I have made that point before. It is easier to deal
with a bright, alert, fairly compos mentis patient with one specific
condition than it is to deal with some of the more complex needs that,
frankly, most of us will develop as we get
older.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000262">&#160;</a>

curate’s egg—good in parts. I do not think that any
Labour Members have ever claimed that we left the national health
service in a perfect state. It is not perfect, but it is so much better
than it was when we inherited it. We were doing the right things. There
is much more work that needs doing, and we would certainly wish the
Government to build on our many achievements.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000264">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some of the
Government’s initiatives—for example, the mental health
strategy and the cancer strategy—we have been pleased about on
the whole, because they have been building on our achievements. The
difficulty is that it is all very well having strategies of that sort,
but they are only strategies for the short term, because in two
years’ time, if the Bill is passed, we will all be heading over
a cliff together. There will not be the levers any more for those sorts
of strategy to be able to continue. That is the concern, and it is very
serious.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000265">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">No
Labour Member has ever said—or they should not have—that
the elderly were treated as well as they should have been in the
national health service. Of course not. Of course much more work needs
doing, and frankly there is a great deal of cross-party agreement on
what should be done. The question is really how we do it. We believe
that the Conservative party is fundamentally misunderstanding how it
can be done and how we can drive up standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Leaving the
national health service to the market is not the way to improve
standards for everyone. It may be for some, but not for everyone, which
is why I am making a speech on equality. Our NHS is based on the
principle of equality, which is fundamentally at odds with the
principle of introducing the market and allowing a free market that is
not managed in relation to services across the
piece.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000267">&#160;</a>

finish my speech. Before I do, may I return once more to the statement

the Bill that are not a laughing matter.

should say that the main reason why I oppose the amendment is that the
clause as currently drafted is a succinct summing-up of the fact that
the Secretary of State should have a duty, as far as possible, to
deliver equality. We do not need to spell out all the various groups

between many different groups whose needs had not previously been met.
One challenge of promoting equality is to understand the very different
needs of different groups. Will the hon. Lady agree that

to add a few more by considering access to treatment since NICE was
introduced. Older people had to wait years before NICE agreed that the
treatment of dementia in the early stages could be benefited by the
Aricept class of drugs. For many years, older people suffered that
discrimination. When a new treatment was licensed for macular
degeneration, older people were not able to access it to many years.
Those in certain parts of the country went blind waiting for the
treatment. I shall not give further examples, but believe me there are

improve services. <em>[</em>

Minister is pulling a funny face, but I refer him to the evidence given
by Chris Ham in our second sitting. It is a contentious point, but in
his view it was good to have some instability in the system. The fact
that instability will arise out of this competition-based system is a
factor we must take into account. It may have a deleterious effect on

Gerada’s main concerns about widening health inequalities was
that the GP consortia will have duties only in relation to their
practice population, not the whole population in the area? It is true
that local health and well-being boards will have responsibility for
the whole population area, but the consortia will focus on their
practices. That could lead people such as homeless people, or those
with drug and alcohol problems, out of the system. That is what Dr

reason why the amendment is essential. The Bill changes the
fundamentals of our co-ordinated health system and risks making
inequality, in terms of access to health services and outcomes,
ingrained in the NHS. The only way to counteract that is to place a
binding duty on the Secretary of State to reduce health
inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000300">&#160;</a>

                           </div>issues such as socio-economic variation—the hon. Member for
Stourbridge mentioned that point. The amendment specifies those areas
that should be addressed, and that is key. In 1977 the chief scientific
adviser to the Department of Health, Sir Douglas Black, produced a
report on the extent of health inequalities in the UK and how best to
address them. The report proved conclusively that death rates for many
diseases were higher among those in lower social classes. It
acknowledged that the NHS could do much more to tackle the situation,
and it called for increases in child benefits, improvements in
maternity allowances, more pre-school education, an expansion in child
care and better housing.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000301">&#160;</a>

that not to digress but because there is the stark danger of a reversal
of the progress that we have made in addressing health inequalities.
That may be exacerbated by decisions that are taken elsewhere in
government. It is important to take the opportunity to try to mitigate
or ameliorate that situation. This is an important issue that I have
long campaigned on, and I believe it is vital that we put a duty on the
Secretary of State to be proactive in the campaign to reduce health
inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000302">&#160;</a>

a number of my hon. Friends and perhaps of others too, by long-term
unemployment due to serious ill health, which is often associated with
former industrial occupations. It is against that background that we
have identified this most pressing need to act against inequalities
created by socio-economic variations. It is no coincidence that health
inequalities follow every other poverty and deprivation indicator. If a
stronger duty is not placed on the Secretary of State to tackle
inequalities, and there is no accountability function to Parliament, I
am concerned that there will not be the full and proper requirement for
the Government to examine and scrutinise progress. Requiring the
Secretary of State to report annually to Parliament would be a powerful
safeguard, and would ensure that the issue of health inequalities
remained at the forefront of Government policy. I ask the Minister and

this week has shown that inequalities are not getting any better. There
has been some research by Margaret Whitehead, professor of public
health, on the north-south health divide that might be of interest to
the hon. Member for Easington. She has established that health
inequalities between the north and the south are worse than at any time
in the past 70 years. That has happened under a number of Governments,
all of whom have tried to address the issue. The 1997 Labour Government
had a cross-departmental group working on health inequalities but,
contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said, Labour has not had a great
deal of success. It has raised the overall standard of the
nation’s health, but inequalities are just as severe as they
ever were. It is not just that “it’s grim up
north”; the causes are deep-rooted socio-economic ones as well
as purely medical and clinical, which is why the inequalities have
persisted despite huge improvements in medical facilities and GP
practices. It is genuinely not an access issue; the most deprived part
of the borough in which I live has the best access to health
facilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000307">&#160;</a>

research by Dr Julian Tudor Hart, which has shown that people in the
poorest areas have the poorest access to health care. The previous
Government did a great deal to improve access with, for example, their
programme to tackle under-doctored areas, under which GPs—into
whose hands £80 billion will be going—who tended not to
go into poor, deprived areas were brought into them. Does the hon.
Gentleman seriously suggest that there is no evidence that people in
the poorest areas also have the poorest access to
care?<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000308">&#160;</a>

services than does my constituency of Southport, but outcomes are
better in Southport. There is no direct correlation between good access
and getting rid of inequities, but there is a perfectly valid point

poor areas where a number of practices were not up to the job, produced
real

is one of the poorest and most deprived areas, and has many social
problems, but an integrated approach across primary care has made an
incredible difference to health inequalities and has overcome the
barriers. There are examples of ways forward that were developed under
the last Government. The present Government would do well to take heed

was a deprived area and that people needed better access, better
facilities and better resources. Similarly, Conservative Members said
that on a per capita basis they were doing a lot worse, pointing to the
fact that their areas had elderly populations that were big consumers
of health services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000311">&#160;</a>

of State made the perfectly valid point—it is reflected in the

inequalities. Opposition Members are not arguing that it is simply
about improving access to services. For the record, I can tell the hon.
Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich that although the funding
formula covers poverty and deprivation, it also includes specific
criteria on age and rurality. It would be wrong to suggest that it does
not include age. It is about striking a balance between these factors.
Indeed, the Labour Government instituted a review of the funding
formula for precisely those reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000313">&#160;</a>

formula ad nauseam. The Secretary of State made the perfectly valid
point that unless we ring-fence public health funding, it can be lost
among other funds and therefore not given the priority that it
deserves, but it is essential when dealing with health
inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000314">&#160;</a>

Margaret Whitehead’s research. Having done more research than
any of us, she discovered that GPs were central to the task of
improving public health and dealing with inequalities. She also
discovered that causes are not wholly clinical but can be social and
economic. The hon. Member for Easington made that point well. Following
on from that is the fact that if the job is going to be done properly,
GPs cannot simply absent themselves from the public health agenda. They
have to be involved in co-operating with a range of other bodies. For
existing GPs, that will be a sharp learning curve, and I am not
entirely certain how welcome it will be.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000315">&#160;</a>

Whitehead also established the fact that increased choice in NHS
services does not proportionally benefit those who suffer the worst
health and who have the worst health outcomes. They tend to be less
adequate when making choices on health provision. Another of her
conclusions reinforces the point made by the hon. Member for Leicester
West. In their new commissioning role, GPs will be hampered by the loss
of the ability to plan for a whole population in a defined geographical
area. That will be as a result of switching from primary care trusts,
which are based on area, to registered patients, who may live all over
the shop—not too far away, but not concentrated in a specific
area. In order to address health inequalities well, the commissioning
process needs to have a population perspective. That largely reinforces
the point made by the hon. Member for Leicester West. In conclusion, it
is an intractable problem and if we

some of the remarks that have been made by the hon. Gentleman and by my

that has been made about previous policies of the former Labour
Government. There is a difference between the wholesale marketisation
of the NHS, which this Bill is trying to achieve, and the impact that
it will have on inequitable access to care, compared with the addition
of capacity and value. It was not an ideological decision to involve
the private sector in health care provision for the NHS under the
former Administration. However, there is a real difference. In my
experience, both as a public health specialist and as a former NHS
chair, the implication is that health becomes a
commodity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000319">&#160;</a>

The Black report is where health inequalities were first described in
terms of the inverse care law. That report showed very clearly the
relationship between health inequalities and deprivation. Then there
was another report, “The Health Divide”, which a former

trying to do is to ensure that the Bill does not make the situation any
worse. We want to achieve some traction, but as the Bill is couched
that will not happen. That is not the mark of a civilised
society—it really is not. We need to ensure that what we include
in the Bill seeks to address these inequalities. We have discussed
older people, but we know that children born to poor families are twice
as likely to die as children born to rich families. Forget lifestyle;
they are babies, and they are twice as likely to die as children born
to rich families. No law of nature decrees such things. They are
systematic inequalities that are socially produced, largely by ill
conceived public policy, including health care policy, and they are
unfair. In his recent review, Professor Michael Marmot noted that
people with a university degree are likely to live longer and in better
health, estimating that if everyone over 30 had a degree, there would
be 200,000 fewer deaths every year. That is an important point, and we
should grab hold  of it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000332">&#160;</a>

NHS. It is an intractable problem, and it has been for a long time. The
same high quality of treatment is not always available everywhere in
the country. That is a fact of life.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000334">&#160;</a>

implied from a sedentary position a moment ago that the Labour party
ought to say sorry for the fact that we still have health inequalities
in this country. Members from all parties regret the fact that health
inequalities still exist, but that is not for want of trying on our
part. We tripled spending on the NHS from £30 billion to more
than £110 billion; we radically increased the number of doctors
and nurses; and we built hospitals the length and breadth of the
country, as the Government whom he now supports did not when they were
last in office.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000335">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
also agree with the hon. Member for Southport that it is positive that
the Government have included the duty in the Bill. It is novel for a
Government to place on the Secretary of State a duty to tackle
inequalities, and it is a useful addition. However—here I agree
entirely with my Front Benchers—that duty, summed up by three
and a half short lines in this 300-clause Bill, is utterly insufficient
to offset the impact of the other principal measures in the Bill, all
of which militate against reducing inequalities, and it will increase
them. I will highlight three, the first of which is the abolition of
primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. Imperfect those
bodies may be; however, they constitute a level of strategic national
and regional planning designed in part to offset some of the
inequalities in the system and level out the NHS to ensure more
equitable distribution of health care and resources. That will be made
more difficult by their abolition.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000338">&#160;</a>

is vital to ensuring that we try to even out the imbalance that will

                           </strong> The third point I want to make about the mitigating
impact is the idea at the heart of the Bill about liberating clinicians
and other actors in the health care system and giving them greater
autonomy to take advantage of the creative destruction—as one of
our evidence givers described it—of the market in health care,
thus allowing them to see whether that gives them more or less
innovation. What the Bill will give them is more or less divergences in
health care. Ministers accept that and have repeatedly said—the
Secretary of State has said this in another arena—that there
will be postcode prescription and postcode lottery of provision. That
is presented as a good thing because we are told that it will be more
reflective of the fact that local services are being determined by more
locally held budgets and more local understanding of the needs of
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If I believed
that that was necessarily what will derive from the Bill, I would
support it. However, it requires a leap of faith that GPs will
necessarily understand all the

			Column number: 318<a class="bkMark" name="Column318">&#160;</a>
                           </div>needs of their local communities better. We heard earlier remarks about
the potential for a lack of understanding, which we already have in
bits of the NHS, of the needs of particular parts of our
community—for example, black and ethnic minorities. Why should
we believe that GP consortia will be any more perfect than current
vehicles at responding to all of the needs of their community? In fact,
evidence shows that they will be less understanding of that. GPs are
not trained in needs-based analysis or in health economic analysis and
they are certainly not trained in public policy, as are many of the
managers who tried to do that sort of equitable distribution in
balancing out the needs across the
community.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Considering
how the GP pathfinder consortia are shaping up right now—varying
from 16,000 patients in one part of the country to 600,000 patients in
another—I think we all realise that there is a huge amount of
work to be done to determine what the optimal size of GP consortia is,
so that they will have the requisite understanding and scale and
capacity to respond financially and intellectually to local needs. That
work has not yet been done, however, so we Opposition Members are very
concerned about greater inequalities being a direct consequence of the
Bill. That is why the amendment matters. It reflects the fact that the
Government are basically taking a leap of faith, and buying into the
notion that the market will deliver better outcomes. We do not believe
that that is the case, which is why the amendment would place a greater
duty on the Secretary of State to safeguard against those inequalities.
For that reason, I will certainly support the amendment and I urge
Members of all parties to do that
same.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000344">&#160;</a>

the Acts of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and even those
under the previous Government between 1997 and 2010—to include
an equality duty for the health service. This is the first time that
such a duty has been put in primary legislation, and that should be put
in context because it certainly was not done by the Labour party, which
had opportunities to do so in 2009, 2006, 2002 and 2003. Given that
some Labour Members used their speeches to portray themselves as the
only ones with a monopoly on caring and a concern for inequality, it is
slightly staggering that it is a Conservative-Liberal Democrat
coalition Government who are actually doing something, and instead of
just talking the talk, walking the

                           </strong> Given the Minister’s commitment to
addressing inequalities in health and access to services, does he
support the idea set out in the amendment of an annual report to
Parliament? Surely that would improve accountability, and I do not
understand how that runs counter to the tenor of his
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000361">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was going to deal with that when I spoke about to
the specific amendment, but I will deal with that now. I was slightly
taken aback by the intervention in one respect because we had a lengthy
debate on Tuesday about holding the Secretary of State to account. He
has to produce an annual report that will be laid before Parliament.
That report will obviously cover the question of health inequalities,
so we already have that among the responsibilities that the Secretary
of State must fulfil when he is being held to account for the NHS. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman is heartened that what he wants is going
to happen, even if there will not be a stand-alone annual report. Quite
frankly, I do not think we need an annual report on every individual
aspect of the health service. It will be far better, far more
comprehensive and far easier to understand if we have one document
rather than a whole load of separate
documents.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000362">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to deal with some specific questions raised by members of the
Committee. The first one—this will please the hon.
Lady—is one of her questions: why do we not spell out every
source of inequality in the Bill, as she proposes? There is a practical
point. If we try to be comprehensive, there is always a risk that
certain groups will be left out, and I do not think that the hon. Lady
would want that to happen, particularly as those groups would then be
set out in an Act and if we wanted to add, remove, change or modify
them, we would need primary legislation to do so, which would not be a
sensible way to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000367">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the public sector equality duty deals with inequality based on the
protected characteristics listed in the Act. The duty in the Bill would
cover health inequalities that arise for any reason, whether we can 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 321<a class="bkMark" name="Column321">&#160;</a>
                           </div>think of them now or following the passing of the Bill. That should be
welcomed by the Opposition, because that such an
all-embracing approach can help in the future by
catching situations that may develop and need
addressing.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000368">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady’s next question was: will consortia budgets be blown,
as she put it, by lots of patients with complex needs? I hope that she
will listen carefully to my answer simply because she rightly expressed
a concern, but made a few statements about the situation that bore
little relation to what the Bill does. First, GPs cannot turn patients
away because they have a complex or particular medical condition. There
are professional regulations against that now, and that will not
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000369">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
allocations to consortia will need to include risk-based calculations
that factor in prevalence of disease and other demographic factors.
Thirdly, the Bill makes provision for consortia to establish a risk
pool, so that can help in year. Finally, the NHS commissioning board
can intervene if a consortium is at significant risk of failure. Its
powers range from being able to request information to the dissolution
or merger of consortia, or asking another accountable officer to take
over. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000370">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Leicester West said that consortia have duties only towards
patients who are registered with practices. That is not correct under
the terms of the Bill. GP consortia will be responsible for both their
registered and unregistered populations in a determined
area—that is in clause 9, if she would like to look it up. The
board has a duty to ensure that the whole of England is covered by
consortia, so no population will be left without being covered in one
way or another by GP consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Easington asked why the Secretary of State’s duty in
relation to inequalities is different from that of the board in
proposed new section 13F of the National Health Service Act 2006, as
detailed in clause 19. Amendment 5 would make the two duties similar.
The reason why the Secretary of State’s inequality duty is
drafted differently from those of the board and consortia is because of
the Secretary of State’s duties on public health. The duties on
the board and consortia—we will come to those in future
sittings, and I do not want to go too far down that road so that I do
not fall foul of the rules—are drafted in terms of accessing
health services and outcomes achieved by health services. The Secretary
of State has duties on to public health that would not necessarily be
caught by that wording, for example through information or education
campaigns. I hope that that satisfies the hon.
Gentleman.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000372">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
return to a question that a number of Opposition Members raised about
whether the proposals for reform will cause less equitable access to,
and outcomes from, care. I strenuously reject that notion because that
is not the outcome of anything that we are proposing in the Bill. In
fact, the exact opposite is true, because we are proposing a duty on
the Secretary of State, the national commissioning board and the GP
commissioning consortia to have regard to the need to reduce health
inequalities. We are enshrining those duties in law for the first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000373">&#160;</a>

I too was confused by that. That is why I was tempted at the time to
intervene on the hon. Lady to remind her of the manifesto commitment of
the Labour party at the previous general election—on which she
fought—about choice. I did not get a response to my question,
because her manifesto commitments seem to go completely against the
general drift of the point that she was making, which my hon. Friend
has picked up so perspicaciously.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000375">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I could go
through a whole list of different checks and balances in the Bill that
reinforce the duties and the need to deliver on reducing and minimising
inequalities. For the sake of brevity and interest, I will not, because
I know that hon. Members, who have expressed such an interest in the
subject, will be prepared to look it up in the Bill and to inform
themselves more to allay some of the misguided and incorrect fears that
we have heard from Opposition
Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000376">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would create an aspirational duty, against which the
Secretary of State could not be held to account, which seems, however
well intentioned the amendment, to be a perverse consequence of what
the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury is seeking to do. If
challenged, how could the Secretary of State demonstrate that his
actions had actually reduced health inequalities? He is, however, able
to show that he has had regard to the need to reduce inequalities by
demonstrating, for example, that he has factored the relevant issues
into his thinking when exercising functions. The duty to have regard to
the need to reduce inequalities, as currently drafted, gives the
Secretary of State a duty, which he is fully able to discharge and for
which he can, therefore, truly be held to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000377">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
as we have discussed, the term “have regard to” is an
established phrase that does not in any way imply a weak commitment. I
will not repeat the legal comments that I read out to the Committee
earlier, because they are equally relevant
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000378">&#160;</a>

the characteristics of inequality that the Secretary of State should
endeavour to address. The duty, as currently drafted, has been kept
purposefully broad to capture all types of inequality that may affect
individuals, including those listed in the amendment. Personally, I
would have thought that, in the light of that information, hon. Members
would welcome the way in which we have drafted the Bill, rather than
the way that the Opposition have drafted their amendment. It would be a
mistake to limit the scope to specific areas. Furthermore, the issues
in the amendment are already covered, in large part, by duties under
the Equality Act 2010, which apply to all public bodies, including the
Secretary of State. To reproduce them in the duty would simply
replicate existing legislation, which, I must say, in the context of
those comments, seems
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000380">&#160;</a>

relation to anything that they have specifically
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000382">&#160;</a>

has been suggested that, on this side of the Committee, there is some
churlishness about us not recognising that the equality duty is in the
Bill. If we have given that impression, I apologise. The point that we
are trying to make is not that there is no nod towards equality in the
Bill, but that it is so little and that it is so pathetic. In fact, in
many ways, the Minister has exposed himself and shown the clause to be
the limp thing that it is. He said that the amendment gave the
Secretary of Secretary a million aspirational duties that he could not
fulfil. Is that a criticism of the amendment? The amendment would
replace what is stated in the Bill, that<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000383">&#160;</a>

                        <p>with
the idea that he has a duty to do something about it. There is a big
difference. Instead of a nod to equalities and playing at the idea of
taking them seriously, the amendment is about ensuring that the
Secretary of State would do something about it. The Bill, as I have
said, will go backwards regarding equality in the NHS, and it is
important that there is a clear duty. There is an element of
churlishness in that the title of the clause states:<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000384">&#160;</a>

covered in the stand part debate. The reason why we have tabled the
amendment is self-evident, and we have already debated it. We tabled
amendment 9 because it would be helpful if the Bill clarified the
phrase “people of England” to confirm that it will cover
all those present in England who are entitled to NHS care. That is
compatible with non-discrimination legislation. I have heard what the
Minister said this afternoon regarding the entire population being
within a GP consortium, but there is concern that the Bill is
insufficiently clear on GPs’ responsibility for the entire
population, and that we will be left with a doily approach. For
example, there is a concern that the most vulnerable, such as homeless
people with mental problems who are not on a GPs’ list, will not
be seen as a responsibility of GPs. It is important that we receive
reassurance on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000419">&#160;</a>

rolls his eyes, but Dr Gerada is an important individual in the context
of the NHS. Given that she represents GPs, it is important that her
organisation understands what the clause really means. I am grateful to

7 has also been covered already, so I now move to amendment 14. The
reference to the NHS constitution is of great importance because its
first principle is that there should be equality. I do not want to
repeat arguments that have already been made, but it is fundamentally
important that the Bill states that the Secretary of State has direct
responsibility to ensure that all the listed bodies act in a proper and
equal way.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000422">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Before the Division, I was referring to the
equality duty as created under the Equality Act 2010 and the concerns
of the EHRC. A Second Reading briefing
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000426">&#160;</a>

Commission is concerned that with proposed changes to commissioning,
there is a risk that services may not be subject to the fundamental
protections contained in the new Equality Duty… The Commission
would advise that the ways in which equality and human rights
legislation will apply to commissioning, service delivery, regulation
and inspection of the National Health Service should be made more
explicit, either on the face of the legislation or clear statements of
commitment.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000497">&#160;</a>

pray that in aid particularly of perhaps the most important part of our
amendment that would place a specific duty on all providers of health
care services for NHS purposes, so that private providers are also
under no misunderstanding that they are subject to the Equality Act and

                           </strong> I am grateful for a further opportunity to deal

                        <p>to
reduce health inequalities into having a duty actually to reduce them.
I have outlined two reasons why I believe that amendment 5 is
unnecessary. In summary, the amendment would create an aspirational
duty, as I have said, against which the Secretary of State could not be
held to account. Furthermore, the term “have regard to”
is an established phrase, as I mentioned when I read out the legal
quote explaining that. I will not test the Committee’s patience
by reading it out again; I will take it as read. I also remind the
Committee that the term is used in relation to the NHS constitution in
legislation enacted by the previous Government. It is not as though we
are doing something completely out of the blue and new. There is a
precedent, and if it reassures Labour Members, that precedent was set
by their Government, so, from their point of view, it must be
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000431">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 7
would add a reference to reducing inequalities in the quality of care.
That is unnecessary, however, because quality is implicit within the
more  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 326<a class="bkMark" name="Column326">&#160;</a>
                           </div>general term, “benefits”. The inequality duty in clause 3
is deliberately drafted widely, because it applies not only to health
services, but to the Secretary of State’s public health duties,
which we briefly alluded to earlier. When we come to discuss the
inequalities duties on the NHS commissioning board and consortia, hon.
Members will see that they refer to reducing inequalities in the
outcomes achieved by the provision of health services, which I believe
captures the point that the hon. Lady seeks to make with amendment
7.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000432">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 14
would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to uphold the provisions
of the Equality Act and the NHS constitution. Furthermore, it seeks to
impose a further duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the
provisions apply to certain key bodies in the health system. The
Secretary of State and, indeed, all the bodies that are listed in the
amendment are already subject to the provisions under that Act.
Similarly, as I have mentioned, a set of legal requirements already
ensures that all NHS bodies and providers of NHS services must have
regard to the NHS constitution. Therefore, such legislation is already
in place and, to my mind, the amendment is unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000433">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
has kindly indicated that she understands that the amendment relating
to the annual report is already covered by the overall annual report
that the Secretary of State presents to Parliament on the NHS. If I
understood the hon. Lady correctly, she will not press the relevant
amendment to a vote. I urge the Opposition that it is not necessary to
press the amendment to a vote, in light of my comments and
explanations, which I hope that they will consider, but if they do
press it to a vote, I invite my hon. Friends to join me in opposing
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021791000434">&#160;</a>
