about situations where there is information held by the police on their

there a mechanism for the information to be deleted, in line with the

                           </strong> For clarity,
clause 88 mirrors provisions in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act
1974. All police information will be removed only for convictions or
cautions that are disregarded. If it is not a disregarded conviction,
if the police hold non-conviction information that relates to
consensual gay sex, the retention of such information is governed by
the provisions of the Data Protection Act itself, but where a decision
is found in favour of the applicant, all the information
goes.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What does that means with regard to information

to the actual, practical reality of what that means with regard to the
information that is

                           </strong> I will come back to the
hon. Lady. My understanding is that it is retained, but I need to
understand that more fully. Under the Data Protection Act, there is no
requirement for it to be deleted. If no disregard is granted by the
Secretary of State, nothing has changed in terms of information on the
police
database.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000038">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am interested in this point
because we know that historically, information has been held around
people’s sexuality by police forces and what is deemed to be
relevant has varied across the country. Some might think that
information on people’s homosexuality should not be on a police
database. What could be done about information held by the police on
homosexual activity that is not a crime? Is there any way in which that
could be removed from the police database?<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000039">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My understanding is that that is a different
question altogether and does not relate to this Bill, which seeks to
provide a remedy for offences that are no longer offences and can be
deleted, in effect, by the disregard. I understand what the hon. Lady
is saying, which is that there can be a mountain of information
residing on police computers around the homosexual nature of an
individual that has not led to a conviction at any time; but the police
can hold information for lawful purposes only if it is adequate,
relevant and not kept for longer than necessary. The police can and do
alter their records in accordance with the management of police
information and individuals can apply to the police to have information
deleted from the police national computer, but that is a matter for the
discretion of the Chief Police Officer and for the individual, based on
whether that information is adequate, relevant and not kept for longer
than necessary. It is not in direct correlation to the disregards where
the conviction, caution and information is deleted. With that, I ask
the Committee to let clause 88 stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000040">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 89 sets up the mechanism for the appeal
and we have already had some discussion about the involvement of the
High Court in relation to the application and its possible failure.
Subsection (1) provides for that right of appeal to the High Court
against a decision by the Secretary of State not to grant an
application for a relevant conviction or caution to be
disregarded.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
subsection (2), the High Court cannot hear any new evidence; it must
reach a decision based on the evidence that was available to the
Secretary of State. If the appeal is granted, the High Court must make
an order. The relevant conviction or caution is to be treated as
disregarded 14 days after such an order is made. Under subsection (6),
there is no further appeal on the High Court decision.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
understand why the High Court will not be able to access any further
information that might come to light. If an application is
unsuccessful, an applicant might make further inquiries and get
together more information. How is the matter helped by not allowing the
High Court to consider such new evidence? We discussed how, under
clause 84, the Secretary of State may not hold an oral hearing, and the
Minister said that there is a right to a review, but that is not clear
in the Bill. Why is it not possible to have a safety net that allows
the High Court to consider any additional information that has not been
picked up before? If it is not possible for new evidence to be heard,
will the Minister reconsider our amendments on the right to formalise a
review in the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000046">&#160;</a>

considered the different courts that might deal with the matter? Why go

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North
has asked several questions. She seems most concerned about why the
appellant cannot submit fresh evidence at the appeal. The purpose of
the appeal is to test the Secretary of State’s decision about a
particular application and to see whether it is upheld by the High
Court; it is not to revisit the facts of the original conviction. The
judgment will be on what the Secretary of State has decided given the
facts before her.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have had a
substantial discussion about the applicant’s responsibility to
submit full details at the start of the application process. As I have
said, new information, or information that was accidentally omitted,
can be made available by the applicant during the process, and the Home
Secretary will consider it. That may even negate the need to proceed to
the High Court, as we discussed.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In providing
for an appeal to the High Court, we have mirrored the provisions in the
Sexual Offences Act 2003, which disapplied provisions
relating to the sex offenders register in the case of people with a
conviction for consensual gay sex. That is one precedent set by the
previous Government that we are content to adopt. An appeal considers a
decision, which has been made on the basis of evidence, so it examines
the rectitude or otherwise of the Secretary of State’s
determination. The hon. Lady is worried about the costs of such an
appeal. An individual will bring an appeal and will be expected to pay
for their own representation in the first instance, but the judgment
that is handed down may well give direction on who should bear the
final costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked why the appeal will be to the High Court and not to a lower one.
The appeal would challenge a decision of the Secretary of State and it
is appropriate that it be to the same judicial body that hears other
appeals relating to administrative decisions of the Secretary of State,
for example, in the case of judicial review. The High Court is the
appropriate level at which to judge a decision made by a Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for setting that out. I am a
little surprised, because I thought that the purpose of the provision
was to make it as easy as possible for the applicant to put forward
their case and to make the process as accessible as possible. However,
we seem to be straying into equating it with a judicial review
proceeding, which is a serious matter and involves high costs. I am
surprised that the applicant cannot make a more measured appeal than by
heading off to the High
Court.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000052">&#160;</a>

hope and expect that the vast majority of cases will be decided without
any problems whatever on first pass. If problems arise at the first
stage, that can be dealt with by the applicant submitting more
evidence, and if the matter is unclear it can be judged by a panel.

has been identified in respect of copyright and database right which is
owned by the Crown but which would not be covered by the current
definition of Crown copyright or Crown database right. That gap would
occur in an instance when, for example, a work or database is owned by
the Crown by virtue of rights assigned by a third party such as a
contractor.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000070">&#160;</a>

213, 215, 216, 218, 220 and 221 address that gap and make equivalent
provision for Parliament by removing the existing definitions and
references to “Crown copyright”, “Crown database
right”, and “Parliamentary copyright” of
“relevant copyright work”. A complete definition of
relevant Crown and parliamentary works to reflect the policy is
provided in amendments 217 and 222. In drafting the
amendments we have noticed some inconsistency of language and have
therefore taken the opportunity through amendments 214 and 219 of
tidying up the language. I commend the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000071">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Good afternoon to you,
Mr. Caton, and to the Committee. May I indulge the Committee
for one moment? It would be remiss not to congratulate the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for
Old Bexley and Sidcup, on his new post on crime and security. I am sure
he will do very well. I hope that he enjoys it—though not too
much—and does well at it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am not going
to say that we should vote against, or argue in great detail about, the
Minister’s amendments, but to be frank, they are extremely
difficult to understand. There have been negotiations between the
Department and Parliament about Crown copyright and so on. Can the
Minister provide an assurance that we will not undermine the ability of
individuals or groups to access information? Clearly, the Government
included the original provision because they were determined to extend
and develop the Data Protection Act and the role of the Information
Commissioner. There is obviously a concern, therefore, that some
information that would have been made available may no longer be
accessible.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What the
Minister has just said is very technical. Are there things that
previously could have been released, which now cannot be released? In
other words, have we tightened the system in a way that is not
immediately obvious? I am not saying that there was anything wrong with
what the Minister said, but it was very technical. Are we achieving our
objective of trying to give people access as appropriate? Does the
Minister have any examples? Will the system remain exactly the same, or
will things that could have been made available under the original
proposals now not be accessible with the
amendments?<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000074">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for highlighting
the issue, which is very technical. I can assure him that both the
House of Commons and the House of Lords are supportive of the
transparency agenda. This is not in any way to circumvent or inhibit;
it is simply a matter of having identified that, for example,
Parliament cannot be instructed by the Secretary of State. We will
address the issue in more detail during the clause stand part debate.
What is covered is covered in different ways for the Crown copyright;
it is covered in different ways for Parliament. This is extending
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000075">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Under the Government’s amendments, is there
a greater restriction on the ability to release information to
individuals or groups than there was under the original provisions?
That is the crucial point. I understand the point about protecting
copyright, but I am trying to understand whether the proposals narrow
the availability of informational datasets to those who wish to access
them or to have them
released.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> My understanding is that it is already
covered. There is no difference, as far as I am aware, or desire to
restrict. The reason why we are redefining the provision simply relates
to the copyright issue. It is not in any way intended to restrict the
amount of information that can or should be made
available.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> So the Minister is saying that it makes no
difference; it is just a tidying-up exercise in relation to Crown
copyright. I think that people would be interested to know whether the
new proposals narrow what could have been made available under the
original proposals. There might be a good reason for narrowing it, but
I am trying to understand whether we are narrowing people’s
ability to access information, or whether it is a tidying-up exercise
to protect
copyright.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000078">&#160;</a>

absolutely understand the point about the Secretary of State not being

                           </strong> A lot of these changes are quite technical, but
regarding the Government’s direction of travel I think that they
are trying to build on a very important Act under the last Government,
the Data Protection Act 1998, which established the Information
Commissioner. That was a very good reform, and the Government are
trying to build on it in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
at some point the Minister might want to clarify these technical
changes, because I am not sure what narrowing the definition of
“Parliamentary work” means, in relation to what could
have been made available before and what cannot now be made available.
That seems fine, but somewhere down the road we might find that there
is some huge thing. But if not, not.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We broadly
welcome many, if not all, of the provisions in clauses 92 to 98. I only
have questions about the detail in some of the clauses, which I would
be grateful if the Minister could answer for the benefit of the

datasets under clause 92 that must be provided obviously now have to be
provided in electronic form. People can still get them as hard copy,
but on request they can get them in electronic form. However, there is
no absolute requirement that they can get the datasets in electronic
form. I understand the amount of resources that would be used to put
the information into electronic form—I understand all
that—but where will the line be drawn? Given that there is no
absolute requirement, can the Minister say how we will ensure that we
can put the information in a reusable form or in electronic copy that
could be made available to people, and that there would not be a bit of
a loophole in the legislation? It would be helpful if the Minister
could say something about that issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p>In
other words, there is a dataset but if it is analysed or interpreted
and then changed, it appears that it cannot be released to the public.

subsection (5)(c)? They seem to almost duplicate each
other.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000097">&#160;</a>

can the Minister tell the Committee why datasets that have been

use the example that was given to the Committee by the Campaign for
Freedom of Information, which makes the point much better than I
can:<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000098">&#160;</a>

then show which accidents occurred on roads with particular types of

(4) talks about a publication scheme. It states that the public

                        <p>Will
the Minister consider how wide that draft is and reflect on it, rather
than saying that I am definitely right or that she is definitely right?
Saying that it is “not appropriate” is a significantly
wide drafting of the Bill, which gives a lot of leeway to any
authority. Will the Minister have a look at that? I know she will say
that there are all sorts of other things that mean that the authority
has to do it under this bit of this Act and that bit of that Act, but I
do not think the Minister would want the legislation to be drawn so
widely that we can say to someone, “If you don’t think it
is appropriate, you don’t have to draft it or publish
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why
should there be a general presumption to publish datasets, regardless
of whether a request has been made? Under the Freedom of Information

is also important the regime for accessing Environmental Information,
the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, also benefits from the
changes proposed in clause 92. The Commissioner considers that this is
important as access to environmental information is a matter of
significant public interest and these rights should
not fall behind other rights. The INPSIRE Regulations, passed in 2009
do implement some obligations for public authorities to publish
environmental information but not comprehensively. The Commissioner
acknowledges there could

                        <p>The
Information Commissioner is concerned about how clause 92 is drafted
and how it relates to the 2004 regulations. Will the Minister say
something about that? Will she explain the position of official

explain the position on access to and availability of official

understand that there is one code of practice with respect to the whole
area. That seems to imply that there could be multiple codes of
practice; is that what it means? We could have a code of practice for
each public authority that is required to publish datasets, so there
would be a significant number of codes. That would be confusing. Would
it not be better, unless I have misunderstood subsection 5(c), to
continue with one code of practice, and amend or adapt it? Why would we
want lots of different codes of practice? I do not understand what that

                        <p class="tabbed">I
start by briefly thanking Maurice Frankel, the director of the Campaign
for Freedom of Information, with whom I have worked for a number of
years. Thanks to his support I have presented to the House two
ten-minute rule Bills relating to freedom of information. I will go
over some of the ground that has already been covered, and perhaps the
hon. Member for Gedling and I will between us be able to present a
clear picture of the clarification we seek. The Minister may feel it
appropriate to respond by writing to the Committee, because these are
detailed proposals. She, or her officials, will have seen a copy of the
information from Mr Frankel that might facilitate her
response.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
first point that I wanted to pick up was on the definition of datasets.
The concern of the Campaign for Freedom of Information is that a slight
change to a dataset or the processing performed on it would convert its
status so that it was no longer available. I hope that the Minister
will reassure us that it will not be possible to circumvent the
requirements simply by concocting a minor change to a dataset that
means that it cannot be
released.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000112">&#160;</a>

CFI highlights its belief that, in terms of copyright, all information
should be released under the Act, unless the authority currently
receives income from licensing the reuse of the information or has
taken steps to enhance its commercial value. The drive of the CFI is to

			Column number: 681<a class="bkMark" name="Column681">&#160;</a>
                           </div>ensure that no policy documents or information about an
authority’s performance or decisions should normally be
restricted on copyright grounds. Clearly, other factors will have to be
taken into account, such as commercial confidentiality or data
protection, but I hope that the Minister will respond to that point
now, or later in
writing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Gedling referred to the format in which information
will be provided. The Campaign for Freedom of Information hopes that it
will be possible to ensure that documents are provided not only in hard
copy but as photocopies of the original, if people request them. I
assume that its concern is that if the document is provided as a
print-out or a re-typed version, it might be possible to change it in
some respect, whereas if a photocopy of the original is provided that
cannot
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause is about the release and publication of datasets; it does not
cover the offence of deliberately shredding or altering data. Although
that is not the subject of the clause, I hope that the Government will
consider whether any changes need to be made to the length of time for
proceedings, for instance, for the offence of shredding a dataset whose
disclosure was required under FOI. Could such proceedings be extended
longer than six months? Two or three years are suggested, which would
be comparable with other offences.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
constant problem about how quickly datasets or other types of
information are released under FOI requests. Now or later, the
Government might want to consider introducing a fixed time limit for
responding to such requests. A matter that is completely outside the
scope of the clause, although I will mention it briefly, is
Ministers’ right to exercise a veto. As long as that right is
maintained, there will always be a question mark over whether we have
full freedom of information. A Minister can ultimately decide that in
his or her view that information, although it has been cleared by the
commissioner, should not be released into the public domain.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My final point
has a bearing on the NHS proposals for freedom of information and
involves the impact of commissioning arrangements. Again, that is not
the subject of the clause, but I am sure that the Minister will want to
consider, perhaps in an amendment to this or a future Bill, how freedom
of information will apply to GP commissioning, so that people can be
confident of access to pertinent information about the public sector
money being spent.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000117">&#160;</a>

have been generous in allowing me to stray slightly beyond the scope of
the clause. I understand that some of my points are quite technical, so
if the Minister cannot respond now, I am sure that Members will be
content for her to respond later in
writing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000118">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is a smorgasbord of points to answer.
The effect of the Government amendments just agreed by the Committee is
to narrow the scope of the provisions in the clause to the extent that
datasets subject to parliamentary copyright will no longer be covered.
However, it is likely that the House of Commons and the House of Lords
will wish to comply with the spirit of the provisions on a
non-statutory
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000119">&#160;</a>

alphabetically or merging two documents. We accept that the information
in many datasets may have undergone some reorganisation or change in
presentation; I am talking about the minor amendments that my hon.
Friend was concerned might lead to a wrong use of subsection (5)(c).
The objective and intent for a change is that it is not significant or
substantive, such that it still constitutes the factual source data or
raw data, un-manipulated in form. The policy is that such datasets are
still covered by the definition. Such minor alterations, which are not
significant or substantive but involve just a reorganisation or change
in how the information is presented, are still covered by the
definition of “dataset”, which is a subset of
“information” under freedom of information
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000121">&#160;</a>

under the Freedom of Information Act not only to release datasets, but
to make them available for reuse and, where reasonably practicable, in
a reusable format.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000131">&#160;</a>

incredibly wide. The hon. Lady might say that she totally disagrees

all. I think that it is. It is a drafting point; it is not a point of
principle. When the words “is not appropriate” are
included, people will argue about their meaning. It is a get-out for
people. If an authority does not wish to publish, it can say,
“It is not appropriate for us to

It is not put in terms of a presumption, but it is quite clear that the
expectation is that a public authority will publish raw data in the
forms that we have discussed. These changes support the commitment to
open up Government to greater scrutiny, allow the public to hold us to
account, help to deliver better value for money in public spending and
bring significant social and economic benefits by enabling businesses,
non-profit organisations and others to exploit Government datasets for
social and commercial

was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington,
around the submission in evidence, why we were not changing
environmental information regulations as well. The Government consider
that the environmental information regulations implement Council
directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. No
changes to the regulations are currently being considered. The
environmental information regulations already require environmental
information datasets to be proactively disseminated to the public, so
there was no need for us to cover the same
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000138">&#160;</a>

another issue of definition raised by the hon. Member for Gedling, we
will provide guidance on what “reasonably practicable”
and what “reusable format” mean in the code of practice
which will be issued under the Freedom of Information Act. I was asked,
do we intend to issue a number of codes; that is not the intention. If
we want a code, there are some changes to the code, but one will
suffice. There will be one code and that is certainly our
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Other
matters will also be covered in the code of practice issued under
section 45 of the FOI Act. The code will be revised to provide guidance
for public authorities on the meaning of datasets and making datasets
available for reuse so that public authorities are clear on the scope
of their duties; and on the terms and conditions of the specified
licences for making datasets available for reuse, which will be the
licences prescribed by the controller of Her Majesty’s
Stationery Office—this is so we do not get a multiplicity of
different licences. There will be one or two authorised, which will
enable a consistency across all the local authorities that will be
publishing this data, so we do not get a hotch-potch of different
licensing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000140">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked why the
changes will apply only to datasets and not to all information covered
by the FOI Act. The Government recognise, and a number of reports have
argued, that great value is locked into information that is held by
public authorities, which can be realised through its reuse. Particular
benefit is to be gained from making datasets available for reuse,
because they can be organised, interrogated and manipulated in creative
and innovative ways. I believe that matter is coming up in discussion
in a Select Committee shortly, when a range of freedom of information
issues will be investigated.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In answer to
why not photocopies or documents, the Freedom of Information Act
provides a right to information, rather than to documents per se.
Section 11 of the Act allows requesters to specify which
form they would prefer and the public authority should, as far as is
reasonably practicable, give effect to that preference. In most cases,
public authorities will provide the information in the form that has
been requested. I understand the distinction between a photocopy of an
original document and a reprinted one. The request, however, has to be
for what is reasonably practicable and it might not be reasonably
practicable for such photocopies to be made, but that will be for the
authority to decide.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000143">&#160;</a>

drafting. Subsection (2)(b) amends section 6(1) of the Freedom of

“any public authority” to “particular
information” will be substituted by “the wider public
sector”. I am not clear what “the wider public
sector” means—apart from the obvious. Presumably, a
public sector was covered, but now more of it is covered, because we
have changed the definition, but that also implies that some of the
sector will be left out, otherwise the clause would state, “all
the public sector.” Can the Minister explain what that means and
the purpose of the change? Some clarification of the term “wider
public sector” would be helpful for the Committee and for

with a public authority owning a majority of its shares, but a private

excluded. If the Government are unwilling to take the matter on board

think that an organisation such as Network Rail, which receives all its
funding from the public sector and is not within the scope of the FOI
Act, should be brought within it. To give an illustration of why I
agree, Network Rail has been asked for information on the number of
trains that arrive on time, as we understand that phrase—within
one minute, rather than within five minutes, which is its definition of
being on time—but even though the company has that information,
it has refused to provide it to Members of Parliament and others. As a
body that receives all its funds from the public sector, Network Rail
should be covered by the FOI Act, but currently it is not. The
Government are aware of the issue, but they have not yet responded.
When the Select Committee considers the FOI Act, I hope that it will
agree that Network Rail should be brought within its
scope.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000151">&#160;</a>

FOI Act do not go further. I am aware of the calls to extend the
provision to companies in which the Crown or the wider public sector
owns the majority of shares, but we believe that that would create
uncertainty about which bodies are subject to the Act, particularly as
bodies whose shares are transferred may regularly pass in and out of
its scope. Should there be a strong argument for including a specific
body, there remain other means of including it, such as the
order-making power in section 5 of the FOI
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000152">&#160;</a>

Network Rail, I reassure my hon. Friend that we are committed to
transparency across the board and to making it more accountable to its
customers. A great many people throughout the country would like the
company to be accountable in the way he has described. There is a
strong case for its inclusion in the FOI Act, but the Department for
Transport is currently reviewing the structures and accountability of
the rail industry, so we will wait until the structure of Network Rail

                           </strong> I welcome the fact that the provision will be kept
under review. One of the logical consequences of the coalition
Government’s desire for local authorities and others to
outsource many of their back office functions, for example, by handing
them over to organisations that might be more efficient at running
them, will be greater diversity among the companies and organisations
providing public services.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I stress that
those companies will be providing public services, so the Government
should keep the provision under review. If there is a wider movement
towards having more companies in which the public sector is a majority
shareholder and the private company is a minority shareholder, perhaps
the matter can be looked at again. Such companies may need to be
brought more specifically within the remit of the

House have been raising the issue of how we commission in this country.
I did not mention my hon. Friend’s reference to commissioning,
which is outside the scope of the clause, but there is a subset of
instances when public money is spent through mechanisms
other than what were recognised in the old days
as publicly owned companies. There are specific circumstances in which
such organisations will be brought into the FOI circumference, but that
debate will go on for some
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000161">&#160;</a>

the debate we have had, I want to put this on the record for clarity.
Companies that are wholly owned by more than one public authority, or
by the Crown and one or more of the schedule 1 public authorities, are
not currently subject to the Freedom of Information Act. As we have
discussed, it should not matter whether a company is wholly owned by
one public authority or by more than one public authority. All such
companies should be equally accountable and should, therefore, be
subject to the Act.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000163">&#160;</a>

93 rectifies that anomaly by amending section 6 of the

company. In effect, the Act will be extended to companies wholly owned

by one or more of those bodies and the Crown, will be brought within
its

Northern Ireland bodies. Clause 94 will repeal both section 80A of the

that the reduction in the maximum duration of certain exemptions in the
2000 Act from 30 years to 20 years will, once commenced, apply to
Northern Ireland bodies, as well as to bodies in England and Wales. The

applicants for the role. We have looked again at that point in the
light of the concerns that were raised. The Government’s initial
decision to propose a five-year term was finely balanced in any case.

appointments of this type should be for a non-renewable period of
between five and seven years. The Tiner review of the post of
Comptroller and Auditor General also stated that it was important that
the period of appointment should not be so long that a figure becomes
too personally associated with the role, but long enough for the
individual to become established and accustomed to the role.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think it was sensible to extend the tenure of
the Information Commissioner from five to seven years, and the evidence
that was given to the Government and the Committee to support that
change was compelling. The Government are clearly trying to strengthen
the Freedom of Information Act 2000 by trying to make more information
applicable under the terms of the Act. The clause is an attempt to
strengthen the independence of the commissioner, which is absolutely
fundamental to how freedom of information works. There will always be a
debate about what that actually means. The perennial debate that
Ministers will have is that everybody wants all these bodies and
commissioners to be independent, but if anything goes wrong they will
ask what the Government are doing about it. That will happen at some
point, but that is not to say that we should not try to ensure that the
commissioner and others are as independent as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A couple of
parallel things are going on. My understanding—the Minister will
correct me if I am wrong—is that a framework document is being
discussed alongside the Bill, which relates to the Information
Commissioner, the Information Commissioner’s Office and the
Ministry of Justice. It is difficult to discuss these clauses without
the Minister saying something about that process; what is actually
going on and how does the legislation fit with that? The Information
Commissioner is a Secretary of State appointment. Do the Government
intend to move from the Information Commissioner’s Office being
accountable to the Ministry of Justice and make it accountable to
Parliament instead? That is quite a significant change.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Alongside
that, we have the question whether the Information Commissioner should
be subject to a pre-appointment hearing. Some similar appointments are
subject to pre-appointment scrutiny and hearings, and others are not.
Why have the Government decided not to state in the Bill that a new
Information Commissioner should be subject to a pre-appointment
hearing? The Minister will no doubt say that it is the
Government’s expectation that that will happen, but I wonder why
the Government choose in some instances to do that and in others not
to.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000191">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, who is more clued up on
such things than I am, understands that, but I wonder whether the
Minister knows what that actually means, because I am not sure. The
clauses that come after this state that the Information
Commissioner will have more independence in matters such as guidance
and numbers of staff. Presumably, the commissioner is given a budget
and they decide how to spend it. I am sorry to stray slightly; it is
difficult to talk about only one of these clauses, because they
naturally come together. What does that actually mean? Can the Minister
enlighten the Committee as to why that particular sentence is included
in the research documents, which, as we know, are usually
outstanding?<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000193">&#160;</a>

independence of the commissioner, which is important, to have the
framework document published as soon as possible. It would aid the

independence of the Information Commissioner, which I am sure is

hon. Gentleman raised a further point around why the appointment of the
Information Commissioner was, for this time only, being pre-scrutinised
by the Justice Committee, and the appointment, unlike that of the
chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has a different
position—I have failed to find my place in the information, but
I know that there is a good reason. I believe it was so that we did not
bind future Parliaments to something that we were doing at this point
in time. The ICO’s functions do not relate primarily to the
business of Parliament, so it would not be appropriate for the ICO to
become a Parliamentary

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government issued a written ministerial statement earlier this year,
stating that the Government will be bound by the Justice
Committee’s view on the appointment of the next Information
Commissioner, and we see no need to give that statutory force. Indeed,
the usual practice is not to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, the clause begins with the introduction of changes to the
appointment and tenure of the Information Commissioner and forms part
of the wider proposals in the Bill to enhance the independence of the
office. As we discussed in relation to the amendments that increase the
new single-term tenure of office from five to seven years, a strong and
independent Information Commissioner is vital to ensure the openness of
public bodies and to uphold information protection rights effectively
for individuals. The Information Commissioner already operates with
complete independence in relation to the decisions that he takes to
promote and enforce the Freedom of Information Act, the Data Protection
Act and the other legislation that falls within his
remit.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the Government believe that it is right to remove some of the
unnecessary and unused legislative provisions to help guard against any
perception that the commissioner is not truly independent from the
Government. We are therefore taking steps to further enhance the
commissioner’s independence through clauses 95 to 98.
As we have discussed, the legislative changes will be underpinned by
the new framework document, which will be published shortly, that sets
out the day-to-day relationship between the Information Commissioner
and the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000205">&#160;</a>

agree with him, and it is an important step to set out clearly the

It will enhance his accountability and independence, by ensuring that a

having made a decision that the Government

                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed new
sub-paragraph (3B) provides that the commissioner must be appointed on
merit and on the basis of fair and open competition. Alongside that
provision Lord McNally, who is the Minister responsible in the Ministry
of Justice, has issued a written ministerial statement confirming that
the Government will be bound by the Justice Committee’s
recommendation in relation to the appointment of the next commissioner,
following the pre-appointment scrutiny hearing that the Committee will
be invited to hold. Obviously, I have no doubt that both the current
and previous commissioners have been appointed fairly, based on their
suitability and merit for the position. The existing commissioner was
subject to pre-appointment scrutiny by the Justice Committee before his
appointment was confirmed. Establishing that requirement in law would
avoid any perception that appointments might be made based on any other
considerations.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000212">&#160;</a>

fixed term. Following the amendments agreed by the Committee, that will
be for a period of seven years. Provision is also made, for obvious
reasons, to remove the requirement that the commissioner must vacate
his office on completion of the year in which he reaches his 65th

removing the requirement for the Secretary of State to sign off such

drawing up the guidance and codes, and repealing the requirement for

The clause purports to remove the current requirement in the Freedom of
Information Act 2000 for the Information Commissioner to obtain the
consent of the Secretary of State for Justice before he may charge for
certain services provided under the Act. The Committee should welcome
that because the commissioner can already charge for those services; it
is simply the necessity to seek the consent of the Secretary of State
that is being removed. We believe that the Information 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 696<a class="bkMark" name="Column696">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Commissioner is best placed to form an assessment of
the particular services for which he should recover the costs. Clearly
that does not appertain to his central thrust in terms of his judgment,
giving advice and writing guidance, but to recoverable costs for
services such as hosting conferences and the provision of documents. In
future, therefore, if the clause stands part, the commissioner will be
able to charge, without consent from the Secretary of State, to recover
the costs of hosting conferences, the provision of training, and
providing multiple hard copies of guidance where it is available free
of charge in another format, such as online. That seems a sensible
change in the system. I emphasise that the Information
Commissioner’s office cannot use the new provision to generate a
profit.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000237">&#160;</a>

the clause provides that the Secretary of State may by order add to the

Information Commissioner’s funding for data protection functions
comes from annual notification fees from the data controllers, which
are set in the Data Protection (Notification and Notification Fees)
Regulations. The Information Commissioner’s freedom of
information function is funded by grant in aid from the Government. We
think it appropriate that this is set by Government rather than
Parliament. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman’s
question, if not in the way that he wished because the framework
document is not yet available, but in that is the
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000243">&#160;</a>

thank the Minister for her reply because it is now clear in my mind.
The Minister said that the Secretary of State will determine the
budget, and there is no role for Parliament. There is debate around
that. Certainly, as I understand the framework document, the issue of
the independence of the commissioner would be better served if they
were accountable to Parliament rather than the Secretary of State. In
other words, you would not have a sponsoring

the Minister, the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup. I leant across
and whispered to him to ask whether he was “right
honourable” and he looked very embarrassed by the question. He
is a very modest man. We in south-east London follow his progress very
closely. I am sure that, with his new responsibility in a very
important job, we will all feel a very warm glow of comfort as his
armour-plated Prius with blacked-out windows sweeps past us on the A2
back to his constituency. We all wish him the very best; he is a fine
fellow.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000249">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not oppose the clause, but section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act
2003 has never been enacted, so this part of the Bill deletes a
provision on a freedom that has never been taken away. I noticed that
the coalition Government programme
says:<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We

                        </p>
                        <p>That
is a very commendable objective, and we all respect trial by jury, but
the attempt to bring in this particular section of the 2003 Act was
motivated by the fact that many trials were falling foul of it because
they were extremely complicated. There has been a big debate about the
ability of juries to commit the time and to be able understand very
complex cases, and about whether that is the fault of prosecutions or
people being unable to understand. We all understand that that argument
has gone by. However, while we do not oppose the clause at all, there
is section of the 2003 Act that restricts trial by jury in relation to
jury tampering. That is the only area where trial by jury is restricted
at present. The Bill does not actually deal with that, which seems
inconsistent with the coalition document. What are the
Government’s thoughts on that? Perhaps it is part of the number
two freedom Bill of the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington’s number two Freedom Bill—in the next
Queen’s Speech, we understand—so we look forward to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000251">&#160;</a>

has been a long debate among people on all sides of this argument. We

in any way. My comments refer to the fact that there is only one area
at the moment where jury trials are restricted and that is in relation
to jury tampering. I just wonder what the Government’s thoughts

comments in relation to my new responsibilities towards security and
counter-terrorism. I look forward to the new challenges that the
additional roles bring. We have already touched on some during our
debates in Committee and I am sure that we will move on to some in our
later consideration of the Bill. I will do my utmost to play my part in
fulfilling one of the fundamental responsibilities of government, which
is about protecting the public from harm and providing security to our
country from the continuing threat of
terrorism.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addressing the hon. Member for Eltham’s points on this clause, I
thank him also for the welcome he has given to clause 99 and its effect
on fraud trials, ensuring that the right to a jury, the right to be
judged by one’s peers, is reassured, and its integrity is
maintained and given effect pursuant to this clause. As he will know,
this clause repeals section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which
makes provision for serious fraud cases to be tried in the Crown court
by a judge sitting without a jury.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The previous
Government argued that section 43 was necessary because of concerns
that some fraud trials lasted so long that they imposed an unreasonably
heavy burden on those chosen to sit on the jury. The
Government’s view is that such considerations are not sufficient
to justify removing a fundamental right, the right to trial by jury. I
welcome the comments that the hon. Gentleman has made because section
43 was opposed by both coalition parties when the Bill that became the
2003 Act was before Parliament and, as a result of this challenge, the
implementation of section 43 was made subject to a requirement for an
affirmative resolution of both Houses. That requirement has meant that
section 43 has remained uncommenced. Meanwhile, trials for serious
fraud have continued to be heard by a jury in the ordinary way. The
hon. Gentleman has already noted the commitment in the coalition
agreement
to<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000256">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>and
this clause gives effect to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman highlighted—it was a fair point—the issue
of jury tampering and the separate provisions that continue to exist.
It is important to highlight a difference betweens the provision we
seek to repeal in clause 99 and the separate provisions that relate to
jury tampering. In fraud cases, even the longest ones, jury trial will
work, albeit at the potential time it takes for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 699<a class="bkMark" name="Column699">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the jurors to be engaged in the consideration of the trial. Therefore,
the trial will ultimately be effective and a decision can be taken by a
jury in that way. Jury tampering, whether actual or potential, may well
mean that jury trial is incapable of delivering justice at all. We have
sought to retain that power on the statute book in this defined way,
because of that important distinction, but we keep all these issues
under review. This is seen as necessary, but we want to continue to
assess what is appropriate. At this stage, we believe that it is
important to have this reserve power available, where jury tampering
may result in justice simply not being done. That was the reason why it
was introduced in the first place, and why we believe that it is
appropriate to retain that
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000258">&#160;</a>

remember being charged by the Church for the bells. If I lived next to
a building that could be used for such ceremonies there might be
consequences, such as planning issues. Practice has established that
churches and other establishments that are used for weddings do not
operate outside those hours, but they may do so in the future. How are
communities safeguarded from the unintended consequences of the
proposal? I do not want to be a killjoy and limit people’s
ability to hold weddings outside the times that are currently allowed,
but I want to ask the Minister if any thought has been given to such
unintended consequences. Other than that, we have no objections to the

killjoy, because this is one of the responses that came in last summer
on the Your Freedom website, where the public were given an opportunity
to suggest laws that they considered were unnecessary and ought to be
repealed. Because of that, the provision has a special meaning, because
people are exercising that opportunity in exactly the way that we
envisaged. Why on earth were marriages ever restricted—I do know
the answer—to between the hours of 8 am and 6
pm?<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000264">&#160;</a>

all hours, or to burn the midnight candles if people want to hold
marriages at 3 am. He raises a fair question, but in the end
the negotiation will be between the religious establishment and its
environs.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000265">&#160;</a>

local authorities, if we allow marriages or civil

the full support of Northern Ireland Ministers and the Northern Ireland
Assembly, the vetting and barring scheme will be implemented in
Northern Ireland, as well as in England and Wales. Northern Ireland
Ministers generally support the changes to the scheme that will be made
as a result of the vetting and barring review. In particular, they
support the abolition of controlled activity and the monitoring of the
children’s and adult work forces. The Northern Ireland Assembly

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, the amendments largely replicate for Northern Ireland the
changes that will be made to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
2006 by chapter 1 of part 5 of the Bill. We have already debated those
provisions at length, so I do not propose to go through the amendments
in great
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should, however, draw the Committee’s attention to minor
differences in the changes for Northern Ireland compared with the
equivalent provisions for England and Wales. In the main, those are
required to reflect differences in Northern Ireland legislation or the
organisation of services there. For example, Northern Ireland Ministers
have indicated that those involved in education, health, social care
and justice inspection services will remain within the scope of
regulated activity and therefore subject to the requirements that flow
from that. The children’s hospital will be retained as a
specified establishment on the grounds that Northern Ireland has only
one hospital dedicated to children, so there is increased public
expectation that all staff who have contact with patients are checked
to the highest level prior to being
employed.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
inclusion of Northern Ireland within the vetting and barring scheme
provides great safeguarding benefits for not only Northern Ireland, but
other parts of the UK. For the first time, we will have a single body
responsible for making barring decisions in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland instead of four different departments. That makes for not only
more consistent decision making on barring, but more controlled sharing
of barring information and much easier recognition of barring decisions
across the UK. Ultimately, it will provide greater safeguards for
children and vulnerable adults by preventing the exploitation of
borders by individuals who are intent on causing
harm.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
224 to 234 are all technical in nature and flow from other Government
amendments in this and other groups. They all relate to clause 105,
which sets out the territorial extent of the Bill. Unavoidably, they
will create a complex matrix, which reflects the devolution settlement
in each part of the United Kingdom. The key changes made by the
amendments are twofold. First, as the Committee would expect, they will
extend the provisions reforming the Northern Ireland vetting and
barring scheme to Northern Ireland only. Secondly, they will establish
the new disclosure and barring service, and provide for the dissolution
of the Independent Safeguarding Authority in Northern Ireland, as well
as in England and Wales. We will come to the substance of that issue
under the next group of amendments; these simply extend the framework
of the
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1105137000305">&#160;</a>

why the single children’s hospital should have a special status,
