Amendment moved [this day]: No. 14, in page 1, line 25, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except where the buildings or structures have the function of controlling pollution.'.&#151;[Mr. Green.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): On a point of order, Mr. Hood. Would it be in order for those members of the Committee who have not pre-empted your decision, to remove their jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that the Committee had a kind and considerate Chairman this morning and I shall continue in that vein. Members of the Committee may remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): As a Committee member who pre-empted your decision, Mr. Hood, I am doubly grateful for that ruling. I welcome you to the Chair, particularly in the light of your decision to carry on that liberal, environmentally-friendly policy, which will help to prevent us from polluting the air.
<P>
Before lunch, I said that I hoped that the Government would accept the amendment, which is in line with the National Farmers Union's wish to relieve certain farmers of an unnecessary burden. The amendment would change the Bill's definition of environmental pollution. Currently, the clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```air' includes air within buildings and air within other natural or man-made structures above or below ground.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One can see why that definition has been included. It will avoid legal doubt about whether air inside buildings falls within the scope of the definition of pollution. For many purposes, that is sensible. However, were it applied to certain agricultural buildings, it might prove inadvertently damaging.
<P>
Many livestock farmers use metal tanks to store slurry before spreading it on the land. Through the natural course of events, slurry's ammonia levels are relatively high. Slurry tanks contain the air pollution&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members of the public should not take papers from the Table.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is far better for the ammonia to be contained in the slurry tanks, so that it does not pollute the air&#151;in the popular sense of the term&#151;with unpleasant and possibly dangerous smells. The Environment Agency has taken an increasing interest in such structures, which, as the Minister will know, may be required to be roofed to contain foul air. Clearly, it would be perverse to regard air that is contained by such buildings as pollution. Such air will be regarded by the Environment Agency as pollution where it is not contained, but, unless the amendment is accepted, it will be regarded as pollution even where it is contained.
<P>
There are other, similar cases. A power station that is fuelled by chicken manure stores it in a building that is deliberately kept under negative atmospheric pressure. Again, the building itself controls the pollution. Clearly, therefore, it would be wrong for that air to be described as environmental pollution. Mushroom composting facilities are another agricultural example&#151;perhaps less vivid than the chicken manure power station&#151;of buildings potentially being employed as pollution control measures.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that air in buildings or structures that are themselves part of a system for controlling pollution are not regarded as falling within the definition of environmental pollution. Obviously, if the air escaped from the building, a problem would arise and environmental pollution would occur. We are seeking not to redefine air, but merely to point out that if it is kept properly inside a building it should not be described as pollution. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington):</B> Again I rise in support of an amendment that has been tabled by the official Opposition. It would be entirely counterproductive if a building designed to reduce and control pollution were to be subject to regulation that precluded the building from serving its proper function. If the Minister can satisfy me that that will not arise, I shall of course gracefully withdraw. If he cannot, I should like to return to the matter at some point in the future.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I understand the motives behind the amendment and I hope that I shall be able to satisfy hon. Members who have spoken in favour of it. The matter has apparently bothered the National Farmers Union, which is worried about a possible impact on the way in which certain agricultural processes are regulated&#151;especially, as the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) said, in respect of mushroom compost manufacturers. All of us in the Room are experts on that subject. Fears have been expressed that unnecessary costs may be imposed on the processes by which compost is produced for use in mushroom growing.
<P>
I am sure that no member of the Committee would doubt that it is right that pollution and noxious smells that escape from a regulated installation and affect the environment outside must be controlled. Sometimes, that control will need to take account of the quality of the air inside a building, although I recognise that it may not always be possible&#151;for whatever reason&#151;to prevent emissions escaping under a doorway or through a window or vent. That is the basis on which the current regulatory regimes&#151;which were, quite correctly, established by the previous Government&#151;operate. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 stipulates that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the medium of air includes the air within buildings and the air within other man-made structures above or below ground''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill merely rolls forward that definition: we are not seeking to make any new demarche.
<P>
I assure the hon. Members who tabled the amendment that it is not the role of the current or new pollution control regimes to regulate the air within buildings if it does not pose problems to the external environment. Where an operator has built a structure to contain pollution and it is performing satisfactorily, there will be no question of regulators imposing additional requirements just because the air inside the building is poor. That is not the case now and it will not be the case. There are, of course, health and safety regulations designed to protect people working in such conditions, but that is a separate issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's assurance. As he said, that is the existing situation and regulators have not intervened in it. He spoke as though he could give some new reassurances. Does anything other than custom and practice lead him to say that regulators will not conceivably intervene in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No, I am not offering any new protection. I am simply saying that the Bill is rolling forward a provision that has operated perfectly satisfactorily for the past decade. We do not propose to change it and there is no reason why it should not continue to operate in exactly the same way in the future. There is no reason why operators should fear that changes will occur that affect that.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): Will my right hon. Friend comment on a particular problem that affects my constituency? If the amendment were passed and if some equipment&#151;I am thinking particularly of a filtration plant&#151;were faulty, am I right in supposing that it would be exempt from action being taken against it and that, even though the biological process may be what is wanted, because the equipment was faulty no action could be taken against that company or plant? That would be deleterious to achieving the right process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that the answer is that if it did not impact on the external environment, no action would be taken under these provisions. If, however, the equipment was working unsatisfactorily&#151;in other words, if the building that had been constructed to contain the pollution was not working satisfactorily&#151;I would expect the Environment Agency to intervene. However, I do not believe that there would be any question of taking action against the owner of the installation, so long as there were no noxious or negative effects on the local environment.
<P>
I hope that the hon Member for Ashford is reassured by my reply. I genuinely do not believe that there is a problem. We are speaking to each other for the reassurance of the National Farmers Union. There is no reason why matters should change. I am not aware of any cases in the past year wherein this has proved to be a problem and I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. As he said, it is a question of reassuring those at the sharp end, who have genuine concerns. I am, however, happy to accept his assurances, with the obvious caveat that we will continue carefully to monitor the situation. I dare say that the fact of the amendment and the debate on it will bring the issue to the attention of those outside this place who are most concerned and we will keep in close contact with them. If necessary, we will return to the issue at a later stage but for now I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 6, after `(c)', insert `significant'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 10, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(c) above, ``significant'' means that which the Secretary of State may by order decide.
<P>
(5) No order shall be made under subsection (4) above unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendments would fulfil a twofold purpose. First, they would make the Bill more practical and prevent it from being so far stretched that its provisions became ludicrous or fell into disrepute. Secondly, they would ensure proper scrutiny.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 would add the word ``significant'' to the line about damage to property being one of the events that can cause regulatory intervention. We had a full debate on the use of the word ``significant'' in another context&#151;[Hon. Members: ``A significant debate.'']&#151;a fully significant debate. Similar considerations apply to the amendment and we do not want to go over old ground.
<P>
Significant measures come up under the group of amendments. I would like the Minister to address the question of the areas in which the directive, and the measures in the Bill that flow from it, go beyond the existing controls rolled up, broadly speaking, in the 1990 Act. There is much concern among many of the groups and industries that will be most affected by the Bill and it will be convenient for the Committee if we discuss issues that arise now.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister will be aware that about 2,600 more installations will be regulated under these provisions than were regulated under the 1990 Act. Some that were regulated under the previous measures will fall out of the scope of provisions&#151;there are clearly complications in both ways. Large intensive pig and poultry installations and those for the manufacture of food and drink products are the unregulated installations covered by the directive. One point especially relevant to the group of amendments that the Minister has already made is that part of the purpose of the Bill is to tidy up. Different regimes for the regulation of different types of pollution are in force; one of the benefits of the proposed changes will be that the situation will be tidied up.
<P>
Who, in principle, could argue with that? It is more sensible that people have certainty and thereby are enabled to run their businesses better. We have already discussed deregulation, so let us not go over that ground, but certainty in regulation is a virtue in terms of letting businesses know what is coming.
<P>
My fear, which I genuinely hope that the Minister can put to rest, is that one effect of the Bill, which would be prevented by the amendments, is the regulatory equivalent of mission creep&#151;regulatory creep. Regulations can be established and extended without, necessarily, any expression by Parliament that that should happen. Several new installations will be covered and a wide range of existing measures have been brought together&#151;regulations for the integrated pollution control regime, for the local air pollution control regime, for control of water pollution and of waste sites. That step comes on top of the addition of new regulations concerning pig and poultry installations and food and drink plants.
<P>
One does not have to be unduly cynical to think that, with such a wide range of new regulatory powers being brought together, there is at least a possibility of creeping extra regulation. I hope that the Minister and I can agree that that would be bad for business and also not good for the environment. As we have discussed, we all want decent and practical environmental controls, but allowing them to spread so that they become illegitimate is likely to encourage bad behaviour by some on the fringes of some industries. That would have a damaging effect on the environment and on respect for the law.
<P>
Amendment No. 10 would insert an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny into the procedures. After this morning's discussions, I am not sure that the Minister and I are destined to agree on what such a level should be, but the amendment is consistent with others that we have tabled. At as many stages possible, we wish democratic rather than bureaucratic control over the regulations to be exercised. I shamelessly steal the elegant phrase used this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who crystallised the issue well. That is part of ensuring that the regulations are legitimate so that people accept and enforce them willingly, rather than feeling that they are being imposed from above. There should be at least some democratic control over the regulations.
<P>
The amendments have the twin aim of increasing the practicality of the regulations and the level of parliamentary scrutiny. On that basis, I commend them to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, we had a considerable debate this morning. I am sorry that you were unable to participate, Mr. Hood, although I am sure that all members of the Committee will tell you that it was comprehensive and exhaustive, if not exhausting. I made it clear in that debate that the Government have no wish to place the burden of regulation on businesses whose pollution is insignificant. Again, however, Parliament should not be required to decide matters case by case in advance.
<P>
We in Parliament are not well placed to make regulations about what is significantly offensive. Despite the slightly casual remark by the hon. Member for Ashford at the outset of today's proceedings, it is not appropriate for the House to make such a decision. How does one encapsulate in a regulation the awful stench that arises from a maggot farm? I am sorry to mention hikers in the presence of the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman)&#151;I am sure that they will find Billericay a wonderful place to walk over&#151;but how does one capture the offence that is caused to hikers or local people in the Peak district when they find that a stream has turned bright orange because of effluent from a dye works? The fact is that we cannot do so. The regulator must consider such issues case by case, following consultation with local people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford asked whether we ran the risk of regulation creep. As I understand that interesting phrase, it means that if we extend the existing parameters of regulations and set new ones, the regulations will somehow grow beyond them. They will not; they will be subject to consultation with local interests. If the Environment Agency sought to extend its regulatory powers beyond what is prescribed&#151;I do not believe for a moment that it would&#151;there is absolutely no question that local interests, including industry and small businesses in particular, would tell it where to get off.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, North): I want to draw my right hon. Friend's attention to an issue in my constituency, to which I referred in passing on Second Reading. It relates to the use of liquid condensate from a rendering plant as fertiliser on grazing land. We are talking about definitions. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the new powers of prevention will mean that smells that arise from that offensive practice can be dealt with in a wholly integrated way? If so, we will be able to consider not only the installation that produces the liquid condensate, but the smells, nuisance and harm that are caused in the surrounding areas. Is that not also an example of the issues that the amendment raises, with which we now need to deal in an integrated way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is a good example of the type of environmental pollution that the Bill covers. There is no doubt that immense discontent and aggravation can be experienced in residences close to some rendering plants. Some rendering plants are well organised, while others cause terrible odours that are detectable from a great distance. It is right that such plants should be regulated, not only in terms of the processes going on inside the building, but of their impact on the neighbourhood.
<P>
The question is whether Parliament should decide on the degree of offensiveness and whether that should be a matter for regulation. The current systems work via the regulator, who is subject to principles laid down by this House. He takes account of the circumstances of the installation concerned and consults widely with all the local interests, which are listed in clause 2(4). That is how the current systems work and that is how the new one will work. The definition comes from the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and it has worked well in practice.
<P>
I am not suggesting that the regulator makes arbitrary decisions. He is an experienced professional, whose decisons are informed by comprehensive guidance about what is the best available technique. He also takes account of local consultation. There is, and will always be, a right of appeal against the regulator's decision. There are many instances of such appeals being made, and in some cases succeeding.
<P>
I feared that the point might be raised that regulators would try to ban the normal smells that characterise the countryside. They hav not done so and there is no intention that they should do so.
<P>
To return to the point made by the Opposition, whom I am trying to meet half way, Parliament can, however, take a view on which processes are capable of causing significant enough offence to human senses to warrant regulation. That is what we are doing in the Bill, which will continue the practice under the 1990 Act whereby the list of industries or companies regulated can be added to or subtracted from by regulation subject to the negative procedure. However, it is then for the regulator to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether pollution is significantly offensive and warrants palliative measures. It would not be sensible to establish first, which those installations were, and then separately&#151;additionally&#151;how they were to be regulated in a further order, as the amendment seems to require.
<P>
I repeat the fears that I expressed in our first lengthy debate, that the amendment&#151;with which I have some sympathy&#151;would create a wholly unnecessary additional parliamentary stage before regulations dealing with the control of pollution could reach the statute book. it would place a restriction on the flexibility of the system&#151;although I am sure that that was not the intention behind it&#151;because Parliament would simply not be able to carry out those individual local consultations. The only way in which the system can operate properly is by having those fine and nice judgments made in the local neighbourhood.
<P>
The amendment would represent a retrograde step in the control of pollution. The system works and I would be the first to complain if it did not. As they say, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' I hope that, for those reasons, the hon. Member for Ashford will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> There is a definite point of agreement between the Minister and me, in that we now know where we disagree. He wants to put powers into the hands of the regulators, and we want to put powers into the hands of Parliament. No doubt the debate will continue. Scrutiny and practicality are important points of principle and I urge the Committee to support the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady:</B> (Altrincham and Sale, West): I do not wish to put myself in bad odour with the Committee by detaining it for long. I had not intended to speak on clause stand part, but a significant point has arisen on which the Minister may be able to put my mind at rest quickly.
<P>
The Committee rejected important amendments and the clause now refers in subsection (1)(b) to ``any environmental pollution''. Subsection (1)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise preventing or controlling emissions capable of causing any such pollution.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```environmental pollution' means pollution of the air''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and goes on to refer to ``any harm''.
<P>
That means any harm whatever, not significant harm, and includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pollution caused by noise, heat or vibrations''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on, but the clause seems not to be confined to emissions of energy and other pollutants may be significant. Subsection (3)(b)(iii) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other impairment of, or interference with, the ecological systems of which any living organisms form part''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and subsection (3)(e) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``impairment of, or interference with, amenities or other legitimate uses of the environment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister clarify whether the clause could apply to that other topical matter of which he is aware, genetically modified organisms, and whether pollen from GMOs blowing in the wind or being carried by insects to neighbouring fields of non-genetically modified or organic crops would be a pollutant. Clearly, there would be harm, within the Government's definition, to organic producers, who may no longer be able to certify their products as organic because they may have been cross-fertilised with genetically modified crops. Clearly, significant harm is being done&#151;and even if it is not significant, harm is being done&#151;because, within the terms of the clause, it impairs the legitimate uses of the environment to which organic farmers and others are entitled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend has been too kind to the Government and to the Bill. He corrected himself&#151;quite rightly&#151;by saying that any genetically modified organisms floating around the countryside need not cause significant harm, but need only to be capable of causing harm. Considering that much of the scientific argument concerns whether they are capable of causing harm, there would seem to be a significant widening of the powers, which is why I believe that parts of the Bill are undesirably drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend's comments. As far as I can see from the Bill, if an organic substance can count as a pollutant for these purposes, it is difficult to see why pollen cannot. If, as my hon. Friend said, there is the capacity for harm to be done, and for impairment of, or interference with, amenities or other legitimate uses of the environment, then farm-scale trials of genetically modified organisms could and should be regulated by the Bill. I do not want to delay the Committee, but I would very much welcome some clarification and assurance from the Minister on that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is certainly an interesting proposition, and one that had not previously occurred to me, but having taken advice on the matter, the answer is, rather surprisingly, that theoretically such practices could be regulated, although I think that, for reasons that I am about to mention, it would be an extremely perverse and obscure way of regulating genetic modification.
<P>
The primary purpose of the Bill is to regulate the effects of large installations, as we have regularly stated, but the Government have tabled an amendment to include controlling activities, as well as installations and plant, and I suppose that, technically, the effects of pollination from GM crops could be regulated on that basis. It is a long shot, but they could be construed as falling within that category. However, although I am well known for wanting proper regulation of genetic modification, the means to do so is unquestionably through the European directive 92/20, which is currently being revised, and through the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Releases) Regulations 1992. Those regulations enable action to be taken where evidence can be adduced that there is a risk to human health or the environment.
<P>
As the MP for Altrincham and Sale, West knows, the Government have set up the farm-scale evaluations precisely to provide the detailed and systematic evidence that is not yet available about the impact on the environment&#151;on invertebrates, insects and bird populations&#151;and we will make that information available. That is unquestionably the route by which regulation should take place, and it would be extremely odd if it was brought within the purview of the Bill. None the less, I am advised that, theoretically, that is a possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his advice on the matter. In that case, will he confirm that, if the EU directives do not provide sufficient powers for the Government to regulate the planting of GM crops, the Bill will provide an avenue through which this or a subsequent Government could regulate that activity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is extremely unlikely. We have a full opportunity to revise the 92/20 directive, in whatever way member states see fit, at the Environment Council of the European Union next week. It would be odd to use another piece of legislation, especially one which has a different purpose, to fill in the gaps. It is far better to design the appropriate legislation so that it meets its full purpose. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West has been ingenious; I did not expect to have to give this answer. It is exceedingly unlikely that the Bill will be used in the way that he suggested. [Interruption.] One is always receiving new information.
<P>
In theory, the 1990 Act could also regulate GMO processes, although that, too, would be an odd way to proceed. The cultivation of GM crops falls within the 1990 Act, but apart from the interesting and highly intellectual discussions in Committee, the obvious way to regulate GM crops is to apply the European directive in the United Kingdom. We must ensure that the gaps in the directive are dealt with next week so that the regulatory mechanism for GM crops is complete.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sure that the Minister is right to say that the best way to proceed is to act coherently. Nevertheless, what he said was significant. He knows that organic farmers have complained that their crops have been damaged and made non-organic by pollution from GM crops. By saying that it is theoretically possible to regulate GM crops under the 1990 Act, the Minister is telling organic farmers that they have a new means of redress, perhaps against a regulator who, theoretically, could have prevented the damage from occurring. Given the passions involved in the argument, regulators may have to intervene because there will, I am sure, be complaints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> This matter is topical. One of today's newspapers highlighted the report of the John Innes Centre, which has researched adequate protections for organic farming. We are reviewing that problem. As I said recently in the House, it is difficult to fine-tune the argument. According to traditional farming practice, the appropriate distance for providing protection for 99.5 per cent.&#151;it may be as much as 99.9 per cent.&#151;of oil seed rape pollen dispersal is 200 metres. However, the Soil Association's revised rules say that that distance should be six miles. There is a substantial difference between those distances. The Government are having to look at what is appropriate. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pollen grains are dispersed. Unusual weather conditions&#151;notably, high winds&#151;mean that it is hard to be certain that there is total protection, even with a distance of six miles. It is a difficult issue.
<P>
Organic farmers want to be able to tell the public that their products are non GM, as that is what those who buy organic products want. That is their case. If those farmers felt aggrieved by the final result of discussions between the two trade bodies&#151;the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops and the UK register of organic farms&#151;they should seek redress not through the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the integrated pollution prevention and control directive or the transposed Act, but simply on the grounds that their commercial interests were being damaged, and that the Government could be subject to judicial review for failing to protect them adequately.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>

<P>
I give the Opposition enormous credit for stretching credibility by bringing genetic modification into our discussion of the Bill, which is far removed from that issue as is possible. Taking such connections further belongs more in the world of ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Clause 2 takes us to heart of the Bill, as it confers powers on the Secretary of State to enforce the regulations. There have already been some preliminary skirmishes on the issue of parliamentary scrutiny in this Committee. Clause 2 gives the Secretary of State an enormous raft of powers; there is considerable scope for improvement, which the amendments would provide.
<P>
The Government should make it clear how much power they will take for themselves, not only in the initial stages of the application of the transposed directive, but in future. We assume that the new regime is likely to last longer than the previous one. We have moved from national regulation to European regulation, and, if I may say so in the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay, we must assume that regulation on a European scale will continue.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Teresa Gorman </B>(Billericay): It is a pity that you have not been here all day, Mr. Hood, as it is difficult to resist the temptation to lampoon the Bill and all its ridiculous implications. In this country, under common law, cannot people with such grievances&#151;most of which are busybody matters&#151;take them to the local courts for a magistrate to resolve? Notwithstanding his toleration of European regulations, does my hon. Friend agree that most of the matters being debated today could be resolved under our intrinsic, good old English legislation and law, without leave to introduce legislation that ties everybody up in knots and allows people to get busybody inspectors to do their dirty work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend to the extent that most cases are clearly local and, although they need to be decided within a wider framework of law, they could be decided locally. One of the aims of many of the amendments has been to avoid including trivialities in regulation. Much of the large-scale pollution with which the Bill deals is inevitably cross-border. My hon. Friend will know as well as I do about the figures that are quoted on the amount of pollution that arrives on our coastline from other countries, and the amount of acid rain that lands on other countries as a result of coal being burned here. 
<P>
Of all the issues on which there is clearly a European locus, environmental protection has always seemed to me to be the most obvious; it is entirely reasonable that there should be Europe-wide legislation in this sphere. I agree with my hon. Friend that that makes it all the more important that there should be a proper degree of scrutiny by the British Parliament of the regulations and laws that will apply to British people. That is not a theoretical point&#151;it is very practical. One of the most important aspects of regulation is that it must be legitimate. If people feel that their lives are being changed, or their businesses damaged, by an arbitrary power over which they have no proper redress, they will begin to resent it and then try to evade it. That is particularly unhelpful in respect of environmental protection.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that future parliamentary scrutiny is proper and powerful. There is some instructive history in that respect in the Bill's passage through another place. I concede that the Bill has progressed: the Government started off with a bad set of proposals, which got better every time their lordships got their teeth out and bit it. However, the process has not yet gone far enough, which is why we are trying to make further improvements in Committee.
<P>
For example, the amendments would extend to all the regulations the privilege that the Government have deigned to allow to the first regulations that will be debated under the clause. I am waiting to hear what the Minister has to say about the rationale of allowing one regime of scrutiny for the first regulations and another for future regulations&#151;beyond the fact, of course, that it is administratively convenient. We have already heard too much today from the Government about the impracticality of Opposition proposals, but no admission that the basis of their desire to retain the Bill's existing wording is simple administrative convenience. For reasons that I have already rehearsed, that is democratically unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will devote some time to explaining why it is proper to have one type of scrutiny for the first set of regulations and weaker scrutiny thereafter.
<P>
During the Bill's passage in another place, protests were made by agricultural and industrial bodies, as well as their lordships, and a degree of consultation has consequently been introduced. The Secretary of State will be required to consult before regulations are made. In answer to the question, ``Is that enough?'', I would say that it is not. Although such consultation is a necessary condition for ensuring appropriate and sensible regulation, it is not a sufficient on its own. Parliament is able to bring to bear a wider perspective, and that must happen. Otherwise, one may well ask what we are doing here. To some extent, the Minister sold the pass this morning, when he responded to a previous group of amendments by saying that small businesses that were worried about the matter could talk to their Members of Parliament about it. The problem is that if their Members of Parliament have no input into the regulatory procedure, those businesses are wasting their breath&#151;breathing out in a polluting way, thus breaking the terms of the Bill. Under the Bill's provisions, there will be no point in hon. Members making representations. However, certain corporate bodies will be allowed to represent themselves to Ministers, which in itself creates an imbalance.
<P>
It is clear that the big boys&#151;those who are involved in large industries or groups of large industries&#151;who have professional trade associations and are tuned in to the business of government will do better out of this than small businesses; they know how to play the Whitehall game, when to intervene and what language to use. One knows of instances of big companies in an industry using environmental regulations to try to damage small companies in the same industry. It is always easier for big companies to adapt. If the regulations can be written in a way that suits their purposes, then for perfectly understandable commercial reasons, that is what tends to happen. It is often the small businesses&#151;which may be collected together in federations but which tend by definition not to have spare staff for lobbying&#151;that look to their MPs, as well as to their federations, to lobby on their behalf. Part of our purpose in seeking to introduce the various safeguards in this group of amendments is to allow Members of Parliament to fulfill their proper function of representing the interests of their business constituents.
<P>
I urge the Minister to take these arguments seriously. The Bill will set the structure of pollution control possibly for decades to come, and it would be a bad day for both Parliament and the long-term control of pollution if in a few years the system that we set up produces great hostility because there are insufficient outlets for a proper representation of interests before regulations are introduced.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for Ashford raised a serious issue and made a careful argument. However, the amendments would replace the carefully thought out provisions governing parliamentary procedure on regulations made under the Bill with a blanket requirement for the affirmative resolution procedure. It is difficult to justify any such proposal when the Government have already conceded a more rigorous parliamentary procedure than even the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation recommended. I hope that the hon. Gentleman heard that. This was an issue of major concern in another place; I accept that the Government made several concessions, but the Select Committee's second report accepted as adequate what we proposed.
<P>
Perhaps the reasons for the amendments have their provenance in Second Reading, for which the hon. Member for Ashford was not present. I was questioned carefully about the combined effect of clause 2(7) and (9). In particular, I was asked to give an explanation of subsection (7), which I did. If I take the opportunity to clarify the position again, the hon. Gentleman may accept that there is no need to press the amendments to a vote.
<P>
I accept that the wording of some of these provisions, especially that of clause 2(7), is pretty dense&#151;not to say impenetrable&#151;but I shall try to give a sensible explanation of the meaning. Clause 2(9) contains a list of types of regulations to which, by virtue of clause 2(8), the affirmative resolution procedure must be applied; I think that the hon. Member for Ashford understood that. The first group comprises the first set of regulations made in England, Scotland and Wales, on the basis that the first set is a framework and subsequent regulations would deal with changes that are likely to be minor. The second group are regulations that create a criminal offence or increase the penalty for an existing offence, and regulations that amend or repeal any provision of an Act, such as the 1990 Act.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am happy to confirm that nothing in clause 2(7) affects the fact that all types of regulation listed in clause 2(9) will have to be subject to the affirmative procedure. The point is complicated and must be seen as a whole. Subsection 7 will provide that regulations not subject to the affirmative procedure must follow the negative resolution procedure.
<P>
The purpose of the arrangement is to provide a choice of procedure&#151;of either the affirmative or the negative resolution&#151;where regulations do not fall into one of the categories listed under subsection 9, for which I repeat the affirmative procedure is mandatory. Regulations not covered by that subsection can, therefore, be dealt with under either the affirmative or the negative procedure. Although it is not easy to understand simply by looking, the language of the Bill is saying that regulations not put through the affirmative procedure must be dealt with under the negative procedure.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will not find it strange that we have such a choice of procedure.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait (Beckenham):</B> I hope that I do not throw a stone in the pond and I understand how complex the matter is, which is why I was happy to listen to what the Minister was saying, but can I go back to the point about deregulation that I made this morning? I am interested in whether measures under clause 2(9)(e), concerning the repeal of any provision, would go under the affirmative procedure, or whether the deregulation procedure would come into play. I also wonder whether those two procedures interact, whether one substitutes for another, or whether the deregulation process is to be ignored. I would like guidance and am happy to wait for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I can give guidance immediately. Clause 2(9)(e) is covered by what I have been saying generally about subsection 9. All regulations made under paragraphs (a) to (e) inclusive are subject to the affirmative procedure.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does that include deregulation measures?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Deregulation is a separate process. We are talking about the making of regulations&#151;that is the point of clause 2(9)(e).
<P>
I was making a point about choice. The proposal is not without precedent. I am not sure about how much detail I should go into on that matter, but there are precedents in the European Communities Act 1972, under which regulations can be made using either procedure. It is entirely appropriate to have a similar choice for regulations made under the Bill to which clause 2(9) does not apply.
<P>
We have given an important commitment about when we shall use the affirmative procedure when we have the choice. My noble Friend Lord Whitty said in another place:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any amendments to the regulations which affect matters which were previously included on the face of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 will be put to Parliament for consideration under the affirmative procedure.''&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 May 1999; Vol. 600, c. 1392.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I repeat his words, as I did on Second Reading, because I am happy to endorse them. I hope, therefore, that the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady&#151;they are a different hon. Gentleman and hon. Lady, but one can still use the covering phrase&#151;were intended to allow me to elucidate how the procedure for making regulations under the Bill will work and to provide me with yet another opportunity to repeat the pledge about when we will use the affirmative procedure. I cannot believe that the Opposition seriously expect the Government to adopt the amendments, which would clutter up Parliament with unnecessary debate about what in most&#151;although not all&#151;cases will be trivial changes to the regulations. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Ashford will be content to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> One phrase of the Minister's, resonated rather ominously. He said that the first regulations would set up the framework and that future regulations were likely to be minor. We can all recognise Whitehall drafting when it is read out loud and not fed through anything. The Minister's remark struck me as simply not being true. Most of the regulations will be minor, but some will be major. Frameworks will have to change, and science will alter over time. There will be some major changes and I am sure that we all accept that. The Minister is delving into dangerous territory.
<P>
I do not want to delay the Committee with a vote on the matter. I assure the Minister that there will be great interest in whether an appropriate level of scrutiny is maintained as the provisions are put into practice. This will continue to be an important matter in terms of the respect in which Parliament is held. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider amendment No. 7, in schedule 3, page 11, line 23, column 3, leave out `Sections 1 to 28'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The issue that amendment No. 7 raises is especially serious. Indeed, it is one ratchet up from previous issues that we have discussed. For the past few minutes, we have discussed which form of secondary legislative procedure we should worry about. At the heart of amendment No. 7 is a desire to keep as many provisions as is appropriate within primary legislation.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the Government from replacing 28 sections&#151;a very large part&#151;of the 1990 Act and to have regulation instead of primary legislation. Quite apart from the symbolic aspect, there is the practical question of whether the legislation can be amended.
<P>
I should make one point to the Minister. Among the sections of the 1990 Act that schedule 3 would remove is a list of criminal offences. It is an extremely dubious practice to deal with such offences in regulations rather than in primary legislation. I know that it is not unprecedented, but it is rare and, if at all possible, the Government should avoid it.
<P>
It was noteworthy in the debate on this matter in the other place that standard procedures inside the Department were gone through and precedents were sought for when the Conservative Government had done something similar. The best example that anyone could come up with went back to the Superannuation Act 1972. The fact that the best example that could be produced was 26 years old shows how rare a procedure it is, and for perfectly good reasons&#151;it is not a good procedure. We should not lightly repeal primary legislation dealing with matters such as the creation of criminal offences; furthermore, we should try not to allow secondary legislation to create criminal offences.
<P>
The noble Lord Renton, who has had a distinguished career in both Houses, said in the debate on this issue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This is the most far reaching example of legislation by reference replacing primary legislation. There is no precedent for doing so on this scale except in time of war''.&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 19 April 1999; Vol. 599, c. 974.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot quote from the other place, unless he is referring to a Government Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Hood. I shall paraphrase Lord Renton. He said that the Government were using this sort of legislation to transfer matters of great national concern from primary to secondary legislation in ways that were unprecedented except in time of war. Lord Renton knows what he is talking about. He was in the House of Commons for a long time and he has been in the other place a while now. I hope that the Minister takes his words seriously, whether they are quoted directly but improperly or indirectly and, I hope, properly.
<P>
Clearly, wider issues are involved. We are talking not only about the competence and practicality of the Bill, but also about the way in which Parliament operates. As we have said, this is possibly the most important point about scrutiny that we can make. The biggest divide between the various types of procedures in this House is precisely that divide between primary and secondary legislation. The Bill is full of Henry VIII clauses, which allow the Government large amounts of power. We all know that there is an increasing trend for such legislation which, if the general public took more interest in the details of our affairs&#151;though who can blame them for not doing so in this case&#151;they would probably find it very disturbing.
<P>
It falls to us as parliamentarians to exercise a check on ourselves and not to introduce too much legislation that requires secondary procedures, because they deny the right of amendment to parliamentarians. We must stick to what people understand to be law making&#151;that is the heart of it. People understand what making law and breaking the law is about. They would find it slightly dubious if they thought that law was being made not by Parliament sitting and voting, but by secondary regulation which is drawn up at a level that they neither particularly understand nor sympathise with.
<P>
I shall limit myself to speaking to the amendment, but I hope that the Minister recognises the seriousness of the case that we are making. This is an inappropriate use for secondary legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I shall limit my comments to clause 2 stand part. I understand the official Opposition's concerns about granting powers to the Secretary of State&#151;the Liberal Democrats have raised that issue in many other debates, including those on the Greater London Authority Bill. In this case, however, the need for action and concerns about the deliberation and delays that might arise as a result of the Opposition's amendments tip the balance in favour of clause 2 and the Government's proposals. I shall therefore support the clause.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale):</B> First, it is wonderful to see you in the Chair Mr. Hood. It is my first opportunity since becoming a Minister to have that privilege. I hope that by the end of my short speech, you will think as warmly of me. Having worked on the subject for almost as short a period as the hon. Member for Ashford, at times I feel like a train driver's assistant stepping into the breach for a colleague. As I listened to the hon. Gentleman's speech, I realised with some trepidation that I was going to be in the same position in a few minutes.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall clarify some of the points that were made and, as well as urging hon. Members to resist amendment No. 7, I shall recommend that the clause stands part.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 addresses the very nature of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Ashford pointed out, it would prevent the repeal of part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and thus, in the Government's opinion, leave the United Kingdom with a ragbag of incoherent pollution control regimes. The amendment also raises a question to which the hon. Member for Ashford referred throughout his speech: whether it is ever right to replace primary legislation with regulations. I am afraid that the answer that I must give is that it depends; sometimes it is clearly a sensible and practical course.
<P>
Our proposal is certainly not without precedent. The hon. Gentleman said that he expected precedents to be cited and I can give him one. The Superannuation Act 1972 replaced part I of the Local Government Superannuation Act 1937, which dealt with the superannuation of local government employees, with a wide enabling power. The detailed, complex and frequently changing matters that the earlier Act addressed are now dealt with by regulations.
<P>
We must remember that we are not debating the principle of regulation&#151;after all, regulation is regulation whether it is in primary legislation or not. As we all know, however, a set of regulations is a much more flexible instrument than a piece of primary legislation. When dealing with complex and evolving issues, as in this case, regulations can be adapted, rectified and improved as the need arises, rather than at a point dictated by the legislative timetable. It is clearly in the interests of those being regulated that any problems can be resolved and improvements made as expeditiously as possible.
<P>
It is therefore not right to oppose, as a matter of course, the replacement of primary legislation with regulations. What is important, and what the Committee must consider today, is whether proper parliamentary control is retained in the process. In that regard, when the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation considered the Bill in the light of amendments that the Government tabled in another place, it agreed&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Yes, but perhaps I may first finish this point.
<P>
The Committee agreed that sufficient parliamentary control was retained over the regulations. Clause 2 makes it clear that the regulations will be subject to affirmative procedure when they are first time made, as will any subsequent amendments that increase offences, add new offences or repeal primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister's flow, but I note that he gave the same precedent as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. Will he enlighten the Committee by giving other precedents subsequent to the Superannuation Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am sure that I will have the opportunity to do so in the course of my address, if I am interpreting the rustle of papers correctly. While I am waiting to obtain the information that the hon. Gentleman seeks, I will continue with my speech.
<P>
Nevertheless, even given those safeguards, Lord Whitty went further. He pointed out that the Secretary of State would have a choice of procedure when making other amendments to the regulations and gave an undertaking, which the Government repeated on Second Reading, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``any amendments to the regulations which affect matters which were previously included on the face of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 will be put to Parliament for consideration under the affirmative procedure.''&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 May 1999; Vol. 600, c. 1391-2.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are thus retaining proper parliamentary control, while allowing the flexibility to improve the regulations in the light of future experience. The Opposition appear to want to lumber industry with incoherence and inflexibility, and I therefore urge them to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Before I finish, I shall deal with a couple of points that were raised. If I cannot recall another example during the course of the next two or three minutes, I promise the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West that I shall reply to him during the course of the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford said that the Government should not create offences by regulation. The House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee noted that point, and said that changes that increase offences or add new ones should be made by affirmative procedures. That is what we have done, thus providing the proper safeguards. The hon. Gentleman said that it is wrong to create criminal offences by regulation. However, I remind him that that happens all the time. One example is that of the Water Industry Act 1991, and the Environment Act 1995 also includes such powers. Having said that, I ask the Committee to agree that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I shall be intrigued to discover whether he and his officials find anything useful to send in a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, because I suspect that they will find that 1972 was the last time that this was done on a large scale. That will reinforce my point that it is extremely rare, and that the Bill could achieve the same effect in other ways. It is undesirable, and I am sure that we shall want to return to the matter at a later stage of our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned&#151;[Mr. Allen.]
