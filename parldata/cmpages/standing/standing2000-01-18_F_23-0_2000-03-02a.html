<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I was winding up.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> I am still amazed about that wallet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) mentions my wallet which is reasonably bulky but, as she can see, contains nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): It may contain food vouchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> As my hon. Friend said, it might contain food vouchers, which I would use to buy fruit.
<P>
I was about to give the Under-Secretary time to reply this morning as I thought that we were going on until half-past 11. I remind Committee members that we were discussing when the provision comes into force. As I said, we fight a civil war on such matters to ensure that Bills do not introduce arbitrary taxation before they are enacted. I was hurt by the suggestion that Conservative Members are cavaliers, as I have always regarded myself as being on Cromwell's side. I have no doubt on what side I would have fought to get rid of those tyrants, the Stuarts.
<P>
Why is the provision being implemented before the Bill is enacted? Matters are not usually handled like that.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> This morning, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), referred to social security matters. However, in some respects, that is not an accurate description. For example, in speaking to the clauses, I am representing my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.
<P>
National insurance contributions are the exclusive concern of the Inland Revenue and are no longer a matter for the Department of Social Security. The Parliament Act 1911 prevents such matters being included in Finance Bills and we are not in the business of suggesting that it be amended. Therefore, there is a vehicle for implementing the Bill, which is essential to prevent a separate Bill from being introduced. However, the hon. Gentleman raised a perfectly legitimate point, as Royal Assent will be given to the Bill after 6 April, the date on which the provisions are intended to take effect.
<P>
This morning, I mentioned a document in an information pack sent to all employers. About 1.25 million such packs have been produced and the document clearly states that the national insurance provision is subject to the passage of the Bill, giving employers the chance to make preparations.
<P>
The crunch, however, comes in a related matter. The last Budget made provision for a series of changes to the national insurance system and we have produced a draft publication on that. The first returns are not required to be sent to the Revenue until July 2001. The provisions do not come into force until early April 2001 and there is full financial year to go before we reach that date. The deadline for submitting P11D is much earlier than that for the self assessment to which I referred this morning.
<P>
Business itself want us to align national insurance and tax as far as possible. We do not believe that the provision will cause problems for employers. I do not regard Bill's legislative proposals as being retrospective. Anyone who promotes retrospective proposals must be careful about what they are doing, and be sure of why they are doing it. Retrospectivity basically means announcing a change to what went on prior to any announcement ever having been made. These legislative proposals are not retrospective. They were announced last year. The Bill is now in its Committee stage and will become effective within the year. The necessary forms will not have to be completed until the end of the next financial year. Delaying for a further year would make a complete mess of other national insurance changes. Many of the details will be in regulations and must be operative from the beginning of the tax year; that cannot happen half way through. Consultation has taken place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I accept much of what the right hon. Gentleman says and understand the general effect. I am more concerned about the procedural and constitutional effect. With the Budget, there is a process of moving a series of resolutions to bring provisions into effect before the Finance Bill goes through the House. Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that that mechanism cannot be used for these items? If he is, will he explain why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is a good question. It is not possible to use that mechanism, and I am unable to explain the reason. It has something to do with the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, under which the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when making announcements on the Budget, can bring in tax changes that day, usually at 6 pm. The authority for that comes from the 1968 Act. However, the Ways and Means Resolutions, all 40 or 50 of which are quite specific, are carried at the end of the Budget debate. I have served on only two Finance Bill Committees, and I cannot remember the technicalities. After the first, there was a bit of a gap before I was allowed to be a member of the second. I led for the Opposition on the latter, so I was back in favour. Also, Finance Bills usually are not given Royal Assent until the summer, by which time we are a quarter of the way through the financial year anyway, and if there are changes in say, personal allowances, over and above those already in place, they go back to the beginning of the financial year. No one ever complains about that. The nature of the beast that is the Finance Bill is such that, by and large, their lordships do not amend it. But the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act—the instrument that can give the Chancellor the power to bring in measures immediately, if he chooses to do so—does not cover national insurance contributions. That is one of the difficulties. These clauses are, in a way, in the Bill for reasons of parliamentary and legislative convenience. Treasury Ministers do not have another Bill around, and the clauses cannot go into the Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is being honest and I am grateful for that. But we do not understand why this cannot be done by Ways and Means Resolutions, and we should like to know the reason. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will undertake to have someone write to us so that it is on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am more than happy to do that. As a parliamentarian, I am uncomfortable about it. The Treasury knows that it has only one Bill each year, the Finance Bill, in which to deal with finance. On account of the changes that have been made whereby national insurance goes to the Treasury and into the Inland Revenue, different rules apply. The rules of procedure and Standing Orders are different, as are the rules for the Second Reading of a Finance Bill. The 10 o'clock rule does not apply. No changes are made in the House of Lords. The Treasury now has responsibility for these measures and changes for which there would not usually be a vehicle may be required from time to time. So in that respect there has to be a more satisfactory arrangement. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman and to other members of the Committee explaining why there is a difficulty and, I hope, what we will do in the future. There may not be a social security Bill every year, even if such changes are required. There must be a normal vehicle for these changes and if it is not a Finance Bill there must be another procedure that does not short-cut other scrutiny procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has been more than reasonable. We were considering dividing the Committee on the amendment because the matter is so important, but the Minister disarmed us. We ask that he is kind enough to impress on the parliamentary draftsmen that a proposal should be drafted as quickly as is reasonably possible because we want to be clear about it before Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, it will be produced before Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> On that basis, and on the clear evidence that the right hon. Gentleman is a member of the Cromwell appreciation society, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> This group of amendments tidies up the child support part of the repeals schedule. It is normal practice to repeal provisions in Acts that are made redundant by a repeal or substitution in a Bill, and schedule 7 does that. Detailed scrutiny of legislation with links to the Child Support Act 1991 has resulted in the amendments. They add to schedule 7 by repealing measures contained in child support and other legislation, for example, references to the Jobseekers Act 1995, the Social Security Act 1998 and the Social Security (Consequential Provisions) Act 1992. Those additional repeals will ensure that the Bill works as we intend it to, and that redundant measures in other Acts are repealed. I urge the Committee to accept the amendments.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following Government amendments: Nos. 357, 358, 360 to 362, Government new clauses 31 to 33 and Government new schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> New clause 31 and new schedule 2 would align the arrangements for local authority decision-taking on housing benefit and council tax benefit claims with those in other social security benefits. They would also provide the recipients of those benefits with rights of appeal to an independent appeals tribunal if they were unhappy with a decision taken on their benefit claim. We propose to introduce the changes from April 2001.
<P>
The measure is an important part of our aim to modernise delivery of social security benefit. Although administered by local authorities, housing benefit and council tax benefit are similar in many ways to income support and jobseeker's allowance. About two thirds of people getting help with rent or council tax by means of these benefits also receive income support and jobseeker's allowance. At present, the arrangements for challenging local authority decisions on housing benefit and council tax benefit claims are different from those for all other benefits. Harmonising the arrangements would therefore be sensible.
<P>
We have successfully completed a phased introduction of new decision-taking in appeals procedures across the rest of social security benefits. The provisions would simply extend them to council tax and housing tax benefit. Taken together, the proposals will provide clear and consistent rights across the benefits system, with easy access to the appeals procedure and at the same time streamline decision-making services to people who apply for, or receive, benefits.
<P>
Amendment No. 358 and new clauses 32 and 33 are consequential on the amendments which provide for a new appeals structure for housing benefit and council tax benefit decisions. Those benefits are determined in accordance with the legislative framework which sets out the rules of entitlement.
<P>
The amendments enable local authorities to provide additional financial help to recipients of those benefits. They give local authorities discretion to consider making additional payments. The amendments enable a flexible arrangement but provide the framework within which local authorities should operate when considering whether, to whom and for how long to make discretionary payments, and the level of such payments. As they are close to their clients and aware of local housing conditions, local authorities are best placed to judge the circumstances of a request for further financial help. They are also in the best position to offer advice on rents and the availability of local accommodation.
<P>
The clauses provide a framework within which local authorities should consider these discretionary payments. For example, to ensure that local authorities act prudently in exercising their discretion, a financial limit will be set on the overall amount that they will be able to spend in any one year.
<P>
The Government will contribute towards the overall limit; regulations will also specify, among other things, the way in which people should apply for discretionary payments, how local authorities should deal with those claims and how local authorities should gather information that they need to take decisions. They will specify the maximum amount of such help to ensure that additional help does not exceed the rent or council tax liability.
<P>
The provisions also enable regulations to provide for decisions to be reviewed. They provide a framework for a scheme in which local authorities may decide to make payments to people who, because of circumstances beyond their control, cannot afford their housing costs. As a matter of course, we shall consult local authority associations and the Council on Tribunals on the necessary regulations and on implementation of the proposals.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 357, 358, 362 and 364 are technical amendments covering commencement, transitional arrangements and consequential repeals. I commend the proposals to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady mentioned the consultation process for local authorities. I am not sure whether I welcome these or not because much will depend on what is in the regulations and how they are brought about.
<P>
On the basis of good faith, the extra flexibility offered to local authorities is a good thing. It will depend very much on what that regime looks like. I have already had preliminary discussions with local authorities and a series of issues might sensibly be raised, but I suspect it would be more sensible to do that once the regulations are laid. I do not intend to detain the Committee, but it might be useful to get on the record when the Minister expects to be able to give us an idea what the regulations will look like?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The regulations will be similar to those that exist for the other benefits. We are aligning these two benefits, which have not had the administrative arrangements or appeal rights before, with the system put in place by the Social Security Act 1998, which introduced the decision-making and appeals system for the other benefits. There is a list of existing legislation with respect to tribunal appeal rights that the hon. Gentleman can look at to get a pretty good idea of what we will draw up in detail for these two benefits. There is no intention to put broadly different administrative arrangements in place.
<P>
There are already discretionary arrangements for local authorities to pay discretionary extra amounts. Our consultation with the appropriate local authority organisations will discuss current practice, as well as the caps, limits and structures within which the local authorities will be expected to run their system. We expect to start consulting as soon as possible after Royal Assent. There is a quite strict timetable for introducing these new appeal rights and getting them in place in the 409 local authorities by April 2001. We need to get on with it.
<P>
Clearly, the local authorities know what worked with their current discretionary schemes and know how to operate them. We are not trying to create a big disjunction with past practice but merely to transfer the whole system across to one appeal rights system. We will therefore translate, in a reasonable way, the discretionary rights and build a structure of which everyone can be certain, rather than the patchwork structure that has built up with the current arrangements. Obviously we will have more detailed discussions about this when the relevant regulations come before the House. We are in the process of setting up user groups consisting of local authority practitioners and other interested parties to discuss the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised in detail. The consultation will be ongoing and open and Parliament can discuss these issues in much more detail when the regulations are in front of us.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 67, line 5, leave out `section 23' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sections 18 and 23'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 79, in page 67, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The provisions of section 18 of this Act—
<P>
(a) shall not come into effect until 1 October 2006 at the earliest; and
<P>
(b) may only be brought into effect upon the Secretary of State having laid a report before Parliament setting out the reasons why the introduction of section 18 is necessary.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 80, in page 67, line 18, leave out `subsection (2)' and insert `subsections (2) or (2A)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> We can be brief as we are touching again on the subject that we have already debated thoroughly. The purpose of the amendments is simply, despite the present proposal in subsection (2), to be more specific about not bringing in the implementation of the benefit penalty until at least 2006. That date has been used because it will be the end date of the phasing in period, during which new assessments are fully implemented, at least according to the answers that have been provided so far.
<P>
Temporary suspension of the benefit penalty was also recommended by the Social Security Committee while the new system was phased in to assess whether incentives alone were successful in achieving higher compliance. We debated that earlier and the general view was that we needed an opportunity to ascertain whether the incentives worked before the penalty system is brought into play. Paragraph 94 on page 31 of the Select Committee report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We want the new incentives to be given a chance to work. We therefore recommend that application of the reduced penalty should be suspended during the phasing-in period and assess whether the incentives alone are successful in achieving higher compliance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That follows through what is proposed more vaguely in subsection (2). Will the Minister make it clear that he does not intend to implement the benefit penalties too early?
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee by referring to a sheath of case studies showing that the parent with care would be severely affected by the disclosure of the name of the child's father. We debated that earlier in relation to fear of domestic violence and other unsatisfactory social consequences for the child. I shall not go into the detail of relevant case studies now, but I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment would delay commencement of clause 18, which provides a benefit penalty for parents with care on income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who choose to prevent child support arrangements being made for their children. The penalty is to be applied only when the parent with care opts out without good cause—an important aspect of the arrangements. We have already had a lengthy debate on these matters, which I do not wish to repeat. However, the hon. Gentleman should remember that the provision cannot be applied when child support arrangements would lead to harm or undue distress. The good cause provisions will help to avoid many of the circumstances to which he alluded.
<P>
The amendment would make it impossible to impose any sanction on parents who, without good cause, choose to rely on benefits funded by the taxpayer rather than allow the Child Support Agency to ensure that the non-resident parent provides proper support for the children. In effect, that would make an application for child support entirely voluntary, giving the lone parent on benefit the choice of whether to involve the CSA or be supported by the taxpayer, as was the norm in pre-CSA days.
<P>
We believe that clause 18, which substitutes a new section 46 of the 1991 Act, should be introduced when the Act comes into force for a number of reasons. First, parents have a responsibility to support their children, and the benefit system should only step in when they are unable to do so. That is why parents with care who claim income support are normally expected to assist in arranging child support for their children.
<P>
Through improved closer working between the Benefits Agency and Child Support Agency, the number of parents with care co-operating with the Child Support Agency has dramatically increased. However, the fact remains that several parents with care refuse to co-operate in seeking child support for their children without good reason. That is why we need to retain a penalty provision. It would be unfair on children if we did not have effective means of ensuring that those parents do not unreasonably prevent the recovery of child support on their behalf. It would also be unfair on parents who support their children and on the taxpayer.
<P>
Of course, we want to avoid imposing a benefit penalty wherever we can. By making changes to simplify the relationship between claiming income support for a child and the commencement of child support action, we are sending a clear signal to parents that maintenance is not an optional extra.
<P>
Parents who have good cause not to seek child support will, of course, be protected as now. There will be no question of any benefit penalty being applied. Parents who have good cause will have no reduction in their benefit. As now, a good cause will be defined as a situation in which there are reasonable grounds to believe that there would be a risk of a person or any child living with that person suffering harm or undue distress if the Secretary of State pursued child support.
<P>
I am aware that the Select Committee on Social Security expressed the view in its tenth report that the reduced benefit penalty should be suspended during the phasing-in period, to assess whether the provisions in the new scheme are successful in achieving higher compliance. As we explained in our response to that report, we see no need to wait to introduce the provisions, which have been in place for a number of years and are an important tool in ensuring that parents face up to their responsibilities. We will evaluate the impact of all the reforms, including reduced benefit decisions.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 78, 79 and 80 would prevent the Secretary of State from imposing reduced benefit decisions until he has provided a report to justify the introduction of clause 18. The implementation of the amendments would slow down the recovery of maintenance for children and would remove parents' responsibility to support their children, which would totally contradict the aim of the new child support system. By definition, the new child maintenance premium could not go to parents who had opted out of child support, so the incentive would not be there if they could choose. The reforms are a package and need to be introduced together, so I urge the Committee to reject the amendment
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. As she acknowledged, we discussed the issue of good cause on clause 18. Important judgments will be made about whether the definitions that will be used by the Secretary of State to define what is good cause will adequately cover all circumstances.
<P>
The amendment was intended to be probing. We may want to return to the matter on Report to debate it alongside the points raised on clause 18, because the broad statements that have been made would not cover several circumstances. Despite the Under-Secretary's honourable assurances, it is right to reconsider the issue to ensure that we get it right. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 315, in page 67, line 6, after `Part II' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and section (Sharing of state scheme rights).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new clause 22—Sharing of state scheme rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I apologise to the Committee; the amendment is purely the result of an oversight in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 in connection with the sharing of state scheme pension rights on divorce or annulment of marriage. We always intended to delegate the responsibility for calculating the cash value of SERPS to the Government Actuary. However, the general regulation-making power in section 49(4) of the Act is not sufficient, and we need a specific sub-delegation power.
<P>
Pension sharing on divorce will not be introduced until the regulations come into force, so it will not be possible to take advantage of the changes. The regulations will not come into force until about the end of the year, so some time remains. It is a complex matter, as hon. Members who served on the Committee that considered the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill will appreciate—I have been responsible merely for issuing tomes of regulations associated with it. We want our proposals to be workable and practical, and that is why we have introduced the amendment and the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that brief explanation of the new clause. It may be an oversight on my part, but I was sad to find that the helpful note on the new clauses did not include information on new clause 22. It may be my bad luck, but I had to do a fair amount of research on the new clause, and although I served on the Committee that considered the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, it seems a long time ago.
<P>
The new clause raises a couple of questions. As the right hon. Gentleman said, he has already issued tomes of draft regulations on pension sharing on divorce, but I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that regulations for the sharing of SERPS are not included. That probably slipped his mind, given the volume of regulations that he has had to consider.
<P>
When I first read the new clause, I wondered whether it would cover all the regulations required for splitting SERPS on divorce and why so many draft regulations were necessary for every other pension scheme. If the new clause is designed purely to give the Government Actuary the authority to do the calculation, I assume that in due course another tome of draft regulations on SERPS will be issued, which will please everyone no end. The new clause refers to four sets of regulations to deal with the matter.
<P>
If the new clause relates only to SERPS, it is possible that, despite the crediting of low and non-earners with state second pensions, on reaching retirement a married couple might depend on just one person's state second pension. Would such circumstances require further regulations, or has no thought has been given to splitting S2P? Is it considered an individual's pension? If only one person in a married couple has an S2P and no other pension provision, what will happen should the marriage come to an end? Some people may not have a state second pension even with the credits provided under clause 28.
<P>
Section 48 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 refers to legislation for Northern Ireland and Scotland. I assume that section 49 and new clause 22 do not refer to Northern Ireland and Scotland because they are covered under section 48, which covers the sharing of SERPS. I should be grateful if the Minister could reassure me on that technical point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I was obviously too brief earlier, for which I apologise to the hon. Lady because it is a complicated area. I will try to answer her question about Scotland and Northern Ireland while I am on my feet.
<P>
I think—again, I will take advice—that S2P will in due course be treated like the basic pension, which is not subject to splitting. In the long term, S2P will become flat-rate and I suspect that the splitting will not apply to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): On the possibility of splitting, because the new clause refers to the additional pension, which is still the phrase used in legislation for S2P, would not the regulation-making powers in the Bill give a future Secretary of State at least the possibility of splitting pensions? Does that technicality exist by dint of the legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall do my best to answer that before we leave the clause. In response to the hon. Lady's earlier question, there is no special provision for Scotland but there is separate legislation for Northern Ireland. The issue is incredibly complicated—as shown by the draft regulations—because it deals with not only social security, but family law. We finished consultation on the draft regulations only on the 14th of last month and are considering responses to it. I hope that before the end of the month, and certainly before Easter, we will announce our decisions on the consultation and will be able to give more information then.
<P>
Section 49 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 is concerned with the creation of state scheme pension debits and credits when a pension sharing order or agreement—which is purely voluntary—is made. A pension debit is simply the reduction in the SERPS rights of the member whose pension has been shared. The pension credit represents the part of the member's pension transferred to the former spouse. Section 49(4) currently provides for the calculation of the value of a credit or debit in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State.
<P>
As I said, it had always been our intention to sub-delegate the responsibility for calculating the cash value of SERPS rights to the Government Actuary. However, the general regulation-making power that we have taken in section 49(A) is not sufficient and we need a specific sub-delegation power.
<P>
In the absence of such a power to sub-delegate responsibility to the Government Actuary, we have been advised that the regulations will need to contain detailed actuarial tables, which would themselves have to be amended each time the methods, and/or assumptions, underlying the tables needed to be changed. To avoid that, it is necessary to provide a sub-delegation power in section 49(4) of the 1999 Act. Similarly, a sub-delegation power is needed in relation to other provisions in the Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 that are concerned with the valuation of SERPS rights in pension sharing cases—hence the symmetrical amendments to section 45B, 55A and 55B of that Act.
<P>
The amendment provides for the valuation of state scheme rights to be calculated in such a manner as may, in the particular case, be approved by or on behalf of the Government Actuary. It also provides for the valuation to be carried out in accordance with professional guidance. I am sorry that the amendments are necessary.
<P>
We now come to the clincher—the state second pension. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) reminded us earlier that SERPS is legally an additional pension. So is the state second pension, and it will work in the same way as SERPS. I am a little surprised by that, bearing in mind what I said a few minutes ago, because the provisions may not be the same when it becomes a flat rate pension. That may need further explanation—it will certainly need to be explained to me—but I have been told that the state second pension, being an additional pension, will work in exactly the same way.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Once the Minister has had that interesting conversation, I should be grateful if he could share it with the Committee. It is useful that we stumbled across the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Not only shall I do that, I shall apologise to the Committee. In the course of issuing voluminous extra guidance for the Committee, we neglected to provide notes on clause 65—or they may have been mixed up with something else. I take full responsibility for that. I shall take further advice to clarify the matter and write to hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked how we would know if we had the right hon. Gentleman on the ropes. The rules sound as complex as for the rebates on state second pension.
<P>
We might have discovered that more questions need to be answered. I am grateful to the Minister for offering to find out. I conclude that the state second pension will be splittable on divorce. It would be useful to have time to think about the matter. The Minister said that we could be faced with annual actuarial tables, as changes are made. We are grateful that the Government Actuary will do it, and that it will not need to be done by regulation. However, we may want to return to the matter.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 365, in page 67, line 6, after `Part II' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and section (Disclosure of state pension information)'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new clause 35—Disclosure of state pension information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Essentially, we are debating new clause 35. I shall not take long, but several points need to be made, if only because this will probably be the last time today that I shall speak.
<P>
Pension forecasting is important, and I alluded to it earlier. It is essentially a matter of data protection. The new clause will permit state pension information to be passed to employers and pension scheme providers for the purpose of providing statements of private and state pension rights, unless employees indicate that they do not want such information to be disclosed.
<P>
The policy announcement on this matter was made in the Green Paper in December 1998. There has been no legislation since because none was required to allow pension forecasts to every worker. However, because we want to get it right—we do not want to rush it—it has been piloted. Indeed the pilot schemes are being piloted. We are piloting the pilot scheme with various companies. We started the pilot schemes with companies that were prepared to co-operate and become involved because we want the pension forecast to be delivered by the employer, not the Government.
<P>
For the employer to print a form showing the state pension provisions of employees would require employees' permission. Indeed, that is what is happening in the pilot schemes. Pre-pilots are being run by the Prudential and Sainsbury's. Tens of thousands of their employees are involved, and they had to give their approval. Not all of them will have second pension provision—that issue will be dealt with elsewhere—but there is potential for the working population of about 27 million to be involved. The plan might not work if only one or two schemes seek approval. The legal question is not about people opting in but allowing people to opt out, so that we can conform fully with data protection legislation and European convention requirements.
<P>
We want to encourage the inclusion of all pension provision details at one point for employees, and there might be a problem if the state did not give information. It has been realised that getting people to opt in is more onerous than allowing them to opt out. The information is theirs and it will probably come through a computer printout. There is no question of employers prying, although they will transmit the information. We have safeguarded people's rights. The right will be clearly given—it will not be hidden.
<P>
Pension providers are also involved, albeit as a third party. They will be given state pension details. Some are developing comparative financial databases, which would give financial information to help individuals to identify the most appropriate pension or saving arrangement. Financial products could be targeted to an industry or segment of the population if its provision was shown to be deficient. The measure will be important.
<P>
The databases would also enable individuals to access their state pension details electronically. I will probably get rapped over the knuckles for advertising a little-known service that the Department provides, which allows anybody to ask for a pension forecast at any time. Remarkably few people do that—600,000 a year—and most do it late in their working life, close to retirement, when there is not much time to act. We provide only basic pension, graduated pension and SERPS information in the forecast.
<P>
Currently, 18.5 million members of private pension schemes in the working population could benefit from a combined pension forecast. About 17 million people of working age do not have rights in a private pension. The system will be voluntary, but the whole industry is behind it. The Government intend to promote the policy vigorously and we shall, in due course, target the self-employed because they suffer a pension deficiency.
<P>
The pre-pilot is under way; the first combined forecasts will be issued by the Prudential in March. Other companies, including the principal civil service pension scheme, are co-operating in the pilot. The parliamentary pension trustees issued a forecast relating to the parliamentary pension for the first time last year. That was a real plus.
<P>
I am modestly ignorant of pensions and everything else. The issue of pension forecasts to the working population will probably have more effect on making people pension wise than Ministers' speeches and the Department's fancy advertising leaflets. The effect on pension information and education will be dramatic, if only because people will say, ``Hang on, this is not enough. Why isn't it enough and how can I increase it?'' That will be an extremely valuable resource for 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds, allowing them to get more control over their pension arrangements. It will not make pensions politically sexy, but it will have a tremendous impact when people start to see how information is provided.
<P>
Careful testing in the pilots is necessary. We want the information to be easily understood. The scheme will not work if we make people opt in. We live in the real world. Although we must protect people's rights by providing a proper opportunity to opt out, our proposal is the only way to make a reality of this important policy.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have great sympathy with the Government's decision to alert people to their pension provision, especially their state pension provision, and to make people aware of their entitlement, hence the need to amend the Data Protection Act 1998. Those of us who have ticked the little box at the bottom of the endless bills and forms that we receive from credit card companies asking whether we want information passed on, know how easy it is for people to miss the positive opportunity to refuse information. Equally, we need to support measures that make it easier for people to get pension information.
<P>
On the detail, the right hon. Gentleman made it clear that Sainsbury's and the Prudential are piloting the pilots. Will the Prudential's pilots involve its employees or its pension holders? What are the Government's plans to ensure that the scheme is piloted by smaller organisations that employ, say, 100, 50, 20 or five people? It seems that the smaller the employer, the greater the burden. I hope that there will not be too much form filling, but the scheme will mean that there is more for am employer to do. Will he reassure me that the pilots will extend across employment groups?
<P>
What will happen with sole traders who may have no other form of pension provision, except what they gain from the sale of their business? How will the Government get information to them? They are planning to exempt employers with fewer than five employees from stakeholder pensions. How will those employees know about their pension entitlement if there is no mechanism for telling them and they have no other pension provision? How will unemployed people know about their pension provision? So far, the system seems to rely entirely on everyone being employed by employers who are capable of dealing with the extra regulatory burden.
<P>
Many people have several pension policies—I certainly do and, at present, I receive annual statements. Will the employer consolidate the principal pension policy with the state pension or will there be some requirement for the income from all the pensions to be included in one statement? What will happen to the clawback on pensions? If a company was operating a pension clawback system, would it appear in the pension statement or could it be glossed over, as it has been in the past to the distress of many people, including some of my constituents? I should imagine that all members of the Committee have received letters from constituents complaining about the system. I am sorry to ask questions that are extraneous to the clause, but I should be grateful to receive reassurance from the Minister.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Like the hon. Lady, I genuinely welcome the provision and how it changes the nature of the way in which pensions are provided. As the Minister said, it is a culture change in education and behaviour and is welcome in all those respects. The Green Paper cites an illustrative example of how the system might appear to the public, although I am sure that it has been refined since then as a result of the pilot scheme. A figure is shown that relates to the amount a person would receive per week at a certain retirement age and then a figure is shown of how much he would receive if he continued his employment. Such a forecast will focus a person's mind.
<P>
As the hon. Lady said, people receive a multiplicity of opaque statements of personal pension plans. I find it difficult to fathom out what I am being told about my ultimate entitlement, except that I know that it will probably be peanuts.
<P>
Such an exercise will make a difference to the way in which people treat their pensions in future, I am concerned about complexity. Some aspects of contracting out will add significantly to the details that appear on the statement such as top-ups, contracted-out contributions and so on. It will increase the likelihood of inquiries into what such details mean. The explanatory notes that deal with the new clauses and the general overall staffing effects of the state second pension state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is likely to be a small increase in staff in the Benefits Agency and Inland Revenue as a consequence of the State Second Pension of around 150 to 250 over and above planned recruitment levels.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the majority of people are receiving through their employer a combined statement that for the first time focuses their attention on the adequacy of their pension, it may pose questions about whether their contribution record has been accurately recorded. Such matters may result in increased inquiries, which begs the question about whether the estimate of 150 to 250 more staff is a fair reflection of the likely demands that will be placed on the Benefits Agency. The explanatory notes go on to say that the number of staff would reduce over time when normal operating levels were reached. In the early days, there will be a substantial surge of inquiries from people who want to know about the provision. Will the Minister explain what plans will be put in place to accommodate that situation? What measures will be used in the pilot schemes to assess the likely additional demand for advice from the Benefits Agency, and what will be the effect of rolling out the proposal to all schemes?
<P>
On a final, perhaps slightly tangential, point that is germane to the publication of the statements, reference has been made to the fact that, under the state second pension at least, people will be notified of their entitlement to home responsibilities protection three years after the period of entitlement instead of when they are about to retire. Those annual forecasts and statements provide an opportunity to communicate important messages.
<P>
The Minister was right to say that many glossy leaflets stay in the Benefits Agency. Undoubtedly, some people read, treasure, inwardly digest and even act on the information contained in those leaflets; many others do not, but they might read, inwardly digest and act upon statements forecasting their pensions. If those statements include information on home responsibilities protection, people may have an opportunity to act on such matters. I hope that the Minister will respond positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I will do my best. I know that 60,000 of Sainsbury's 160,000 employees are in its pension scheme. The pilot scheme covers those 60,000 employees. The policy-holders of Prudential pensions are involved, not its employees, so I am sorry if I gave that impression. The exercise includes some big players, in the sense that some of them are pension providers. Sainsbury's, EMAP, Prudential, AXA Sun Life, NPI and the principal civil service pension scheme are involved.
<P>
We must evaluate what happens at the Prudential and Sainsbury's before we start the second stage of the pilot scheme. I understand that the plan is to begin the second stage this autumn, perhaps in September. I do not know exactly how such things as the telephone inquiry hotline will work. I cannot give any such forecasts at present.
<P>
I welcome the fact that more people are inquiring about their pension rights. As I have said, only 600,000 people ask about their pensions. If the number of people asking about their pensions doubled or trebled, problems would be caused in the Benefits Agency. If more people had asked for their pension forecasts in 1986–87, we might not have inherited problems in the state earnings-related pension scheme. Although it is not a matter of blame, the fact is that the then Government would have been alerted to the problem and have nipped it in the bud, but that did not happen, which has presented a few problems.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is right that the idea is to have a single statement, such as Members received last year, using current prices for current and projected rights. The figures must be given in today's money; otherwise, people will not understand them. The Green Paper includes an example forecast for someone aged 58. Under the heading,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The contributions you have made so far have built up the following pension entitlements<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
figures are given for the basic pension, the state second pension and the total current pension earned so far—£129.80 a week in that example. However, someone who stays in his present job until 65 is forecast to have a pension of £162.90. If another 5 per cent. is chucked in, he will get £170 a week.
<P>
That example illustrates the position of Mr. A. Smith, who is 58 at the time of the forecast. It would not be worth giving non-illustrative figures as it would be impossible to make sense of them. The illustration is as simple as possible and uses current prices.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam spoke about responsibilities. I caution those responsible for the matter to eschew add-ons. Millions of people will request pension forecast information, although not all in the same week, as matters will be phased. Let us try to achieve the initial objective of the pension forecast. If we tweak the system to deal with add-ons, the computers will not work. That is the history of Whitehall information technology: first, a system must be set up and intentions carried out before tweaking for add-ons is considered. Pilots are obviously in place and we will learn from them.
<P>
Deferred rights are complex. How to make paying into the funds of existing policy holders simple is important and we are examining the industry's problems in dealing with deferred rights. We are not ignoring that difficulty, but it will not be solved immediately.
<P>
Enabling people to trace their rights is important for the registration of pensions. However, we do not intend to include deferred rights in the initial forecast. Such issues will crop up in the pilots, as many employees taking part in them will have deferred rights from elsewhere. Questions are bound to be asked about that.
<P>
On sole traders, information will be provided by pension providers. People who do not have anything can ask for their state forecast. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) spoke about the burden of the regulations of industry, but in fact everything is voluntary. The Government intend to push the matter so that provision is as widespread as possible. Indeed, our target is getting every employee in the country into a pension forecast.
<P>
However, Government cannot impose their wishes on industry. The arrangements are therefore voluntary and have been the subject of large-scale pilots and pre-pilots. Sixty thousand people, for example, have been taking part in the Sainsbury's pilot. That is a large number of people with whom to deal, especially as opting-in was initially involved.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Are the employers or the employees volunteering?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is a good question.
<P>
Employees have a right to ask for a state pension forecast and do not have to go through their employer to get it. Therefore, both employers and employees are volunteering.
<P>
The forecast will not be a burden on employers as, generally speaking, professional pension providers will administer the pension, although trustees will also be involved. It should not be a bigger burden than giving people P60s every year, although I may be exaggerating slightly. The forecast will be computer generated every year, but will not be produced on the same day every year. Indeed, it would be impossible to get state pension information for everyone out in a week anyway.
<P>
We estimated that 160 staff would be needed, but when the pilots are completed we shall have information from them. This is a new enterprise, so there is no experience on which the Government can draw. I was asked whether the pensions can be used for other purposes. They can be used to support information on the forecasts, or to support leaflets. We do not know what the pension forecast will look like; we have only a blow-up of the Green Paper. We hope that what comes with it will not be a tome of many pages because that would be counter-productive.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We need a clear explanation in plain English. We must be careful about the way in which information is imparted. It must be minimal, to avoid any risk of mis-selling or giving false information. It has to be accurate. It is important also to suggest to those who receive the information some ways in which they might like to use it to obtain advice, from the provider or the Department of Social Security, about what they might do. I was counselling about this earlier, because it is the ultimate mailshot and we know that mailshots and mailing addresses can be used for all sorts of things. I caution against thinking first about other issues, such as benefits not being claimed, or take-up and so on, before deciding on the policy and on what we intend to do. I can think of many things for which the mailshot would be a useful vehicle.
<P>
Once we have completed the pilots, I expect that we shall report on them. We do not yet have a vehicle for this, but question time and Westminster Hall might be suitable.
<P>
We shall be more than happy to share it with hon. Members. We shall seek wide support for the policy because it is so innovative.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 356, in page 67, line 9, after `Part III' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and section (Child benefit disregards)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 30—Child benefit disregards.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> New clause 30 is a necessary technical amendment to restore the legislative basis for child benefit payments for a small group of disabled children in Scotland. Amendment No 356 allows the new clause to commence.
<P>
When a child is accommodated and cared for by a local authority child benefit usually stops after eight weeks. This long-standing arrangement prevents duplication from the public purse. When the only reason for a child being in residential accommodation is to minimise the effect of disability or to allow the child to lead as normal a life as possible, the position is different. Were it not for the disability, the child would be living at home. For child benefit purposes, this type of absence from home is treated as analogous with a hospital stay.
<P>
The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 repealed parts of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, especially where it related to children under 18. This had the unfortunate and unintended effect of removing the legislative basis for payments of child benefit in respect of disabled children in this group, although payments continue on an extra-statutory basis. The amendments restore the statutory basis for the provisions.

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> These are technical amendments. New clause 34 brings together all the measures in the Bill where we need to specify a requirement to refer regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee. Amendments Nos. 359 and 363 are consequential. Amendment No. 359 provides for the provisions to be brought into force by commencement order, and amendment No. 363 removes from clause 66 reference to the community sentence provisions relating to the Social Security Advisory Committee and inserts reference to the measures contained in new clause 34. 1 ask the Committee to accept the amendments.
