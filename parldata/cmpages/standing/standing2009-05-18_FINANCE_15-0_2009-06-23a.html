<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000406"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. May
I also welcome the Exchequer Secretary to her new position in the
Treasury team and to the Finance Bill Committee? I am sure that we all
applaud the fact that she is to respond to the debate on the next few
clauses. She has experience of previous Finance Bills, having been a
Parliamentary Private Secretary, which I am sure will stand her in good
stead. She must be as delighted as she is surprised to find herself on
this year&#146;s Finance Bill Committee.</div>
<a name="09062393000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 91
relates to the HMRC charter. I will make various comments about the
charter&#146;s purpose during the stand part debate, but it might be
helpful to touch upon its purpose in relation to amendments 75 and 76.
Is the charter&#146;s purpose to set out HMRC&#146;s
responsibilities and its mission statement; or to set out the rights
and responsibilities of taxpayers; or a bit of
both?</div><a name="09062393000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Exchequer Secretary and perhaps her ministerial
colleagues for the new draft of the charter, which was published last
week, before the hon. Lady 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div>had fully settled into her new role. The draft sets out the rights and
responsibilities of taxpayers or customers&#151;I am never sure about
the term &#147;customers&#148; in relation to HMRC, but I know what
the Government are getting at. The clause inserts into the
Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 new section 16A,
subsection (2) of which
states:</div><a name="09062393000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Charter must include standards of behaviour and values to which Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will aspire when dealing with
people in the exercise of their
functions.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
draft charter&#146;s content on the rights of taxpayers may be
regarded as similar to that statement, but the obligations, which the
charter also outlines, are not reflected in the subsection. The
subsection does not refer in any way to the obligations of taxpayers;
its focus is entirely on what HMRC will do. We will have an opportunity
during the clause stand part debate to argue about whether that is
right or wrong, but we think it would be a better description of both
the draft HMRC charter that was published last week and the February
draft if the subsection provided for the charter to</div>
<a name="09062393000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;set out the
rights and responsibilities of taxpayers and other persons with whom
HMRC
deals&#148;</div><a name="09062393000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
proposed in amendment 76.</div>
<a name="09062393000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 91
gives the charter statutory recognition&#151;I hope to talk at
greater length about that and the reasoning behind the clause in a
moment&#151;but if the clause is to accurately reflect the
charter&#146;s nature, amendment 76 would be helpful in clarifying
that purpose. New section 16A(2), as drafted, does not fully or
adequately explain what the charter is about. We can debate what we
think the charter should be about. There is a strong argument that what
is in subsection (2) should be an accurate description of what the
charter is about, or we could argue that that is deficient. I submit
that subsection (2) is inadequate as a description and would be better
if amendment 76 were
accepted.</div><a name="09062393000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
75 toughens up the wording of subsection (2), which refers to</div>
<a name="09062393000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;standards of
behaviour and values to which Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
will aspire with people in the exercise of their
functions.&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
suggest that that could be improved and strengthened by removing the
word &#147;aspire&#148; and, instead, say that HMRC will</div>
<a name="09062393000025"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;use all
reasonable endeavours to
achieve&#148;</div><a name="09062393000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
standards. The intention is to strengthen the requirements of HMRC to
comply with the charter. If we have a charter to which people merely
have to aspire, as opposed to actually and properly seen as a key
objective that HMRC will go to great lengths to achieve, one may
question whether the charter will have as much effect as it should
have. Consequently, amendment 75 deletes the word
&#147;aspire&#148; and inserts the
words</div><a name="09062393000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;use
all reasonable endeavours to
achieve&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
77 to 80 deal with review. New section 16A(3) states
that</div><a name="09062393000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commissioners must...regularly review the Charter,
and...publish revisions, or revised versions, of it when they
consider it appropriate to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
term &#147;regularly review&#148; is vague. How frequently is
regularly? Perhaps the Minister can give some guidance to the Committee
on that point. We suggest two alternative approaches&#151;they
obviously contradict each other. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>amendment 77 we propose the removal of the word
&#147;regularly&#148;. In amendment 78, we suggest that the review
should be annual, tying in more neatly with new subsection (4), which
refers to the Commissioners making</div>
<a name="09062393000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a report
reviewing the extent to which Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
have demonstrated the standards of behaviour and values included in the
Charter.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the obligation to make a report annually, we suggest that a review of
the charter be performed at the same time&#151;again, annually. I do
not think that the Government intend that that be done annually and
that the review of the charter itself should be tied up with the review
of compliance with the charter, which is why we tabled amendment 79,
which proposes that the review be undertaken every three years. That
would regularise and formalise a proper review and deal with the
vagueness, which has been a concern. The Minister may well provide some
comfort through her comments to the Committee, but I think it is right
to raise the issue of vagueness in the present wording.</div>
<a name="09062393000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
concern relating to the review process is that there is nothing in the
Bill that states that there will be consultation with stakeholders.
Clearly, in producing in the draft charter, the Government have
consulted stakeholders. We will turn to the charter in more detail in
the stand part debate, I hope, but there has been extensive
consultation and the original draft of the charter responds to the
remarks made by the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. If HMRC is to review the
charter regularly, it would be sensible to consult stakeholders. I am
sure the Exchequer Secretary will be able to reassure the Committee
that any reviews will be undertaken with proper consultation, but it
would be helpful if that were in the Bill and I see no reason why it
should not be. We tabled amendment 80 to address that
point.</div><a name="09062393000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
91 is important, raising a range of issues which I would like to turn
to in the stand part debate. We tabled amendments 75 to 80 in an
attempt to be constructive, to provide greater clarity and to allow the
Exchequer Secretary to expand on some of the more technical points,
before we turn to a wider
debate.</div><a name="09062393000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000407"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b>
I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson,
and to join the Bill Committee, although it was a bit of a surprise, as
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said. I thank him for his
kind
words.</div><a name="09062393000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will come later to the stand part debate on clause 91, but I
have a couple of introductory remarks. The clause introduces and
maintains the charter in statute for the first time, ensuring that the
charter cannot lapse. It also ensures that HMRC will be specifically
accountable to both Parliament and the public for its performance
against the charter. Commissioners must report annually on how well
HMRC is doing in meeting the standards in the charter. That will be
included in HMRC&#146;s departmental report, opening it to scrutiny
by both the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury Committee. That
imposes on the commissioners and all officers of Revenue and Customs
the strongest obligation to comply with the charter&#146;s
requirements and aspirations. I assure the Committee that the charter
will have a high profile at HMRC and be at the heart of everything it
does.</div>

Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="09062393000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000409"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Can I just finish the point, as it leads me
to amendment 75, which would change the wording of the provision to
describe the standards in the charter? Instead of standards to which
HMRC will &#147;aspire&#148;, they would become standards HMRC
will</div>
<a name="09062393000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;use all
reasonable endeavours to
achieve&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is a standard in the charter to which HMRC must aspire, it goes
without saying that HMRC must use all reasonable endeavours to achieve
it. In my view, the accountability mechanisms I have just described
meet that
obligation.</div><a name="09062393000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000410"></a>John
Howell:</b><b class="B"> </b>Given the general nature of the behaviours
described in the charter, will the hon. Lady say a little more about
how she is going to measure them? It seems impossible to measure some
of them. There are no firm numbers and no comparisons one can make. How
will she approach the measurement, against which we will tell whether
HMRC has met its obligations under the
charter?</div><a name="09062393000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09062393000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000411"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall speak about that later when I
respond to amendment 80, because we intend to set up an advisory
panel.</div><a name="09062393000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not think it necessary to change the wording as proposed in
amendment 75 because we think the obligation is already there.
Amendment 76 would require the charter to</div>
<a name="09062393000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;set out the
rights and responsibilities of
taxpayers&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is too sweeping. It is intended that the charter will set out those
rights that do not lend themselves to being enshrined in statute, such
as the rights to be treated with respect and to be presumed to be
honest. However, the charter cannot be expected to set out all the
rights that already exist in law, such as the right to appeal in
certain circumstances. On the responsibilities of taxpayers, the
charter is not the right place to say that a tax return must be
completed correctly and by a given date. Although it may include, for
example, a general statement that a taxpayer is expected to be honest,
it is not appropriate for the clause to suggest that HMRC can dictate
values to which the public must
adhere.</div><a name="09062393000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire expressed the hope that I
would give some comfort and clarity in relation to amendments 77 to 79.
Taken together, they propose omitting &#147;regularly&#148; and
inserting one of two alternatives. &#147;Regularly&#148; clearly
implies that HMRC must review the content of the charter reasonably
often, which does not mean once every five years. As I have said, the
charter will be at the heart of HMRC&#146;s relationship with
taxpayers and other persons it deals with. It is a pivotal document. I
assure the Committee that the terms of the charter will be kept under
review and the annual reporting obligation makes it inevitable that
such reviews will take place at least once a year. It is not necessary
to put that in the
Bill.</div><a name="09062393000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 80
deals with consultation with stakeholders in carrying out the reviews.
We agree with the sentiment behind it&#151;of course we want HMRC
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 527</div>consult with stakeholders&#151;but the amendment is too vague and
might blur responsibilities. For example, who are stakeholders? Is
every member of the public a stakeholder? How many of those
stakeholders should we consult? However, as I said, HMRC&#146;s
responsibility to consult is something that both we and HMRC take very
seriously. Consequently, we will be setting up  an advisory
panel to monitor the charter. A majority  of its
members will be representatives of external stakeholders and it will
operate in a similar way to  the powers implementation forum,
which is already regarded as a success. An additional reference to
stakeholders is not required in the legislation.</div>
<a name="09062393000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Henley, we are already working to review
what performance data should be published. That involves looking at
what customers have told the Department is the information they care
most about and reviewing what it would be most helpful to publish. In

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000412"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Exchequer Secretary for her response. I
shall briefly go through the various amendments and respond to her
comments.</div>
<a name="09062393000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
75, I am grateful for the hon. Lady&#146;s comment that where HMRC
aspires to do something, it will also use all reasonable endeavours to
achieve it. If I understand her correctly, that is helpful, and if we
have her assurance that HMRC will use all reasonable endeavours to
achieve the standards of behaviour and values set out in the charter,
that is also
helpful.</div><a name="09062393000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am less persuaded by the hon. Lady&#146;s comment that amendment 76
is too sweeping. In it, we propose that the charter should set out the
rights and responsibilities of taxpayers, but we do not intend that to
be exhaustive. I am sure that, in her short time in the post, the
Exchequer Secretary has read through the draft charter. I think that if
amendment 76 was accepted, the clause would reflect the charter much
more accurately than it does now. At risk of straying into areas that
will form part of the stand part debate, I believe that the charter
should emphasise the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers, rather
than being a mission statement for HMRC. I am not entirely persuaded by
her remarks, although I am not inclined to press the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="09062393000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Lady for her remarks on amendments 77 to 79
about regular reviews. I am not sure if the definition of
&#147;regularly&#148; as &#147;reasonably often&#148; provides
as much clarity as it might have done, although I note her comments
that it does not mean every five years. I assume by that remark that
she means that it will happen more frequently than every five years.
There is some clarity
there.</div><a name="09062393000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly grateful to the hon. Lady for her remarks on amendment
80 about consulting with stakeholders. I am not sure that the wording
we propose is so vague as to cause enormous difficulties to HMRC in
complying with the obligation. The meaning of &#147;consult with
stakeholders&#148; is pretty clear. However, the confirmation of the
advisory panel is a helpful remark for which the Committee will be
grateful.</div>

Bill.</div>
<a name="09062393000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000413"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We have already been debating amendments to the
clause, but the central question this morning is the purpose of the
HMRC charter. It might be helpful to describe the context.</div>
<a name="09062393000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fairly
regular feature of recent Finance Bills has been that a substantial
part of each Bill relates to HMRC powers. Those powers have been part
of the programme entitled, &#147;Powers, Deterrents and
Safeguards&#148;. I have made the point to the Minister&#146;s
predecessors, at various stages of more than one Finance Bill, that we
tend to hear much more about the powers and deterrents than about the
safeguards. Over the years, Treasury Ministers have answered by
pointing to the existence of the HMRC charter. That charter has evolved
over the past few years and we welcome the statutory recognition given
in clause 91&#151;we certainly will not oppose the clause standing
part of the Bill. However, we have to consider whether the charter as
it has been drafted is sufficiently focused on providing safeguards to
taxpayers or customers, or whether it is lacking in that
regard.</div>
<a name="09062393000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also
consider the concerns expressed, in recent years in particular, about
the performance of HMRC. There are two types of concern. First, there
are concerns about the failure of HMRC to raise as much tax as it might
have done. Those centre on underpayment of tax and HMRC&#146;s
failure to enforce measures sufficiently in the right areas, with the
result that it has not got the yield that it might have done. Secondly,
concerns are frequently expressed to all constituency MPs about
failures in the performance of HMRC&#151;that the customer service it
provides has been unsatisfactory.</div>
<a name="09062393000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that the area that most MPs have experience of dealing with is tax
credits, but I do not wish have a lengthy discussion about the tax
credit system, and I am sure that you would not wish me to do so,
Mr. Atkinson. However, we have all heard from constituents
who are concerned about HMRC&#146;s treatment of them, about its
inability to get information across, about information going missing,
and about the difficulties of getting to speak to anyone at HMRC.
Lengthy delays in VAT registration and payments were also common a
couple of years ago. There may be good reasons&#151;there was concern
about M-Tech fraud&#151;but there have also been failures within
HMRC, as highlighted by the National Audit Office. Experienced staff
members have not been available because they have been moved around,
and as a consequence the performance of HMRC has not been all that it
might be. There is currently a problem, as I am sure the Minister is
aware, of more general delays in tax repayments from HMRC. It would be
helpful if the she said something about that.</div>
<a name="09062393000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The past few
years have clearly been challenging for HMRC, with the Lyons report,
the Gershon savings, the merger between the Inland Revenue and Customs
and Excise and frequent changes in senior management. It is publicly
acknowledged that HMRC has had a morale problem in recent years. That
was highlighted at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>the time of the loss of the disk containing the data of all child
benefit claimants. Satisfaction with the performance of HMRC has been
very low. I assume that the charter is an attempt to address these
concerns, as well as the one I highlighted a moment ago: the balance
between the powers of HMRC and the safeguards that taxpayers should
have in this very important area. That is an issue we have discussed
many times before.</div>
<a name="09062393000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say in
parenthesis that I wonder whether issues of tax administration, to do
with the balance between the rights of the state and of individuals,
belong in Finance Bills, which only this House has the opportunity to
review, unlike a normal Bill. Those issues are different from the
raising of revenue, where this House has rightly been protective of its
monopoly powers. Would some of those provisions benefit from scrutiny
by the other place? How we balance that is at the heart of a liberal
democracy, which makes it somewhat surprising that the Liberal
Democrats are not present this morning.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I notice that my surprise is not
shared by all members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09062393000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
charter is important as a way of trying to provide some safeguards. It
has to be seen in the wider context of debates on previous Finance
Bills. That leads me to some of the concerns expressed about the
content of the draft charter. I thank Ministers for producing a draft
charter last week, as it is helpful for the Committee to have it in
front of us. Such is the timing, however, that I do not think that the
professional bodies that scrutinise such documents closely and provide
support for members of the Committee have had an opportunity to review
the contents. I suspect that, although they welcome some aspects of it,
they still have further questions. My role today is to ask those
questions.</div><a name="09062393000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09062393000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first point that must be raised is that there is still a lack of
clarity about whether the charter is intended to be a mission statement
for HMRC or whether it is intended to set out the rights and
responsibilities of taxpayers. The expectation, by and large, was that
the charter was to be for taxpayers, to set out what rights they have
and what obligations they owe. Indeed, one could question the title of
clause 91, which is &#147;HMRC Charter&#148;. Should the title be
&#147;Taxpayers&#146; Charter&#148; or &#147;HMRC Customer
Charter&#148;? Does the existing title get to the heart of the
matter?</div>
<a name="09062393000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">A criticism
raised by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, for example, of the
February draft of the charter was that it rather confused the matter. I
would like to quote the first paragraph of that draft, which was
highlighted by the CIOT. It says that the purpose of the charter
is:</div><a name="09062393000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
make sure that the money is available to fund the UK&#146;s public
services. We also help families and individuals with targeted financial
support. We aim to make the tax and benefit system feel simple to
use.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the CIOT said:</div>
<a name="09062393000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
belongs in a mission statement, not a
charter.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are some amendments to the new charter. However, as far as the first
paragraph is concerned, the new charter, which we have in front of us,
states:</div><a name="09062393000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
collect taxes and duties so that there is money to fund the UK&#146;s
public services. We help families and individuals with targeted
financial support. We also help international trade run smoothly and
protect the UK economy.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div><a name="09062393000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that is of the
nature of a mission statement. The new charter goes on to make comments
that are more focused on the taxpayer. However, the confusion
identified by the professional bodies in response to the February
consultation still remains.</div>
<a name="09062393000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall also
be grateful if the Minister can explain one of the changes to the
wording in that first paragraph of the new draft. It
says:</div><a name="09062393000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
also help international trade run smoothly and protect the UK
economy.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no one more committed than I am to the cause of international trade
running &#147;smoothly&#148;; I am a free trader, without any
equivocation. However, I was somewhat surprised that that objective was
seen as a particular focus of HMRC. If HMRC can do what it can to help
international trade, I have no objection to that. Nevertheless, I was
somewhat surprised to see those words in the first
paragraph.</div><a name="09062393000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also curious about the
wording:</div><a name="09062393000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
protect the UK
economy.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s view, but my personal
theory is that there was a first draft that stated, &#147;We must
protect the UK economy&#148;, which I suspect was about protecting UK
tax revenues. Then, someone looked at that draft and said, &#147;That
looks somewhat protectionist&#148;, and therefore some wording about
helping &#147;international trade&#148; was inserted, to prevent
there being any protectionist element. I am not quite sure how we got
to this particular wording, but it sits rather uneasily in the first
paragraph about the purpose of
HMRC.</div><a name="09062393000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
then have a summary of the rights section and there has also been a
change there from the February draft. The February draft contained the
wording:</div><a name="09062393000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pursue
relentlessly those that break or bend the
rules.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
professional bodies made two points about that wording. First, they
said that it did not sit comfortably in a list of the rights of
taxpayers. Secondly, it did not fit comfortably with the intention of
the new penalties regime to work constructively with taxpayers to
ensure that they would comply with the rules, and it did not make a
distinction between those who made innocent mistakes and those who were
cheating the Revenue. In that sense, it would be inappropriate to
pursue relentlessly those who break or bend the
rules.</div><a name="09062393000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new draft addresses a concern raised by the Low Incomes Tax Reform
Group that people on low income, who are unable to receive professional
advice and who may make an inadvertent mistake, would be affected. The
February draft appeared to state that such people would be pursued
relentlessly, which was perhaps not the tone that HMRC wanted to
strike. We welcome the new draft&#146;s
wording:</div><a name="09062393000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Tackle
people who try to cheat the
system&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate that a key obligation and responsibility of HMRC is to tackle
people who try to cheat the system, so we have no query about point 8
of the charter as an HMRC obligation. However, whether that fits easily
into a list of &#147;Your Rights&#148;, is another
matter.</div><a name="09062393000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the Minister will argue that those who pay their taxes in
accordance with the rules and do not cheat the system will not want
other people to be able to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>cheat the system. However, the document does not read easily on that
point, so I would be grateful for her remarks on
it.</div><a name="09062393000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062393000414"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): Does my
hon. Friend agree that it would be better  to have three
sections entitled, &#147;Your Rights&#148;, &#147;Your
Obligations&#148; and &#147;HMRC Commitment&#148;? That would be
a better and more logical way of explaining whether HMRC would get the
money by pursuing relentlessly or by tackling
wrongdoing.</div><a name="09062393000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000415"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. It might be
better to structure the document so that one section focuses on rights,
another on obligations and another on HMRC&#146;s wider commitment.
The counter-argument is that that takes us back to the confusion
between the mission statement and the rights and responsibilities of
taxpayers. I understand that the charter seeks to address both, but
that would be done more cleanly if the Government and HMRC followed my
hon. Friend&#146;s
suggestion.</div><a name="09062393000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say something about the document&#146;s structure. The February
document essentially contained a summary, and that was it; it basically
listed rights and obligations, and did not particularly expand on them.
The structure adopted by other charters, such as those of the OECD and
Australia, provided greater detail in addition to a summary of rights,
which is the route that HMRC has now taken. It is a good structure, and
it is helpful for taxpayers that there are greater explanations on
headline matters. For example, under Your rights, the
charter
says:</div><a name="09062393000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
can expect us
to:</div><a name="09062393000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">1. Respect
you.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then,
within the body of the charter, there are helpful details on what
respecting the taxpayer or customer means, such as treating the
customer with courtesy and consideration, listening to concerns, and so
on. However, I wish to highlight some of the suggestions made in
response to the February document that are not covered by the new draft
charter, and I would like the Minister to respond to
them.</div><a name="09062393000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
there is nothing in the charter about taxpayers&#146; freedom of
information rights. Those rights exist&#151;the Freedom of
Information Act 2000 exists, as all Members of the House are well
aware&#151;and should be in the charter. There is nothing specific
here about rights of appeal. It is not appropriate to put detailed
rights of appeal in the charter. They are complicated matters that vary
in each circumstance, but some indication on rights of appeal would be
helpful. There is nothing specific in the charter about remedies or
compensation available to a taxpayer, or anyone, in the event of
failures on the part of HMRC. Should there be anything in the charter
on that point?</div>
<a name="09062393000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the issue, which we debated last week, of retrospective taxation. Last
week, I raised the issue in the context of clause 67 in the hope of
obtaining from the Financial Secretary some indications of the
Government&#146;s general approach to retrospective taxation. I do
not think that I was entirely successful. However, some indication of
what a taxpayer can expect from the Government on retrospective
legislation&#151;something perhaps setting out the general principle
that HMRC will not act retrospectively, other than in some fairly
clearly defined circumstances&#151;would be helpful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div><a name="09062393000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered
Institute of Taxation raised one point that is partially addressed.
That is, if the charter states that it is right for a taxpayer to pay
only the tax that is due, which seems perfectly reasonable as nobody
should be expected to pay more than they are lawfully due, then there
is wording in the charter that distinguishes between those legitimately
trying to pay the lowest amount of tax and those evading tax. I do not
think that anyone would necessarily disagree with an explicit
acknowledgement that people should not be required to pay more than
they are due. Indeed, I think that the Chancellor has commented that
people are entitled to minimise their tax liability, if they do so in a
lawful way.</div>
<a name="09062393000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062393000416"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Has it not always been
a duty of HMRC to help taxpayers pay the minimum amount of tax that
they are due? I am surprised that this is something new, because I
understood that it was almost a duty of
HMRC.</div><a name="09062393000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000417"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend is correct: this is not new. What we
have is a charter that is new. The charter should set out what the
taxpayer can expect. In our earlier debate, the Exchequer Secretary
raised the point that it might be difficult to be comprehensive and
create an exhaustive document setting out every right and remedy
available to a taxpayer. However, there is an opportunity to assert
what is, as my hon. Friend says, a fundamental aspect of our taxation
system.</div>
<a name="09062393000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is not
included in the new charter is a blunt statement that taxpayers can
expect to receive a professional service from HMRC. That is not at any
point explicitly stated. The charter refers to various
commitments&#151;we will do what we can to keep the costs down, we
will help to support you to get the payments and claims
right&#151;which partly addresses the point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Wellingborough, but there is nothing particularly
explicit.</div>
<a name="09062393000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09062393000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have, of course, picked out various points that could have been
addressed but have not been. I do not want to obscure the fact that we
believe that an HMRC charter setting out the rights and
responsibilities of taxpayers is right. It is an important safeguard,
as Ministers have said, but we still have one or two concerns about the
drafting, about whether the document lacks focus on what the taxpayer
can expect and on their rights and about the danger that this is a
missed opportunity. It needs to be looked at in the context of a period
that has seen HMRC accrue significant new powers. The safeguards are
right, so we raise those concerns, but welcome clause 91 none the less.
It is an important aspect of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09062393000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000418"></a>John
Howell:</b> When I first looked at the draft charter that goes
with the clause, I had a sense of d√(c)j√  vu; it struck me
as very retro. It took me back to the 1980s and 1990s and those
companies that had mission statements emblazoned across their doors. It
was axiomatic that the only companies that needed mission statements
emblazoned in such a way were those that had difficulty believing in
them and translating the words into change in the first place. It is a
shame that this charter has that feel because I agree with the comments
made by the Chartered Institute of Taxation&#151;there is real value
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 533</div>having a simple, accessible statement of basic rights, particularly as
the relationship between HMRC and the taxpayer is becoming ever more
complex each year. We have also commented on that.</div>
<a name="09062393000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The charter
does the minimum. It is not easy to hold HMRC to account and the
charter is subjective in what it currently sets out. It will not, for
example, be difficult to sue against the charter if you wish. It ought
to have been backed up with hard targets. My hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire commented on professional service. Part of
that professional service is about having targets that can be seen,
measured and used to hold the organisation to account. The charter
comes over as neither one thing nor another: part mission statement, as
has been said, and part an attempt to get some substance into the
relationship between the taxpayer and
HMRC.</div><a name="09062393000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is confusion in the charter over who the audience is. Without wishing
to make the document significantly longer, there is logic in specifying
some of the differences between the different sorts of customers or
clients&#151;however you wish to describe them&#151;that HMRC deals
with. It would be useful in the
charter.</div><a name="09062393000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reading
and comparing the proposed draft charter with the OECD model charter,
which, from the structure and the wording, HMRC must have based it on,
I was struck that paying tax that is legally due is firmly in 
the OECD charter. So, too, are some very specific recommendations, such
as, &#147;We will finalise assessments in X days, we will deliver
refunds in X days, we will reply to queries in X days, and, even, we
will send the minutes of investigations in X days to those who have
been investigated.&#148; The OECD charter also deals with the right
of appeal in a more robust way than the one-line reference in section 1
of the draft, which just mentions the awareness of rights, including
the right to
appeal.</div>
<a name="09062393000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linking to
other legislation is important. My hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire mentioned that in connection with the Freedom
of Information Act 2000, but it also applies to the Equality
Bill&#151;the Committee on which is going on in another room down the
corridor. I am sure that there are elements of the Equality Bill that
will need to be taken into account.</div>
<a name="09062393000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">What will the
board report against? We come back to the question about needing
specific details. Even with the information that is there, it is very
difficult to see what the HMRC board will say about how the sorts of
objective in the charter will be achieved and measured. That is because
the charter is far too wishy-washy. It could have set out standards and
played an important role in providing safeguards for the taxpayer. Of
course, the weakness in the charter compares very unfavourably to the
enormously greater powers that HMRC is seeking in subsequent
clauses.</div>
<a name="09062393000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point is one of great surprise, Mr. Atkinson. I notice that
the letter to you and Mr. Hood from the Treasury team
regarding this clause, states that the redraft is a better version than
there original. If that is the case, I would hate to have seen the
original.</div>
<a name="09062393000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062393000419"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
rise to speak very briefly, following the contributions of my hon.
Friends the Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for Henley. As the
latter rightly said 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column534" />Column number: 534</div>toward the end of his comments, there is a stark contrast between the
mushy generalisations of the charter and some of the very specific,
quite draconian and unique new powers in the next few clauses. There is
a fundamental risk that such a document written in such general terms
will look like a very mushy mission statement. It needs specifics. As
my hon. Friend rightly said, the OECD&#146;s proposals talk about
commitments that can be expected by the customers, as it were, of the
HMRC in relation to time
deadlines.</div><a name="09062393000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000420"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend goes to the nub of the issue. When I
was in practice, one of the problems was that one would get a demand
from the Revenue to reply within two weeks, or else, but the
Revenue&#146;s reply would then take up to six months to arrive,
which left the taxpayer in limbo. It all seems to be one way, and I do
not see the charter addressing that problem at
all.</div>
<a name="09062393000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000421"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Similar problems may be found in a range of central
Government Departments, but my hon. Friend is absolutely right. There
is a sense of imbalance in the relationship, which is not terribly
helpful.</div>
<a name="09062393000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The charter
is written in such general terms that it justifies HMRC&#146;s
existence in areas where many would doubt its competencies. As my hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire rightly pointed out, the
very notion that HMRC exists to look at international trade and to
protect the economy is utter nonsense, and if that provision gives the
various bodies who should have those responsibilities an alibi, it
makes it all the worse.</div>
<a name="09062393000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a
business man before I entered Parliament and have had dealings for many
years with HMRC and the two predecessor bodies. I had perfectly good
relations with the VAT-related bodies and Customs and Excise. There was
a very strict rule that, if one was running one&#146;s own business,
in no circumstances should one mess with Customs and Excise. In almost
20 years as a business man, I ensured that I kept to the letter of that
rule. Fundamentally, my concern with any sort of charter, and certainly
a charter couched in such terms, is that it undermines what I consider
to be a very important principle, which is that businesses and
individuals should be able to get on with their lives without undue
hindrance from the state. We do not want businesses or individuals to
neglect to pay their taxes, and they have certain obligations in that
regard. However, setting those out in a strict rule of a charter must
be the wrong approach. Let businesses and individuals have as much
freedom as possible. I fear that the charter is a step in the wrong
direction.</div><a name="09062393000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062393000422"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): As usual, it is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship and to be guided by your wisdom,
Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09062393000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
charter. It is a good move. One of the difficulties that we have always
had&#151;I think that we have now cracked it&#151;relates to the
rights and responsibilities of taxpayers. Once the charter is passed, I
will await the day when taxpayers line up to give an assurance that
they will always speak the truth, never lie, never take cash and never
join dodgy tax avoidance schemes, but I will not hold my breath while
waiting. I am more concerned about the mechanics of how the provision
will be implemented.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column535" />Column number: 535</div><a name="09062393000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commissioners must report at
least once a year, but to whom? The Chamber of the House of Commons? Do
not expect me to go through their report line by line and hold them to
account; I have neither the time nor the resources to do so, and
neither do most of our Committees. The only Committee with such
resources is the Public Accounts Committee, which can call upon the
National Audit Office&#146;s 800 members of staff, who have the time
and resources to go through such a
report.</div><a name="09062393000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commissioners&#146; report is not the only one in which I am
interested. I am most interested in the Public Accounts
Committee&#146;s report, to which the Government have to reply. I am
also interested in what follows that. When the commissioners return
within the next year, as well as having an undertaking to utter, yet
again, the warm words, &#147;We accept that our behaviour was not up
to standard&#148;&#151;I am more interested in behaviour than
values, because behaviour will lead to the targets that the
commissioners aspire to achieve&#151;will they also have a duty to
report to the Public Accounts Committee the percentage of their
promises that have actually been
achieved?.</div><a name="09062393000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chamber debates Public Accounts Committee reports at least once a year.
Will that Committee have a duty every year to ensure that it reports
not only on the commissioners&#146; report, but on the
commissioners&#146; assessment of how many standards of behaviour
they have achieved or failed to achieve, as well as why they failed to
achieve them? Putting the simple mechanics in place is as much as a
Government can do; we cannot change individuals&#146; behaviour and
we should not legislate to try to do so. I would therefore like an
assurance from the Minister that the mechanics are right for the
situation, and that we have got a firm grip on the
matter.</div><a name="09062393000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000423"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We have had an interesting debate with
contributions from several hon. Members. On the last point made, the
commissioners must report annually on how well HMRC is doing in meeting
the charter&#146;s standards and, as I have said, that report will be
included in HMRC&#146;s departmental report, which opens the matter
up to scrutiny by both the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury
Committee. That gives a degree of comfort that the
commissioners&#146; report will not only be a piece if paper, but
will also be
scrutinised.</div><a name="09062393000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
formal service standards, since April 2008, HMRC has been reflected in
the three departmental strategic objectives, all of which are supported
by high-level targets, and HMRC success against those targets is
included in the departmental report. HMRC plans to start publishing
information on its performance against those objectives in the autumn.
The information will focus on what customers tell us is most important
to them, how easy it is for them to access the services support that
they need and the quality of that support, including whether they were
handled courteously, whether information was treated confidentially and
whether they were given the right
answer.</div><a name="09062393000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not relate the history of the charter, because members of the
Committee probably already know it, but the first consultation document
was warmly welcomed as making a positive contribution to the
relationship 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 536</div>between HMRC and those with whom it deals. The hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire has said that he does not agree with the
concept of the
charter.</div><a name="09062393000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000424"></a>Mr.
Gauke</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="09062393000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000425"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> No? I am sorry: he agrees with the concept
of the charter, but his hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and
Westminster disagrees with it, which is a shame, because I think that
most people agree with the concept. Most respondents argued that a
legal foundation would be the best way to ensure that the charter would
be an effective and enduring document. That is why the clause giving
the charter explicit legislative backing is included in the
Bill.</div><a name="09062393000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09062393000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000426"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> For the charter to be effective it needs to impose
or encourage a culture within HMRC to comply with it. Will the
Minister&#151;either immediately or subsequently in her
remarks&#151;outline to the Committee what steps will be taken to
disseminate the contents of the finalised charter among HMRC staff? I
appreciate that we do not have the final version here, although we
anticipate that what we have is very close to
it.</div><a name="09062393000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000427"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I may come back in detail on that. It is
important that the charter does not just sit here because we have
agreed to it, but that it goes to HMRC staff not just in Whitehall but
across the country, because those are the people with whom the majority
of taxpayers interact. Most people interact with HMRC not in Whitehall,
but in its local branches. The hon. Gentleman said the draft is not set
in stone, and I will come back to that point.</div>
<a name="09062393000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster
asked why the overarching statement at the beginning of the charter
mentions international trade. HMRC has responsibility for European
Union obligations on international trade duties. The
charter addresses all of HMRC&#146;s stakeholders,
so the overarching statement has been written to reflect the
customs policy as well as the tax-collecting duties of  the
Department&#146;s role. The Committee has seen a draft of the charter
and I want to assure Members that work continues on the final version
and the remarks we have heard today will feed into it.</div>
<a name="09062393000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was
raised that there was nothing in the charter about being professional,
but point 4
says,</div><a name="09062393000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whenever
you deal with us we will take responsibility for our actions and behave
in a professional way. We will: act with
integrity&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will continue to work with stakeholders on the specific text of the
charter and to take comments on board, as we have done so far. We aim
to have a complete charter published in the autumn. The second
consultation, which closed in May and led to the revised draft, took a
wide range of views on board. The CIOT congratulated us on listening to
its suggestions and taking them into account.</div>
<a name="09062393000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about accounting
bodies, we shared information on a confidential basis with the ICAEW.
In its briefing last week it said:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div><a name="09062393000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
support the current version of the charter which we believe is a well
balanced document which sets out the rights and obligations of the
taxpayer.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is straightforward and self-explanatory. The detail is in the
charter, which is still being refined and
revised.</div><a name="09062393000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Schedule
46</h4><a name="09062393000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Duties
of senior acounting officers of large
companies</div><a name="09062393000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000428"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that schedule
46 is introduced by clause 92, which was extensively debated by the
Committee of the whole House on 13 May, so the principle of imposing
duties on senior accounting officers has been dealt with. We are
dealing with schedule 46, which sets out the mechanics of
that, so we do not want a rerun of the original
debate.</div><a name="09062393000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000429"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. The
matter was debated on the floor of the House but, given the number of
Government amendments, surely there should be some leeway and
opportunity for us to look at this in general as well as at the
provisions the Government have put in place, because the clause is now
somewhat different from the one debated only six weeks
ago?</div><a name="09062393000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000430"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With respect, I do not wish to change my view.
We have discussed the broader principles. If there is a problem as the
debate on the schedule unfolds, we shall deal with it as it arises. If
the hon. Gentleman gets too far back into the original debate, I will
stop him. It is as simple as that.</div>
<a name="09062393000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000431"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I beg to move amendment 269, in
schedule 46, page 338, line 34, leave
out &#145;large&#146; and insert
&#145;qualifying&#146;.</div><a name="09062393000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000432"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: Government amendments 270 to 273, 276, 280 to 282, 287 to
290 and 296 to
298.</div><a name="09062393000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
65, in
schedule 46, page 343, line 20, leave
out &#145;or

amendments 300 to
304.</div><a name="09062393000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000433"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The schedule makes senior accounting
officers of large UK companies and groups of companies personally
responsible for ensuring and certifying that adequate controls are in
place to calculate tax and duty liabilities. Clause 92, under which
schedule 46 sits, helps to protect tax revenues by ensuring
that, in the present difficult economic environment, tax compliance
does not become a cost that is overlooked by the largest UK companies.
The clause will underpin the existing good practices of the majority by
ensuring that tax remains a priority at boardroom level, and tackling
poor tax compliance among a small minority of companies that do not
have robust systems and processes in place.</div>
<a name="09062393000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC is keen
to continue to develop open and transparent relationships with large
businesses. The schedule builds on that and on work that is already
under way to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div>help business to improve tax governance. That will allow HMRC to
continue its risk-based approach, focusing resources on the most
important issues, while reducing burdensome checks and interventions
when they are not required.</div>
<a name="09062393000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time
of the Budget, we made it clear that, because of the need to act now to
underpin tax revenues from such an important sector, we would discuss
the operation of the measure with interested parties. HMRC has held
wide-ranging discussions, and we have listened to what has been said.
The Government amendments take account of those discussions and are
designed to smooth the operation of the measure in practice.</div>
<a name="09062393000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
discussions began immediately after the Budget, so that when clause 92,
which introduces schedule 46, was debated by the Committee of the whole
House, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary was able to
announce the intention to table amendments to make three changes during
the Public Bill Committee stage. Those changes are first, to refine the
population of companies within the scope of the provision to give the
best possible fit with its aims; secondly, to remove the requirement
for the senior accounting officer to notify the company auditors of any
respects in which the tax accounting arrangements of the company are
not appropriate; and, thirdly, to revise the certification requirement
to allow notification of the appropriateness or otherwise of the
company&#146;s tax accounting arrangements using a single form of
certificate rather than one of two
forms.</div><a name="09062393000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discussions
with interested parties have continued, and three further changes are
proposed which, like those announced in the Committee of the whole
House, are designed to smooth the operation of the measure, yet fully
retain its effectiveness. They are: to focus the measure only on major
taxes and duties; to ensure that the wording of the draft legislation
is clear about what constitutes appropriate tax accounting
arrangements; and to refine the definition of senior accounting officer
to allow more flexibility for those groups of companies organised on
less conventional lines. We will discuss each of these changes in more
detail. However, all have been welcomed by the parties involved in our
discussions and each will help to smooth the efficient operation of the
measure. None undermines or dilutes the essential aim of underpinning
the tax compliance of the very largest companies.</div>
<a name="09062393000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary wrote to
Committee members last week enclosing a draft of the guidance on the
measure. The Government are grateful for the ongoing input of
representatives from business and the tax profession in developing the
guidance.</div><a name="09062393000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to a particular point mentioned in the
guidance, which is about how the measure will operate following Royal
Assent. A senior accounting officer who begins a review of the
appropriateness of the tax accounting arrangements during the first
financial year covered by the measure will be treated as having taken
reasonable steps to comply with the main duty introduced by the
legislation for that first period. It follows that, in those
circumstances, the senior accounting officer would not be penalised for
any failure in the main duty in respect of that first year.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 539</div><a name="09062393000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
speaking to the amendments, I remind the Committee of the situation
that the schedule seeks to address. The majority of large companies
already ensure that appropriate tax accounting arrangements are in
place in their companies or groups. For those companies, we want to
ensure that the burden of the new requirement will be minimised. It is
not intended to introduce a costly and complex bureaucracy for
companies when it is not required. However, a small minority of large
companies do not have robust systems and processes in place. We want
identified individuals&#151;the senior accounting officers&#151;in
those companies to take responsibility. We need to be clear whose
responsibility it is to put that right.</div>
<a name="09062393000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
269 to 273, 276, 280 to 282, 287, 289 to 291, 296 to 297 and 300 to 304
relate to the definition of the companies that fall within the scope of
the measure. Schedule 46 already provides for the population of
companies within the scope of the measure to be restricted by Treasury
regulations. However, in the Committee of the whole House my right hon.
Friend the Financial Secretary made it clear that, following
discussions with representatives of business, we were mindful to
restrict the population of companies that fall within the scope of the
measure, so that it was broadly limited to those largest companies and
groups to whom HMRC has assigned a customer relationship
manager.</div>
<a name="09062393000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062393000434"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Can the Exchequer Secretary
explain to the Committee why the decision was taken to exclude
partnerships from the remit of the
measure?</div><a name="09062393000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000435"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Not off the top of my head. If I cannot get
an explanation for the hon. Gentleman by the end of my remarks, I will
write to him and explain why that decision was
made.</div>
<a name="09062393000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000436"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I give the hon. Lady&#146;s officials notice
of my next question? Does the measure include mutuals? The Exchequer
Secretary will be aware that there is a large number of, say, financial
mutuals, building societies and mutual insurers out there who, I
suspect, would fall within the definitions of size that the Government
will insert in the schedule through their amendments. I would like to
know if those companies are included in the scope of the measure or if
they are outside its
scope.</div><a name="09062393000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000437"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Again, I hope to get back to the hon.
Gentleman on that point.</div>
<a name="09062393000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, the scope of the measure is broadly limited to the largest
companies and groups that have a CRM. The legislation could technically
be drafted to define the population as those companies with a CRM.
However, it is not appropriate to use defining criteria that rely on
HMRC&#146;s administrative practices. Instead, we have identified
objective criteria by reference to company turnover and asset value,
which will very closely equate to the assignment of a CRM. That means
that the measure will encompass the top 2,000 groups of
companies.</div>
<a name="09062393000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">For both
singleton companies and groups of companies alike, those criteria are
turnover of more than &#163;200 million and/or a balance
sheet total of more than &#163;2 billion. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column540" />Column number: 540</div>It is a test that brings banks within the scope of the
measure, as otherwise they would fall outside its scope. The amendments
will also ensure that the measure will apply only in relation to UK
companies and their senior accounting companies, and not to foreign
companies.</div><a name="09062393000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000438"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Given the restricted number of companies that will
meet the criteria, can the Exchequer Secretary say to what extent the
cost-benefit analysis set out in the regulatory impact assessment
should be revised?</div>
<a name="09062393000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000439"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Once again, I will get back to the hon.
Gentleman on that.</div>
<a name="09062393000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 303
deals with the definition of &#147;group of companies&#148; for the
purposes of the legislation. The Government received some
representations in informal consultation that the legislation as
drafted may have included companies and other entities that we did not
want to catch. We have given the matter further consideration and we
have introduced a definition that is drawn from existing tax
legislation, which will be more familiar to companies and easier for
them to work with. The new definition of &#147;group&#148; is set
out in the amendment.</div>
<a name="09062393000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
288 to 298 and amendment 65 concern the definition of &#147;senior
accounting officer&#148; for the purposes of the schedule. Who can be
and who should be a senior accounting officer has been discussed
extensively with interested parties and we are introducing amendments
that give more flexibility, so that the legislation is better fitted to
some of the situations that can occur in practice. However, the
legislation still requires the senior accounting officer to be a person
who has overall responsibility for the company&#146;s financial
accounting arrangements.</div>
<a name="09062393000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, amendment 298 makes it possible for a director or officer
of any group company to fulfil the requirements of the legislation on
behalf of another company in that group, or on behalf of the whole
group, if the company or companies concerned consider that that person
has the appropriate responsibility.</div>
<a name="09062393000361"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09062393000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000440"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I note the flexibility that amendment 298 will
give. The guidance suggests that the senior accounting officer could be
based outside the UK. If they are, will they still be liable for the
penalty regime that schedule 46 will
introduce?</div><a name="09062393000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000441"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is my understanding that if the company
is based in the UK, it is liable for the penalty regime. The exclusion
was for foreign companies based outside the UK. My understanding is
that a UK-based company that chooses to have a senior accounting
officer based outside the UK will still be liable. I will check that to
ensure that I understand
correctly.</div><a name="09062393000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
65 would go against the trend of the representations from business by
narrowing the field of possible candidates to carry out the functions
of senior accounting officer. Businesses consistently ask for
flexibility and the Government are happy to provide it, as long as the
person appointed to be senior accounting officer is appropriately
qualified to carry out the role. I therefore ask the Committee to
reject that amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 541</div><a name="09062393000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward
to the debate on this group of amendments. When I sum up, I hope to
respond to the points hon. Gentleman raised in his
interventions.</div>
<a name="09062393000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000442"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
this morning, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="09062393000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome my neighbour, the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North, to her new
role. As I said last week, we have got used to seeing press releases
from the Department for Children, Schools and Families with the
Minister&#146;s name attached rebadged as reports in the
<i class="I">Portsmouth Evening News</i>. I am looking forward to seeing Treasury
press releases on foreign exchange reserves and new appointments to the
Monetary Policy Committee being rebadged in that way. It will be
interesting to see what coverage such matters get in that august

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000443"></a>Mr.

predecessor, a week or a month may be a long time. Indeed, a day is a
long time in the hot seat of Exchequer
Secretary.</div><a name="09062393000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000444"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> In the week that the hon. Lady was a Minister in
the Department for Communities and Local Government, I did not spot a
DCLG press release being rebadged for the
occasion.</div><a name="09062393000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000445"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Oh, it
was.</div><a name="09062393000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000446"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Lady clearly got the press machine
working. Perhaps she is so keen to get those press releases in the
local paper because they might affect her longevity in the
post.</div><a name="09062393000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, that there was
a long stand part debate on clause 92 in Committee of the whole House.
The amendments flow from that debate. There was wide concern across
professional and business bodies about the scope of schedule 46 and the
need to restrict it. The amendments reflect those concerns and it is
good that the Government listened to them. It would have been better
still had the Government consulted on the matter first, rather than put
the schedule in the Bill and then table the amendments. The amendments
will change the schedule significantly and they reflect the concerns
that were
raised.</div><a name="09062393000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
desires to improve its relationship with large businesses. A conclusion
of the Varney report of 2006 on that matter was that there should be
clarity through effective consultation and dialogue. If HMRC and the
Treasury had embraced that conclusion, they would not have had to table
so many amendments to restrict the nature of large
groups.</div><a name="09062393000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will deal first with amendment 65. The Minister referred to the
representation that HMRC received from business organisations that were
supportive of  the concept that it should be directors or
officers of companies that were senior accounting officers. I argue in
amendment 65 that a senior accounting officer should be a director of a
company. The Government did not acknowledge in their review the
representation from the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West
(Mr. Robinson), who was Paymaster General and who played a
pivotal role in determining how tax law developed at the start of the
Government&#146;s first term in office. In the debate had on the
floor of the House, it became clear that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach to tax law was, &#147;Bung it in the
Finance Bill and amend it in Committee.&#148;&#151;a practice to
which the Government seem to have returned with schedule 46. He said
that it should be a director who took responsibility:</div>
<a name="09062393000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
point of the person being on the board, as opposed to being an officer,
is that being on the board carries certain specific personal
liabilities. The chief financial officer or the person with tax
responsibilities might in many cases be taken off the board precisely
so that they avoid that sort of responsibility, which a directorship
carries with it.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 May 2009;
Vol. 492, c.
885.]</div><a name="09062393000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary did say that he would look at that important point.
Why did the Government ignore
it?</div><a name="09062393000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an issue for directors in that they have particular responsibility
for the stewardship of a business. We have seen that a lot over the
past weeks and months. There are obligations that go with being a board
director and one would expect the senior accounting officer of a
company of the relevant size and status to be a director. It would be
very odd for such a company not to have a finance director. A senior
accounting officer always being a board member tightens up the measure
and focuses responsibilities on the board. It is important, and the
Minister may say that professional bodies have argued for flexibility
but sometimes Parliament needs to take a view. I am pleased that the
hon. Member for Coventry, North-West and I seem to share a common view
on the matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000447"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Am I to understand from my hon. Friend&#146;s well
argued comments that it would be possible to have a senior accounting
officer who was not a board member and was junior to the people sitting
on the board, but who took all the flack while the board member
escaped? Are the Government giving an opt-out to board
members?</div>
<a name="09062393000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000448"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. That is
what is happening. The flexibility means that the responsibility for
certifying the appropriateness of the tax accounting arrangements could
pass from a board member to somebody more junior in the
company&#151;rather than the finance director, it might be the
financial controller or a financial accountant, tax director or tax
manager. There are others to whom the duty could be allocated who are
not main board directors. I think that we ought to focus responsibility
on the board rather than on more junior staff. The people at the top of
the organisation, who have to certify that the accounts are true and
fair, are the people taking responsibility for the tax information as
well as other financial information. The Government should think about
that point carefully because it is important, as I said, to focus
responsibility on the boards.</div>
<a name="09062393000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments would restrict the number of companies that fall
within the measure. When we debated the matter earlier, the Financial
Secretary acknowledged that that was something that should happen. I am
pleased that the definition is in the Bill and not in regulation and
that it is based not on some administrative term within HMRC, but on
objective criteria. We all know that HMRC terms change from time to
time. A company that is subject to customer relationship management
today may not be in 10 years&#146; time, or a wider range of
companies may be caught, so it is important that there are objective
criteria. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div>interested to know how many companies are involved. When we debated the
matter in Committee of the whole House, the criteria used in the Bill
were drawn up with reference to the Companies Act 2006. A large company
would have to satisfy two of the following three criteria: a turnover
of more than &#163;22.8 million, a balance-sheet total of more than
&#163;11.4 million and more than 250
employees.</div><a name="09062393000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the time, the regulatory impact assessment suggested that 3 per cent.
of all large incorporated companies would fall within the 60,000
companies defined in the 2006 Act. However, in putting together the
RIA, the Government suggested that many companies were parts of groups
and so whittled down the number of companies needing to appoint a
senior accounting officer to between 1,600 and 2,000. Will the Minister
give us another estimate of the number of companies that fall within
the new category? The qualifying criteria are now, according to
amendment 296, a company with a turnover exceeding &#163;200 million
or a balance-sheet total exceeding &#163;2 billion. It would be
helpful if the Minister told us how many companies fall within those
criteria. I also wonder whether it is feasible for the Treasury to tell
us the names of the companies that fall within the criteria. Having
identified the criteria, it must be relatively straightforward to
understand which companies are
affected.</div><a name="09062393000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the size criteria help, it is not clear how big a difference they will
make compared with the statements that were made justifying the RIA
when the measures were first published. That is why I asked the
question about the cost-benefit analysis. Was it based on the type of
companies that are now caught, or was it based on the wider pool of
companies that was envisaged at the time of the regional definition? As
I said to the Minister in my intervention, there are other carve-outs
from the scope of this measure. It excludes partnerships. On one level,
I can understand that because it deals with the circumstances in which
a company is owned by a private equity company. For example, the
partnership exclusion means that the limited partners at the top will
not have to report on the accounting provisions of the companies it
owns. As a result, only portfolio companies that meet the criteria will
have to appoint a senior accounting officer. However, that excludes
some large businesses that are partnerships&#151;for instance, John
Lewis Partnership would not be covered&#151;and if there was a
partnership within a group, the partnership itself would be
carved out.</div>
<a name="09062393000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
what the consequence would be in practice. It is in the guidance notes,
but it seems to me that if the accounting arrangements for one part of
the business were not entirely certain, the company might try to hive
it off into a partnership.</div>
<a name="09062393000362"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09062393000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000449"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Am I right
in thinking that most of the large accounting firms are partnerships?
If so, they would not need to appoint a senior accounting officer,
which seems rather bizarre.</div>
<a name="09062393000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000450"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is correct. The exclusion for limited
liability partnerships is set out in the guidance notes: they are not
companies as defined by the Companies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>Act. My former employer, PricewaterhouseCoopers, would be excluded, as
would my hon. Friend the Member for Henley, who was a partner. My hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire has worked for a firm of
solicitors&#151;another partnership. If it met the criteria, it too
would be excluded. A wide range of significant businesses will be
excluded as a result of the carve-out for partnerships.</div>
<a name="09062393000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
sensible reasons why partnerships should be carved out&#151;for
example, the provision would impose upon the limited partner in a
private equity firm an obligation that probably could not be carried
out. However, the provision goes some distance beyond that by excluding
retail or professional partnerships. It would help if the Minister were
to clarify why these businesses should not be included, and why they
are carved out. Does she believe that they are inherently low risk? If
so, why are other low-risk businesses not carved out?</div>
<a name="09062393000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need some
explanation for the inconsistencies on which businesses are carved out.
I go back to my earlier point that part of the problem is that the
Government did not think the matter through. The provision was included
in the Bill at a late stage, perhaps on a whim. I do not know what whim
it was meant to satisfy; perhaps someone felt good trying to tackle
some of the tax measures that companies take, without thinking through
the process or of what the outcome would be. We need some explanation
of why partnerships and mutuals are excluded.</div>
<a name="09062393000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
also sought to deal with the question of foreign companies. Branches of
foreign companies are excluded from the provision. I know that Deutsche
bank in the UK is established as a branch and that many European
financial services businesses are based here under a branch structure.
The Economic Secretary and I have discussed before the question of
passporting, which enables companies incorporated in other European
economic area member states to operate through a branch structure in
the UK.</div>
<a name="09062393000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
spoke of ensuring that the balance sheet totalled more than &#163;2
billion, to ensure that the banks were picked up. I suspect that the
balance sheet of the UK branch of Deutsche bank would meet the
criteria. I suspect that it is quite a big taxpayer, if only through
the tax paid on staff salaries, bonuses and so on, the VAT paid on
purchases and the stamp duties paid on share transactions, but it has
been excluded. The Government need to state more clearly the nature of
the exclusions. A group with its headquarters in the UK has to sign off
tax returns and give the declaration required under schedule 46, but I
am not sure how it would be able satisfy itself about the operation of
overseas subsidiaries. We shall come to later to how the materiality
exemption in the later amendments could help those companies, but it is
clear from the guidance notes that the materiality level to which the
Government refer is not the materiality that is used in sets of
statutory accounts; it is a different, unspecified level of
materiality.</div><a name="09062393000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
expectations do the Government have of people in UK-headquartered
groups being able to sign off the way in which tax is dealt with in
their overseas subsidiaries? A company in the UK that is part of an
international group may fall within the regime and be required to
understand the tax accounting elsewhere in the group. The senior
accounting officer would have to attest to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>the sufficiency of not only the UK company&#146;s accounting
arrangements, but those of the worldwide group, and he may have little
practical or technical knowledge of
that.</div><a name="09062393000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
significant concerns arise from the tighter definition in the group of
amendments. To put the matter beyond doubt, I am not arguing that the
measure should be extended to cover branches, partnership or mutuals. I
am trying to understand why they are excluded, because that will give
some insight into the Government&#146;s thinking on the purposes of
the measures. We debated the matter in Committee of the whole House and
there are more issues to be teased out in this Committee. Depending on
the Minister&#146;s response, we may return to it on
Report.</div><a name="09062393000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000451"></a>John
Howell:</b> The guidance notes on the schedule are extremely
revealing. They state that there was previously no requirement on
anyone within a qualifying company to ensure that the underlying tax
accounting arrangements were fit for purpose. They go on to say that
this measure addresses the accountability gap. There is a huge gap
between the logic of those two statements, so it would be good to have
clarification on
that.</div><a name="09062393000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
could be a situation in which a number of different people were
responsible for this in a company. The fact that more than one person
was involved would not equate to a gap. A gap is an absence of
something, and we are yet to hear that there is the real gap to which
the guidance notes
refer.</div><a name="09062393000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to the risk-based approach of HMRC on this matter. I
have a point that follows on from the remarks made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Fareham about understanding where the detail of the
schedule came from. I get the feeling that it emerged out of
HMRC&#146;s risk framework document. I have put together risk
framework documents in the public sector, so I know that one must
identify all possible risks that might occur. It would be extremely
useful to know where this risk occurs in the HMRC risk framework and
what weighting it was given before a conclusion was reached. Our
concern comes from the guidance note in paragraph
58.</div><a name="09062393000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000452"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am struggling with the concept of a huge gap in
all these large companies that is ruining their tax affairs. How can
the auditors in those companies sign off a certificate to say that the
statement of affairs shows a true and fair view? Is this a sledgehammer
cracking a nut when there was no nut to crack in the first
place?</div><a name="09062393000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000453"></a>John
Howell:</b> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. He
has amplified my point that we are yet to be convinced that there is a
gap at all. If there was a gap, we would have expected to have heard
about it from the auditors of major companies. It is inconceivable that
companies of the size we are discussing would allow such a gap to
continue.</div><a name="09062393000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
58 of the guidance notes deals with interaction with other
countries&#146; requirements. It mentions two countries: the US and
Japan. It ends by saying that a company that is compliant with the
Japanese requirements may derive some comfort that the Japanese
procedures go some way towards satisfying the reasonable steps required
by the schedule. I cannot imagine that anyone in that situation would
get any reasonable comfort from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div>such a statement. It would be extremely helpful to understand what the
Exchequer Secretary sees as the principal differences between what is
set out in schedule 46 and what is set out in the Japanese
and US arrangements.</div>
<a name="09062393000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point relates to the interaction of the schedule and the charter that
we have just been examining. It seems to me that the schedule conflicts
with the charter, particularly on point 2, which is called
&#147;Treat you as honest&#148;. It
says:</div><a name="09062393000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
know that most people want to get things right. Unless we have a good
reason not to, we will&#148;,</div>
<a name="09062393000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">and it goes on to list
a number of things, one of which is:</div>
<a name="09062393000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;presume you are
telling us the
truth&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule goes completely against that. We have had no good reasons
advanced as to why a different treatment to point 2 of the charter
should apply. The schedule is clearly not treating the companies as
being &#147;honest&#148;. We have already seen the first of the
holes that have been driven through the charter.</div>
<a name="09062393000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
element of the charter that the schedule goes against is point 9, which
says that HMRC will
do</div><a name="09062393000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
we can to keep the cost of dealing with us as low as
possible&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
heard the Minister say that the process will not raise too many costs
on the part of companies. I simply do not believe that that will be the
case. There will be additional costs, but no justification for them has
been given.</div>
<a name="09062393000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000454"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s point about costs is right.
One of the issues here is that companies that are already compliant, or
those that are assessed as being low risk by HMRC&#151;there is a
risk-assessment process that HMRC has undertaken for these large
companies&#151;will end up incurring unnecessary additional
costs.</div>
<a name="09062393000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000455"></a>John
Howell:</b> My hon. Friend is right. These costs will be
additional costs that a company will incur, on top of what it is
already paying, simply to meet the reporting requirements.</div>
<a name="09062393000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Point 2 in
the charter goes against point 3 of the taxpayers&#146; duties, which
is about takings reasonable care when they compute their tax returns.
That shows that there is no trust in the company that is going through
the process of putting these details together.</div>
<a name="09062393000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, there are huge gaps in our understanding, which I hope that
the Minister will fill. These are real gaps, unlike the accountability
gap, in that there is absolutely nothing to provide me with any
comfort.</div>
<a name="09062393000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000456"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I thank hon. Members for their contribution
to our discussion of these amendments. I will try to address all the
points that have been made.</div>
<a name="09062393000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
overarching point is that the majority of large companies already have
appropriate tax accounting arrangements in place. I do not accept that
this measure will put an additional burden on
them.</div>
<a name="09062393000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000457"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Exchequer Secretary be more specific when
she says &#147;the majority&#148;? How many companies does she
think do not have adequate tax accounting
provisions?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 547</div><a name="09062393000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000458"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman numbers,
but I can say that there have been large companies whose tax
computations are calculated incorrectly each year, due to known
problems in the accounting system. One group of companies had system
problems every year. They could not identify the source of the problem
or satisfy HMRC that the tax computation was correct. The measure is
intended to encompass the small minority of large companies that do not
have those systems in place. For those companies, it is difficult for
either the company or HMRC to know whether the right amount of tax is
being
paid.</div><a name="09062393000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000459"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The example that the Exchequer Secretary cited was
exactly the same example that the Financial Secretary gave to the
Committee of the whole House. I asked him then if he could say how much
tax had been lost in these circumstances and he could not give me an
answer. Will the Exchequer Secretary give me an answer to that question
now?</div><a name="09062393000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000460"></a>Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000461"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We will see whether that information is available.
Part of the problem is that the examples given&#151;they often
involve &#147;a number&#148; of companies&#151;do not provide
robust justification. Perhaps the Minister will look at it another way.
A risk-assessment process goes on now for large companies. What
proportion of those companies are deemed to be high
risk?</div>
<a name="09062393000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000462"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Again, I do not have that information to
hand but I will pass it on to the hon. Gentleman. I imagine it will be
a percentage not a
number.</div><a name="09062393000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to get to the specific questions asked. Amendment 65,
which the hon. Gentleman spoke about, relates to whether a director of
a company with board responsibility should always be the senior
accounting officer. The board has overall responsibility for meeting
tax obligations. We think it is right to give businesses and boards the
responsibility and flexibility to decide who is responsible for
ensuring that the systems and processes are correct so that the board
delivers its obligations. HMRC customer relationship
managers will work with businesses to ensure that an
appropriate senior accounting officer is identified and has the
appropriate responsibility to fulfil this role. With the flexibility we
are giving business, working with the customer relationship
manager, we can ensure we meet our requirement for an appropriately
qualified person to carry out the
role.</div><a name="09062393000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000463"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I forgot to welcome the Minister to her new post and
apologise for not doing so earlier. Does she think there is a danger
that a financial director could pass the buck down to the financial
controller, who would probably have day-to-day organisational
responsibility? It will be the poor financial controller who hits the
dirt, rather than the financial director who sits on the board with all
the perks and extra bonuses, and who really should be taking the flak
because he has ultimate
responsibility?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div><a name="09062393000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000464"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Given
that the board has overall responsibility for meeting tax
obligations&#151;we are talking about systems and processes&#151;it
is for the board to decide what it wishes. The request for such
flexibility came from business. By working with the customer
relationship manager we can manage to balance both sides so that HMRC
is satisfied and we also meet the flexibility that business has asked
for.</div><a name="09062393000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000465"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister said that the customer relationship
manager would discuss with the business whether it had identified an
appropriate person to be the senior accounting officer. That seems
sensible. Does it mean, in effect, that HMRC will have a veto over whom
the business decides to appoint as a senior accounting

McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is not my understanding that he or she
will have a veto but I will clarify that
point.</div><a name="09062393000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked why we had tabled so many Government amendments in Committee.
This is part of a compliance package that was announced in the Budget.
We would all agree that it is right that all companies pay the
appropriate level of tax. We said at the Budget that we
would work with stakeholders to manage the implementation. The number
of Government amendments reflects the fact that we listened to
stakeholders in the consultation and I do not apologise for
that.</div><a name="09062393000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham raised a point about partnerships but answered
his own question. He asked whether partnerships were included and then
he said they were not. Partnerships and other unincorporated bodies are
excluded. The biggest risks are posed by corporates, so the measure is
focused on corporates, on a risk-based
analysis.</div><a name="09062393000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000467"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I knew that partnerships were excluded. It is clear
that they are and the Financial Secretary said so at the time. The
question was about why they were excluded. The Minister seems to return
to the concept of risk. Partnerships are seen to be low risk&#151;I
am not sure about the basis for deciding that&#151;but all companies,
depending on the size criteria, and whether they are high or low risk,
will have to take part in this regime. Why should low-risk companies be
part of the regime, when low-risk partnerships are outside
it?</div><a name="09062393000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000468"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As a whole, corporates pose the greatest
risk. We are seeking to minimise the burden on businesses, so we are
focusing on corporates, which is why the measure does not cover
partnerships and unincorporated large businesses.</div>
<a name="09062393000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked what would happen if the senior accounting officer of a
UK-based company was based outside the UK. I can confirm that the
information provided was correct. I was also asked to name the
companies that would be caught by the provision, but for reasons of
taxpayer confidentiality, I cannot disclose the names of particular
taxpayers. However, as a result of the amendments, about 2,000 large UK
companies will be
encompassed.</div><a name="09062393000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about the impact assessment, which was based
on the original analysis. Following the Budget, our discussions showed
that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 549</div>draft legislation was likely to encompass more companies than originally
envisaged, which is why the commitment was made to narrow the scope. We
want to ensure that the measure focuses on the area of greatest risk to
the Exchequer and that we do not impose administrative burdens on those
who pose less risk. I also say to the hon. Member for Wellingborough
that compliance with the provisions will not cause additional
difficulties to companies with robust systems in
place.</div><a name="09062393000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000469"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> When I have asked how many companies were assessed
as being high risk and how much tax had been lost, Ministers have
responded and given examples. However, I raised a further question that
the Minister has not addressed explicitly: why are branches and mutuals
excluded from the provisions, given that some operate in the same
business areas as companies, including in the financial services
sector? Should there not be a level playing field for
both?</div><a name="09062393000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000470"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We need to strike the right balance and to
apply the provision to a particular group, which is why we have
restricted the measure to the largest 2,000 companies. They pose the
greatest potential for Exchequer loss. We do not have a specific number
for high-risk companies, which the hon. Gentleman asked about, but
about 40 per cent. of companies are classified as low risk by
HMRC.</div>
<a name="09062393000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000471"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Does that mean that 60 per cent. of companies are
considered high
risk?</div><a name="09062393000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000472"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I can do the maths as well as the hon.
Gentleman. If 40 per cent. are classified as low risk, it would seem to
imply that 60 per cent. are classified as high
risk.</div><a name="09062393000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to my earlier point about why some bodies are excluded and
others are not. We have taken a risk-based approach to decide where we
think that the greatest cost to the taxpayer lies. That is the reason
behind the provision.</div>
<a name="09062393000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000473"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If the Minister believes that this is a risk-based
approach, why have a blanket inclusion for companies and a blanket
exclusion for unincorporated
businesses?</div><a name="09062393000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000474"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We are dancing on the head of a
pin.</div>
<a name="09062393000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000475"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We have not got to that point
yet.</div><a name="09062393000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000476"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We do not want to include partnerships or
public bodies, or to bring too many people into the scope of the
provision. We are focusing only on very large corporate companies. The
highest risk is in the corporate sector, although I appreciate what the
hon. Gentleman is saying: sometimes bodies operate in the same
areas.</div><a name="09062393000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000477"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> If the Government found that partnerships were
becoming high risk, would the Minister amend the legislation to bring
partnerships into the regime, or is there a technical problem that
would make that difficult?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 550</div><a name="09062393000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000478"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am not aware of a technical difficulty in
bringing partnerships into the regime. The hon. Gentleman knows as well
as I do that we always keep our legislation under review, which is why
we have a Finance Bill each year. We always seek to manage the balance
between ensuring that we have the right tax revenues and ensuring that
we are not putting too great a burden on business. I can only repeat
that it is right to focus on the area in which there is the greatest
potential for risk, which is why we have concentrated on
companies.</div><a name="09062393000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000481"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendment 219 was originally tabled by
Opposition Members and removes paragraph 2 of the schedule,
thus removing the requirement for a company&#146;s senior accounting
officer to notify the company&#146;s auditors, as well as HMRC, of
the respects in which the company&#146;s tax accounting arrangements
are not appropriate. The Financial Secretary announced our intention to
remove that requirement during the Committee of the whole House debate
on clause 92. However, the removal of paragraph 2 requires
consequential amendments throughout the schedule to remove references,
which is achieved by Government amendments 283 to 286, 293 and
299.</div><a name="09062393000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
224 and 225 are Opposition amendments and propose additional rules to
lift penalties in certain circumstances. Neither amendment should be
accepted. Amendment 224 is covered by the reasonable excuse provision
and by the formal guidance on the measure, while amendment 225 is not
entirely clear. I hope that Opposition Members will be able to offer
clarification when they speak to amendment 225, but if its intention is
to prevent a penalty from being levied in an instance where another
penalty has already been charged&#151;for  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 551</div>an incorrect return, for instance, or for late filing&#151;we cannot
accept it. The penalties under the schedule and the other tax penalties
are completely separate, and the purpose of the senior accounting
officer rules would be thwarted if there were a get-out for those who
have failed to comply with tax legislation
elsewhere.</div><a name="09062393000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 277 is a minor consequential amendment resulting from the
proposal to change the certification rules, allowing companies to
submit only one form of certificate. I think that the Committee will
agree that the text deleted by the amendment is redundant given the
move to a single form of
certificate.</div><a name="09062393000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 291 is a small, consequential amendment consistent with
Government amendments 276 and 281, clarifying which company
is relevant for determining whether a penalty is due on the senior
accounting officer. Government amendment 292 removes a potential risk
of double jeopardy by making sure that where one company, or a senior
accounting officer in a group of companies, has already been subject to
a penalty for a particular financial year, no other senior accounting
officer or company can be assessed as liable for the same period. I
hope that the Committee agrees that that is a useful safeguard limiting
the application of
penalties.</div><a name="09062393000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000482"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome the Government&#146;s acceptance of
amendment 219, which I originally tabled. When we looked at schedule
46, it was hard to see why there was a need to notify the auditors. It
seems that the relationship involved is actually that between the
taxpayer and HMRC, so such a notification seemed a fairly redundant
step. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough identified in the
previous group of amendments, the accountants or auditors of a company
would already know if the tax systems were not up to producing figures
that could be included in the accounts and that would give a true and
fair view of a company&#146;s profit and loss account for the year
and the balance sheet at the year end, so it seemed to be a redundant
step. The Government seem to be rather tardy in tabling amendments to
that. I thought that I might beat them to the punch and keep them to
their promise. I am pleased that I did so on this occasion and will do
so with the next group of amendments.</div>
<a name="09062393000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09062393000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
224 seeks to deal with the issue of what is a reasonable excuse, with
respect to failure to apply. When we debated that in the House&#151;I
will return to a specific example in the final group of
amendments&#151;the Government were extremely hard line in their
approach and were not accepting materiality. I felt that it was
important to place on record that there may be circumstances where we
cannot expect a senior accounting officer to know what was happening on
the ground and to take responsibility for that. One of the examples I
quoted demonstrates part of the problem. The VAT change was implemented
in December and, in a number of places, the reduction in VAT was
calculated manually rather than through updating a system. Why was it
the case that the senior accounting officer would know, or be able to
vouch for, the accuracy of someone doing manual calculations for that
VAT reduction? Therefore, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 552</div>I wanted to make sure that there was some definition of what was
reasonable. My amendments would add the following
words:</div><a name="09062393000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
circumstances where the failure is attributable to any matter outside
the person&#146;s control or any matter of which a person could not
reasonably be expected to be
aware.&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have heard the Minister&#146;s explanation about why she thinks that
the amendment is unnecessary and I am inclined to accept her
argument.</div><a name="09062393000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
daft, sorry, draft guidance&#151;a Freudian slip,
perhaps&#151;deals with this issue of what is reasonable. The
guidance is quite widely drafted and we need to make sure that, in
order to protect senior accounting officers, there is some degree of
certainty in the Bill. Guidance notes are helpful, but they change,
whereas the law can be changed only with the approval of the House.
That is why we have sought, where possible, to make sure that where
there are protections, they should be in the Bill and not tucked away
in guidance notes that will not receive the full scrutiny that is
offered by primary or secondary legislation. While I accept that there
is coverage in the guidance notes and I will not be pressing the
amendment to a vote, we need to be very careful that, where we are
giving some form of protection, it has a bit more standing than simply
a note in a draft
document.</div><a name="09062393000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of amendment 225, identified by the Minister, is to ensure that
where somebody is penalised for late filing of a return, they are not
doubly penalised in their capacity as a senior accounting officer.
There is a risk of multiple fines for the same offence. I am not sure
whether to push this much further with the Minister. It is important
that there are penalties in place, but the fact that someone could be
fined for the same thing twice would not strike people as particularly
fair. We would need to be careful about the circumstances in which such
penalties are levied. I accept the point about personal
responsibility&#151;there is a gap opening up between the personal
responsibility of an accounting officer and the corporate
responsibility of a business&#151;but we need to be make sure that we
do not lose sight of the fairness issue in the drive to tighten up
responsibility for
accounting.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000487"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The first group of amendments is concerned
with the certification requirement set out in the schedule, including
the requirement in the original draft for senior accounting officers to
notify the company&#146;s auditors, where needed, of the respects in
which the company&#146;s tax accounting arrangements are not
appropriate.</div>
<a name="09062393000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of certification, Opposition amendments 220,
221 and 222 all deal with the arrangements for certifying to the
commissioners of HMRC that appropriate tax accounting arrangements are
in place, or otherwise reporting the respects in which those
arrangements are not appropriate. The broad effect of the amendments is
to enable certification to be achieved by a single dual-purpose
certificate. The intention to accommodate was raised by my right hon.
Friend the Financial Secretary during the Committee of the whole House,
and parliamentary counsel was instructed accordingly. Opposition
amendment&#151;sorry, Government amendment 220 is
identical to that drafted by counsel. The associated amendments 275,
278 and 279 have the same practical effect as Opposition amendments 221
and 222. So I ask the Committee to accept amendments 275, 278 and 279,
which would make amendments 221 and 222
unnecessary.</div><a name="09062393000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000488"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am delighted that the Government have added their
name to my amendment 220. It is right for the Government to do so. That
is yet another example of the failure of the Government to think
through carefully what they were trying to achieve for business.
Instead, they created a situation in which there were two
certificates&#151;perhaps the measure was inspired by those old
telephone kiosks where one had to press A or B when making a
call.</div>

different certificates: one to say that someone had complied and one to
say someone did not comply. I could not&#151;I do not think anyone
else could&#151;understand just quite why the Government thought that
was a good idea in the first place. That is why we made the point in
the Committee of the whole House, and why we were pleased when the
Treasury conceded that point.</div>
<a name="09062393000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
grateful that the Government have taken up the issue. Once again, it
shows the merits of getting a consultation right. The Minister says,
&#147;We have listened and therefore we have changed the
Bill,&#148; but it would have been better to have listened first,
thought about the legislation and got it right first time. That would
have avoided the damage to the relationship between HMRC, the Treasury
and business as a result of putting provisions in the Bill when no one
had really thought about their practical
implications.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000494"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is the final group of amendments relating to
schedule 46. Its substance stems from the debate on materiality that we
had in the Committee of the whole House. It seems that the Government
have moved beyond the position that they enunciated then. The issue is
important because where one strikes the line on what is material in a
tax computation or a tax return determines the exposure to penalties of
the senior accounting officer. What was seen to be missing from the
legislation as drafted was any concept of materiality. We pushed the
Financial Secretary on the matter in the debate in the Committee of the
whole House. I thought, at that point, that the Financial Secretary was
loath to move. When I raised the point of materiality, he
said
that</div><a name="09062393000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;companies
already have an obligation to deliver correct and complete returns. The
measure ensures that the minority of senior accounting officers who do
not oversee systems that generate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 556</div>correct and complete computations take responsibility for addressing
that. That is the level of the bar that we envisage
applying.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 May 2009; Vol.
492, c.
886.]</div><a name="09062393000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had no
doubt that that meant 100 per cent. accuracy. I pushed the Minister
again and he came up with the same example that the Exchequer Secretary
used earlier about this apparently large company that had systemic
errors, which we have only just got to the bottom of.</div>
<a name="09062393000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, there is
an important issue of principle here. What we must bear in mind is the
obligation to keep proper accounting records that directors are already
subject to under the Companies Act 2006. Section 386 of the 2006 Act
imposes a duty to keep adequate accounting records</div>
<a name="09062393000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to disclose
with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the
company at that
time&#148;.</div><a name="09062393000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
obviously includes the tax liabilities to which the company has been
subject. There are penalties that relate to a failure to comply with
that duty. So, a mechanism is already in place to ensure
compliance.</div><a name="09062393000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill, as drafted in paragraph 16 of the schedule refers to
&#147;appropriate tax accounting arrangements&#148;. Amendment 268
seeks to provide a definition of tax accounting arrangements through
secondary legislation, so that the senior accounting officer will know
exactly what are &#147;appropriate tax accounting
arrangements&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062393000365"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09062393000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
option would be to omit the current vague definition and divert to
regulation, which would give time for proper consultation; instead, it
has been rammed into the Finance Bill, with the Department hoping that
everything works out for the best. Including a regulation-making power
would give the Treasury time to think carefully and consult business
properly; it would allow due process. Alternative methods are suggested
in amendment 226, which would inset the word &#147;reasonably&#148;
in paragraph 16(2)&#151;that would go some way to introducing the
concept of materiality&#151;and amendment 227, which would add a new
sub-paragraph.</div>
<a name="09062393000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have listened to the argument and understood the strength of
the representations made by the Committee of the whole House and others
about materiality. The draft guidance now starts to approach that
question, which I welcome. A commonly accepted definition of
materiality relates to what is in the accounting standards. However,
the final sentence of paragraph 61 of the draft guidance says of the
standards that</div>
<a name="09062393000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
should not be interpreted as imposing any higher standards than are
already required when preparing returns but neither does the phrase
&#145;in all material respects&#146; import the concept of
accountancy or audit materiality into the
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that tax return completions have to be signed off as being accurate,
why have another test on the certificate to say that the systems are
accurate? It would lead to needless duplication&#151;unless one is
introducing a new definition of materiality.</div>
<a name="09062393000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The senior
accounting officer might breathe a sigh of relief on hearing that
&#147;material respects&#148; had been introduced, but paragraph 62
of the guidance does not give anything more concrete. It
states:</div><a name="09062393000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reference to &#145;material respects&#146; along with the use of
the words &#145;appropriate&#146; and &#145;reasonable&#146;
within the legislation does however make it clear that the focus is on
the significance of the transaction, system or tax and the relative
size of these items in terms of the business.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 557</div><a name="09062393000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">No guidance has been
given on relative size. The guidance goes on to say
that</div><a name="09062393000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMRC
are not interested in small or insignificant errors and this fits with
our policy of focusing on significant
risks.&#148;</div><a name="09062393000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
no guidance is given on what is meant by &#147;small or
insignificant&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062393000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is what further clarity the Government are seeking to give through this
change. They have disregarded the conventional accounting and auditing
definition of materiality, and they have introduced some clarification
in paragraph 62 of the draft guidance; but it seems that materiality
rests somewhere between the accounting and auditing definitions. It
should be a little more significant than the language now used to sign
off tax returns and computations.</div>
<a name="09062393000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the example given by the Financial Secretary. I raised the issue of
systemic calculations, wondering whether it would be a problem if each
computation or transaction was a penny out. The guidance now reflects
that, so I can see that there has been at least some outcome from my
raising the issue. However, there is the question of what happens with
systemic errors, and how big they must be to be noted and disclosed to
Inland
Revenue.</div><a name="09062393000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a major U-turn by the Treasury, which has now accepted that maturity
has a role to play in the sign-off by the senior accounting officer. It
has been a bit more specific than the current guidance about what that
actually means in practice for
businesses.</div><a name="09062393000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 295 relates to an issue that has been raised by several
bodies that are concerned about the kind of taxes that might be brought
within the scope of the measure. No taxes were excluded from the
original clause, so the fact that the Government have been specific
about which taxes should be the focus of the accounting certificate is
welcome. To be fair to the Government, on page 5 of the guidance they
have also excluded certain taxes, duties and liabilities explicitly,
including things such as the child trust fund, life assurance premium
relief, the unclaimed asset scheme and the European savings directive,
and any requirements that come from
them.</div><a name="09062393000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the greater clarity that amendment 295 gives, but I think that
the Government need to go a little further in providing some clarity on
amendment 294 so that there is a much clearer understanding in the
minds of senior accounting officers as to what &#147;material
respects&#148; actually
means.</div><a name="09062393000296"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000495"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> This group of amendments is concerned with
the definition of &#147;appropriate tax accounting
arrangements&#148; and introduces new wording to make it absolutely
clear that the measure does not require a higher standard than that
already required to sign off tax returns as correct and complete. It
also makes it clear that HMRC&#146;s focus will be on significant
weaknesses and not on small or insignificant
amounts.</div><a name="09062393000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham spoke at length about Government amendment 294,
which changes the definition of &#147;appropriate tax accounting
arrangements&#148; and adds the words &#147;in all material
respects&#148;. The wording is careful because the intention is not
to introduce the concept of audit or accountancy materiality, as it is
not a tax concept. We have to separate them, as the hon. Gentleman
said. I make it clear that the legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 558</div>should not be interpreted as imposing any higher standards than those
already required when preparing returns, and that HMRC&#146;s focus
will be on the significance of a transaction, system or tax. It will
not be interested in small or insignificant errors. It is important to
put that on the
record.</div><a name="09062393000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked if we could be more specific in guidance
as to what the measure will mean in practice. He will be aware that
this is draft guidance. We have been working with interested parties to
develop the solution that is reflected in Government amendment 294, and
we will continue to consult on the draft
guidance.</div><a name="09062393000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000496"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am trying to think what is left as a consequence
of all the amendments. The Minister is saying that the standard is no
different from the one that already applies in signing off returns and
computations. That almost begs the question, why do we need the
certificate if all that is happening is that the senior accounting
officer will reconfirm what people signed off when they submitted
returns to
HMRC?</div><a name="09062393000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000497"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I come back to the point that I made about
using the definition of accountancy and audit materiality. That has
never applied for tax. What happens in practice is that accounts are
prepared according to materiality, but that is unpicked when the tax
finance people prepare their computations and returns. The amendment
makes it absolutely clear that the legislation does not raise the tax
bar in respect of what is required to sign off returns. That is an
important protection for senior accounting
officers.</div><a name="09062393000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman spoke about significance. We can provide more examples
of significance within the guidance; as I said, it is part of the
ongoing consultation. I welcomed the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support
for draft guidance on appropriate tax accounting arrangements and,
again, that will be subject to further consultation.</div>
<a name="09062393000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving to
amendment 295, the thrust of the schedule is to help maintain fiscal
sustainability by making the senior accounting officers of the very
largest companies and groups responsible for ensuring that they have
appropriate tax accounting arrangements in place and, as currently
drafted, the measure applies to all liabilities regardless of relative
importance. However, in some instances the associated administrative
burden, while not significant in relative terms, might be
disproportionate in relation to the size of those liabilities, which
are relatively small, therefore amendment 295 restricts the
measure&#146;s scope to specify mainstream taxes and
duty.</div>
<a name="09062393000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000498"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> At the end of what has been a lengthy debate on
four groups of amendments, I am left wondering what is left. The
Minister has now said that the standard of accuracy applied to the
certificates is no different to the standard already applied to tax
returns and computations. We are effectively asking a senior accounting
officer to confirm that what has been submitted and said was and is
still materially accurate.</div>
<a name="09062393000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000499"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The difference is that this is about the
process and the systems behind the taxes paid, and not about the amount
of tax itself.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 559</div><a name="09062393000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062393000500"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is part of the issue. A senior accounting
officer could sign off the computation as being materially accurate
only if they were content and only if their systems were accurate. We
know that HMRC has access to the systems of large companies and that it
does a risk assessment. As a senior accounting officer, I could not
sign off a tax return if I knew that the underlying systems were not
robust or able to produce correct and accurate financial
information.</div><a name="09062393000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am at a loss to think of what is left. I almost feel that the four
amendment groups have made schedule 46 a hollowed out husk. Expense
will be imposed on companies, depending on their size, but not other
types of business combination. The amount of additional comfort that
senior accounting officers are given is minimal. Given the nature of
the relationship between HMRC and large companies, which are already
risk- assessed, the Government will not get more value out of this
measure. HMRC already has access to systems as part of the Varney
review.</div><a name="09062393000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will end up with a compliance burden on companies without, as far as I
can see, additional value to HMRC. Companies may be grateful that the
Minister has listened to them, but I am not convinced where the
measures&#146; value rests. I am grateful that the Government have
listened to the concerns about materiality, because that certainly was
not the message from the Financial Secretary in the debate in the
Committee of the whole House, and that is a sign of movement. However,
moving so far on so many issues has left me questioning what the
Government have got out of schedule 46 and clause 92. As they 
have addressed the issue in amendment 264 with amendment 294, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062393000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
