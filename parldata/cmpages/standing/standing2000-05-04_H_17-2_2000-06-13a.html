</P>
<P>
On resuming-
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have delayed the start of the Division. We now have a quorum plus some, so we will return to our debate.

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> We have just had an interesting introduction to our discussion on the tonnage tax from the Opposition, Dr. Clark. If you will forgive me for saying so, they are all at sea, but it is full steam ahead from now on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Choppy waters.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> And we are in choppy waters.

<P>
The issue before us relates to the shipping industry. The Opposition seemed unable to make up their mind about whether they were in favour of the tonnage tax or against it. If they welcome the measure, they have a strange way of showing it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Before the Minister gets too involved, can I make it clear that we support the introduction of the tonnage tax?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> Move it formally.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I rest my case. I am not trying to be confrontational with anyone. It is an important subject and Opposition Members have, at least, touched on it in their comments. When the proposals were announced, the Opposition welcomed them, as did the industry and a wide range of commentators. I shall try to deal with the points that arose. Some of them are pertinent to amendments that we have not yet discussed. It might be more suitable for me to comment then.

<P>
Members of the Committee are aware of the plight of the United Kingdom shipping industry in recent years. We are a maritime nation, which is facing the prospect of reducing tonnage and a lack of the officers necessary for our ships. In the 1980s and 1990s, we saw a significant and steady decline in the size of the UK-owned and registered fleet. By 1997, it was apparent that a new strategy for British shipping was required, and the Government started to work with the shipping industry and the trade unions to produce a recipe for reinvigorating the British shipping industry. A major element of the package of measures that emerged from that process was the need to create a more favourable fiscal environment for shipping, such as a tonnage tax, which several other countries had introduced.

<P>
A comment was made about the code of conduct group and harmful tax competition. First, I would say that the code of conduct group considered the harmful tax competition that may exist between member states. It found that the tonnage tax regimes were not harmful. The hon. Members for Guildford and for Croydon, South raised queries about that, but in the debate about those issues the important thing to emerge was that, although it is important to examine the competitive relationships between member states, we must also look at the competitive relationship for the European Union as a whole. The global nature of the shipping industry means that one cannot look in isolation at the tonnage tax regimes in the European Union, whose number has been growing over the past few years. I cannot remember every member state that has a tonnage tax, but, for instance, Greece has one, as has Luxembourg, that well-known maritime nation, and the Netherlands has a very successful tonnage tax. As a result of seeing what was happening in the Netherlands, the shipping industry encouraged the Government to take a fresh look at the matter.

<P>
A major element of the regime is to provide a more favourable fiscal environment for shipping. Following discussions, Lord Alexander of Weedon was asked to produce an independent report into the case for and design of a tonnage tax for the United Kingdom, and that was announced in the 1999 Budget. The consultation undertaken by Lord Alexander was very wide ranging. I am sure that all members of the Committee will acknowledge the business skills and achievement, as well as the knowledge and expertise, that he would bring to such a discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> For the record, will the Minister confirm that she disputes the claim of the Chartered Institute of Taxation that Lord Alexander's committee failed to consult properly outside the industry?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, I dispute that claim. It ill behoves the Committee to allow aspersions to be cast on such an eminent industrialist who has achieved so much. Lord Alexander conducted that inquiry with great thoroughness.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Can I correct what I said? I believe that the institute was referring to the Government's consultations rather than to Lord Alexander's. Would the Minister dispute its claim that the Government failed to consult outside the industry?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, I do indeed dispute that-what a surprise!-and I shall set out the consultations that the Government undertook. Nobody can be in any doubt that such a tax was proposed, that draft clauses were available, that evidence was taken and that people were asked to express their views.

<P>
Lord Alexander set out a design for the tonnage tax regime that would allow the UK shipping industry to exploit our internationally renowned maritime strengths, improve training provision and compete fairly on the international stage without putting the Exchequer at risk from escalating costs. The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) asked about costs, and I shall come to that before I conclude my remarks.

<P>
Clause 81 and schedule 22 contain proposals to deliver a tonnage tax for the UK based on Lord Alexander's design. The new regime will be a major improvement in the way in which UK shipping is taxed, as I think all hon. Members have acknowledged in their contributions this evening, and will play a major part in the Government's strategy to secure the future of the UK shipping industry. Indeed, it was warmly welcomed by the shipping industry and has received cross-party support in the press.
 
<P>
Our proposals represent the fruits of extensive public consultation, particularly with representatives of the shipping industry. That is expected of us, but not exclusively. It would be a poor show to introduce proposals for a tonnage tax if we had not spoken directly to the industry and we have tried to take on board its comments.

<P>
Lord Alexander recommended that the regime should be flag-blind. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to make UK registration a precondition for joining the tonnage tax would deprive companies of the operational freedom-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they require-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in various parts of the world.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall return to flagging when we come to a later amendment.

<P>
P&O passenger ships will return to the United Kingdom flag. They are currently managed in the USA and flagged in Liberia. That is an important foundation for the development that we want to encourage in the shipping industry. There is no estimate of the number of ships that may return to the United Kingdom flag, but the Maritime and Coastguard Agency is actively encouraging United Kingdom companies to consider reflagging.

<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood and the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to a bonanza, and wanted to know how there could be a bonanza if the total revenue is £20 million. The temptation for tax avoidance would arise because tonnage tax profits are fixed by reference to tonnage. Our view and that of Lord Alexander is that unless we have the safeguards in place, additional profits from non-shipping activities could be diverted into shipping companies and sheltered from tax. Clearly, that is not desirable and it is the reason for possible and substantial future losses to the Treasury. The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that the legislation is complex. It seeks to establish a complex relationship responding specifically to our objectives for the shipping industry and protecting the Exchequer from other profits being sheltered.

<P>
At present, shipping companies can use excess capital allowances and losses to reduce tax on profits from other areas. The tax paid by shipping companies on their shipping profits is not the whole story. I must tell the right hon. Member for Charnwood that the regime outlined in the clause and schedule 22 is expected to cost around £40 million per annum.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Paymaster General explain to the Committee whether the profits or losses of a company in a tonnage tax regime are shielded and not capable of being used in or transferred to other business activities within the group, part of which may be in the regime?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that those profits that fall within the tonnage tax regime, which is, as Committee members pointed out, very generous, are protected by that regime and that other profits and losses cannot be moved into or out of it. I shall return to that matter in more detail later when we consider relevant amendments.

<P>
On the training commitment, the right hon. Member for Charnwood and the hon. Member for Croydon, South asked what benefits the UK would receive. Trainees must be UK nationals, other European Economic Area state nationals or British citizens from the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man and ordinarily resident in the UK. In view of the industry's circumstances, that is the best that can be done.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about the central fund and referred to the Maritime Training Trust, which is a charitable body that was set up by the Chamber of Shipping and the maritime trade unions. It is totally independent of the Government and the funds will be used to train seafarers. I have already explained who will qualify as a trainee.

<P>
I return to the argument of the hon. Member for Guildford, namely, that we did not consult widely enough. I refute that suggestion, which the hon. Gentleman put to us very gently. I am always amazed at his varied experience and knowledge. If he will forgive me, I hope that this evening we shall not hear about too many of his experiences in the merchant fleet-if we must, I hope that they will be repeatable and suitable for Hansard.

<P>
On consultation, the provisions were outlined in detail and issued on 23 December 1999. Since then, we have again issued a full public consultation, draft regulations and a draft statement on practice. We shall return to those matters when we consider later amendments that deal with the related and detailed aspects of the regime. It is not acceptable to say that we have not consulted widely.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about the percentage of the industry that would elect to go into the tonnage tax. I can give him only an estimate, namely, that about 75 per cent. will do so. The tonnage tax is optional and companies may wish to stay in the existing regime. He also asked about the national minimum wage. The tax will have no affect on its application.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about boosting the training of cadets. He is, I acknowledge, knowledgeable in this area, and he will know that British seafarers' skills and experience make a vital contribution to many sectors of our economy. That national resource has been severely eroded in the long term, and a shortfall in training and recruitment means that we need to regenerate the UK's maritime skill base. That was a major theme of the tripartite shipping working group and remains a key objective of the Government's shipping policy. I bow to the expertise of other Committee members in this regard, but as I understand it, an age cohort of officers are moving through the industry, many of whom are not far from retirement, and it is not clear who will replace them. If the benefits of the tonnage tax were used for training, we should connect the two main pillars of our policy.

<P>
The hon. Members for Guildford and for Torridge and West Devon asked about regulations and practices for dealing with deferred tax. We understand from shipping industry representatives who have sought accountancy advice that, even under the new accountancy standards, tonnage tax will remove deferred tax liabilities in respect of shipping activities. However, I shall look closely at that matter and if that does not answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, I shall come back to him. This regime is based on the design recommended by Lord Alexander. It will provide a sensible balance between immediate write-off of balancing charges-which would have been costly to the Exchequer-and a phasing out over the term of the 10-year election. That will strike the right balance for those issues.

<P>
Several other matters were raised and I shall try to deal with them speedily. A question was asked about immigration laws in relation to the tonnage tax. No special immigration laws apply to the tax, but to come within the regime a company's ship must be strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom. This is the subject of one of the amendments and we shall be able to explore it more fully when we debate that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about double taxation treaty partners. The tonnage tax regime does not introduce a new type of tax; it merely allows companies opting into the regime to commute their profits on the basis of the tonnage of the ships that they operate, rather than accounting profits. This is an alternative way of making them subject to corporation tax and I see no reason why our treaty partners should not accept that corporation tax paid on tonnage tax profits is no different, for the purposes of the double taxation agreement, from corporation tax paid on accounting profits.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> On double taxation, I take it that there has been some liaison between the Treasury, or the Inland Revenue, and our major trading partners in relation to their understanding of this tax, especially our partners in the United States.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Many of our partners in double taxation treaties-of which we have the largest network, comprising more than 100-indicate that that has never caused problems before and should not do so in future. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the discussions on the United States double taxation treaty are continuing and the negotiations are long drawn out and complex.

<P>
The final points raised by hon. Members concerned consultation on the minimum training obligation. That obligation was developed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions with the Chamber of Shipping and the maritime trade unions. The description of the scheme was published in the Inland Revenue's consultation pack issued on 24 December 1998, and the draft DETR legislation was published in the Inland Revenue consultation pack of 17 May 2000. The negotiations for that training agreement, which again are subject to later amendments, are between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the industry.

<P>
I hope that I have dealt with the hon. Gentlemen's initial comments on the proposal and that, notwithstanding some of their misgivings and reservations, they will agree that it is a much-needed proposal for the British shipping industry and will support the clause. We shall pick up some of the points in more detail as we go through the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I begin by assuring the Paymaster General that nothing in my experiences in the Merchant Navy could possibly embarrass a Member of Parliament for Bristol. [Laughter.]

<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I missed that last comment because everyone was laughing. Could I ask the hon. Gentleman for an action replay so that I can share the joke?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. St. Aubyn, if you would like to repeat the comment, we shall laugh again.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It was a very simple point. I said that nothing in my experiences as a member of the Merchant Navy could cause the Paymaster General any embarrassment. However, she should perhaps be embarrassed by the experience of the Deputy Prime Minister. His enthusiasm for the Merchant Navy has now clearly infected the entire Treasury team, so that old Labour is today gaining an advantage for the old economy that new Labour is seeking to take away from the new economy-a tax-favourable regime.

<P>
I refer the Paymaster General to the Inland Revenue's explanatory note on the clause. Paragraph 1 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This favourable new regime is being introduced to help deliver the Government's aim of encouraging the British shipping industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can we take it from that that the unfavourable new regime being introduced for so many of Britain's multinational companies by schedules 30 and 31 is intended to deliver the Government's aim of discouraging other sectors of British industry? Is that the consistency of approach that we take from what the Government have said so far? The Paymaster General has said nothing about the inconsistency between her attitude to the shipping industry-we support the aims to make the tax regime attractive-and her attitude and that of the Treasury team to other parts of international business based in Britain, as revealed in the approach that we shall scrutinise in schedules 30 and 31.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thought that I should stay in order, Dr. Clark, and discuss the matter before us rather than move full steam ahead to later parts of the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman has done. The hon. Gentleman knows that the Budget contains a range of measures designed to enhance and encourage UK competitiveness. Is he telling the Committee that the future of shipping is not a matter of concern to us, as a maritime nation, now and in the future? I think not. His point is on the record and I am sure that he will want to make it again when we reach the schedules to which he referred, but it would perhaps be right for me to stay in order and on schedule 22.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is the first time that the House has had the opportunity to debate the tonnage tax and this is in the nature of a Second Reading debate on it. This is the only time that I can press the Minister on a couple of matters, which she slightly went round in her response. However, I appreciated her response, which I thought was detailed and dealt with the majority of the points.

<P>
The first point is the minimum wage, which, as the Paymaster General will know from her consultation, is a significant issue. Will she clarify whether the minimum wage regulations will be waived for low-paid seamen who find themselves under British jurisdiction? If the Paymaster General does not know, I am happy for her to write to me about it.

<P>
Secondly, the Paymaster General said that immigration rules do not apply to the tonnage tax. That is an important point, because the object is to attract people into the United Kingdom so as to promote the British maritime industry. Many people may fall foul of the immigration rules. For example, India has one of the largest fleets in the world and many Indian people may want to come to this country. Will a special regime, integrated with the tonnage tax, be established? I was informed that that was another matter that arose in the consultation.

<P>
Thirdly, on the fund into which companies may pay in lieu of the minimum training requirement, the Paymaster General said that it would be used for the training of seafarers. How will that be put into effect? Will a college be established for the training of cadets, or will an existing organisation be expanded? Exactly how will the money be used and how will it enhance training arrangements?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have given the hon. Gentleman an answer on the national minimum wage and am not aware of any further implications. I am happy to write to him about it, as he suggested.

<P>
On immigration, the normal immigration rules apply. I explained the training commitment and who would qualify under it.

<P>
His final point on training is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and I shall need to investigate it in a little more detail before I respond. The Maritime Training Trust is established, and the way in which the money is used will be decided by the trustees-that is, the Chamber of Shipping and the trade unions. There will be no Government intervention in that; it will form part of the training agreement negotiated by the DETR. That is my understanding of the matter, but I do not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman and, if I am wrong, I shall correct it on the record. In any event, I shall write to him about the matters that he raised.

<P>
This has been our first major opportunity to discuss the tonnage tax-although the right hon. Gentleman could have tabled it for discussion in Committee of the whole House and chose not to do so.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 81 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Tonnage tax</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 299, in page 414, line 39, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
The amendment would ensure that the Treasury provides further opportunities for companies to elect to join the tonnage tax regime. Companies must elect to join the regime within 12 months of Royal Assent or within 12 months of becoming eligible. After that, there is no opportunity to join, which strikes us as a little harsh. The Government should consider the approach that is taken in the Netherlands, where companies are given a further opportunity to join the scheme.

<P>
A company with a fleet that is 74 per cent. time chartered might, because of the 75 per cent. limit, be worried about going over the top and therefore hesitate before joining the regime. Alternatively, it might be excluded from the regime due to its offshore activities, which are liable to change. The mix of activities in a group might mean that there is no benefit in entering the scheme at an early stage, although that might change. A company may have tax losses in shipping that it wants to sort out before joining the regime. A company might be eligible for the scheme and find it unattractive at first but more attractive later. I am happy for the Paymaster General to make the entry point as tough as she likes, but a second option might be appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have a simple point to put to the Paymaster General. I would imagine that the Bill always allows a new company, group or consortium to elect for tonnage tax treatment within a period after its formation, whenever that may be. I look forward to hearing from her on that point.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The time at which new companies can enter the tonnage tax is the subject of the Government amendment that we will discuss next.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I referred also to new consortiums.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The simple answer to his question is that new businesses can elect within the 12 months of first qualifying. In discussions with the industry, we considered all the issues that may occur. We and the industry are satisfied that the schedule, once amended, will deal with all those points.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South is changing tack. In his opening remarks under the stand part debate on the clause he almost complained that we were too generous and were giving too much leeway. Now he wants to build more elasticity into the system. His proposal is not desirable at this point because, by changing ``may'' to ``shall'', it imposes a definite obligation on the Treasury to make an order offering a window of opportunity for entry into the tonnage tax. That would tie the hands of this and future Governments.

<P>
I am aware that the Dutch tonnage tax regime includes provision for another window of entry 10 years after the first one and that United Kingdom companies would like reassurance that those windows will be offered in our regime too. In recognition of that, we have built a flexible approach into the legislation, saying that the Treasury may, by order, provide future windows of entry at any time. That gives this and future Governments the option of offering entry windows at the 10-year point, or earlier or later, if that seems appropriate and as the tonnage tax develops. However, we do not believe that the question of future windows of entry should be pre-judged. The hon. Gentleman's comments on the clause 81 stand part debate lead me to believe that he would concur. By suggesting some possible difficulties, he flagged up-I am sorry, but once one starts one rolls ahead-some questions about the regime.

<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the Government believe that there should be future windows of entry. We need to decide when the time to provide them is right, which is why we have given ourselves powers under Treasury orders. I am afraid that I could not agree to the proposals, which he rightly said were unique. I cannot endorse an amendment that would require us to say that there must be future windows of entry. I hope that he accepts our commitment to saying that there will be some, in parallel with an understanding of how the tonnage tax develops, whether it achieves our objectives and has advantages.

<P>
It would be foolish at present to tie any future Government to an absolute commitment to provide a future window of entry. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If he feels unable to, I shall ask the Committee to oppose it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General accuses me of changing my position. I am not sure what she is driving at, as I thought that I had been moderately consistent throughout. The job of opposition is to provide constructive opposition, which is what we seek to do. If there is a perceived change of position, it is to test the Government's attitude to an amendment and a position.

<P>
I welcome the Paymaster General's remarks about considering the subject again. She said that the Government believe that there should be an opportunity to provide another window, which is tantamount to accepting our amendment. None the less, I find that a perfectly adequate response, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 310, in page 415, line 26, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`This is subject to paragraph 38(2)(a) and (b) (effect in certain cases of exceeding the 75% limit on chartered in tonnage).'.-[Dawn Primarolo.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 300.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> Move it formally.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 300, in page 416, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The elements of management activity to be taken into account in determining whether strategic and commercial management is carried out in the UK will include:

<P>
(i) managing the bunkers, provisioning and victualling requirements

(ii) route planning

<P>

<P>
(vii) technical management including making decisions on the repair and maintenance of vessels

<P>
(viii) whether the vessel is flagged in the UK.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I always know that the Government are getting a bit edgy when the Whip says, ``Formally''. I suggest that he pipes down.

<P>
The amendment goes to the root of the shipping companies' process for making the decision to opt into the tonnage tax regime. I am sure that the Paymaster General has spotted that it would incorporate paragraph 29 of the draft statement of practice into the legislation on a statutory basis. At the heart of it is a graphic description of what is meant by strategic and commercial management of vessels in the United Kingdom. It is detailed, mentioning the managing of bunkers, route planning, personnel management and decisions on purchase and charter. Such issues are central to the British shipping industry and it seems to us that their inclusion removes any uncertainty that they might change. If the Inland Revenue decides to do so, it can change the draft statement of practice and the definition of strategic and commercial management of shipping will alter. As the Minister will know, this is a one-off election: once in, one is in for 10 years. It would be highly unsatisfactory if a company made a 10-year decision on a set of criteria that could be altered. In our judgment, those criteria should be given a statutory basis in the Bill to provide the certainty that the industry requires.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendment would insert in primary legislation the factors to be considered in deciding whether ships are strategically and commercially managed in the UK. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment as it presents a less flexible approach than is provided for in our current rules. I shall try to explain why that is the case.

<P>
I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman's argument that the concept of strategic and commercial management is a new one for UK tax law. The elements of management activity mentioned in the amendment will be taken into account in deciding whether strategic and commercial management is carried out in the UK. As he rightly said, that has already been made plain in the draft Inland Revenue code of practice, published on 17 May. However, it is inappropriate to describe how that concept should be interpreted in primary legislation, as the amendment seeks to do.

<P>
The concept is a new one and we have no experience in applying that test. The Inland Revenue and representatives of the shipping industry will discuss what elements it might be best to consider. It may be incomplete or contain elements that would give a perverse result if they had to be considered in every case. Leaving the term undefined in the primary legislation leaves scope for it to be interpreted in a common-sense fashion and allows for the interpretation to evolve alongside the shipping industry itself. The amendment would remove that scope for flexibility. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<P>
The requirement for ships to be strategically and commercially managed in the UK comes from the European Commission's guidelines on the state aid in the maritime transport sector. The concept is not defined in those guidelines or elsewhere. In the absence of a definition, the term has to be interpreted in a common-sense way, as I said. We have discussed that with the industry, but there is always a risk that that approach may not work perfectly in practice and may have to be amended and also that European guidelines on how the concept should be applied may develop. By leaving the definition of strategic and commercial management undefined in the Bill, we have greater flexibility to adapt that interpretation as required and in consultation with the industry.

<P>
While I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument about wanting certainty for the industry, defining the concept might inadvertently make a straitjacket or introduce elements that are not workable or suitable, which I am sure that he would not want. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment. Otherwise, I will have to ask the Committee to oppose it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We would not want the Paymaster General to have to do that. To put the argument the other way round, if the definition of strategic and commercial management changes under the circumstances that she described will the ships that enter the regime be allowed to leave it, as the basis on which they made their commercial decision has changed?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not clear in my mind about the question that the hon. Gentleman is asking. If a company has elected to enter the tonnage tax regime, the current criteria will apply. We are considering future decisions on the tonnage tax regime and entry to it, and how our interpretation of strategic and commercial management, which the industry shares, works. A definition in primary legislation would make it much more difficult for the Government to react. I am not sure that the point made by the hon. Gentleman applies to those who have already elected to enter the tonnage tax regime. It is a question of flexibility for the future. The concepts being used for full entry into the scheme have been set out and agreed with the industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General is answering only half of my point. I recognise that shipping companies will look at the requirements in the code of practice and decide on that basis whether to enter the regime. If those requirements change, the regime may no longer suit them, and they may want to leave it.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> With respect-I am happy to consider the point in more detail-they would already be in the tonnage tax regime, so the criteria are already laid down. The hon. Gentleman asks whether different criteria may apply in the future to those who are already in the regime. Without a crystal ball, I cannot say. However, those who enter the tonnage tax now do so on the basis of the current criteria. There is no prospect of a change in requirements at present, but if something unforeseen occurred we would have to discuss the implications sensitively with the shipping companies, as we have done all along. I do not want to raise the prospect of a problem, as I do not anticipate one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> As I understand it, unless paragraph 17 is invoked, if a company ceases to fulfil the tonnage tax criteria, it falls out of the tonnage tax regime.

<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is for companies that have entered the tonnage tax regime under the strategic and commercial management criteria. The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked what would happen to the companies already in the regime if, at some later date, the rules for compliance changed. Unless he can cite an example of how the rules might be changed, it is difficult to answer his question accurately because we accept that companies will enter the regime and be elected for 10 years on the basis of the present rules.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is easy to give an example. The Minister knows that there are eight criteria, but that companies do not have to meet all eight to qualify. Under the code of practice, the more elements carried out in the United Kingdom, the more likely it is that the company will be accepted as satisfying the test. That implies that companies would qualify if they meet six of the eight criteria.

<P>
Let us suppose that a Greek shipping company is flying the Greek flag and operating in London, but that the rules change so that it is mandatory for companies to meet all of the eight criteria-in other words, the ship must fly the United Kingdom flag. That would be an example of a change in the requirements.

<P>
It was interesting when the Minister said that she would discuss such matters sensibly with the industry. On the assumption that the Government would not enter into discussions unless there was a reason for doing so, the hon. Lady's response is not a bad answer.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In that case, I shall quit while I am ahead. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would answer my question about what would happen if all eight criteria were made compulsory.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The question is whether entry into the tonnage tax regime will require all eight criteria to be met. I shall try to give some examples of certain companies, but I cannot give a precise answer now. If all the management activities of a wholly United Kingdom shipping company were carried out in the UK, it would meet the criteria. If a company has no commercial presence in the United Kingdom apart from its registered office and occasional board meetings, it will not satisfy the requirements.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about combinations. Let us suppose that an international group operates a quarter of its fleet from the United Kingdom. All the technical management of its worldwide fleet is carried out in the UK, but its personnel management is administered in the far east. The booking system for vessels is internet based and used via a computer in north America, but United Kingdom staff contribute a quarter of the worldwide bookings. The operational board includes directors who are based in London, but meets at various locations around the world. The UK ship-operating company would probably pass the test, as sufficient activity is carried out in the UK in relation to its share of the ships. I have tried to give an example of what happens if there is a combination of factors. It is not a straight, clear test. I hope that I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's point.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 301, in page 417, line 39, after ``tonnage'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which is registered in the United Kingdom and is'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a probing amendment to discover why the proposals are flag-blind. In 1999, the Deputy Prime Minister announced his package for British shipping. The press release stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Prescott package will boost British shipping<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and announced
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a powerful package of measures to put British shipping back on the world maritime map.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The release went on to state that the Government would develop United Kingdom maritime skills, and that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the most important day for British shipping for generations''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also said that more vessels would fly the red ensign and that the package would have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>far-reaching benefits for the rest of Britain.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>announcing the revival of maritime Britain<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and there would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>more ships under the British flag<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and more repair work for the British fleet. I am not sure how that final point crept into the release.

<P>
The release was written in 1999, when spinning was still the order of the day for the Labour party-I read in the papers this morning that spinning is out and reality is in.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> That is the spin.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was going to say that we may no longer get this type of press release, but the Whip tells me that they could continue to happen.

<P>
The measure was sold as a matter for British shipping, which was right. However, the proposals are flag-blind and may have a substantial interest for non-British vessels. That is the point that I made under the previous amendment. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the proposals are British; in truth, London and Britain in general will become a tax haven for any shipping company in the world that elects to comply with the criteria. The Government could do well to acknowledge that and welcome it.

<P>
Maritime London is doing well without the tonnage tax regime. A lot of foreign shipping companies whose representative offices and agencies are based here operate vessels that are not under the British flag or anything remotely to do with it. The provisions represent a tax break for those companies. That is the way it is, however. London is the world's maritime centre, and will go on being so. We put the probing amendment down to draw attention to the fact that the proposals are flag-blind.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for assisting me in drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that the proposals are flag-blind, as Lord Alexander recommended that they should be.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has twice referred to Lord Alexander's report. Will she tell us to which paragraph she refers?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will, as soon as I remember, or am assisted to remember. The answer is 17-I remembered sooner than I thought I would.

<P>
I am sure that we all share the desire for an increase in the number of ships flying the red ensign, but the amendment would not achieve that. Under the current tax system, when a ship is bought the capital allowances given on it are likely to outweigh the profits it makes in the early years; for tax purposes, it will make a loss. It would be tax efficient for companies to keep such vessels outside tonnage tax and use the tax losses to soak up tax liabilities on other activities. By making vessels flagged outside the United Kingdom non-qualifying for tonnage tax, we would allow companies to do just that. A company in a group must bring all its qualifying ships within the tonnage tax. If foreign-flagged vessels were non-qualifying, they would remain outside the regime. The perverse result would be that tonnage tax companies would flag their newest tonnage elsewhere and would put it on the UK register only once the level of capital allowances dropped off. Therefore, despite the desires that the hon. Gentleman shares with us about the proposals, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am pleased that the Paymaster General's memory was restored halfway through her speech, which gave me a chance to re-read paragraph 17. I did not think that a recommendation had been made for a flag-blind measure. Paragraph 17 does not say that. It says that to insist on UK registration
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would deprive companies of the operational freedom in various parts of the world which they understandably seek.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is stretching matters to say that that constitutes a recommendation for a flag-blind measure. It merely says that there will be trouble. In my judgment, there is a difference between relying on the report as authority for a recommendation that the Government had reluctantly to accept, and highlighting problems. It would be possible to avoid those problems if the Government wanted to.

<P>
None the less, the Paymaster General has put her explanation on record. She has probably reached the right conclusion, but for the wrong reasons. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 419, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) For the purpose of the regulations, a company's tonnage shall exclude all ships that satisfy the following conditions:

<P>
(a) the ship is chartered-in; and

<P>
(b) the ship's owner is a company in the tonnage tax regime.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is designed to avoid double-counting ships for the purpose of the annual training requirement. It is common practice in the shipping industry for a vessel to be owned by one company and chartered by another. Under the group arrangements, it would be possible for both to be subject to the tonnage tax regime. The amendment is simply a suggestion that in such circumstances two training commitments should not have to be made.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. An important principle of the tonnage tax regime is that the company that enjoys the benefits of entering a ship into the regime should in return accept a seafarer training obligation. Ships entered into the tonnage tax regime may be owned, chartered, operated directly by the company or operated on behalf of another company. In each case, the training obligation will attach to each company that benefits from the regime. In the case of two independent tonnage tax companies, one of which charters a vessel to the other, both companies will benefit, so both should accept an obligation to contribute to seafarer training. In the case of a group of companies that charters vessels internally between group companies, the group will benefit only once, so the training obligation will attach to the group only once.

<P>
The amendment confuses ships and beneficiaries. It would allow a company to opt out of its training obligation-while still enjoying the benefits of the tonnage tax regime-in respect of a ship that it chartered in from another tonnage tax company. Furthermore, if the ship were chartered in on bareboat terms, neither the owner nor the company chartering in would contribute to the training of seafarers. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman desired that effect. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if he presses it to a vote. The tonnage tax is clear. The benefit from it requires an obligation to provide training, as is clearly set out in the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General gave an answer that I did not expect. She said that the Government had intended this effect; I thought that there had been an error. I leave the Government to face the perils of the industry, which will express its displeasure. The provision strikes us as pretty harsh, but we do not seek to divide the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 426, line 20, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and

<P>
(c) any trading income, such as the rebate of rentals, arising on the disposal of an interest in a ship, provided that the income does not arise from a trade consisting in the purchase and sale of ships.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 304, which was to have been grouped with this amendment, got things the wrong way round. As I notified the Paymaster General this morning, rather than including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any revenue from the transporting of oil,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it should have excluded it. I hope that she has had the chance to consider the matter in the light of that difference.

<P>
There are clear definitions of the relevant shipping profits that are included in the tonnage tax regime. The schedule describes tonnage tax activities, qualifying activities, qualifying secondary activities and incidental activities, which all have a different status. If they fall within the criteria, they will effectively be exempt from corporation tax as we know it and will simply qualify for tonnage tax.

<P>
Amendment No. 303 deals with trading income that we feel may have been left out, although the Paymaster General may tell me that it has already been covered. It is common in the sale of ships for there to be rebates that will go on the balance sheet, and it requires consideration as to whether they come under the regime.

<P>
Amendment No. 304 was intended to exclude any revenue from the transportation of oil. It is common in the oil industry-the draft code of practice alludes to it in paragraphs 57 and 58 under the heading ``Merchant Venturers''-for the owner of a ship to load the oil on the ship and to sail it off in the general direction of a market, not knowing exactly where it is going or what price will be achieved. In some circumstances, a profit can be made on the sale of that oil, which will generally appear on the balance sheet of the shipping company. I am keeping it simple, because it is a complex subject. The Government are alert to the issue, which they address in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the code of practice, but the code of practice is not clear enough about it; it misses the point about the element of oil profit that can be derived by a shipping company. It would help us if the Minister would say how the code could be tightened up to deal with the matter.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hoped that, before he sat down, the hon. Gentleman would point out that amendment No. 304 is defective; as he did not do so, I shall do so from the Chair. Amendment No. 304 will not be debated; we are debating amendment No. 303 only.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I shall speak only to amendment No. 303.

<P>
I am advised by the Inland Revenue that any trading income arising from the disposal of a qualifying ship, such as a rebate of rental, would be treated as relevant shipping income. The acquisition and disposal of qualifying ships is a ship-related activity that is a necessary and integral part of a business operating qualifying ships. Any trading income connected with such activity is included in the relevant shipping profit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Did I hear the Paymaster General correctly when she said that the gains from the purchase and sale of ships were part of the income of the tonnage tax company and that therefore any gains or profits from the sale of ships falls into account only for tonnage tax purposes?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall speak up, because the hon. Gentleman asked me to do so earlier. I said that trading income arising from the disposal of a qualifying ship, such as a rebate of rentals, would be treated as relevant shipping income; the acquisition and disposal of qualifying ships is a ship-related activity that is a necessary and integral part of a business operating qualifying ships. Any trading income connected with such activity is included in the relevant shipping profit.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked a question about the sale of oil. Although we are not speaking to amendment No. 304, he alluded to the transporting of oil. However the amendment was framed, it would do nothing to affect the taxation of profits made on the sale of oil. Profits from the sale of oil are already excluded from the regime by the ring-fencing provisions. How they apply to the operation of merchant venturers in the oil industry is set out in the draft Inland Revenue statement of practice on 17 May; it is still subject to consultation, to which I hope that the hon. Gentleman will respond.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have had satisfactory answers to my questions on the amendment under discussion and on the amendment that was not selected. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 305, in page 427, line 42, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and, in the case of non-trading income falling within sub-paragraph (2)(a), any such income that can be shown to arise from the short-term investment of surplus working capital from core qualifying activities or qualifying secondary activities'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment relates to investment income as an incidental qualifying activity. Page 29 of the appendix to Lord Alexander of Weedon's report, sets out the framework for a tonnage tax under the paragraph heading ``Inclusions and Exclusions''. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>investment income (other than short-term investment of working capital)  must be isolated and subject to normal corporation tax<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment follows that proposal, because the Bill does not. Will the Paymaster General explain why she has not accepted Lord Alexander's recommendations?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The tonnage tax is intended as a alternative method for computing shipping profit. We recognise that shipping companies have other income apart from their shipping profit; such income remains chargeable to tax under the normal rules. The hon. Gentleman asks me why; it would be outside the scope of the European rules on state aid for us to extend the benefits of the tonnage tax to investment income, even if that investment income arises from short-term investment of surplus working capital. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, which would be incompatible with the proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Lord Alexander of Weedon made a proposal which the hon. Lady says would fall foul of European Union regulations; that is obviously something of which Lord Alexander was unaware. If that is the case, there is not much to be done about it. I have not heard that Lord Alexander has changed his mind about it, or recognised that he was wrong. However, there is no point in continuing our dialogue on the proposals and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 306, in page 429, line 20, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and ending before or on the company's exit from tonnage tax'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
When a company enters the tonnage tax regime, it sometimes has on arrival trading losses that cannot be utilised. It is perfectly reasonable that the company should be allowed to utilise those losses when it leaves the tax regime. It seems logical that a company going in and out of a regime should be in the same position when it comes out, as if it had not been in the regime in the first place. The proposal to reinstate trading losses is entirely consistent with that. I would be grateful to hear the Minister's reaction.

<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The tonnage tax regime is an alternative way of computing a company's profits from qualifying shipping activities. As such, it replaces the whole normal measure of profit, including all the reliefs and deductions that would normally be available. Had the company not elected to enter tonnage tax, it would almost certainly have used up all the available pre-tonnage tax losses during the following 10 years.

<P>
Reinstatement of 10-year-old losses would put a company coming out of tonnage tax in a better position than a similar company that stayed outside the regime. Clearly, we do not want that. Once a company has left tonnage tax, it should be broadly in the same position as similar companies that never entered it. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. It simply would not be reasonable to allow the situation that I have described to arise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Now the Minister has really got me. Her explanation seems to be exactly what I was asking for, but she asks me to withdraw the amendment. If she wants a company to be in exactly the same position when it leaves the regime, as if it had not been in the regime, surely she should accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, because the company would have used up what was available in the 10 years that it was in the tonnage tax regime. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would allow the company to enter tonnage tax in an advantageous position. On leaving tonnage tax, the company would be in the same position as if it had not been in the regime. That is not acceptable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> But the losses had been incurred before the company entered the regime. It then has nothing to set the losses against. Surely the company should be allowed effectively to carry over those losses. I am not willing to divide the Committee. The Minister is shaking her head like hard-hearted Hannah, but the amendment is a perfectly reasonable proposal. Once again, I leave her to the tender mercies of the shipping industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South might not know the answer to my question, but it would be interesting to hear what the Paymaster General has to say. Let us say that there are rolled-up losses when the company enters the tonnage tax regime. When the company comes out of that regime, those rolled-up unutilised losses should still be available for the income thereafter. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman agrees.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Yes, that is the gist of the amendment, and I am grateful for support from the Liberal Democrat Benches. We shall not divide, but I suspect that the shipping industry was looking for that provision. The Government will have to face the consequences of their approach. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 307, in page 431, line 11, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Where a company fails to issue a notice within the prescribed period the company shall be liable to a penalty of £100.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under part VII of the schedule, there is a duty to give notice when a transaction that is not at arm's length is completed. It struck us that there should be a penalty for failing to do that. Although I am not comfortable about suggesting that we make criminals of my many friends in the shipping industry, the penalty is fairly modest at £100. Why is there no sanction for failing to issue a notice?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman called me hard-hearted Hannah in the previous debate, but now he is trying to impose penalties, albeit modest ones.

<P>
I understand the rationale behind the amendment. The threat of such a penalty would encourage companies to issue the requisite notice. However, it would be difficult in practice to decide when to levy such a penalty. The Inland Revenue could not reasonably be expected to check that every party connected to every tonnage tax company had received the notice.

<P>
Paragraph 60 makes it clear that it is the tonnage tax company's responsibility to notify connected parties that the transfer pricing provisions may affect them. It is unrealistic for the Inland Revenue to check whether a company has done that. Therefore, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment. He suggested an interesting but impractical idea.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Is the Minister saying that she is confident that notices will be issued? What enforcement procedure will be followed if they are not? There is a statutory requirement. We have been unable to have so many provisions included in the Bill. Should not it provide an appropriate way of enforcing that requirement?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am confident that the companies understand their obligations and will comply with the measure. The amendment is simply unworkable. If the hon. Gentleman is imploring me to go away and seek out a method of imposing a penalty on companies that fail to issue a notice, I take note of his comments. However, I currently see no practical way of implementing a penalty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Has the Minister remembered one or two more points to make?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I got my response right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> There is no point in pressing the issue, as we have made our point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 309, in page 433, line 26, at end insert-
 `Chargeable gains: disposal of shares in tonnage tax companies<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>65A.-(1) Where a tonnage tax company disposes of shares in another tonnage tax company (``company A''), the chargeable gain or loss shall be equal to the gain or loss which would have accrued if the shares had been disposed of immediately before company A became a tonnage tax company.

<P>
(2) Where a tonnage tax company disposes of shares in a non-resident company (``company B'') that satisfies the conditions in sub-paragraph (3) below, the chargeable gain or loss shall be equal to the gain or loss which would have accrued if the shares had been disposed of immediately before company B first satisfied those conditions.

<P>
(3) The conditions are-

<P>
(a) that the conditions in paragraphs 49(2)(a) and 49(2)(b) are satisfied;

<P>
(b) that the 75 per cent. limit is not exceeded in relation to the overseas company; and

<P>
(c) that all the income of the overseas company is such that, if it were a tonnage tax company, it would be relevant shipping income.

<P>
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)(b), the ``75 per cent. limit'' has the meaning given in 49(3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have decided that I could have drafted amendment No. 309 better, so I will speak to amendment No. 308 only.

<P>
The amendment would prevent companies from being taxed on gains accrued when an asset was not in the United Kingdom tax net. Part of the object of the regime is to attract foreign investment into the UK, and foreign vessels may fall within the scope of that regime. Capital gains tax liability may have accrued before it comes into the UK tax net; it may go into the tonnage tax regime and gain certain exemptions. If the vessel is subsequently sold, because it falls under the UK regime, there is a hangover liability for capital gains tax that arose while the vessel was not under UK jurisdiction. In those circumstances, it is unreasonable for tax liability to arise for the period during which the vessel was not under UK jurisdiction. The amendment's purpose is to rectify that problem and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We are dealing with the chargeable gains when an asset is held outside the scope of a UK tax. I appreciate that it is a common concern for companies considering a move to the UK. It is not especially a tonnage tax problem, but it has been brought to the fore because the tonnage tax regime is making several shipping companies consider relocating to the UK.

<P>
There is no good reason to treat shipping companies differently from other migrant companies. The potential liability to tax on bonds may appreciate abroad, but tonnage tax companies will have the benefit of a time apportionment to exclude that part of the gain relating to the period of tonnage tax regime. Tonnage tax can reasonably be expected to relate only to the company's period of election into the regime and should not treat migrant companies more favourably than UK companies in respect of gains attributed to the pre-tonnage tax period. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman again, but for those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That was not quite the answer that I was expecting. The industry thought that there might be some movement on the issue, but the Minister has confirmed that there will be no further changes. That is an unattractive position for foreign companies seeking to relocate in the United Kingdom. If a gain that has accrued is subject to capital gains tax, it will swamp the potential benefits that might have accrued through the tonnage tax regime. That is not a possibility, but a certainty. It is always attractive to enter a tax-exempt regime, especially when a capital allowance regime runs alongside it. Having this sort of penalty, which could run to hundreds of thousands of pounds, hanging over the regime makes a mockery of all the effort that the Government have put into setting up a regime. I wonder whether the Minister has fully taken into account the implications of her position.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am fully aware of them and I have given assurances to the industry that it is not a tonnage tax matter. Companies engaging in a variety of sectors are attracted to the UK for a variety of reasons; such companies have to take care that they do not come here with a potential capital gain attributable to a previous period. Tonnage tax is already a generous scheme, so it would be unreasonable to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> As I have said on previous amendments, the Government will have to live with the consequences of that draconian line which could have a serious effect on the success of the regime-a success that hangs in the balance. Even Ministers have admitted their uncertainty about whether it will work. They do not know how many ships will come into the regime. Capital gains tax on a ship is common and could dramatically tip the scales against the success of the proposal. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 293, in page 437, leave out lines 18 to 25 and insert-

<P>
When a company joins the regime, the disposal of assets could lead to a tax charge for a number of years. The amendment reduces the taper from seven years to five years. [
Interruption.] I hear a harrumph from my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin); I assure him that it has nothing to do with the tapers that he was talking about earlier. The Chamber of Shipping favours a clean break, like that of the Dutch regime. Perhaps the Minister could explain why there is such a long phase-out for vessels that have entered the regime. They have virtually to come out of the other side of the tonnage tax regime before they are finally out of the woods. Perhaps the Minister could give us an insight into her thinking on that.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am a little surprised at the proposal to reduce the period from seven to five years. The phase-out of capital allowance balancing charges has been the subject of extensive consultation on the regime as a whole, including the publication of those provisions in draft. At no stage since the publication of Lord Alexander's original design has any party said, in response to the consultation, that the phased-out period should be shorter. Indeed, the proposal to shorten it came forward only on 28 May. Given the extensive consultation period, that is a bit like the industry saying, ``Thanks very much for the mile; can we have the last few inches?'' The period of seven years was discussed in the consultation and no problems were raised in regard to it. The amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 445, line 4, leave out from beginning to end of line 42 on page 448.

<P>
Why are offshore activities on the continental shelf excluded from the tax regime? The offshore industry has played a huge role in the British shipping sector and makes a valuable contribution to the success of the North sea industry. It is tough on the offshore industry, which has stood by this country through thick and thin, to be excluded through these provisions. Except in the case of a qualifying vessel that is in port for a short period of time, the industry is excluded from the tonnage tax regime. I see no difference between carrying passengers around the Caribbean or oil from Africa to this country and carrying provisions out to a rig on the North sea. Why has the Paymaster General cut out that industry?

<P>
Lord Alexander, in paragraph 92(c), seems to suggest that there may be a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>conflict with the Government's policy towards securing revenues from the North Sea under which foreign shipping is taxed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My response is, ``So what?'' Either the Government are whole-heartedly committed to the tonnage tax regime to encourage industry, or they are not. Are they suggesting that they can take the offshore shipping industry for granted and treat it in a cavalier, off-hand way? If that is their attitude, it matches their policy. That is an unfair way to treat an important part of the British shipping industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The amendment gives me an opportunity to raise the issue of mixed-use companies and the anti-avoidance provisions contained in paragraph 41. Will the Paymaster General confirm that when a group of companies comprises both tonnage tax companies and non-tonnage tax companies such as offshore ship operating companies-

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Perhaps it will help the Committee if I swiftly reiterate what I said. It is unlikely, given the mathematics of the Committee, that amendment No. 296 will be accepted.

<P>
I would like the Paymaster General to make it clear that the acquisition and/or operation of a ship by a tonnage tax company that is part of a group comprising tonnage tax companies and non-tonnage tax companies-companies engaged in offshore activities, for example-will not of itself cause the invocation of the anti-avoidance provisions in paragraph 41, even though the ship could have been acquired and operated by the non-tonnage tax company. If the Paymaster General cannot confirm that my understanding is correct, could she write to members of the Committee, making clear the Government's views? The point is of concern to the industry.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall deal with the last point first. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked when the anti-avoidance provisions would be used. The provisions will not be invoked lightly. The rule will not be used to attack companies for innocent mistakes, minor errors of interpretation or genuine misunderstandings. Nor will it be used in the case of bona fide pre-election restructuring required to enable a group to opt for the regime-for example, the divisionalisation of shipping and non-shipping activities.

<P>
I hope that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point. We have been on this point for a long time, including a break for a Division in the House, and I would be happy to write to him, if the record shows that I have not dealt clearly enough with the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> When she writes, will the Paymaster General confirm that, in the circumstances that I have described, involving a company that is already in the tonnage tax regime, but which is part of a group that contains a non-tonnage tax company, the anti-avoidance provisions in paragraph 41 will not be invoked? I look forward to hearing her views.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall cover those points in my response to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
We are discussing the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. We have had a lively discussion on the subject of vessels engaged in offshore activities, and the hon. Gentleman quoted from Lord Alexander's report, in which he said that there might be a conflict with the Government's policy towards seeking revenues from the North sea on which foreign shipping is taxed. That is certainly the case.

<P>
Including vessels that are engaged in offshore activities in the United Kingdom sector is likely to be expensive. It would make our treatment of foreign companies engaged in such activities seem unnecessarily harsh, opening the United Kingdom to accusations of discrimination. The importance of the revenues from the oil and gas-related industry means that there is a special charging provision that applies to non-resident companies that would not normally be subject to United Kingdom taxation. Such companies are subject to UK corporation tax in respect of profits derived from offshore activities in the UK sector. Those non-resident companies would not pass the strategic and commercial management test for the tonnage tax, so we would be offering a massive and, possibly, discriminatory advantage to the United Kingdom companies in competition with them, if part XI rules were done away with for the UK companies.

<P>
A lively and important discussion has taken place in the consultation process outside this Committee. I can tell the hon. Member for Croydon, South that in two years' time we shall look again at the important issue of the tonnage tax regime and its impact on the offshore industry. We are naturally concerned to prevent distortions between resident and non-resident companies, or any adverse affects on the offshore sector.

<P>
Given our undertaking to conduct a review in two years' time, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment and-as he has said on other occasions-hold fire on his criticism until the outcome of the review is known.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General has made a generous offer, and it is perhaps my turn to quit while I am ahead, given the circumstances. If there is a different Government in two years' time, it might fall to the Conservative party to examine the matter. I have been caught somewhat unawares, so I cannot make a similar pledge now, but after tabling such an amendment, I would be surprised to discover that we would not be willing to examine the matter in a couple of years' time, too.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Of course, it is a big if, but should the hon. Gentleman have to take that decision in two years' time, I am sure that he will remember what I have said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We are getting into the realms of bravado. It is said that a week is a long time in politics, but for this Government the next nine months will also be a rather long time. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
