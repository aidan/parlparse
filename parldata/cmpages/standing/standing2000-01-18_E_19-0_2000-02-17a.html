</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> Before we adjourned, I think I had said that this has been a genuinely interesting debate, and that I had gone out of my way to pay tribute to my hon. Friend, the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) for his excellent speech and his help to the Committee in tabling the amendment. I am grateful to him and to other colleagues for their comments during the debate. I am a highly amenable Minister, anxious to please and I hope that my response will reassure my hon. Friend.
<P>
Local authorities should be alert to the positive and constructive offers and initiatives that are available from the bus operators. If necessary I should like to send out a clear message from the Committee that we expect a high degree of consultation between local authorities and bus operators. However, the emphasis on consultation is both implicit and explicit in the Bill.
<P>
Clause 94(4) makes special provision to ensure that, in drawing up its bus strategy, a passenger transport authority is to seek and have regard to advice from its passenger transport executive. That is right and proper: the clause recognises the respective role and functions of the two bodies. Most importantly, the clause deals with strategies. It therefore seems reasonable that it should be representative and accountable bodies and their executive arms—namely the PTEs—that should be consulted on the broad picture in developing the strategies. There is more than ample indication in the Bill that operators will play a central part in the process of implementing the strategy. It is difficult to see how the Government could give greater emphasis than it has to the role of bus operators.
<P>
Clause 95 already requires authorities to consult operators or their local representative organisations in connection with the preparation of the bus strategy. It follows that any reasonable authority, having consulted, must take those views into account. In the light of those provisions, it is argued that the amendment would not add anything to the Bill.
<P>
In addition, there are specific consultation requirements in connection with the making of schemes for quality partnerships, quality contracts and ticketing. Bus operators will have ample opportunity to make their views known, both on the generality and on the specifics. Judging by the remarks of my hon. Friend, the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, bus operators in Scarborough are ripe for involvement in a quality partnership. It is unnecessary to add further provisions to the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend is fully persuaded by my remarks and will be content to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for summing up our important debate—although we were slightly diverted by other events—and for the opportunity to have a closer view of the draft local transport plan guidance. It is an important document and over the lunch break I was able—as you would expect of a civil engineer at lunch time—to get into the meat of it. In view of my hon. Friend's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move, amendment No. 496, in page 56, line 35, after `using', insert `(a)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we will take the following amendments: No. 447, in page 56, line 36, after `vehicles', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and other public vehicles providing public services'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 497, in page 56, line 36, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`;
<P>
(b) vehicles run by community transport organisations;
<P>
(c) dial-a-ride services;
<P>
(d) taxis and private hire vehicles; and
<P>
(e) home to school transport,'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Syms:</B> The purpose of our amendment on clause 94(5) is to stretch the definition of bus services to engender a debate about some of the other services that run in rural areas. Amendment Nos. 496 and 497 deal with vehicles run by community transport organisations, dial-a-ride services, taxis and private hire vehicles and home-to-school transport. Concentrating solely on bus services is too narrow. There are many important services in the rural areas and broadening the definition of ``bus services'' to take account of such services would be an important contribution to bus strategies. Parish councils and local organisations run minivans for transport, and they need to be taken into consideration along with more broad-based issues of buses running up and down the motorways and between major urban centres.
<P>
If one extends the definition of ``bus services'', the issue of fuel duty rebate, which was raised earlier, comes up again. Although, as the Under-Secretary pointed out, there are relevant criteria, many people wonder why fuel duty rebate is not available to a broader range of organisations, especially voluntary ones that provide services to far-flung communities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I rise briefly to support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms). Amendment No. 447, tabled by me and by my hon. Friend, the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), has a similar effect, the difference being that it would give a more wide-ranging definition of the other types of vehicles that could be included. The Minister has pointed out in the past, with some justification, that it is sometimes not appropriate to attempt to list all the vehicles that might be involved because others might be mistakenly omitted; for example, many local authorities are investing in light transit schemes, so one could ask whether tram systems should be included in the list. Notwithstanding that, the intentions of the hon. Member for Poole run along the same lines as ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that his amendment would allow the inclusion of dustcarts and roadsweepers as well as public transport vehicles?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He is right to point out that both our amendment and the one tabled by the hon. Member for Poole contain some technical deficiencies in the wording. However, as the hon. Member for Poole is wont to say, the amendments will give the Under-Secretary the opportunity to tell us what he wants to say on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Again, I express my thanks to colleagues for explaining the thinking behind the amendments. As hon. Members will be aware, the initiative has been raised previously with the Department. Let me address first the extension of the fuel duty rebate to vehicles operated by voluntary organisations, which was raised by the hon. Member for Poole. We are investigating whether that might be both sensible and practical. I make no promises, but we will do that, especially in the light of the recommendations by the Commission for Integrated Transport when those become available.
<P>
The amendments would widen the definition of ``bus services'' in the context of bus strategies under Clause 94. The Bill as drafted defines bus services as services using ``public service vehicles''. The term is further defined in Clause 138—Interpretation of Part II—by reference to the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981, section 1 of which defines a public service vehicle as a motor vehicle adapted to carry more than eight passengers and used for carrying them for hire or reward; or not so adapted but used for carrying passengers for hire or reward at separate fares in the course of a business of carrying passengers. Amendment No. 447 would expand that to include other public vehicles providing public services, while amendments Nos. 496 and 497 spell out in detail categories of services that should also feature in the bus strategy, namely community and schools transport, taxis, private hire vehicles and dial-a-ride buses.
<P>
We have no objection at all to local authorities seeking to widen the coverage of their bus strategy to include reference to many of those services. Indeed, many will already be using passenger service vehicles—for example, community buses, school buses and dial-a-ride vehicles. We have anticipated the need to recognise links with other forms of transport in Clause 94(1)(c), which refers to additional facilities and services connected with bus services. Therefore, to the extent that other services or facilities are ``connected with'' conventional bus services, they are already provided for under the clause as drafted. Current guidance on non-statutory local transport plans already refers to the desirability of acknowledging links with health and community transport provision in what we have come to know fondly as ``joined-up thinking''. I believe that we are at one on that broad question; where we differ is on the desirability of amending the Bill.
<P>
In our view, Clause 94(5) rightly puts the focus on the bus services that must be covered by the strategy. They are what might be called ``conventional'' bus or coach services using public service vehicles. In that sense, Clause 94 provides a bridge between the local transport plan provisions in Clauses 92 and 93 and the new powers and functions of local transport authorities in respect of local services under Clauses 96 to 135. Let me repeat that there is nothing to prevent a local authority from giving its bus strategy a wider canvas to include other types of bus services, but we do not believe it is appropriate to make that part of the mandatory requirements in the bus strategy. I hope that I have satisfactorily explained our thinking to the Committee and that hon. Members will be content to withdraw the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation. I am pleased that the Government are at least examining the fuel duty rebate and that they might take a look at voluntary transport organisations in that context. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said that he would write to his mother. I shall now write to my wife to tell her about the tremendous success I have been having. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 448, in page 56, line 36, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In drawing up its bus strategy a local transport authority shall be able to require any persons operating a bus service within its area to provide reasonable statistical information such as may be required to meet any targets or indicators set by the appropriate national authority to be included by the local transport authority in Local Transport Plans or other statutory reports or plans.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment states clearly what the intention is. The Committee is well aware that local authorities' best value performance indicators relate to the efficient and effective delivery of a range of services, including bus services. The Minister has already said that he believes it to be important that a local authority, in developing its bus strategy, will have regard to establishing a number of milestones against which it can check whether it is achieving the objectives set out in both its local transport plan and its bus strategy.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Despite that, both the Government and the Audit Commission have been increasingly concerned that local authorities are having difficulty meeting some of their defined best-value performance indicators. One of the reasons for that is the absence of some of the vitally important statistical information that would enable them to check whether they are meeting those milestones. The amendment would ensure that providers of local services were required, within reason, to make available to the local authority the statistical information that would be helpful.
<P>
I fully appreciate that some of the statistical information that may be helpful to make those judgments may have commercial and in-confidence implications. Since I have referred to that issue, the Minister will be aware that I am conscious of it. However, given the careful way in which the amendment has been worded, I do not believe that that can be used as an argument against it. However, the Minister may well give appropriate words of comfort to the operators.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> The Liberal Democrat party is an extraordinary creature. It produces a fantastic amount of paper, most of which is absolute rubbish, but occasionally a piece of worthwhile material comes out. It is rather like the principle of the infinite number of monkeys in front of an infinite number of word processors eventually writing ``King Lear''. This is the moment when they have done it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> My understanding of that statement was always that it was to prove that ``King Lear'' was never produced by that means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I accept that ``King Lear'' may not have been, but the hon. Gentleman has now hit the jackpot. He has produced an amendment that is relevant and appropriate and with which we have a great deal of sympathy. We are aware that local authorities have obligations to prepare plans that depend on reasonable statistical data and they must have the means of securing that data. In addition, they are under an obligation, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, under the best-value regime to report regularly on a range of services with which they are directly or indirectly concerned. That information may not be readily available to the authority unless it has the ability to obtain it.
<P>
In many cases, we believe that bus operators will be content to supply the information that they hold so long as it will not be used in a way that breaches commercial confidence, which was recognised by the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, we detect a growing willingness on the part of the bus industry to share information on that basis. It is reasonable to point out that authorities have no powers at present to require statistical information. Without that power, in some instances the authority might not be able fully to meet its obligations or it might otherwise be put to the expense of trying to generate it afresh.
<P>
I note in particular that the amendment is drawn fairly narrowly so that it is clearly aimed at information that can reasonably be required to meet statutory obligations. Commercial confidentiality is still not fully covered. I should therefore like the opportunity to look carefully at the wording. Having said that, I believe that in principle the argument has merit and I am happy to agree to reflect on the matter to see whether we can produce a suitable amendment at a later stage. In response, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am delighted with the Minister's response. I am delighted that I have hit the jackpot. I am delighted that the amendment will come back at a later stage and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure that it is any business of the Chair, but I am interested to know who the hon. Gentleman will be writing to?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale, I shall be writing to my wife, but I will copy the letter to you as well.

Clause 94, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 95</center></H4>
<H4><center>Consultation and publicity about bus strategies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 422, in page 56, line 39, after `authority,' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`every metropolitan district council (except, if the authority is a Passenger Transport Authority for a passenger transport area, a council for a metropolitan district comprised in the area)'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 383, in page 56, line 43, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ba) if the authority is a metropolitan passenger transport authority, the councils of the districts and boroughs within its area,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The purpose of amendment No. 383 is to require passenger transport authorities to consult with the metropolitan districts within the PTA's area in preparing bus strategies. The Government have tabled a number of amendments to recognise the essential role of the metropolitan district authorities in the development and implementation of local transport plans and bus strategies. In metropolitan areas, the local transport plan will be produced jointly by the PTA and metropolitan districts. The amendment has, therefore, been superseded and I invite the hon. Member to withdraw it. Am I talking to the right amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I am sorry to give the Minister a hard time but this is the first time that I have served on a Committee in which a Minister has sought to persuade the Committee to reject the amendment that he is moving. Perhaps I could say a few more words about the importance of ensuring that Ministers are well briefed. I hope you would agree with me, Mr. Gale, that they are well briefed on the issues that they wish to bring before the Committee and that it is important that all members of the Committee are as helpful as they possibly can be to Ministers to enable them to be so briefed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I am not entirely certain that that is a matter for the Chair. However, I am pleased that the Minister managed to rule himself out of order before the Chair found it necessary to do so. Is the Minister now ready to speak to his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. As I understand it, amendment No. 422 is agreed with amendment No. 383, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and it is the latter amendment that I was suggesting should be withdrawn. I would not propose that amendment No. 422—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 383, to which the Minister refers, has not been moved so it cannot be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. You rightly point out that that amendment is grouped with the lead amendment, which is No. 422. That is the amendment that has been moved and it is not, therefore, my intention to encourage its withdrawal.
<P>
Since metropolitan districts will be involved in the joint production of the relevant bus strategy, amendment No. 422 is tabled to remove the need for a PTA to consult the metropolitan districts within its area. At the same time, the amendment requires that the metropolitan districts be consulted where they are affected by other bus strategies—that is, by strategies produced by authorities outside the metropolitan area.
<P>
I hope, that that clarifies the somewhat complex position and that the Committee will accept amendment No. 422 and the hon. Member for Bath will recognise that there is no need for his amendment No. 383.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not wish in any way to sound churlish and to suggest that once again I must have hit the jackpot, but the Minister, having seen our amendment, has already rushed off and produced his own amendment, which is more effectively worded. Nevertheless, the effect is similar and were this particular amendment ever to be voted upon, the Minister can be assured that he would have our support since it achieves the ends that we had intended.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Amendment made: No. 423, in page 57, line 6, leave out from `each' to end of line 9 and insert

<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 443, in page 57, line 22, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and unless it is consistent with the policies set out in the local transport authority's bus strategy prepared under section 94.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In moving my previous amendment, I alluded to the fact that I stand here first and foremost as a civil engineering Member of Parliament. I move amendment No. 443 from that perspective.
<P>
I referred to the important bus manufacturer, Plaxton's, in my constituency. The simple fact is that the major investment forced on bus operators really involves getting at least a seven-year effective working life on primary routes and, with cascading—a fairly well-known term in transport planning—perhaps up to 15 years out of the lifespan of any transportation unit. I move the amendment from that perspective. I am trying to tease out of the Minister whether it would be feasible to provide in the Bill for some sort of strategic consistency in these partnerships, so that in the light of clause 94, potential operators could ensure that they received the whole life benefit from utilising the plant and that any changes would be made on the basis of the previously agreed bus strategy.
<P>
I am trying to mitigate the risk from the operator's point of view and to ensure that any changes in the strategy are flagged-up well in advance to assess their impact on the quality partnership. I would be interested to hear the Minister's response. After studying the draft guidance, I think that my hon. Friend may be able to convince me on this point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his explanation which, with the greatest respect, does not immediately jump off the page when one looks at the amendment. I now understand that he is looking for some comfort for a firm such as Plaxton's in his constituency. I pay tribute to that bus manufacturing company as I do to his various transport achievements, including the excellent integrated transport scheme that is about to be implemented in his constituency and for which he has campaigned so assiduously. We were happy to respond to that in the local transport plan settlement in December.
<P>
I understand why a company like Plaxton's would be seeking the sort of reassurances and benefits that can accrue from the long-term rolling programme to which my hon. Friend referred. Obviously, I cannot offer that precise guarantee—either on behalf of the local transport authority or any other—to a manufacturing company because there is no direct interface between it and the transport authority. However, the provisions in clause 98 propose the opportunity for the bus quality partnership to extend for a period of up to five years. If it is successful, it will extend beyond that period. The quality partnership, as drafted and as is our intention, is very much about the quality of the vehicles. A great deal hangs, therefore, on the quality of the product manufactured by companies like Plaxton's. I cannot offer a precise guarantee, but if it delivers a good product, it has every prospect of going forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> If a new development occurred and the previously agreed strategy needed to be changed, how would that change be managed and what would be the interface between local bus operators and the manufacturers? Developing the right product to service the well-defined needs of the bus strategies will take a long time.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will not think me evasive if I suggest that there might a better opportunity to develop that point, as it has much more to do with bus quality partnerships. At the moment, we are dealing with the consistency between a scheme and the local transport plan. This is not an entirely appropriate time to talk about such changes or developments.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. Clause 96(1) already provides the appropriate tests for making a quality partnership scheme. One is that the authority must be satisfied that the scheme will, to some extent, implement the policies set out in the bus strategy. It is hard to see how a scheme that meets that test can be held to be inconsistent with the bus strategy. Unless I have missed something, my hon. Friend is worrying unduly. It will be in the local transport authority's interests to ensure that all quality partnership schemes are consistent with the policies in its bus strategy. It would be absurd for a scheme to countermand those policies. We need make no further provision in the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend is persuaded that we can come back to that question at a more appropriate time. I hope that he will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I hope to probe the matter in a later debate. I am more convinced today than when the amendment was tabled. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 467, in page 57, line 24, after `facilities', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(which may include bus lanes, priority traffic light schemes and bus gates)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and I tabled the amendment to give the Minister the opportunity to comment on the Government's understanding of the word ``facilities''. The Committee will be aware that there are two sides to a quality partnership—the authority, which will be required to provide particular facilities, and the operator or operators, who will be required to provide local services of a particular standard when using the facilities.
<P>
A partnership is a two-sided affair, and there must be some equivalence in each party's investment. One of the problems may be the difficulty of separating the additional facilities put in by local authorities from their other activities, because it will not be possible to judge whether the operator and the authority have made an equivalent investment.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will confirm that one of the key reasons for those facilities, whatever they are, is that they will presumably enable clearways for the buses, so that the public at large will know that when they travel by bus, it will be able to take advantage of those quicker routes and use priority traffic light systems, bus lanes and so on. It is important to get the message across that the additional advantage of those facilities is that they send people a clear message about the benefits of using public transport.
<P>
The Minister may wish to comment on some of the measures now being taken in some parts of the country on enforcing some facilities. There is little point in having a bus lane, for example, if it is routinely abused by ordinary motorists. With the local authority's agreement, some buses have cameras on board to try to identify infringements such as the use of bus lanes by other vehicles.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is the same as those often tabled by the hon. Member for Poole—to give the Minister an opportunity to discuss important issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I echo my support for the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. It is important to outline the facilities provided, and there is anxiety among bus and coach operators about what the local authorities will do, whether or not the operators fulfil their side of the bargain. The daughter paper, ``From Workhorse to Thoroughbred'' states in paragraph 4.9:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the local authority did not make the promised improvements, an operator could apply for a court order preventing the local authority from using its exclusion powers, and releasing the operator from its side of the bargain. In practice, however, if the facility has not been provided, it is hard to see how the question of exclusion can arise.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is always the thought that if local authorities do not provide certain facilities, legal action may ensue. We want the Minister to explain how the clause will operate in practice, and how it will affect coach and bus operators.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had a short and useful debate, which raised issues relating to the operation of quality partnerships. The Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), will be saying more about the concept of quality partnerships when we discuss later amendments. If the Committee will bear with me, I shall speak on issues that relate to the amendment and respond to matters raised by the hon. Members for Bath and for Poole, but I shall not go into the wider issues involved in the operation of quality partnerships.
<P>
The key principle that the hon. Member for Bath rightly identified is that the local authority should provide facilities that will ease the passage of buses, making access to them easier for the public, and making it easier for buses to travel quickly and conveniently through traffic congestion. The facilities will enhance the operation of bus services. In turn, the bus operators will meet their side of the bargain by improving the quality of the fleet and making bus travel a more pleasant experience. That is a sensible arrangement. Some facilities are already in place on a voluntary basis and the purpose of the measure is to provide a sounder footing on which that admirable concept can be taken forward. Having said that, we cannot identify all the elements that will be encompassed within the term ``facilities'' by the local authority. Those identified by the hon. Member for Bath in his amendment could play an important role: bus lanes, priority traffic light schemes and bus gates are all measures that may be appropriate in some areas. There are others: for example, better bus shelters and the appropriate signage, including dot matrix signs giving up-to-date information on when the next bus is likely to arrive. Such facilities might well be part of a quality partnership.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath will realise that we are moving towards the old, familiar lists argument, which we should perhaps refer to as argument C, that there is a problem in putting too many specific references in the Bill because at some future date it may be inferred that what was not on the list was excluded. For that reason, although I have much sympathy with its purpose, it would not be appropriate to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): What would happen if a competitor or new bus company wanted to operate a service, but did not wish to use the facilities such as a bus lane? How would the new service be established?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The key point about partnerships is that they are not exclusive to a particular operator. That is the distinction between quality contracts and quality partnerships. A contract might involve one or a limited number of operators to the exclusion of others, but a partnership is an open arrangement to which all operators have access. There is no question of excluding operators. However, an operator that fails to meet its side of the bargain by providing unsatisfactory, outdated buses when the other companies in the partnership are operating properly, could be referred to the commissioners because that would not be in the spirit of the partnership. The provision is not exclusive to any one operator or group of operators. Its purpose is not to bar operators.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> A bus company in Newcastle upon Tyne runs old buses. They are a bit tacky, but the fare structure is cheaper than for the more up-market buses. How would the provision cater for them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Details such as fare policy are not part of the partnership principle. Operators determine fares. The partnership deals with the quality of the service, hence the name quality partnerships. The quality concept is that the local authority contributes the infrastructure that is necessary to provide an easier service, which is judged by the speed with which a bus passes though the streets and the facilities that are available for bus users. It is up to the operator to provide a higher quality bus service. The aim is to agree the partnership with all operators rather than one particular operator. A range of operators should be consulted if Newcastle wants to develop a partnership. There will, however, be exceptions. Some needs might have to be met differently and would be excluded from a partnership. Those issue would be addressed locally.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath mentioned the interesting and important issue of enforcement. He asked what happens when bus lanes, which are provided to speed up buses, do not work because they are clogged up with other vehicles. Most members of the public who lawfully use the lanes that are available for motor cars trust be immensely irritated when they see others travelling past in a bus lane, in flagrant disregard of the restriction. He will be pleased to know that the Department has taken steps to implement initiatives to encourage enforcement, including kerbside cameras and cameras on buses to record the number plates of cars or other vehicles that infringe bus lanes. We are keen to pursue a policy that ensures that bus lanes work. If a bus lane is being disregarded, effective action can and will be taken.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am aware of those initiatives, but I welcome them none the less. Will the Minister expand on enforcement? Where does the ultimate responsibility lie? More traffic light measures, bus lanes and opportunities for buses to make turns that other vehicles cannot, put an additional burden on the police because it is their responsibility to prosecute infringements. Has the Department thought of another way around the problem instead of overstretching the already overstretched police?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid and important point about enforcement procedures, which we take seriously. He knows that it is not easy to introduce new arrangements. They do not always work smoothly from the outset. I mentioned the work that the Department is undertaking to ensure more effective operation of bus lanes in certain areas. Experiments are being adopted on certain routes and we are keen to pursue that more vigorously, with the support of all the relevant enforcement authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): My hon. Friend will be aware that some of the enforcement measures to which he has referred are being pursued in London. Why should London alone enjoy the benefits of such proper enforcement, which would be valuable in other parts of the country?
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There is no question of London benefiting and others not being entitled to benefit from anything. I congratulate London Transport on the initiative that it has taken to ensure a whole-route approach since November on the No. 26 bus route in north London, which involves a range of measures including kerbside cameras, on-board cameras, teams of wardens to issue tickets and tow away vehicles and which has resulted in a 40 per cent. increase in prosecutions and, more importantly, a 12 per cent. increase in bus feeds since the experiment was introduced. I hope that that experiment will inform other areas that seek to adopt similar approaches. It is certainly our wish and intention that the lesson should be learnt and adopted throughout the country, and not limited to London.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): It has been brought to the attention of some members of the Committee that powers were given to London in the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to enforce priority bus lanes and so on. Will my hon. Friend consider whether similar powers should be included in the Transport Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Our intention is that comparable powers should be available in all parts of the country. If more extensive powers are available in London as a result of provisions in last year's Greater London Authority Act, I will certainly write to her on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): On the conflict between the motor vehicle and the bus, does the Minister feel that part of the facilities to be provided could be purpose-built segways for guided buses. There would then be no need for enforcement because guided buses would not come into conflict with motorcars.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is an important point. I know that my hon. Friend's local authority has been looking at the opportunity for physical segregation of buses from other vehicles to ensure the free movement of buses. Northampton is a town with which I have fond associations having been born there—I continue to support the football club through thick and thin, although it poses certain challenges to one's loyalty—and I congratulate all those responsible for that initiative.
<P>
Items such as the one that my hon. Friend mentioned were not on the list in the amendment, which is another reason why the amendment is probably not appropriate because it might appear to be unreasonably restrictive. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will agree to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister has deployed argument C with great effect and aplomb and for those reasons I shall withdraw the amendment. It is interesting how many of the Minister's hon. Friends have intervened on him on enforcement. If the amendment has done nothing else, it has raised an important issue. We must consider whether other measures exist along the lines of those in the GLA Act whereby there can be enforcement without it being an additional burden on the police. Extending the duties of traffic wardens might be one way forward. I am grateful that the Minister has agreed to study that issue and I hope that the Committee will have an opportunity to debate it when he produces his own amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> My understanding is that the London Local Authorities Act 1996 allows closed circuit television to be used in the enforcement of bus lane regulations. Both of us and, I suspect, the rest of the Committee would like to see that Act extended to the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for getting the reference right. Argument C has been deployed very effectively and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 573, in page 57, line 26, leave out `must' and insert `agree to'.
<P>
The amendment is important, even though it contains only a few words. The subject is quality partnerships, as distinct from quality contracts. We will have an opportunity later to debate the ability to change from a quality partnership that the local authority thinks is not working to the more imposed approach of a quality contract. The amendment gives us the opportunity to tease the Minister's understanding of the differences between a quality partnership and a quality contract.
<P>
A number of people—in particular, operators who have spoken to me about the issue—are concerned that the word ``partnership'' is somewhat inappropriate, given what is in the Bill. As the Bill stands, the local council could impose the quality partnership on operators, and that is certainly not a partnership of equals.
<P>
The Conservative Whip, the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), raised an important question about operating companies that are not party to a quality partnership, but want to use the facilities provided simply because they are there. The Minister very fairly said that an operator who was not part of a quality partnership would not be prevented from using those facilities. For example, if the local authority provides a bus lane as part of the quality partnership, other companies in that area that are not party to the quality partnership will be able to use it. It is right and proper that they should be allowed to do so and to use all the other facilities, such as prioritisation at traffic lights or bus gates. However, there is a difficulty with subsection (3)(b), which defines a partnership scheme as one in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``operators of local services who wish to use the facilities must undertake to provide local services of a particular standard when using them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Outside the quality partnership, the bus company could operate under a different set of rules, while using the same facilities.
<P>
I have two points. First, I have a genuine concern as to whether the quality partnership envisaged is truly a partnership of equals, between the authority or authorities, on one hand, and the operator or operators, on the other. Secondly, there appears to be some confusion about the entitlement of operators outwith quality partnerships to use the facilities provided specifically for those partnerships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will begin by correcting the record slightly. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, I inadvertently said that quality partnerships would be implemented for up to five years. I should have said for not less than five years. That should offer my hon. Friend some comfort. I apologise to the Committee for making an error, which is unusual, at least in this section of the Bill—so far, so good.
<P>
I shall answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Hexham, which was taken up by the hon. Member for Bath in his more recent contribution: what happens if a quality partnership is in operation, with bus lanes and other facilities, and a new service is introduced? The new service could run on the street alongside the bus lane, but if the service did not meet the quality partnership's standards, it could not run in the bus lane. It would not benefit from the bus lane and would be subject to all the disadvantages of being held up in other lines of traffic. That is my clear and simple answer. The hon. Member for Bath looks slightly mystified. Although he invited me to speak more broadly about quality partnerships and quality contracts, with his indulgence, I would rather deal with the detail of his amendment now, and to return to the broader issue shortly in a further little tour round the network in my guided bus on amendment No. 384. I think that the hon. Gentleman assents.
<P>
I will start the bus tour by saying that subsection (3) defines a quality partnership. We shall consider that in detail on subsequent amendments, but the summary in subsection (3) tells us what makes the scheme a partnership: both local authorities and bus operators have a part to play. Authorities provide facilities on routes to be served by buses operating under the scheme. Typically, those will be bus lanes and other traffic management measures designed to help the bus through traffic, and facilities for passengers, such as quality bus shelters perhaps with real-time information about when the next bus is due.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I apologise for interrupting the Minister so soon, but I would like something put on the record. The Bill specifies that the local authority is responsible for the provision of such facilities, but my hon. Friend will be aware that in parts of the country, including the west midlands and the north-east, bus operators have offered to assist. Does the Minister welcome that approach, and would he like that voluntary contribution to continue?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. The Government have welcomed that approach and we believe that local authorities should be responsive to such initiatives. In response to an earlier amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, I tried to make it clear that I am aware of them. Indeed, outside the confines of the Committee Room, my hon. Friend has spoken to me about outstanding offers, which have not always received a response. I suppose that, to some extent, it is a matter of the availability of matched funding from the local authority. However, we hope that bus operators who make those offers find a ready response from the local authorities. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for highlighting the fact that the traffic, as it were, is not all one way.
<P>
The partnership scheme also involves operators, because they have an obligation to meet the quality standards laid down in the quality partnership scheme when making use of the facilities provided by the local authority. Those standards will typically relate to the vehicle, and may cover accessibility—specifying low-floor vehicles, for example—and emissions, but may also cover standards of driver training and customer care.
<P>
The new statutory scheme is a partnership, albeit somewhat different from the voluntary partnerships that currently exist, in that both parties' commitments will be enshrined in a formal statutory scheme. That is why the Bill provides for full consultation with bus operators before the scheme is set up. The quality partnership scheme is not simply imposed by the local authority without reference to the bus operators. Once the scheme is established, the partnership carries with it obligations on both sides. Clause 100 sets those out in more detail. Briefly, the local authority must provide the appropriate facilities and continue to do so for as long as the scheme is in operation, and the bus operators must meet the appropriate standards when taking advantage of those facilities. The amendment appears to be aimed at softening the obligations on operators, to make it a matter of agreement rather than a requirement.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am afraid that that is a mere play on words. The amendment to clause 96 does not alter the clear obligation on operators under clause 100 to comply with the standards laid down in the quality partnership scheme. By itself, the amendment would have no practical effect. In any event, as I have tried to explain to the Committee, it is the nature of a quality partnership that it lays obligations on both parties. They are not simply bilateral contracts between the parties; they are public law obligations. We should not shrink from making that plain on the face of the Bill, and that is what clause 96(3) does. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see the force of those arguments and be prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I find myself in some difficulty. The Minister's response is not only unconvincing, but it has raised an interesting separate point. In response to the questions about bus companies that are not part of a quality partnership but are operating in the area, the Minister said that they would not be allowed to use bus lanes or traffic light schemes, and so on. We now have the vision of two different bus operators operating in an area where one will be able to use a bus lane because it is part of the quality partnership and the other will not. I can see the logic of that in terms of persuading the other operator to come on board the quality partnership. However, given the remarks that were made only a few minutes earlier about the vital importance of enforcement, it is odd that the Minister will create significant difficulties for people who have to work out whether the bus should be in or outside the bus lane and whether it has a right to turn right where no other traffic may do so. I foresee significant enforcement difficulties and the Minister may wish to give us some comfort on that.
<P>
On the main principle of the amendments, I find the Minister somewhat unconvincing. My understanding of a partnership is that it is the coming together of two different groups of people who work out a deal between themselves. I accept entirely the Minister's assertion that at a later stage, once it is agreed, we want that partnership to have the force of law. That is the whole point of making quality partnerships change from being voluntary quality partnerships, which exist at present in some parts of the country, to being statutory quality partnerships. I am at one with the Minister on that issue.
<P>
The disagreement between us is how to reach the point at which the agreement is made. The Minister said that the local authority cannot impose a quality partnership without reference to the operators; I believe and the record will show that that was the phrase he used. However, the implication of the provision is that the local authority effectively can impose the partnership. It can refer to the operators, but if the operators say, ``We don't like this'', the local authority can nevertheless impose it, and it has the effect of law. That worries me enormously: it is not my understanding of a partnership. Given that the Minister will have the power contained in later clauses dealing with quality contracts to impose measures on bus operators in the area, and given the impact of the 1985 Act—I am surprised that the Minister persists in the belief that it is truly a partnership. Some important issues have been raised, to which I will return, relating to the definition of partnership and to the difficulty of enforcing the complex rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman concluded or is he giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the Minister will have the right to speak after me and before I withdraw the amendment, Mr. Gale, I will happily sit down and withdraw it in a minute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises two points. His question about the nature of the quality partnership and the stage at which it will be enforced is important and interesting. However, let me take him back to first principles. We are talking about a quality partnership—about investment by local authorities in a range of infrastructure improvements to assist bus movement through localities. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that if a local authority finds that there are no operators willing to participate in the scheme, there is little point introducing and implementing it. The local authority has no incentive to engage in those investments without a corresponding offer being made by the operator. To that extent, in a quality partnership there are no unwilling partners.
<P>
If they are willing partners, they are partners who are willing to invest in improvement, for example, the physical quality of the bus, the quality of training and customer care and so on. If they are making that investment as part of the partnership agreement, then they need some protection and that is where the enforcement provisions of the Bill come into effect. I hope that deals with that point.
<P>
The initial matter of enforcement mentioned by the hon. Member for Bath raises two points. There is the regular issue about which he had exchanges earlier with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning on the enforcement of bus lanes in general and my hon. Friend answered that privately. The issue relates to enforcement in respect of vehicles that are not part of the quality partnerships. We have little doubt that there will be a number of parties ready to draw the attention of the traffic commissioner to the use of infrastructure improvements by those who are not parties to the partnership agreement. The local authority will want to monitor those facilities to see whether they are used by operators not in the quality partnership. In addition, the traffic commissioner—the enforcer—will want to check. The Committee can be assured that other operators will have an incentive to report competitors who are getting a free ride. There are plenty of natural mechanisms to deal with that issue.
<P>
<B>Ms Winterton:</B> My hon. Friend may not be able to respond to this point straight away, but presumably a lot of the quality partnerships extend to bus stops, many of which will be on the side of the bus lane. Presumably it would be difficult for the other operator to use the bus stop if it could not use the bus priority lane, which would be an additional safeguard. Will such an operator be able to use the special bus shelters and other facilities that are part of the quality partnership?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The ruthless answer to my hon. Friend's question is no. If bus lanes, bus station facilities or bus stops have been improved—for example, with countdown information facilities—and designated as part of the bus quality partnership scheme, those operators that are not signed up to the scheme will not be able to use those facilities. If they use them, they will be subject to penalty under action by the traffic commissioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Member for Bath has done the Committee a service by moving the amendment because there are difficulties. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) has graphically outlined one of the problems of enforcement that occur when quality partnerships are set up, but the picture is not quite so black as has been suggested. The existing quality partnerships, known as showcase routes, work extremely well.
<P>
Despite my hon. Friend's fears, incentives exist for people to join quality partnerships because of the additional passenger revenue that such partnerships bring. For example, my own company Travel West Midlands operates a showcase route in Coventry and Bedworth, alongside Stagecoach, another large company. The route was inaugurated by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), who is the Whip in the Committee. Because of the Competition Acts, we cannot work out timetables or fares in the way in which we would like, but such problems have been overcome.
<P>
Although I appreciate the fears expressed by the hon. Member for Bath, genuine incentives exist for people to invest in modern equipment simply because the bus priority measures so ably explained by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary bring genuine and tangible increases in passenger numbers and enable bus companies to make a profit. There is nothing wrong with that, as all Labour Members would agree these days.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those comments. He has great experience of such matters and says that some of the problems that have been mentioned can be solved. I confess that I support the broad thrust of the Government's proposals. I broadly support the notion that bus operators who do not sign up to a quality partnership should be excluded from using such facilities, but I have become more concerned about that during the debate. I am trying to envisage the signage that will be needed in my city and elsewhere. Buses-only right turn signs will need to list those companies that are allowed to turn right and those that cannot. I worry about the impact on visual amenity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that physical separation will produce advantages further down the road, inasmuch as the stage might be reached where there is no conflict between motor vehicles and buses or between buses from different companies that are not signed up to the quality contract?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's—I was about to say obsession, but that would be insulting—keen interest in guided buses. Of course, there are alternatives to guided buses, such as light transit systems, small tram systems and so on. The principle of separation is widely accepted as appropriate for pedestrians, which is why we have pavements, and it is increasingly relevant for cyclists as we have separate cycleways. In a number of our cities we are seeing the relevance of that principle for other forms of public transport. The Committee learned a great deal from the hon. Gentleman's interventions. I do not know what the bus signs will be like. This may be the solution to some of my tour bus problems.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am delighted to see that nod. I can write another letter to my wife. The Minister said that in the debate the next but one group of amendments he will give us more details about the difference between quality partnerships and quality contracts. I look forward to that debate with considerable interest. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 500, in page 57, line 34, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
I have read this provision a number of times and I think that I understand it, but I am not entirely sure. We seek to delete subsection (4)(b), which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may not be facilities which are required to be provided as a result of section 119 or 120.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clauses 119 and 120 deal with the provision of bus information. Does that preclude the local authority side of a partnership agreement from promoting bus schemes that provide information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> No. Well, I should be grateful if the Minister could explain why that paragraph needs to be in at all. We have mostly discussed such facilities as bus lanes and bus shelters. If we want to increase the numbers of people who can travel, the local authority should have some responsibility for providing information—possibly information that has been paid for and printed by bus companies. I look forward to a full and long explanation from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing sinister in this provision. It is certainly possible for a quality partnership scheme to include requirements as to bus information for passengers. That will come as no surprise. Local authorities, for example, commonly provide bus shelters with timetable displays, maps and so forth. Subsection (4) is simply aimed at avoiding undesirable duplication of powers. Thus facilities may not be required under a quality partnership scheme if they are being imposed under the powers in clauses 119 and 120. In other words, the provision appears in the Bill at this point simply to avoid double banking with the specific information provisions in clauses 119 and 120. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can be persuaded on this point and will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am tempted to divide the Committee on this important issue but in the interests of making progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 384, in page 57, line 36, leave out `may' and insert `must'.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) include requirements as to frequency or timing of services, and

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and
<P>
( ) include requirements which the vehicles being used to provide the services must meet, including safety, age of vehicle, noise and exhaust emissions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister has told us that he wishes to use this group of amendments to outline his thinking about the difference between quality partnerships and quality contracts. I shall be brief, but I hope that I will have an opportunity when the Minister replies to raise a few more points. I urge the hon. Gentleman to deal with some key points. First, as he will know, a number of quality partnership schemes already exist. They provide a valuable service to both residents and visitors. There is concern that some of the requirements in the Bill, particularly those in clause 96, may mean that those quality partnerships can no longer be continued. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) shakes his head, so let me provide examples to illustrate the point. Under clause 96(5)(b), the standards of service specified in a quality partnership
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``do not include requirements as to frequency or timing of the services.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Several existing quality partnerships refer both to the frequency and the timing of services. Clearly, the voluntary partnerships to which I referred—the one in Manchester, for example—would fall outwith those requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain how an existing voluntary quality partnership that provides for discussion of fares and services could possibly be threatened by the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I certainly can and am grateful for the opportunity to do so. The Minister made it clear that the Bill's purpose is to shift the concept of quality partnerships from voluntary to statutory provision. Statutory provisions will, as the Minister observed only a few minutes ago, have public law obligations and operate under the full force of the law. A current voluntary partnership in breach of the Bill could not become a statutory quality partnership because the reference to the timing and frequency of services is excluded by the clause.
<P>
The Minister might suggest that a voluntary agreement that covers frequency and fares could exist outside the details of the statutory quality partnership—the obvious solution that the Minister will, in a few moments, proffer. However, the requirements of the Competition Act 1998, which come into force on 1 March, will lead to significant difficulties for voluntary agreements in respect of frequency, timing and—as the amendment proposes—fares. One way to avoid the problem is to make specific requirements—hence the word ``must''—so that the new Act will provide protection against the impact of the Competition Act on quality partnerships.
<P>
If the amendments are rejected, what will happen to voluntary agreements that already refer to fare, timing and frequency when the Act comes into force? Secondly, what will happen to voluntary agreements outside statutory quality partnerships in respect of those matters from 1 March? Real concerns have been expressed by local authorities and operators about this part of the Bill. The amendments would provide a solution to two significant problems. The Minister may have another way of achieving that, so I look forward to hearing his reply.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister has affirmed that he would like to provide an overview of quality partnerships. I am prepared to permit that and to allow both sides of the Committee to question him. That might have an impact on my decisions about clause stand part debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. I listened carefully to the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Bath and I also take note of representations from beyond the confines of the Committee. Considerable interest and some anxiety have been expressed about this part of the Bill. I hope to allay the anxiety and demonstrate the advantages of our proposals.
<P>
I know that hon. Members feel strongly about this issue, so I propose to speak at some length—with your indulgence, Mr. Gale—to try to deal with some of the anxieties that have been expressed. As I see it, there are two aspects to this matter—the philosophical approach that the Government are adopting, if that is not too grand a phrase, and the associated practical issues. I should like to deal first with the philosophy or underlying principles.
<P>
Bus deregulation under the Transport Act 1985 had a number of bad results. There was much disruption and there were even bus wars, as well as problems with vehicle quality, a lack of timetable information and disjointed ticketing. None of these problems helped to make bus use attractive to passengers. I am glad to say that the Bill is designed to put right many of those all too familiar problems—and not before time, some would say.
<P>
Party politics aside, we would do well to remember that the picture is not all black. In some worthwhile ways, it is even getting better. If we consider the broadest statistics, bus miles—that is, the availability of buses on the street—actually went up under deregulation. Bus subsidy went down, even though service levels were pretty much maintained, so local authorities had money available for other transport services or other services altogether. I acknowledge that, recently, subsidy bills in some places have increased and that is a matter of concern, but the broad picture over 15 years is by no means wholly negative.
<P>
We have seen the statistics come to life on our streets. Bus operators have shown themselves able to innovate and give the public better services. Over time, the bus market has shown signs of becoming more mature in every sense as operators have spent less energy on squabbling with each other and more on giving the public a good service and thus encouraging people back on to the buses. We can see success stories throughout the country, many of which will be familiar to hon. Members.
<P>
Brighton has high-quality, frequent services and extra patronage of about 5 per cent. a year, including some former car users. Trent buses in the east midlands run 5 Rainbow routes. Service restructuring and careful attention to quality and marketing has not only won it extra passengers—in some cases the numbers are 100 per cent. up over five years—but has also won people out of their cars. Apparently, on one route 72 per cent. of passengers used to be car users. In Ipswich, where another quality partnership operates, new investment on the Kesgrave corridor has seen 42 per cent. passenger growth, and there are a number of other examples. There are between 100 and 130 voluntary bus quality partnerships across the country.
<P>
When we consider what the success stories have in common, we normally find bus operators working with local authorities. Operator initiatives may be fine, but the bus needs help to get through the traffic and; that is where the local highway authority comes in. Often, the local authority may be able to prompt the bus operator to think about how to make best use of a traffic management scheme. Either way, each has a contribution to make—I want to emphasise that. Undoubtedly, local authorities have a lot to offer. They have not only the powers but also an expertise in traffic management and highway design that no one else can match. They have shown that repeatedly up and down the country. But bus operators, too, have their own skills to bring to the party or, more precisely, the partnership. One does not have to belong to the Adam Smith Institute—

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Apparently the hon. Gentleman does belong to it. I confess surprise at that. Perhaps that is due simply to the comparison between him and his senior partner, who I am certain must belong to the Adam Smith Institute. I shall go no further down that road.
<P>
It is important to acknowledge that operators can and often do have a valuable role to play in running buses. It is right to acknowledge that they can also be good judges of innovation as well as efficiency. That recognition, however cautious, informs my response to the amendments.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not claim that the story is one of success everywhere. Not every quality partnership has done well. In some places, people have even been reluctant to try them. That is why we are legislating and giving local authorities extra powers. The Bill gives those authorities powers to call for investment from bus operators and to say to them, ``We are playing our part with our traffic management money and expertise. We expect you to play your part by spending on vehicles that are comfortable, easy and convenient to use, that are driven by people with proper training who will pay proper attention to customer care, and that help to make the air cleaner in our town centres.''
<P>
I see those as substantial powers that give local authorities a significant new role in setting quality standards for bus operators. I am not persuaded that it would be sensible to give local authorities the sort of detailed control over bus timetables to which the amendments would lead. It would be best to leave some discretion to bus operators. However, I hope that the Committee will recognise the extra powers given in the Bill to county councillors and passenger transport authorities.
<P>
I shall turn from the broad principles to the practical implications of these amendments. I remind the Committee that under the Bill as it stands, where a quality partnership is set up, the local authority concerned will set quality standards that apply equally, to any operator who wants to use the facilities provided by the local authority, whether they be bus lanes or bus stations. It would be for each operator to declare to the traffic commissioner that he will meet those quality standards, and for the traffic commissioner to make sure that he does.
<P>
The amendments would put an extra stage in the process. The operator would have to go to the local authority before the traffic commissioner to ask what frequency the authority wanted for that bus service. The service could not be run until the local authority's requirements had been met, and the same would apply to fares.
<P>
In effect, the local authority would determine details of timetables and fares. Of course, hon. Members say that they see the power as being used for only broad-brush matters such as standard minimum frequencies. Who decides what is a minimum or what is the right minimum for a range of different circumstances? Something that is right for a lifeline service to a distant village will be wrong for a connection to a busy railway station. I am driven to the conclusion that local authorities will find themselves taking views on the details of different routes.
<P>
That leads me to a second and important, practical point. The Bill already provides for local authorities to exercise such detailed control over timetables and fares in the clauses about quality contracts. Those clauses give local authorities full planning powers, and provide that the Secretary of State's consent should be sought for a quality contracts scheme.
<P>
However, an extension of quality partnership powers in the way proposed by the amendments would seriously blur the distinction between a quality partnership and a quality contract. If the partnership powers enabled local authorities to set frequencies and fares, one set of powers would begin to look much like the other. Of course, quality partnership schemes rightly have no need for ministerial consent. So the outcome would be quality contracts by the back door.
<P>
My argument about the blurring of that distinction is strengthened by the representations of the Local Government Association, which has made it clear that it is concerned that quality partnerships should be effective and that quality contracts should be reserved as a fallback option, as the Bill intends. I do not accuse anyone of seeking to blur that distinction, but I fear that that would be the effect of the amendment. In practical terms, it seems odd to have sets of provisions in one Bill that significantly overlap, but have quite different procedures attached to them. I could not commend that to the Committee as good legislation.
<P>
I apologise for having spoken at length, but this is an important set of amendments. I shall end with two general points. First, some people, in the Committee and outside, might have drawn too strong a conclusion from subsection (5), which deals with frequency and timing. They may have thought that the provision rules out the possibility, in any circumstances, of agreements between local authorities and operators about frequency and timing. That is not the case. The provision applies only to statutory quality partnerships made under the Bill. It is perfectly open to local authorities to come to non-statutory agreements with operators—just as they can, and do, now. The Bill does not stop that. If a local authority, perhaps alongside a statutory quality partnership, wants to encourage a bus operator to run more frequent services, to make best use of the new facilities, nothing in the Bill prevents it from doing so.
<P>
I can therefore give that comfort, particularly to representatives of the South Yorkshire area, where the bus quality partnership strategy embraces arrangements for frequency and, to some extent, timetabling. I also give comfort to the slightly improbable representative of the Manchester transport authority, the hon. Member for Bath, who expressed those concerns on behalf of Manchester. I reiterate that it is perfectly possible for there to be both a statutory quality partnership, and a kind of codicil to that partnership that makes voluntary agreements about frequency and timetabling. Now, where was I?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Come on!
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My hon. Friend asks me to hurry. I have now found my place.
<P>
Secondly, I refer to local transport plans and bus strategies. It has been suggested that without enhanced quality partnership powers, a local authority cannot make a proper bus strategy. The technical answer is that clause 94, which deals with strategies, refers to the local authority's functions—in other words, its powers and duties. The duty to make a strategy therefore applies only to its use of what powers and duties the Bill confers on it; the local authority cannot be criticised for not doing what it lacks the power to do.
<P>
More positively, I remind the Committee of what the Bill provides for local authorities. It provides significant powers to require standards for quality partnerships and it provides wholly new powers, such as those to require integrated ticketing and to require that operators provide proper information. It also enhances the existing power to provide subsidised services, to make it easier for local authorities to secure enhanced frequencies. Those are all important extra powers for local authorities. It is important that discretion on their use be left with the local authority, which is why I cannot support amendment No. 469, which, with amendment No. 384, would require the local authority to set vehicle standards.
<P>
Those points serve to underline one of my key points. I believe firmly that the provisions equip local authorities with substantial and worthwhile new powers to ensure improved public transport. That is the objective of that part of the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am pleased that the Minister and his advisers read documents from the Adam Smith Institute; it issued a good blue booklet on the deregulation of buses, which I agree has had bad and good effects. I am glad that the Minister acknowledged that one of the good effects is that the decline in buses has been halted. However, we are still fighting a battle to get more people to travel by bus.
<P>
Our amendment No. 18 is in this group of amendments. It, too, deals with the important issues raised by the hon. Member for Bath on frequency, timing and fares. I thank the Minister for his broad explanation but he did not mention the Competition Act, which comes into force on 1 March 2000. In my discussions with bus companies, I have found that they are concerned because the Act is a draconian piece of legislation that could impact on the directors of those companies. When the Local Government Association gave a briefing for those interested in such affairs, they did not say that they had been to see Ministers at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to express their concerns about the Act. It is important that the Committee receive answers about this Act because, as the hon. Member for Bath clearly pointed out, some things that are now voluntary could well become illegal with consequences for those who run these services. The problem is not insurmountable—the solution could be an exemption or whatever—but the Department for Trade and Industry and the DETR need to come to an agreement so that we all know exactly what the situation will be. The Competition Act is going to have an impact on these services. That is the principle point I wished to make on this section of the Bill, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> I seek some advice and guidance from the Minister on amendment No. 469 and clause 96(5)(a) regarding safety. Ministers know from recent correspondence about the serious road traffic accident in Northampton, which involved a school bus. The Committee will be pleased to know that there were no fatalities but a number of schoolchildren were hospitalised. That accident again raised the issue of the fixture of seatbelts on buses and bus-coaches. When setting up quality partnership schemes and quality partnership contracts, would a local authority be able to insist in the contract that those vehicles operating school bus runs must have seatbelt fixtures? A number of schools within Northamptonshire are running a campaign for which I have tremendous sympathy. Seat belts are still a problem. Although coaches are fitted with seatbelts, buses continue not to be. I would appreciate advice from the Minister as to whether he would see it as sensible that a partnership scheme and/or contract should enable a local authority to ensure that all those in their charge be transported safely to and from school.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I should like to pursue with the Minister the use of facilities. The idea raised earlier about bus lanes being available only to bus companies that belong to the quality partnership seems to me to be ludicrous and unenforceable. Is it suggested that a long-distance coach or a private hire coach would not be allowed to use a long bus lane, which is to be reserved for a particular company. It seems bizarre to discriminate against people who take the trouble to hire a bus for a journey rather than use their cars.
<P>
More seriously, if I may use a personal example, my constituency is a large, rural one that borders the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, which has its own PTA called Nexus. It provides the type of facilities that we welcome and which the Minister has described. There are, however, infrequent services: perhaps only once a week. Where I live there is a once-a-fortnight minibus service into the centre of Newcastle. It is a fact of life that those buses and minibuses and some country buses are rather older than those used in the city. They use central Newcastle facilities and when they take people shopping on Saturday, they go into the bus station and deposit their passengers there. Will those people be forbidden from going into the bus station? Will poor country folk coming to Newcastle be pitched off the bus and have to stand in the rain because they are not allowed to use the city's bus stops? That would be bizarre, so I hope that the provision would not apply in such circumstances.
<P>
Furthermore, in relation to a matter raised by the hon. Member for Bath—which he pronounces with a short `a'—Nexus, the passenger transport authority in Tyne and Wear, has several concerns, some of which the Minister has dealt with. Nexus provides all the facilities and is worried that there is nothing to stop operators and partnerships whacking up fares and charging a premium rate for a route with so many services. I raise that matter on Nexus' behalf. Personally, I have no view on the matter.
<P>
Will some facilities be provided by district councils in the PTA area? What happens if such councils are not prepared to come into the partnership, or are not interested in doing so? If the Minister responds to those points, he will reassure my local PTA.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): I want to speak briefly in response to the Minister's interesting and valuable exposition of what a quality partnership involves.
<P>
I do not profess to have experience of running bus companies or of being involved in local bus initiatives. However, I have five years' experience of managing a public-private partnership. I am anxious that, despite frequent reference to partnerships, PPPs and so on, the nature of such partnerships has not been considered clearly and carefully. However, the Minister proved that, in this case, the matter has been considered clearly and carefully.
<P>
References to Adam Smith and the Adam Smith Institute were interesting. I do not doubt that Adam Smith himself would have been a great supporter of such partnerships and would have agreed with the Minister. However, there are two problems with Adam Smith: one is that the vast majority of people have not read ``The Wealth of Nations'' and the other is that the Adam Smith Institute claims sole access to the great economist.
<P>
I shall make three observations based on personal experience of partnerships which confirm that, in this case, we have got it right. First, when a partnership between the private and the public sector is entered into, the parties should not be asked to do things that they cannot do. Asking private sector organisations to behave philanthropically, altruistically or like a public service provider is of no use: they do not behave like that. However, if they are asked to run their companies and organisations efficiently, commercially and profitably, they will do so. Similarly, transport departments and local authorities should not be asked to behave like entrepreneurial or commercial organisations.
<P>
Secondly, partnerships should be equal. Neither side should be able to overpower the other. My experience is that allowing that to happen will lead, at one extreme, to the public sector not being able to provide efficient services and, at the other, to commercial organisations exploiting circumstances and trying to attract as many resources as possible. I do not know about other hon. Members' experience of the rural transport grant, but in my constituency welcome additional bus services have been provided at the expense of less well-known services elsewhere in the constituency, which have disappeared. That is a common problem that should be tackled.
<P>
Finally, if we get it right, by bringing together both partners, we shall have not only a combination of two sets of resources and two skills bases but a far better service than either could provide that is equal to the two combined. If we get it wrong, it could be a disaster. On the basis of what the Minister has said this afternoon, I believe that we have got it spot on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): I wrote to the Department last year about the anxieties that companies and PTEs and PTAs that would be inclined to enter into voluntary quality partnership agreements expressed about the possibility of other companies that were not inclined to enter into such agreements taking claims to the Office of Fair Trading for anti-competitive behaviour. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister and his Department are aware of the problem and have examined it since. What has he concluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The Committee owes a great debt to the hon. Member for Bath. Someone once said that Bath is a city that he so ably represented that it is where Opposition Members keep their coal. I am sure that that is not true these days. The debate that he has provoked through his amendments goes to the heart of the Bill, in a way that took me, and, I suspect, some of my hon. Friends, by surprise.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) discussed the problems that are likely to be caused under the Competition Act. I crave your indulgence, Mr. Gale, in suggesting that my hon. Friend the Minister might do the Committee a great service by accepting an amendment that I have drafted to clause 118 that states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``schemes made under this section shall be exempt from any provisions of the Competition Act 1999.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> It is already there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am sure that it is. I knew that I had taken it from someone else, but it was the best that I could think of quickly. The point worries people who enter into voluntary agreements and partnerships, and unless we overcome that hurdle, it will continue to worry them.
<P>
Judging from my experience, people in the bus industry would be unanimous in opposing the amendments that the hon. Member for Bath has tabled. I am not authorised to speak on everyone's behalf, and I would not presume to do so, but, in view of the discussions that have taken place both in the Committee and outside, I consulted the Confederation of British Road Passenger Transport UK, to which all reputable bus companies in the United Kingdom belong, and there is no confusion among its members about that aspect of the clause. They are unanimous in opposing—
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. He will have an opportunity to respond in a moment. I cannot do more than consult as widely as I have. There is unanimity among the people whom I have consulted that they do not want the amendments to be accepted or services and frequency to be part of a quality partnership. A quality partnership is an agreement into which both parties have entered voluntarily. Once a statutory framework includes matters such as frequency and services, it is no longer a quality partnership. Indeed, the distinction between that and a quality contract, which we shall discuss in due course, is not merely blurred, it is wiped out completely. One becomes the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a quality partnership as envisaged by him is one in which two parties come together voluntarily and agree what they wish to do, after which that partnership is put on a statutory footing? Given that he is nodding—
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am twitching, not nodding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that, in some circumstances, there may be a desire on the part of both parties to include references to ``fares'' and ``frequency'' in that voluntarily agreed document?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being artful in his choice of words. He puffs out his cheeks, but he is in politics like the rest of us. He adopts the air of Liberal innocence rather too often, which, in my view, typifies his own party. I meant that a quality partnership should be just that—a partnership. Its statutory provisions should not extend further than the clause, thereby excluding the provisions of his amendment. If operators and local authorities voluntarily wish to take on that partnership outside the statutory provisions by discussing and agreeing frequencies and services—and fares, too—that is a matter on which the two partners must agree. That is different from those provisions—frequency of services, in particular—being given the force of law.
<P>
If the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath are accepted, the distinction between quality partnerships and quality contracts will be wiped out completely. The hon. Gentleman asked me for my definition of a ``quality partnership''. It is one between bus operators and local authorities, in which the parties have agreed voluntarily a series of commitments to improve bus services. There is nothing sinister in that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am glad that I am taking the hon. Gentleman with me. I hope that he agrees, in his new-found spirit of amity, that a quality contract is a public transport package, in which the local authority has unilaterally determined the constituent elements, including service frequency and timing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman again nods in agreement. I have some unanimity fairly early on in this debate.
<P>
The Bill provides that a local authority can introduce a quality partnership scheme after consultation with bus operators, which the traffic commissioner will then enforce. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bath is with me, thus far. The authority is not required, however, to amend its quality partnership scheme in the light of its operator consultation, nor is there any right of appeal by the operators against the authority's decision. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees.
<P>
Such powers are not insignificant. Those who feel that the quality partnership legislation without such specific powers will be toothless should reflect on what I have just said. New powers will be granted to local authorities. Under the clause, an authority that was minded to control its bus services would, if it was unable to specify service frequency and timing, be able to dictate such matters to operators without any right of operator redress or appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman control himself for a second while I finish my point? For reasons that I have outlined, the draconian powers in his amendment are opposed by bus operators throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I wonder why the hon. Gentleman did not speak with such passion and use exactly the same argument on an earlier amendment, when I sought to ensure that a quality partnership was truly one of equals, without the draconian powers to which he is referring, which I wanted to amend. He makes far better the very argument that I made earlier about quality partnership being one sided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I was going to speak earlier, but I did not wish to bore the Committee twice in the same afternoon. As the hon. Member for Poole, who is leading for the Opposition, would agree, too much passion is not necessarily a good thing on a Thursday afternoon.
<P>
I hope that I can convince the Committee, especially the hon. Member for Bath, that adopting the amendments could undermine the viability of an operator's network, particularly if the powers conferred on the local authority under the amendment were misused—I shall not say abused, as I would not accuse an authority of doing that intentionally.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For a quality partnership scheme to work under the Bill, there would have to be a partnership agreement between the authority and its bus operators. When an authority contemplates significant investment in its bus-operating infrastructure, it may wish to seek through its operators some commitment to minimum future service levels. No reasonable operator would object to that. We would not expect local authorities to spend public money on providing those facilities and then to say, ``Who wants to run a bus more often than every couple of hours?''. No reasonable operator would behave in such a way.
<P>
Local authorities would obviously want to place the facilities—those mentioned in the previous group of amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Bath—where they would be best used, probably along the busier routes served by one or more operators in the area. As I said earlier, that is already happening under voluntary arrangements in various parts of the country. Some operators—Travel West Midlands and First Group in my area, for example—are offering money to local authorities to assist with the provision of these facilities. That represents a genuine partnership that members of the Committee should prejudice with a great deal of discretion.
<P>
If an operator were unco-operative in a quality partnership, he would be entitled to invoke the quality contract procedures—we shall debate them in a few moments—proposed in the Bill. As these include a requirement for the Secretary of State's approval and operator rights to make representations, the appropriate checks and balances are in place for quality contracts. They exist for good reasons.
<P>
Much investment is going into the bus industry country wide. In my own area, £30 million is being invested over a three-year period in new buses. I have already appealed to the Committee not to prejudice that investment by accepting the amendments so craftily proposed—I hope that I do not insult him—by the hon. Member for Bath. As I said earlier, problems of competition can be dealt with. However, with a country-wide investment programme of more than £350 million in new buses, we would be barmy to prejudice it by telling operators: ``Your bottom line: services and frequencies will be dictated by somebody else.'' They would be less than human if they did not respond, ``Well, if you are going to dictate the company's bottom line, you had better start considering where future investment is going to come from.'' A company would have difficulty persuading its shareholders that a sensible, long-term investment programme could go ahead in those circumstances.
<P>
Finally, let me comment on the remarks of the hon. Member for Hexham, which provided food for thought. I have always regarded taxis as part of a public transport package. It cannot be good if they and other services from outside a conurbation cannot use the facilities. My hon. Friend the Minister would agree that it is important to tempt people into public transport, wherever they live. If a vehicle comes into a conurbation from 20 miles outside it, it is still a public transport vehicle.
<P>
It might not be the most modern on the road but I am sure that my hon. Friend would rather see 50 or 60 passengers on that than in their cars, driving into our towns and cities at peak times in the morning. They would do that if they were excluded because they were from so far away that they were not considered part of a quality partnership. That may be a retrograde step for public transport. I ask the Committee's forgiveness for detaining it for so long, but this is probably one of the central clauses in the Bill and these are fundamental changes. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that they should be rejected. I hope that he can do so without ruffling the feathers of the hon. Member for Bath too much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> It has been a useful debate. Some side issues have inevitably been raised because of the wide-ranging speech by the Under-Secretary. Like the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East and others, I am still in a quandary about the use of facilities. The hon. Member for Hexham talked about a bus coming from 20 miles away. It could be rather more difficult for a coach arriving from a foreign country visiting the area. I hope that the Minister will consider the problems associated with that. He, sadly, has given no comfort about the implications of the Competition Act. I should be more than happy to give way to him if he wishes to do so now. [Interruption.] I am delighted to hear that he will respond in a second.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East made a fascinating speech. Surprisingly, I agreed with nearly everything that he said. His understanding of the problems that would be created by a one-sided partnership are exactly the problems I spoke of earlier. Both he and the Minister have simply swallowed the line of what is in the Bill. The Minister said that he did not want local authorities to control fares and frequencies, and neither do I. The hon. Gentleman said that services and frequencies would be dictated by someone else. Nothing is further from my view that they should be dictated by a local authority, but it is perfectly reasonable for a local authority and an operator to come together to discuss what they jointly think is appropriate in relation to fares, frequency and timing.
<P>
If two parties choose to make that co-operation part of the quality partnership, why are the Government denying them that opportunity? If the Minister is adamant that it will be excluded and that it will have to sit alongside the quality partnership in, as he put it, a codicil, so be it. But he will have to explain how those codicils will not fall foul of that Act, as so many are already doing and more will do after 1 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This has been a wide-ranging and interesting debate. I am grateful for all the contributions. Hon. Members have asked important questions and thereby given me the opportunity to clarify the Government's intentions. I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan for his supportive remarks, which drew on his wide experience of these matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke) asked about seatbelts. I do not seek to duck the question, but he will know that seatbelt requirements are governed by the construction and use regulations as well as European directives. As he acknowledged, it is not directly a matter for the Bill. I hope that he will permit me to write to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham raised a number of matters, including the question of special signing. We do not anticipate special signing for quality partnership schemes. It will be the job of the traffic commissioners to monitor and enforce them against details lodged with them.
<P>
Let me offer the hon. Gentleman some comfort about minibuses from his constituency to Newcastle. He will be aware that the Bill applies to local bus services which are defined as services operating within a 15-mile radius. I strongly suspect that the services of which he spoke would fall outside those provisions. The same applies to the point made by the hon. Member for Bath about long-distance foreign coaches, which also would fall outside the provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister says that they fall outside the provisions. Will vehicles originating from more than 15 miles away, be it within the United Kingdom or from overseas, be able to use bus lanes and other facilities because of the quality partnership?

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The answer is that they would not be a local service, so they would not be governed by the provisions. I hope that that is of some comfort to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I am immensely grateful to my hon. Friend and guru the Member for West Bromwich, East for his support and his extremely well-informed and cogent views, which, as all of us know, are based on his knowledge of the bus industry. He explained clearly the advantages of quality partnership schemes in the form in which the Government have proposed them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to add to my panegyric on my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I always enjoy the contributions that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East makes to the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Competition Act, as I did. If the Minister cannot give us some idea today—I know that we will discuss this on other clauses—will he write to members of the Committee? There is genuine concern on this issue, which needs to be resolved before our debate on this part of the Bill is concluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As they say, I was just coming to that. The hon. Member for Poole picked up on the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East offered a manuscript amendment on the subject. I am extremely grateful for the late amendment, but we did anticipate the matter to a certain extent.
<P>
It seems that two issues are connected with the Competition Act. One is the imminent issue of its coming into force on 1 March which the hon. Member for Poole mentioned. It is true that existing voluntary quality partnerships may be subject to the Act. This will ultimately be a matter for the Office of Fair Trading. I know that the OFT is aware of the issues. In fact, I owe its awareness in part to the early representations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart). I pay tribute to his work in highlighting worrying issues such as unfair competition arising in his PTE area from cowboy operators, and the consequential actions of the OFT. He wrote to the Department some time ago and we have thought about it and made representations to the Department of Trade and Industry. I am grateful for my hon. Friend's assistance.
<P>
We have made representations to the OFT. I remind the Committee that the Act allows for public benefits to be taken into account when the OFT considers these matters. I hope that it will issue guidance to the bus industry and I know that it will consider block exemptions, as provided in the Competition Act. Thus, such consideration already occurs.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend, but this is an important point. Will those exemptions have to be sought by individual operators or by the bus industry as a whole?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As usual, inspiration has winged its way to me. The answer is that the industry as a whole will have to seek them.
<P>
As I said, we intend to table amendments on the subject of competition to ensure that the clauses providing for quality partnerships, ticketing and subsidies dovetail properly with competition legislation. I know that the hon. Member for Bath has already tabled amendments to that effect but, with the greatest respect, we prefer to deploy parliamentary counsel, who is already busily drafting amendments to clauses 96 to 103 on quality partnerships, clauses 115 to 118 on ticketing schemes and clause 130(4) on subsidies. We have therefore anticipated that matter and firm and prompt action will be taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> As I said, we have had a wide-ranging debate and I am delighted that the Under-Secretary has been able to give us some comfort in relation to many hon. Members' concerns about the Competition Act. I am also delighted that he acknowledged the need to table additional amendments to the Bill to deal with that. We look forward to them with great interest.
<P>
I am left somewhat confused, because it appears that the majority of members of the Committee want one-sided quality partnerships that would allow local authorities to impose a number of conditions on bus operators. It seems that a local authority will be able to impose detailed requirements regarding the cleanliness of vehicles and precisely what pollutants are to come out of the back of them. According to the Under-Secretary, they will even be able to specify, in considerable detail, drivers' training qualifications. In return for a company agreeing to fulfil all those requirements and many others, it will be allowed to use particular facilities, including bus routes, but at the same time, to protect the investment, the local authority will be given no guarantee on how many times, even as a minimum, the bus company will run up and down that expensive bus lane. I find that somewhat bizarre, but it clearly accords with the Committee's wishes, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 501, in page 57, line 37, after `vehicles', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and drivers'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the claims made by the White Paper was that partnerships would produce high-quality schemes, of which better training and better staff were an essential part. The amendment would therefore ensure that drivers are a factor to be taken into account. After all, many of us know that a good-quality driver is important for both safety and a good service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Gale, that I intend to be brief. We had an extremely full debate on the previous group of amendments and it will come as no surprise to the Committee that, for similar reasons, I cannot accept amendment No. 501. It may help for me to assure the hon. Gentleman that standards for bus drivers as well as for the buses themselves are already within the scope of clause 96. I can well imagine, for example, that local authorities might want to use their quality partnership powers to require that drivers should have training in customer care. He would obviously welcome that even if the hon. Member for Bath in his more recent libertarian mode would not. The word ``include'' in clause 96(5) is important. We do not need to set it out more fully on the face of the Bill.
<P>
I hope that in the light of those remarks the hon. Gentleman will be content to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his response. Reflecting on the amendment, I do not wish to press it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is technical and simply extends to other places the power to make traffic regulation orders. This power is not limited to roads. Traffic regulation orders can be made in other places, for example bus stations off the highway. Thus the definition in clause 138 of the Bill refers to regulating the use by public service vehicles of ``roads or other places''. This amendment simply brings the wording of this clause in line with that of clause 138.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the follow amendments: No. 548, in page 58, line 29, leave out paragraph (f) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) such other persons or authorities who may have an interest in the establishment of such a scheme.'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) such other persons or authorities who may have an interest in the establishment of such a scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The clause deals with consultation on both schemes. We believe that the authorities should consult groups who are representative of user groups. The clause gives only the option specifying those that they think fit to consult.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 548 and 549, again the current paragraphs are vague and leave it to the wit of the authorities as to whom they consult. We think that this should be specified more clearly and that they should consult those who may have an interest in the establishment of a bus scheme.
<P>
That is all I wish to say, Mr. Gale, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's concern that there should be proper and full consultation, but I hope that I can reassure him that his amendments are unnecessary. Let me stress that the consultation requirements are requirements: the word used in each clause is ``must''.
<P>
As to subsection (4)(b) and the requirement to consult representatives of bus users, the ``as they think fit'', which he highlighted as a potential problem, does not exempt a local authority from the requirement to consult but it gives a degree of flexibility to enable consultation to be undertaken in a way that responds to varying local circumstances, for example, the extent to which local bus users are indeed organised. Local authorities, however, have to act reasonably and the word ``must'' remains in force. A failure to consult would, therefore, lay the local authority open to judicial challenge.
<P>
As to clauses 97(4)(f) and 105(3)(g), the wording is fairly broad but I suggest that that is appropriate. The word ``persons'', believe it or not, does legally include local authorities. A local authority is unlikely to consult anyone who has no interest in a scheme. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the consultation obligation is a real one and that we have a common objective in seeking to ensure that consultation does take place. I hope that he will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his reply and I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 503, page 58, line 42, leave out from `scheme' to end of line 43.
<P>
This is a probing amendment to deal with clause 98(3), which refers to local services being ``excluded from the scheme''. The amendment simply allows us to ask what the criteria for exclusion should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am delighted that on this occasion I have to respond to the hon. Member for Hexham because I think that I may have further good news for him.
<P>
We intend clause 98(3) to allow a local authority to judge services to be inappropriate to be subject to the quality partnership requirements. For example, it could be crucial to ensure that a bus runs to an outlying village for which that service is a lifeline. That is exactly the sort of matter on which the hon. Gentleman has expressed concern. Such a service may only be a small part of the many services running along a quality partnership corridor and a local authority might conclude that it is not right it to have to be raised to the full partnership requirement. Equally, the local authority might conclude under the clause that another less stringent policy requirement is appropriate. The clause ensures that the exclusion and alternative requirements are part of the scheme, so all the publication and consultation requirements will apply. The provisions are about giving local authorities proper room for discretion to tailor local solutions to local circumstances, while not providing exemption from all of the procedural requirements.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hexham will ask leave to withdraw the amendment on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> That almost earns me a letter home, which would be my first for this Committee. If the Committee co-operates, however, I may be able to see my wife tonight. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 505, in page 59, line 27, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A) If the authority or authorities, following consultation under section 97, decide that it is not appropriate to make the scheme, a bus operator who has offered to participate in the scheme may appeal to a panel established by the elected members of the authority or authorities or to the Transport Tribunal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is necessary principally to ensure that the bus operator has a right to appeal if he has been led to believe that his company is participating in the scheme but has then been refused involvement after consultation. It is especially important because the unamended consultation procedure is so vague.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not suppose that it will come as a massive surprise to the hon. Gentleman that I shall request him to withdraw the amendment. Bus operators are likely to be keen on quality partnerships, but I do not think it appropriate for them to be able to take steps that could overrule a local authority decision and cause it not to go ahead. We must leave the discretionary policy judgment with the local authority. After all, it is part of the terms of the amendment that the local authority would have consulted, so the views of others, including bus users, will therefore have been taken into account as well as those of the enthusiastic bus operator, as he is assumed to be in the amendment.
<P>
One could find technical flaws in the amendment. For example, it says nothing about what the panel or transport tribunal can do if it sympathises with the bus operator. It looks very odd for an appeal against a local authority to be made to a panel set up by that authority. I doubt whether the transport tribunal, which is a judicial body set up to hear appeals against decisions made by traffic commissioners, is the appropriate vehicle for such complex matters.
<P>
My difficulty with the amendment is, however, more one of principle. It would not be right for anyone—not even a panel comprising members of the local authority—to be able to overturn what is essentially a policy judgment of an elected local authority, which will have been made after consultation. For all those powerful reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am disappointed with that answer, but I shall smother my disappointment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Clause 98</center></H4>
<H4><center>Making of scheme</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider new clause 11—Publication—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—A local authority or authorities making a quality partnership scheme under section 98 must publish annually in at least one newspaper circulating in the area to which the scheme relates information about—
<P>
(a) the facilities provided by the authority or authorities,
<P>
(b) performance against the standard of services provided by operators of local services specified in the scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): The new clause proposes that the local authority or authorities making a quality partnership scheme in accordance with clause 98 shall publish, at least once a year, information about the authority or authorities and about performance against the standard of service provided by operators of local services in the scheme. We hope to encourage the Government in the belief that there should be publicly available information against which people may measure the standard of service that is being achieved. That is consistent with the spirit of amendment No. 448, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Bath, which the Minister described as a ``King Lear amendment''. I am not sure that I care for the way in which he thought that it had been produced. I hope that this is not the ``Macbeth new clause''.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is that the public will get good information. There is a right to know. People should understand the way in which the quality partnership schemes are measuring up against what the Committee would agree are high public expectations. The Government have accepted the principle of the right to know through their initiatives such as modernising Government, best value and service first. Only last week, a Minister announced that there were to be consumer champions in central Government. Many people welcomed the proposal.
<P>
It is important that the Government do not respond by hiding behind the idea that commercial confidentiality is involved. The Minister might respond to that point in particular. Commercial operators will receive public subsidy. Rail passengers are entitled to see detailed information comparing rail companies' performance regularly. Bus operators benefit from fuel duty rebate and support for concessionary fare schemes. Some receive the rural bus subsidy. It is only right that they, too, should be accountable.
<P>
The Minister will, I hope, agree that the performance of bus operators is generally patchy—I exclude the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East from that comment. According to the Government—[Interruption.] I excluded the company that the hon. Gentleman runs. I did not want to provoke an aggressive intervention—not that the hon. Gentleman is aggressive.
<P>
According to the Government's research through the People's Panel by MORI in October 1998, 16 per cent. of those polled were fairly dissatisfied with local bus services and a further 7 per cent. were very dissatisfied. The dissatisfaction was slightly higher than among users of train services, which are widely known to be disreputable.
<P>
In a People's Panel survey in January 1999, the greatest dissatisfaction with bus services concerned the cost—28 per cent. of passengers rated bus fares as poor or very poor. Twenty-five per cent. of passengers thought that frequency of service was poor or very poor, and 22 per cent. of them believed that of the reliability of services. Comfort was rated as poor or very poor by 17 per cent. of passengers, and personal safety received those ratings from 15 per cent. of users. In each instance, users wanted to know the bus operators' performances—34 per cent. of those polled wanted more information about buses, specifying that what they wanted most was information about standards of service.
<P>
The Government have announced that they intend to conduct regular national satisfaction surveys to monitor performance against national targets. Bus services are essentially local and performance inevitably varies. Local bus users want to know how their services are performing, not what is the average performance of bus companies, although we concede that that would be welcome information.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bath said, we want quality partnerships to succeed, but they will achieve their full potential only if they build confidence throughout the community, not just among existing passengers, and show that they deliver improved services and facilities in their areas. We hope that bus authorities and operators will welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that. We hope that the clause will achieve that aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government are committed to open government and to establishing targets, of which I understand that there are now in excess of 4,000—I hope that we can deliver on them. Therefore, I am not unsympathetic to the purpose of the new clause, but I do not believe that I do not believe that its detailed provisions are necessary.
<P>
New clause 11 would require local authorities to publish an annual notice in a local newspaper about any quality partnership scheme facilities provided by them and the performance of bus operators against quality partnership standards. On the matter of facilities, I believe that the new clause is unnecessary. Clause 98(6) already provides that local authorities must publish a notice for each quality partnership scheme that is established, giving full details of the scheme or saying where those details can be inspected. Authorities will already have given similar notice when they bring forward schemes for consultation. Therefore, the information about quality partnership scheme facilities will already be publicly available. I submit that nothing more is needed, especially because the facilities will be physical, material objects that are unlikely to change annually.
<P>
On the second limb of the new clause, we do not believe that a requirement to publish information about performance against standards is appropriate. The traffic commissioners, not the local authority, are the primary enforcing body, so it is for them to be satisfied that bus operators are complying with their registered details. As we previously discussed, that will include compliance by operators with any standards imposed under a quality partnership scheme when they avail themselves of quality partnership facilities. Of course, the traffic commissioners already produce annual reports on their activities, which are available to the public, and they will continue to do so under the new quality partnership regime.
<P>
Local authorities have a general duty to keep their local transport plan and, therefore, their bus strategy under review. They can certainly be expected to have an interest in monitoring compliance with quality partnership schemes at some level and, no doubt, they will be anxious to bring to the attention of the traffic commissioners any breaches that they detect. They will remain free to make whatever public reports they wish, but it is simply not appropriate to lay on them a duty in law to publish information annually on the subject. Against that background, I hope that the hon. Member for Ettrick, Tweeddale and Lauderdale will agree to withdraw the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The Minister has returned to his previous form, in so far as remembering the name of my constituency, although he did not make as much of a mouthful of it as the writer of a letter that I received from First Bus, which was addressed to Michael Moore, ``Tweedle, Ettrick and Lauderdale''.
<P>
I have listened to the Minister's remarks about the traffic commissioners. It seems that I will be the only member of the Committee who will not be able to write home to his mother at the end of today; I might have to come up with another reason for doing so. Our concern is that information should be easily accessible and freely available, on a regular basis and in a form that is recognisable by the public. With respect to the traffic commissioners, that information is not always as publicly available as we would like. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will let us know how he intends to make that information more accessible. However, I accept your word, Mr. Gale, about the technicalities of the issue, to which we shall no doubt return in due course. I hope that the Under-Secretary will honour his assurances.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We all know that, for technical or legal reasons, it is sometimes necessary to postpone schemes. Will the Government keep a record of the number of postponements? Some local authorities may be worse than others. Although postponements should not exceed 12 months, a postponement may have financial implications because private sector companies may make investments on the basis of a scheme starting on a particular date. One postponement may not be a problem, but if authorities postpone schemes several times, operators could be put at a great disadvantage. An operator may negotiate with an authority to produce a scheme that does not go ahead and, as a result, lose the opportunity to provide a service to another opportunity; it is an opportunity cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, to which I am not unsympathetic. If a local authority were regularly to postpone the introduction of schemes, it would certainly be bad news for operators. It would also be a failure for the local authority properly to implement the provisions—a failure to take its responsibilities seriously. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are likely to become aware of such problems but I am not sure that we would want to go so far as to compile a register of such postponements.
<P>
We are not a Government who are sympathetic to the nanny state approach—an approach that, increasingly, I notice emanating from the Opposition Benches. Conservative Members seem to want to regulate practically every aspect of the arrangements. However, it is an interesting and important point; I shall certainly bear it in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary. The partnership between local authorities and private companies is important, and a financial cost could be involved. I accept what the Minister said, but it would be useful to keep an eye on postponements, because such inefficiency could have an adverse effect on some companies.

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 506, in page 60, line 3, leaveout subsection (2).
<P>
This is a probing amendment, designed to throw light on something that is utterly unclear. It anticipates amendment No. 386. The short question is, what on earth does subsection (2) mean? In what circumstances would subsection (1) not apply because a local authority had been temporarily unable to provide the facilities due to factors beyond its control. What does it mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Hexham realises that clause 100(1) imposes an obligation on local authorities to provide the specified facilities as part of a partnership agreement. Those facilities could include traffic lights to give priority to buses. Let us suppose that the traffic lights have failed because of a power failure in the surrounding area. Unless subsection (2) was in place, the local authority would automatically be in default of its obligations, even though the failure was not its responsibility. It is a safeguard against an authority being in default though force majeure. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises its purpose, and that it is a sensible provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> In our debate on new clause 11, we said that the local authority has an important role to play in the establishment of quality partnerships. It is an omission that the local traffic authority is not involved in the process. Amendment No. 386 highlights the fact that subsection (4) provides a generous get-out clause for the operator of local services. How limited is the opportunity to make use of that loophole? Amendment No. 387 is largely self-explanatory. Why does the Under-Secretary believes that the operator should not need to have due regard to the local transport plan?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale made a brief contribution, but the amendment raises important issues that I need to address. I notice the horrified glance of the Government Whip, Mr. Gale, so I shall try to do it rapidly.
<P>
The amendments are all concerned with obligations on bus operators in connection with quality partnership schemes. Amendment No. 470 would require the operator to give a written undertaking to the traffic authority before using the scheme facilities; that would be in addition to giving such an undertaking to the traffic commissioners under subsection (4)(a). I am not convinced that that is appropriate. The purpose of the written undertaking to the traffic commissioners is to ensure that the commissioners are aware that a particular bus operator expects to be using the quality partnership scheme facilities, and is committed to meeting the necessary quality standards when doing so. It is information that the commissioners need in order to support their role in monitoring and enforcing compliance with bus registration details.
<P>
The traffic authority has no statutory function in that respect. However, we envisage that the undertaking itself will be one of the matters to be included by the traffic commissioners in Notices and Proceedings. For members of the Committee who are not familiar with that august journal, I need say only that it is a regular publication of the traffic commissioners, in which they are required to include details of new and varied bus registrations and public services vehicle operator licences. Copies are available for inspection free of charge at the offices of the traffic commissioners. I shall not get in the way of the stampede to that location.
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 386. Subsection (4)(b) provides a defence for a bus operator temporarily unable to comply with the quality partnership scheme standards on account of circumstances beyond its control. It is a perfectly reasonable provision, which is common to many areas of contract law. Indeed, we discussed the question of force majeure in the context of licensing under part I. If we were to omit that defence, bus operators, through no fault of their own, would find themselves unable to enjoy the benefit of quality partnership scheme facilities, or in danger of breaching their bus registration conditions, simply because of a temporary problem.
<P>
For example, if a bus breaks down or is involved in an accident, an operator would have to decide whether to replace the bus with an older one that might not meet the quality partnership standards or, in extreme cases, leave passengers without a bus until the original one could be repaired or replaced. The amendment would prevent the operator from using the quality partnership facilities while running that lower quality bus, even temporarily.
<P>
That seems harsh—not only on the operator, but also on bus passengers, who might be left waiting at the bus stop simply because the operator was legally prevented from keeping the service going. It seems only fair to provide for a reasonable degree of latitude when a temporary problem prevents the bus operator from fully meeting its obligations. Subsection (2) provides an equivalent defence for local authorities for the provision of scheme facilities, which we have just debated.
<P>
Amendment No. 387 seeks to introduce additional tests to be met in subsection (4). To be eligible to use the quality partnership scheme facilities, the bus operator must also provide the service,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``having due regard to the local transport plan''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and having
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consulted with all the relevant local authorities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary with regard to the local transport plan. A local authority must, at the outset, satisfy itself that a quality partnership scheme does, to some extent, implement the local transport plan. That is provided for in clause 96. It is unnecessary to provide additionally that, in running a service, the bus operator must have regard to the local transport plan.
<P>
Nor is it appropriate for the bus operator to have to consult local authorities. The obligation to consult rests on the local authority, in the context of preparing its local transport plan and bus strategy under clauses 92 to 95. It would be unnecessary to require every bus operator additionally to consult traffic authorities. In most cases, those will be the same authorities that drew up the quality partnership scheme in the first place. The only exception will be in the case of a quality partnership scheme in a metropolitan district area that does not involve a traffic order for which the metropolitan district is the traffic authority. Even then, it is most likely that the district authority will have been consulted on the scheme anyway under clause 97. I have tried to give a comprehensive reply to the points that have been raised and, in the light of my remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The Under-Secretary was generous with the quality and speed of his reply. I hope that it was not too fast for the Official Report. In the Spirit of not being churlish, which has typified my contributions all week, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 100 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 101</center></H4>
<H4><center>Variation or revocation of scheme</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 388, in page 60, line 33, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where the consent of the operator or operators to revoke a scheme under the terms of subsection (2) above is not forthcoming, the authority or authorities may, after due consultation with the operator or operators, and user groups, and having given notice of their intention, terminate the scheme within twelve months.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that it is advisable to include a longstop, so that there is legal provision for a local authority to end a scheme when co-operation with a bus operator has broken down. Subsection (2) says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consent must not be unreasonably withheld.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, there could be considerable room for argument about what is unreasonable. It could be in the interests of an unsatisfactory bus operator to cling on to running a particular service and keeping the benefit of local authority facilities, even where it is clear that the travelling public are getting a raw deal. We have also added the requirement that a user group should be consulted before the plug is pulled. That will be a good way of verifying whether bus users feel that they are getting a raw deal and that it is time to end the failing scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but I hope that when he has heard my brief response he will accept that the amendment is undesirable. The Bill already provides for the termination of a quality partnership by consent and states that the operator's consent may not be unreasonably withheld. If consent were unreasonably withheld, in circumstances such as those described by the hon. Gentleman, it would be open to the local authority to pursue an action in the courts.
<P>
Instead of the test of reasonableness included in the legislation, the amendment would create a situation in which one party could act on its own account after 12 months without the consent of the other. That goes back to the issue that we debated at length this afternoon about one-sided agreements. We do not believe that the amendment is in line with a framework that establishes a genuinely two-sided partnership.
<P>
Obviously, there will be circumstances in which the service breaks down, for whatever reason, and it is no longer sensible to maintain it. In the case of bus operators, that might simply mean no longer being able to provide the quality of vehicles that were envisaged when the scheme was set up or, in the case of Bath, sedan chair operators no longer being able to provide the quality of carrier that they would wish to offer. In such circumstances, termination would be appropriate, and we believe that the right way to achieve that is, first, by agreement and then, if the agreement is unreasonably withheld, through the courts. However, we do not believe that it is right to allow unilateral termination for the reasons that I have outlined. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept what I have said and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful that, without going into detail, the Minister deployed argument three yet again, by making reference to sedan chairs, which provide a wonderful public service in my constituency. He reminds me of how foolish we have been not to include them in another of our amendments. That demonstrates, yet again, the advantage of argument three.
<P>
The Minister and I are at one in recognising that two-sided partnerships can break down. The question is what happens in those circumstances. His solution, and that of the Bill's, is recourse to the courts, but that is often time-consuming. Our proposal has the advantage of fixing the time limit at a maximum of 12 months. I prefer our alternative, but his confidence that matters will proceed reasonably quickly gives me some comfort. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 101 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 102 and 103 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish all hon. Members an enjoyable brief recess. I send Mr. Syms off to see Mrs. Syms, with whom we hope he will be able to spend at least a little time.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]

Adjourned accordingly at twenty-five minutes past Five o'clock till Tuesday 29 February at halfpast Ten o'clock.
