</P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Claire Curtis-Thomas </B>(Crosby): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during the proceedings on the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is a pleasure to find that you are chairing the Committee, Mrs Roe. I am grateful for your support. It is a delight to welcome hon. Members from all parties who have such a considerable interest in animal welfare.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that might be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.

<P>
I am happy for hon. Members to remove their jackets if they feel that they will be more comfortable.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application of Act</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 14, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) For the purposes of subsection (2), ``animals kept for commercial purposes'' shall include animals kept for farming or commercial breeding, animals kept by zoos or circuses, animals kept for sale in pet shops, animals kept for racing, animals being looked after by kennels or catteries, guard and sniffer dogs, dray horses and horses kept by riding schools or establishments.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 14, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) For the purposes of subsection (2), an animal kept shall be deemed to be kept for commercial purposes where the sole purpose of keeping it is financial profit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I join the promoter of the Bill in welcoming you to the Chair, Mrs Roe. I think that this is the first time that I have had the privilege of serving on a Committee under your chairmanship. It is a particular pleasure given that you and I go back some way-perhaps further than either of us would care to admit.

<P>
I say at the outset that I do not intend in any way unnecessarily to delay the progress of the Bill. I hope that we shall find ways of getting it on to the statute book, although the way ahead looks slightly difficult at the moment.

<P>
I feel strongly that Standing Committee proceedings should always be taken seriously, and should be used properly as an opportunity to scrutinise Bills and to consider, in as much detail as is necessary, their contents and relevance. I therefore make no apology for saying to the Committee that most of the amendments tabled in my name and in that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean)-who sends his apologies to the Committee for being unavoidably delayed elsewhere-arise largely from a recent letter to me, dated 16 June, from the Pet Care Trust. The letter makes several important points about the Bill, and offers us the opportunity, through the amendments that I have tabled, to reassure ourselves that the wording of the Bill is as it should be, and is fit for the purpose for which it was intended.

<P>
I shall not read out the whole text of the letter-I suspect that it is already in the possession of the promoter of the Bill and the Minister, and perhaps other hon. Members-but I should like to give a flavour of what it says. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whilst we fully support the aims of the Bill to improve standards of responsible ownership we feel that there are some serious errors in the text and that, because there has been no process of public consultation-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we were certainly not consulted, it adds, with an element of pique-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Bill, as it stands, does not reflect either the reality of any problems or focus upon where concerns actually do exist.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are quite serious charges. Although I suspect that they arise from misunderstandings, the job of the Committee, and the task that I have set myself in tabling amendments, is to ensure, as far as possible, that the anxieties expressed by the Pet Care Trust are unfounded. Between them, the Minister and the promoter of the Bill should be able to satisfy the Committee that that is so.

<P>
The letter continues: ``The supposition''-that is, from our debate of 19 May-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>was that pet animals were the focus of this legislation, and yet the explanation given was that pet animals were specifically to be excluded. Therefore does the Bill aim to regulate the pet shop, boarding kennel or cattery-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which are, as the letter points out, already heavily regulated-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or is it aimed at farm animals?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are intended to tease out that question.

<P>
The Protection of Animals Act 1911, which the Bill amends, seeks-in 1911 language-comprehensively to define ``animal'', ``domestic animal'', ``captive animal'', ``horse'' and, rather quaintly, ``knacker''. We need not concern ourselves too much with that, but as the Pet Care Trust points out, the world has moved on since 1911. Although definitions of animals may not have changed, society in the early part of this new century regards and treats animals in a way that could not have been envisaged in 1911, and we must satisfy ourselves that the Bill's wording is adequate for the purpose. The amendments therefore try to deal with the questions raised by the Pet Care Trust. In particular, they try to establish whether the Bill properly answers those questions, or whether they would improve it.

<P>
Amendment No. 2 tries to clarify subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>those sections only apply in relation to an animal which the owner keeps or has kept for commercial purposes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps amendment No. 2 is not particularly elegantly worded, but its purpose is to establish whether the promoter and the Minister, working in harness, can satisfy Committee members that the Bill, as drafted, answers the questions raised by the Pet Care Trust. Would the amendment-or one with similar wording-do a better job?

<P>
I shall not elaborate further. I hope that I have got across the gist of the matter as I see it, and that I am doing justice to the Pet Care Trust, to whose letter I shall return briefly in due course. My aim is to probe, seek clarification, and ensure that the Bill leaves this Committee in the best possible shape.

<P>
<B>Mrs Curtis-Thomas:</B> I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). I, too, have received a copy of the letter from the Pet Care Trust, and I acknowledge the concerns expressed in it. I have referred it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for detailed consideration and a response.

<P>
The definition of commercial animals in amendment No. 1 largely repeats paragraph 8 of the explanatory notes, which can be used by the courts as an aid to interpretation where there is genuine doubt about the meaning of the provision. However, to the extent that the amendment's definition does not repeat paragraph 8, the inclusion of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>animals being looked after by kennels or catteries  and horses kept by riding schools or establishments,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could vastly extend the Bill's scope. It could include animals not otherwise regarded as kept for commercial purposes, such as pet dogs and cats in boarding or quarantine establishments, and horses on livery.

<P>
I therefore propose that amendment No. 1 be rejected. The Bill as drafted adequately covers-this is the important point-animals reared solely for profit as part of commercial operations. Although other legislation attempted to create a strict and comprehensive definition of the term ``commercial'', there is no overarching definition. I do not consider a tighter definition to be appropriate or necessary. The term ``commercial'' is widely understood and a tighter definition might lead to the creation of loopholes. Ultimately, of course, it is for the prosecution to prove that an animal is or was kept for commercial purposes. I recognise the right hon. Gentleman's concerns but, on this occasion, his proposals would not keep the Bill within its desirable limited scope.

<P>
The description in amendment No. 2 falls within any definition of ``commercial''. The amendment would add nothing to the Bill at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am most grateful to the promoter of the Bill for that explanation. I suspect that the problem might have arisen-it is perfectly understandable that it should-because a body such as the Pet Care Trust might read the Bill but not be aware of the explanatory notes. It was helpful of the hon. Lady to explain that although the explanatory notes are not part of the Bill-I need to be careful here-they provide adequate and substantial guidance on its intent and the way in which it should be interpreted. That is helpful and it might assist us to make even more rapid progress with subsequent amendments.

<P>
I accept the hon. Lady's comments on the word ``commercial''. She said that it is a well-known term
 that should not involve difficulties of interpretation. On that basis, and in gratitude to the hon. Lady, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, leave out lines 20 to 27 and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) the Veterinary Investigation Service.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5, in Clause 1, page 1, leave out lines 20 to 27.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The amendment brings us to the third paragraph of the letter from the Pet Care Trust. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our concern with the Bill is that it seems specifically to allow for the provision of statutory powers to non-statutorily (and democratically) elected bodies, which seems to indicate that anybody with an interest in a particular matter relating to animal welfare can, having completed a few formalities, initiate prosecutions and maliciously do so with the intention of receiving funds for the purposes of looking after the animals at a profit subsequently. It is after all not unknown for organisations to ascribe costs to a process that do not really belong there!<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an interesting point of view. Anyone who has even a glancing familiarity with corporate accountancy knows that that is certainly the case. However, I am not convinced that that matter need concern us here, and I shall not test your patience, Mrs Roe, by discussing it further.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are designed to probe a matter on which it is worth dwelling for a moment, and which was raised on Second Reading. Clause 1(3)(e), which I want to make more specific, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in relation to a prosecution in England, a person who, at the request of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has entered into a written agreement under which he may perform the functions conferred on a prosecutor by virtue of this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision might be far too permissive. On the face of it, it appears to allow almost anyone-albeit, I accept, at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food-to act as the prosecutor. Is not that too flexible, open and, frankly, far too trusting of the Minister and the Ministry? I say that with some diffidence, but we must satisfy ourselves beyond peradventure that nothing is likely to go wrong with a provision of this kind. On the face of it, it seems very loose. That is the thrust of what the Pet Care Trust is saying, and I defer to its knowledge of this subject because of the business in which it is involved. The trust claims to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the professional association representing the interests of the pet industry with some 1,500 member companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To that extent, I should think that it knows of what it speaks, especially on the subject of regulation and prosecutions.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Perhaps I can persuade the Minister to help the Committee on this matter. My amendment seeks to replace the provisions in clause 1(3)(e) with the more specific requirement that only the veterinary investigation service could act as prosecutor, instead of what appears to be any old person. If right hon. and hon. Members are not minded to accept the amendment, we need words from the Minister to reassure us that nothing will go wrong as a result of the provision. That is not an unreasonable request. The paragraph is very broadly-I will not say loosely-written. I understand the nervousness expressed by some people who think that they might be subject to prosecution by someone who is neither fit nor to be trusted to do that.

<P>
It is important to get the provisions right, because the entire Bill has the potential to affect people's livelihoods. It would help me and the Committee if the Minister could tell us how he interprets clause 1(3)(e). I intend no disrespect to the hon. Member for Crosby, the promoter of the Bill; perhaps we shall hear from her as well.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley) Following the invitation from the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, it might be convenient if I respond on behalf of the Government. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby is the promoter of the Bill-and is doing an excellent job, if I may say so-it is the Government who will be responsible for implementing it and for interpreting the clauses. In that respect, I should be only too pleased to respond to the right hon. Gentleman's legitimate concerns, because his amendments relate to the Government's implementation of the provisions.</B><P>

<P>
The point raised by the right hon. Gentleman and by the Pet Care Trust is perfectly legitimate. The Government would want to be satisfied that a measure of this kind could not be abused-for example, by vexatious prosecutions being brought by people with a grudge against an organisation or institution. We are anxious to ensure that that would not happen, and this clause has been drafted as a safeguard. It makes it very clear that any organisation empowered to bring a prosecution under the Bill, apart from the organisations specified, would need a written agreement with and written authority from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): Will the Minister tell the Committee how the system works at the moment under the terms of the 1911 Act? He will be aware that virtually all prosecutions are brought by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Is that done on the basis of a written agreement with MAFF, or does the society take on the role of the citizen as a prosecutor, just as anyone could in bringing a private prosecution under the Act? Does the Bill mirror the provisions of the Act in terms of the relationship between the prosecutor and MAFF, or is this a new departure?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> In some ways, this is a much clearer way of setting out who has the power to bring prosecutions. I am not a lawyer, but I suspect that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is right and that bodies such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals bring prosecutions. The safeguard in the 1911 Act is that if animals are being removed the power must come from the police.

<P>
The RSPCA has a long and distinguished record of bringing prosecutions to protect animals. Under the 1911 Act, prosecutions can also be brought by local authorities and often are, as well as by my Ministry, which often does so. That is what the clause refers to. Organisations such as the RSPCA are experienced, reputable and have the resources available, and it would be reasonable for them to enter into a written agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to bring prosecutions. We shall decide with whom to enter a written agreement and I assure the Committee that we shall do so only with reputable organisations with the background and experience to bring actions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Without wanting an exhaustive list at this stage, will the Minister give the Committee the flavour of the organisations that he has in mind? Reference has been made to the RSPCA, but it would be helpful if he could give us an idea of the sort of organisation or people with whom the Ministry might make a written agreement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> At this stage, the RSPCA is the principal organisation that we have in mind. Other, equally reputable organisations might want to bring a prosecution and we would want to give them the opportunity to do so, but that would depend on the situation and the track record of the organisation concerned. All organisations would be subject to criteria laid down by the Ministry and it might help the right hon. Gentleman if I outline some of those criteria. They include whether the person or body has adequate resources to provide care for the animals concerned, including facilities for care, the ability to provide adequate food, water and veterinary treatment, the financial resources available to the applicant and, when appropriate, whether the person or body has a proven track record in securing convictions under the 1911 Act. For example, if a person or body had a string of unsuccessful prosecutions, it is unlikely that we would enter into an agreement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It is not quite clear from the clause what the financial relationship would be between the Ministry and the person with whom the written agreement would be entered into. If the RSPCA decides to bring a prosecution under the 1911 Act, it does so off its own bat and bears its own costs. If it fails, it is responsible for the financial costs. Under the authorisation procedure in the Bill, will the Ministry certify organisations as being fit to bring proceedings, or will the Ministry use those organisations as agents and take the financial rap for any consequences that flow from, for example, a misguided prosecution? It is worth bearing in mind that the proceedings will always be intimately linked with a prosecution.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will forgive me for probing, but the point is important. If an organisation brings an independent prosecution under the 1911 Act and the prosecution succeeds, the costs are recovered, the offender is convicted and there may be no problem.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he was making an intervention. He now seems to be making a speech. Will he draw his comments to a conclusion and perhaps make a speech later on?

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I apologise, Mrs Roe. If the Minister will clarify that, I shall then amplify my remarks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I think that I can clarify that. MAFF will not enter into a financial relationship with anyone who is authorised. In some ways, it is not even a formal stamp of approval, although the criteria would have to be met. One criterion is that a body must have adequate resources before bringing such a prosecution. The provision is a filter, for the purpose mentioned by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst-to stop vexatious prosecutions and to ensure that they are brought by a reputable organisation. Any financial consequences are clearly a matter for the prosecution, whether it is the RSPCA, ourselves in MAFF or local authorities. Therefore, I hope that I have reassured the Committee on that point.

<P>
Amendment No. 6 would include in the Bill the new body, the Veterinary Investigation Service. That body no longer exists. It has been absorbed into the Veterinary Laboratory Agency, which is not an appropriate body for bringing prosecutions. The state veterinary service, which is included in the clause, has the power to bring prosecutions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I apologise again, Mrs Roe, for my lengthy intervention. One of the problems with a small Bill is that one starts to think of things as one stands up. There is a point here that cannot be ignored. It is not to be dealt with by amendment at this stage, but I hope that the Minister will have a word with his officials to help the hon. Member for Crosby.

<P>
Under the system of prosecution set out in the 1911 Act the prosecuting individual is acting as an individual. I believe that I could prosecute somebody under that Act, if I so wished. If my neighbour were ill treating his dog and the police were not prepared to do anything about it, I could lay a summons at the magistrates court, summon the neighbour and conduct the case. I would have to bring in legal representation. That is usually a condition: I could not represent myself as the prosecutor. I could prosecute him, get him convicted and recover my costs out of central funds on the prosecution being concluded. Organisations such as the RSPCA are undoubtedly doing a good job in the majority of instances in bringing these prosecutions, and on their head be it.

<P>
The Bill will give the organisations extra powers in the middle of prosecutions effectively to impound animals-to arrange for their disposal or do whatever else they need to do. But those powers will be given to them by the Government through an agreement, although the Minister has clarified that that agreement is not financial: it is not intended to pay the organisation for performing those services.

<P>
We must ensure, therefore, that the prosecutor remains wholly responsible for everything that happens, including his actions under the powers conferred by the Bill. We shall come to this on new clause 1. I think that the hon. Member for Crosby knows that this matter worried me on Second Reading. It is probably the only thing that bothers me about the Bill, and I am sure that it can be resolved.

<P>
Where does the buck stop? The Bill gives the impression that those who will carry out the functions will be acting as agents of the Government. I may be wrong about that. The officials may not be worried about it. I simply flag it up. The point could be considered, so that, by Report, we are all satisfied that we have got it right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman straight away. Anyone acting under the Bill will not be acting as an agent of the Government or on their behalf. The court gives the bodies power to act in the normal way.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
On some occasions, bodies such as the RSPCA have taken into care animals that needed veterinary attention, immediate care and feeding. Sometimes local authorities have done that, but it has been mainly the RSPCA. The bodies have borne the costs of that, some of which are not recoverable. The Bill allows bodies such as the RSPCA and our state veterinary service to recover some of the costs of caring for, feeding and treating the animals, where that is appropriate, but it does not confer agency powers on any of the bodies. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, the prosecution bears the financial risks, and it can seek to recover some of its costs through the court in the normal way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The use of the words ``written agreement'' struck me as creating a difficulty. The word that one might have expected to see is ``authorised''. I do not want to get into a exercise on semantics. I am doing my best to help the hon. Member for Crosby and the Minister and not to put spokes in the wheel. I simply suggest that that might be looked at, because the words ``written agreement'' suggest almost a contractual relationship, which, to judge from what the Minister has told us, is clearly not intended.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I confirm that that is not intended. However, I caution the hon. Gentleman against changing the word ``agreement'' to ``authorises''. A written agreement sets parameters: it is already considered. However, if someone is given authority, that confuses the position, because it gives the impression that they are acting as agents on behalf of the Government, and that is not the intention of the Bill.

<P>
I repeat that the clause is intended to act as a filter to stop vexatious prosecutions from people who have an axe to grind. It aims to ensure that those who are authorised are reputable organisations and are bringing the prosecution for the welfare of the animals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I hope that we can characterise what the Minister has said as ``The buck stops here''-that is, with him and the Department. That, I think, will sufficiently relieve the worries raised by the Pet Care Trust and on Second Reading. The Minister's intention is now clearly on the record. It is, as one would expect, perfectly respectable and above board. Assurances are now on the record and we now know, if anything goes wrong, who carries the can. On the basis of that reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders for the care, disposal or slaughter of animals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 17, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In determining what to authorise by the order, the court must have regard to the advice of a veterinary surgeon as to the most appropriate action in respect of the animals in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We can dispose of this amendment rapidly. I simply want to tease out the meaning of the words in subsection (1)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If, on the application of the prosecutor, it appears to the court from evidence given by a veterinary surgeon that it is necessary<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. Can the prosecution proceed only if evidence has been given by a veterinary surgeon, or can it proceed in the absence of that? A strict, literal reading of subsection (1) suggests that it can happen only if evidence is given by a veterinary surgeon. If that were the case, my amendment would be otiose. However, its intention is to ensure the participation of a veterinary surgeon at this crucial stage. Therefore it is a simple question: is that what the words mean or is my amendment needed to make the words mean that?

<P>
<B>Mrs Curtis-Thomas:</B> I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, and I hope that I can clarify the situation. The amendment would place an additional requirement on a court to have regard to veterinary advice when deciding on the type of order to make under clause 2(3). By virtue of clause 2(1), a court is already bound to take into account veterinary advice when deciding whether to make an order.

<P>
A court is already required by clause 2(3) to take into account all the circumstances of a case when deciding on the appropriate form of order. Such circumstances could include the welfare of animals. Clause 2(1) provides the first step in a cumulative approach to the granting of an order. Throughout that process, proportionate steps must be taken at each stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, whose response fully answers my questions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) No order shall be made under this section unless the owner of the animals in question has been given the opportunity to present to the court any such evidence about the welfare and upkeep of the animals in question as he deems fit'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Clause 2(3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the court must have regard to all the circumstances-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to which the hon. Lady referred-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>including the desirability of protecting the owner's interest in the value of the animals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is perfectly reasonable and, one would hope, reassuring.

<P>
The amendment, which would take the process a stage further, is intended to tease out the nature of the proceedings and the extent to which the owner's interests will be guaranteed to be taken into account. It is intended to strengthen the subsection, which states that a court ``must have regard'' but it does not state that the court should give the owner a hearing.

<P>
I seek from the Minister the reassurance that it will be impossible for a court to have regard to all the circumstances or to determine what to do with an order without having given the owner of an animal the proper opportunity to present in court the evidence to which the amendment refers. My argument is as simple as that. I want to clarify and strengthen the provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's important point about protecting individuals' interests. I assure him that the amendment is unnecessary-owners of animals already have an opportunity to present to a court evidence about the welfare of their stock. Clause 2(3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the court must have regard to all the circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The owner will be able to ensure that the court receives all the information that is relevant to his case.

<P>
A problem with the amendment is that it would give unlimited scope for delaying tactics in prosecutions. I appreciate that that was not the right hon. Gentleman's intention. Owners are entitled to ensure that their case is heard properly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Again, I am grateful to the Minister. This process has been helpful to me and, I hope, other Committee members. I am satisfied that the Bill goes as far as it reasonably can in its efforts to protect owners' interests. If one went a step too far in one's efforts to protect the legitimate interests of, in this case, the owner, one would make it possible for people to cause mischief and vexatiousness in some cases, which might, in the end, frustrate the ability to mount an effective prosecution. As ever, we must strike a balance in the Bill. I accept in good faith the Minister's comments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 27, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a person authorised by him'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 10, in page 2, line 29, leave out

</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 11, in page 2, line 38, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a person authorised by him'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We have reached what is often the most sensitive part of any Bill or provision of the kind that we have before us today. I submit that all Members of Parliament should feel their antennae twitching when they see in a Bill the clause title, ``Powers of entry, etc.''. That alone would be bad enough. In this case, the problem arises from a matter that we considered in a different guise under clause 1-the authorisation, at one or more remove, of considerable powers.

<P>
The clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the prosecutor, or a person authorised by him, may enter the premises on which the animals are kept.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must be very clear about the extent of that provision and what, if any, limitations might be placed on it. I reflect a nervousness that was expressed in the letter from the Pet Care Trust and on Second Reading.

<P>
The hon. Member for Crosby or the Minister, or both, should place on the record their view of what the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or a person authorised by him<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means in the context of the entering premises, and, more specifically, the limitations that might be involved. The amendment would elucidate the matter by removing the phrase. I accept that that may be going too far. However, in a case such as this, where statutory powers are being given in relation to powers of entry to premises, it is important that, before the Bill is reported to the House, we are satisfied that matters are as they should be, and that there is no danger of opening up the possibility that powers of entry may be handed on in a way that is anything other than proper. That is surely our duty as Members of Parliament and members of the Committee.

<P>
I need not dwell on the matter further; it is familiar to all Members of Parliament. I get nervous when I see it in a Bill such as this kind, and I hope that the promoter and the Minister will provide full and proper reassurances. Otherwise, I shall have to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Important issues surround the power of entry, including those of human rights. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the Human Rights Act 1998 provides safeguards in that respect. Lawyers have to ensure that any legislation that we wish to implement is compatible with human rights legislation. We are satisfied that the Bill meets those requirements. The purpose of the power of entry is simply to carry out a court order at the direction of the court. It will always be done with the authority of the court, which will give the person concerned the opportunity to raise the relevant issues.

<P>
We must distinguish between the power to apply to prosecute and the power to carry out the prosecution. The powers in subsections (1) and (2) enable orders made under clause 2 to be carried out. I recognise that the amendment is a probing amendment, but, if accepted, it would require prosecutors to carry out orders in person. That would represent immense practical difficulties for Government Departments and local authorities, which can only ever act via authorised persons. For example, if one interpreted the amendment literally, the Director of Public Prosecutions might have to go personally to a hill farm in Cumbria to feed and water cattle.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> It might not do him any harm.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> That was a bit of Maoism-back to the fields-from the right hon. Gentleman.

<P>
That would be the literal effect of the amendment. Of course, those bringing the prosecutions are not in a position to go out and do that personally. The Bill is drafted in this way because authority is needed for authorised persons to go to the farm to feed and care for the animals. That could be done by vets, by the state veterinary service, by employees of the Ministry or by employees of the RSPCA. There is nothing sinister about the intent of the provision. It relates to the difference between a person carrying out the prosecution and a person authorised by him.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with every word that the Minister has said. There clearly has to be a system of authority. A system of authority is often given to a constable, a health inspector or someone who already has some experience. How are we to ensure that prosecutors have within their ranks people who understand how the law works, to whom this task can be delegated?

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> This point relates to our earlier discussion. There is already a filter mechanism in the Bill. Anyone who enters into a written agreement must satisfy certain criteria. He or she must have the resources, the expertise, the experience and the staff to carry out the task properly and professionally.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am desperately tempted by the thought of the Director of Public Prosecutions doing something rather grubby on a remote hillside. Perhaps we can return to such matters on another occasion. I suspect that it would do the Director no harm at all occasionally to engage in such earthy practices. However, this is not the occasion on which to bring that about, and I suspect that it was not the intention of the hon. Member for Crosby when she proposed the Bill.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the Minister have both been most helpful in this matter, and I accept what the Minister said. However, it is useful to have these matters spelt out clearly in Committee, so that they stand as a record of the intention of the promoter of the Bill and, especially, of the Government. I am grateful for that. I am sufficiently reassured, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 2, line 42, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any other premises not connected with the animals in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment also deals with the subject of entering premises. The Bill attempts to give some reassurance, in that clause 3(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nothing in this section authorises a person to enter a dwellinghouse.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to put the matter beyond doubt. I am worried that if the Bill excludes only the dwelling house, it might be possible in some circumstances to regard the power of entry as rather too widely drawn. It might permit entry to premises not directly related to the purpose of the Bill or, in the words of the amendment, to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>premises not connected with the animals in question.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I seek reassurance that the exclusion in clause 3(4) is adequate and that the Minister cannot envisage any circumstances in which the powers of entry could be abused, applied excessively, or exercised beyond the strict purpose of the Bill. The Bill should remain narrowly focused and defined, especially in relation to powers of entry. I seek assurance either that the existing words are fully adequate for the purpose, or that my amendment would strengthen them in an acceptable way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point. The Government's intention is that any measure of this kind must be balanced. It is legitimate to exclude dwelling houses, because the scope of the Bill does not include pet animals. If it did, that would broaden its scope considerably. The exclusion is also a recognition of people's right to privacy. However, the amendment is too restrictive. It would unduly limit powers of entry, and create uncertainty about where powers could be exercised. For example, problems might arise if animals were moved between buildings on a farm, perhaps to frustrate prosecution. Under the amendment, a person who entered a building that proved no longer to contain animals would technically be committing a trespass.

<P>
A balance has been struck between protecting people's right to privacy and ensuring that those whom the courts empower to protect the welfare of animals are not unduly restricted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation, and I shall not press the matter. I accept some people might try to evade the purpose of the Bill, but I simply thought that the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or any other premises not connected with the animals in question<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
might have covered such circumstances. However, I accept that, as the Minister said, the wording might prove unduly restrictive and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>

<H4><center>Other supplementary provisions</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 3, line 12, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where the owner is convicted of an offence under section 1 of the 1911 Act in respect of the animals in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider new clause 1-Reimbursement for financial loss-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where a person against whom proceedings are brought for an offence under section 1 of the 1911 Act is acquitted of that offence, he shall be entitled to be reimbursed for any financial loss suffered by him as a consequence of an order made under section (2) of this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> At this point in the Bill, the balance appears to be weighed heavily in favour of the prosecutor, and there is insufficient protection for the person being prosecuted, who, in almost every case, will be the owner of the animals. Amendment No. 16 would make it clear that the circumstances to which subsection (2) refers are those in which the owner is convicted of an offence. Even more important, new clause 1 would make it clear that, where someone is acquitted of an offence,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he shall be entitled to be reimbursed for any financial loss suffered  as a consequence of an order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such a provision appears to be missing from the Bill.

<P>
A crucial balance must be struck between the rights of the hapless owner and the might and majesty of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the prosecuting authorities and bodies such as the RSPCA. Even though the Minister has told us that everything will be all right, others may also become involved, given the content of preceding clauses. The Minister sought to reassure us about the mechanisms in the Bill, but if something were to go wrong, new clause 1 would correct the balance and ensure the provision of proper compensation or reimbursement.

<P>
We are all anxious to do the right thing by animals and protect them-that is the object of the Bill. As the Minister said, we are also anxious to ensure that the powers are not only proper but effective. I am asking the consequential question about whether the Bill's balance is right, and am trying to ensure proper protection for the small man against the majesty and power of the authorities. I hope that the hon. Member for Crosby and the Minister will accept the amendment and the new clause, or provide very strong reassurance-I have not seen any in the Bill-that proper protection will be provided in another way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I shall try to reassure the right hon. Gentleman on what can be complicated legal matters.

<P>
Amendment No. 16 would restrict the right of a prosecutor to recover reasonable expenses by way of civil debt to cases in which a conviction is obtained. The purpose of the Bill is to care for animals while a prosecution is in process. They may need urgent attention or may have been abandoned and the amendment would defeat much of the object of the Bill.

<P>
New clause 1 would allow people who have been acquitted of the offence with which they had been charged under the 1911 Act to claim reimbursement for any financial loss that they suffered as a result of an order made under clause 2 and I understand the point behind that. I realise that this is a probing amendment to try to obtain reassurance. Amendment No. 16 would preclude a prosecutor from starting complaint proceedings in a magistrates court and not from starting an ordinary civil action. There are safeguards in the Bill to cover the right hon. Gentleman's points and there are two stages at which the courts will have the opportunity to scrutinise the steps taken by a prosecutor: when deciding what order to make, by virtue of clause 2(4), and in relation to any dispute about the amount of any shortfall or surplus. That is the right hon. Gentleman's main point.

<P>
The Bill makes it clear that the reasonableness of expenses must be taken into account both as to the heads of expense and the amount of individual heads and can be determined by the appropriate court. That could be any court, including a magistrates court, county court or even the High Court if substantial sums or complex issues are involved in a dispute. Similarly, if the animals were sold and the owner believes that the price obtained was not reasonable or fair, the court could make a ruling. A safeguard exists to ensure that any action is reasonable in the owner's interests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The Minister is now speaking about the specifics of the disposal of animals, their value and any dispute arising from that. I would have thought that the owner could incur a financial loss beyond that of the value of the disposed animals. I was trying in new clause 1 to widen the scope to provide more effective protection than the narrow protection to which the Minister referred. I accept that protection, but I should like more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is now straying into the courts' legal powers. In the event of an acquittal, it would be reasonable for the prosecutor to recover expenses that the owner would have borne anyway-for example, the cost of feeding the animals, any necessary veterinary treatment and so on. The extent of the owner's obligations will be determined by the courts and the question of what is reasonable will be determined on the facts in each case.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman might be going wider in relation to people who are acquitted and believe that the prosecution was unreasonable and resulted in a great deal of expense. I am not a legal expert, but those people would have access to legal civil action to press their case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> This is, as I said on Second Reading, the one issue that causes me concern. Although I agree with the Minister's criticism that amendment No. 16 would create difficulties, and I do not believe that the amendment is necessary, the issue raised by new clause 1 causes me real concern. Perhaps I can explain in more detail what bothers me.

<P>
It is implicit in the Minister's approach that if I go into somebody else's farm and remove his stock, look after it, arrange for its subsequent destruction, collect the money from that and, at the end of the process, the defendant in the criminal proceedings having been acquitted, claim my costs for the management of that and repay the money that I have acquired through the disposal of the carcases or the sale of the meat, the owner will be no worse off. I accept that there may be disputes over fairness of price, but they are capable of being resolved by the Bill. I have no difficulty with that.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Where I start having difficulties is that if somebody is prosecuted and acquitted, it will be implicit in that acquittal that there has been an unwarranted interference in his livelihood and activities, including the seizure-because that is what it boils down to-of his livestock. He may reasonably be able to say that some expenses would not have been incurred if the livestock had not been seized. I accept that livestock can sometimes be cared for in situ, but an example would be transport costs to take them elsewhere.

<P>
The second issue that concerns me is that the person may in some cases-not in most cases, one would hope-be able to argue that the interference with his business by the removal of his livestock for the period of a prosecution, which may cover months, has seriously damaged him economically in a way that goes beyond the mere loss of the livestock and cannot be compensated for simply by the money that came to the prosecutor when the livestock was disposed of.

<P>
The Minister says that other avenues of redress may be open. Casting my legal mind on the matter-nobody nowadays can claim full knowledge of the law, but I have prosecuted and defended in such cases-I do not believe that the person would have an avenue of redress, unless an action for malicious prosecution had been brought, and I am not suggesting that; yet his economic interests might have been seriously damaged.

<P>
New clause 1 seems to have some merit, because in those circumstances it would allow the person to make a claim saying that he had financial losses over and above those met by the provisions in the Bill and was entitled to reimbursement. The matter would then have to go to a county court judge for adjudication, if it could not be resolved by agreement.

<P>
I believe that that is the only fair way to proceed. We cannot ignore the fact that, for good reasons, the Bill proposes substantial interference with private property rights-the rights of ownership in respect of animals-and might be used against somebody who had not been convicted of an offence. I worry about that aspect of the Bill, because, if we do not get it right, we could fall foul of the Human Rights Act 1998.

<P>
It is clearly for my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to decide what to do with the amendment. I dare say that he will not wish to press it to a vote now, but I hope that this matter will be considered, because it may have to be revisited at a later stage. To my mind, that is the central flaw in the Bill. Although the Minister has clearly explained how the Bill will work, there is still the risk of unfairness to a person who is ultimately acquitted of any offence and whose livestock should therefore never have been seized in the first place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has raised fundamental issues, which go way beyond the scope of the Bill and relate to the application of the law in relation to prosecutions in general, whether they are criminal prosecutions brought by the police or those brought by the Inland Revenue or the Government. The situation is always the same, in that a decision must be taken by the prosecutors and the court as to whether the case is legitimate.

<P>
Such issues are not easy to resolve. However, the points that the hon. Gentleman raised are recognised in the Bill, in terms of what is regarded as a reasonable cost. It is up to the court to decide what is a reasonable cost when the approved prosecutor first applies for the care order. I should point out that when they apply for the care order, they must present the basis of the case. Application for the care order therefore means that the case has already started. At that point, prosecutors and the owners of the animals will have the chance to put their cases to the court. If the person concerned wants to argue that the prosecution is unjustified in bringing the case, they have every opportunity to do so.

<P>
The Bill makes explicit provision for the court to have regard to all the circumstances, which include the desirability of protecting the owner's interest in the value of the animals concerned and to avoid increasing that person's costs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Could we consider a civil analogy for a moment? Interlocutory proceedings will take place at the point at which the order is made to allow the livestock to be taken away. That will not represent the final determination of the case. In interlocutory proceedings, an undertaking is given regarding damages in terms of any financial consequences that flow if the person concerned ultimately does not win the case. That is precisely what new clause 1 is designed to achieve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I understand that point, although I do not pretend to be a lawyer. I sometimes think that that might have been a better career path.

<P>
I am trying to deal with the hon. Gentleman's points in as much detail as I possibly can. I suspect that we may never satisfy him completely with regard to his main point, because it applies to any court case. It would be difficult, in technical terms, to construct a Bill that absolutely guarantees that if a prosecution fails, every avenue of expense is somehow protected.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised legitimate points about costs on someone who may be acquitted. Those points are addressed in the Bill. The court has to decide what is reasonable, and the person concerned has every opportunity to put their case before the order is made. The owner's interests are protected in relation to the value of the animals. As the hon. Gentleman said, in practical terms-especially in agriculture, although the Bill's scope is wider than that-the logic would be to care for and feed the animals in situ. There would be no advantage in removing them, unless, for example, they had to be humanely destroyed, taken to market or slaughtered because of their age profile. In those circumstances, it would make no difference whether they were being cared for under the authority of the Bill and the court or that of the owner. The costs and returns to be recovered would be exactly the same.
 
<P>
In reality, the extra costs incurred by owners who are acquitted are likely to be limited. There is the issue of cost saving where care in situ is not possible. The Bill places a responsibility on those who bring such prosecutions to try to limit costs, and I am sure that that will be done.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has raised a wide philosophical point relating to prosecutions in general that goes beyond the scope of the Bill, and which I am not qualified to answer. I should say to him and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that we recognise the point that was made. In relation to legislation that the Government would have to enact, we are trying to ensure safeguards for individuals, and the Bill contains such safeguards as can be practically applied.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The Minister has acknowledged that we are dealing with an issue that, although not new, is none the less important. He is right to say that it goes wider than the confines of the Bill, but it is the Bill with which we are concerned, and we should focus on specific circumstances that may arise in the light of its provisions. Given the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, whose relevant knowledge and expertise is great, and in the light of the lay but well-advised opinions of the Minister, I must confess that I am not entirely satisfied. Rather than attempting to resolve this matter in Committee, perhaps we should reflect further and return to it at a subsequent stage. My hon. Friend will doubtless reflect further, as will I. Those outside this place who read our proceedings will want to do likewise, and perhaps the Minister and the hon. Member for Crosby will do so as well.

<P>
This is an important issue, and the Minister has done his best to satisfy my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and me, but on this occasion, I am not entirely sure that we have got the balance right. Nevertheless, I shall not press the matter at this stage, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 3, line 21, leave out ``10'' and insert ``21''.

<P>
The amendment deals with a specific point. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the owner must, as soon as is practicable and in any event within 10 days of the making of the order, deliver those documents to the prosecutor.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The issue was raised in the letter from the Pet Care Trust, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the person responsible for the care of the animal is required to produce documentation 10 days is far too short. With the vast majority of this country taking holiday breaks of 2 weeks it may well be impossible for this timescale to be adhered to.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The question of holidays has limited relevance, but there is a more general point. It is simply a matter of judgment as to whether it is reasonable for the Bill to require that documentation be produced within 10 days in all circumstances. I would suggest that a 10-day limit is somewhat draconian, and could prove impractical. There are various circumstances in which a 10-day limit could prove too strict: illness, legitimate absence-not necessarily for holidaying purposes-or an inability to access documents. In my view, a limit of 21 days, which I concede is arbitrary, might prove more reasonable in most circumstances. Unless the hon. Lady and the Minister can persuade Committee members that this entire edifice rests on the 10-day requirement, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that there should be some easement in this regard.

<P>

<B>Mrs Curtis-Thomas:</B> Although I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, the requirement on the owner to deliver documentation to the prosecutor within 10 days will ensure that animals are accompanied by the necessary documentation-cattle passports are required by law. The length of time is not unreasonable.

<P>
Committee members may be concerned about owners who are on holiday, and the right hon. Gentleman mentioned other circumstances that might preclude an owner from delivering the documents within the set period. Those concerns can be dealt with by the overall defence of reasonable excuse.

<P>
The proposal to extend the period to 21 days would strike at owners' legitimate interests. Without the necessary documentation, such as cattle passports, animals would fall outside the law, and the only option for prosecutors would be the slaughter and subsequent rendering of the animal, which could endanger the possibility of getting any value for it. In view of the facility of reasonable excuse, it is important to maintain the 10-day requirement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Well, I suppose so. That approach puts the onus firmly on the individual. I sometimes wonder how that old friend of ours, innocent until proven otherwise, still survives. The presumption increasingly appears to be against it. The approach in this context involves saying, ``You have to comply during this narrow period unless you provide a damned good reason for not doing so.'' I should feel more comfortable if the situation were the other way round. The hon. Lady pointed out that there is a let-out or get-out, or whatever one wants to call it. However, the onus is on the individual to provide a reasonable excuse for not meeting the 10-day requirement. I am uneasy about this matter, but I shall not press it further at this stage. I leave my comments as a marker-we may or may not return to it later. For the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
