</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> It falls to me, Mr. Cunningham, to welcome you to the Chair for the first time in our proceedings, which I do unreservedly.
<P>
Amendment No. 128 deals with the grounds on which preliminary appeals for variations may be dealt with. I have spoken about the situation regarding non-resident parents, and will now move on to say how variation applications from parents with care will be considered. We will quickly reject applications from parents with care, if they have no possibility of success. For instance, if the non-resident parent were in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance and were, therefore, liable for the minimum amount, a variation would be irrelevant to the final outcome. We envisage that that sort of case will be rejected at the preliminary stage before the whole variation procedure is invoked.
<P>
As the details of variation arrangements are developed in regulations and operating procedures, no doubt we will identify other cases in which it is clear at the outset that a variation should not be allowed. Committees often debate whether measures should be included in Bills or in secondary regulations. Our view is that, in this case, to require all the relevant criteria to be spelled out in the Bill would be too rigid an approach. We believe that it is preferable for the grounds for rejection to be prescribed in regulations, which will provide the necessary flexibility. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar):</B> I have listened to what the Minister has said and believe that she is wrong to think that those measures should not be included in the Bill. However, I am prepared to give the hon. Lady the benefit of the doubt, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No 129, in page 6, line 18, leave out `one of the conditions' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the condition'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider amendment No. 130, in page 6, line 21, leave out from `The' to end of line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`condition is that the non-resident parent must make payments at the rate of—
<P>
(a) £30 per week where there is one qualifying child;
<P>
(b) £40 per week where there are two qualifying children; and
<P>
(c) £50 per week where there are three or more qualifying children'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It was rude of me not to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cunningham. You have joined the Committee at an interesting time, and I am sure that you will enjoy our deliberations.
<P>
The amendments are straightforward. If an application for variation were made and the Secretary of State concluded, after preliminary assessment, that there was some merit in the application, the non-resident parent would still have to pay either the full rate or a lower rate, at the Secretary of State's discretion. Given that the new variation scheme is being introduced because the existing formula may not be fair, it seems right that that parent should have to pay only the default rate until the appeal is determined.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendments Nos. 129 and 130 relate to the intention to allow the Secretary of State, in appropriate circumstances, to require the non-resident parent who has applied for a variation to make regular payments of child support at a pre-agreed level as a condition of having his application considered. Similar provisions apply in relation to the existing departure scheme in the current Act. It may be helpful if I explain the background.
<P>
Unlike under the existing departure scheme, under the Bill applicants will be able to apply for a variation before, as well as after, a final maintenance calculation has been made. If a variation application is made before a decision has been reached on the original maintenance application, the Secretary of State may either make a final maintenance calculation, which takes account of the outcome of the variation application, or an interim maintenance decision based on the normal calculation rules without a variation—for example, where he is unable to clear the variation application promptly because further investigation is needed before a decision can be made.
<P>
Where an interim decision is made, new section 28C provides that the non-resident parent applicant may be required to make regular payments of maintenance while his application is being considered. The intention is that, in those circumstances, the amount payable will be either the full amount of the existing interim rate—where the reasonable expectation is that the variation application, once processed, will not succeed—or a lower rate. The lower rate will be prescribed and will take account of what the rate would be if the variation application were successful.
<P>
The intention is to ensure that child support continues to flow while a variation application is being considered, but it is only right that the amount payable should be set at a reasonable rate. However, the amendments would require the non-resident parent to make regular payments at one of three fixed rates, based on the number of qualifying children. That approach takes no account of either the actual maintenance calculation, based on the information provided by the non-resident parent, or the anticipated amount payable, if variation is allowed. In fact, it is likely to bear little or no relationship to either.
<P>
That is certain to lead to discontent. Not only would it unfairly penalise non-resident parents with lower assessments but, perversely, it might encourage those with higher assessments to apply for a variation on wholly spurious grounds, simply as a means of securing a temporary reduction in the amount that they must pay. The approach that we are taking mirrors the provisions in the existing departures scheme, whereas the amendments provide an unreasonable and inflexible approach. On those grounds, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) The persons mentioned in subsection (7) above shall, in a manner to be prescribed, be afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State as to whether the non-resident parent has failed to comply with a regular payments condition.
<P>
(9) Before making a determination as to whether the non-resident parent has failed to comply with a regular payments condition, the Secretary of State shall have regard to any such representations as are made to him pursuant to subsection (8).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> You must be wondering what is happening, Mr. Cunningham. We have had some lively debates, but we broadly agree with the Government's proposals. I am aware that the Committee wishes to make progress, so I shall restrict my comments narrowly to the amendments, which are probing amendments.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to give all parties, especially non-resident parents, the right to make representations to the Secretary of State, who has an otherwise unfettered discretion to determine whether a regular payments condition has not been complied with and, therefore, to decide whether an application for variation should not be considered.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> You have arrived, Mr. Cunningham, for the most rumbustious debates that we have had in Committee—my little joke.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It was nearly funny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am sure that the debate will hot up. We want to make progress, so I shall respond briefly to the amendments.
<P>
It has always been our intention that the Secretary of State should, as now, make appropriate inquiries before determining whether the regular payments condition has not been met. The Bill takes a reasonable approach. In practice, the payments will be made through the Secretary of State. Only he will have first-hand knowledge of whether appropriate payments have been made regularly. We intend him to pursue non-compliance only with the non-resident parent, and he will exercise appropriate flexibility in considering the issue. For example, it may be unreasonable to require full and timely payment of the amounts due. There must be scope to take account of the reasons why some payments are unavoidably late, which may happen because a person is ill or because the bank slips up with a direct debit.
<P>
The Bill is intended to suspend progress on the variation application if the Secretary of State determines that the non-resident parent has failed without good reason to make appropriate payments. In a way, our approach is that of the carrot and stick. If people are acting reasonably and are seen to be doing so, there should be no difficulty. As I said, we intend the Secretary of State to act reasonably. All parties affected by the variation application will be notified in writing when proposals for change are made. Similar provisions exist in current legislation and apply under the departures procedure. To that extent, the Bill does not make a major change.
<P>
We want to build safeguards into the Bill, but it is a question of encouraging people's behaviour to be reasonable in the round. I hope that my remarks will be sufficient to persuade the Opposition that we are not making a major change and that we are seeking to operate constructively and with cross-party support.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) so as to require, in any case where the maintenance calculation is to be made by reason of section 6, that any application for a variation is made within 14 days of the non-resident parent receiving notification that a maintenance calculation is to be performed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The principal purpose of the amendments is to require applications to be made promptly. They are probing amendments that seek to obtain from the Minister a brief explanation of how applications will be dealt with.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The speed with which we are doing business is leaving us all breathless, me especially. I shall deal first with amendment No. 135, which would change the wording of schedule 2 to state that regulations ``shall'' make provision instead of ``may''. The amendment refers to paragraph 2 of proposed schedule 4A to the Child Support Act 1991, as set out in schedule 2.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The provision allows for regulations to specify the procedure to be followed by the Secretary of State or tribunal in considering a variation application. We intend to make such regulations but need the flexibility—that word again—to make other such regulations on procedural matters if required.
<P>
The regulations will cover such matters as what should be accepted as an application, types of cases that should be rejected at the preliminary sift and the handling contest—at which the other party is given an opportunity to comment on the application. Many of the regulations for variation applications will be similar to those set out in the Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996, which I am sure are fresh in all hon. Members' minds.
<P>
While I appreciate that there may be some concern about the use of the word ``may'', I assure the Committee that we fully intend to make regulations in respect of the procedure to be followed, as indicated in the schedule. The word ``may'' is used in the Child Support Act 1991 in relation to departure applications and is common in connection with regulation-making provisions. We are simply applying the same wording to the expenses and cases that we intend will be contained in the regulations on variation applications.
<P>
Amendment No. 136 relates to applications for a variation made before a maintenance calculation has been determined. The Bill, unlike the current departures scheme, provides that applicants for a variation will not have to wait until a maintenance calculation had been made before being allowed to apply. That positive step should help to get the right amount of maintenance flowing at an earlier stage.
<P>
The amendment would impose a time limit of 14 days on applications in respect of which the parent with care was treated as having made an application for maintenance because of being in receipt of a prescribed benefit. The restriction would apply to either parent, and the 14 days would begin from the date on which the non-resident parent was first contacted about the application for maintenance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Has the Under-Secretary reached a conclusion about the expected number of applications, given the simplified formula? Does she anticipate an increase or a decrease?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The principle behind the new variation scheme is that it should be drawn tightly. That is why it will be triggered only if people fall within certain income thresholds. One of the underlying principles is that the variations must be of an order to have a reasonable effect on the resulting maintenance level. That cuts out small changes that might be used to trigger variation otherwise. I cannot predict the future and give an exact figure for the number of variations that we expect. The aim is to keep them within tight limits, and we do not think that the provision creates a huge loophole enabling people to drive a coach and horses through the new rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I appreciate that the Under-Secretary is still having problems with her throat and we all sympathise. I apologise for repeatedly interrupting her, but perhaps that will give her a chance to have a Polo mint or something like that.
<P>
We are not thinking about whether the provision will create loopholes, but about whether it will provide justice. The question I would really like answered is whether the hon. Lady envisages more or fewer applications.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The grounds for variations are drawn tighter than those for departures, simply because of the shape of the scheme that we are considering. We discussed that issue on clause 1. For planning purposes only—and we cannot be sure in advance of the accuracy of such planning—the figure for applications currently expected in the first year is about 21,000. That needs to be set against the predicted case load of 1.2 million for 2002 when new cases begin to be added to the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): That figure of 21,000 is interesting, but it would be helpful if we could have an idea of how it was reached. A quite wide list of grounds for variations is set out in the schedule. As the basic formula will be so simple and people will be looking for a way of having their personal circumstances taken into account, the figure of 21,000 out of 1.2 million seems very low.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We must remember that the variation scheme is drawn very tightly and includes thresholds below which variations will not be allowed and will be sifted out: they are £15 for those earning more than £200 a week and £10 for those earning less. There is also an assets threshold of £65,000, the level at which the maintenance calculation would be materially affected as it would provide £100 a week income, assuming an interest rate of 8 per cent. That is, by the way—for the benefit of the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) who looks envious—the judicial rate. It has not been plucked out of the air. There are always official rates for such things. The rate that I quoted would change with the one used by the courts. The current departure scheme's £5,000 capital limit, below which capital would not be thought to affect the outcome of the maintenance calculation, would also remain.
<P>
We intend to keep the new variation scheme tightly drawn and on that basis estimate that the variations are likely to apply in a minority of cases—we think about 5 per cent. We are assuming 250,000 applications a year. I can only provide the planning figures that have been given to me, and the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) should accept them on the basis on which I offer them, that we cannot tell what will happen in the future.
<P>
I was explaining that amendment No, 135 would impose a time limit of 14 days on applications where the parent with care is treated as having made an application for maintenance because she is in receipt of a prescribed benefit. We have no intention of imposing a time limit in such cases. That would simply result in more applications being considered after a maintenance calculation has been made. Parents often need time to consider whether they have grounds to apply. Applicants who missed the 14-day deadline would feel frustrated about having to wait to apply until after the maintenance calculation had been made.
<P>
The amendment would make the system more complex. Any parent who made a late application would be told to wait until after a decision on the maintenance calculation, which would defeat the object of being able to apply for a variation at the beginning of the process, as the Bill allows.
<P>
We believe that the word ``may'' is the correct one. We intend to make regulations on the procedure as set out in the substituted schedule 4A to the 1991 Act. However, we do not want to be unnecessarily restricted in making regulations and do not believe that a duty to act is required. Further, imposing a time limit on a variation application is unnecessary and would simply delay applications. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 73, line 14, after `furnished', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by the person making the application for a variation within such period as may be prescribed the Secretary of State shall dismiss the application but if such information required to be furnished any other person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This simple amendment seeks to emphasise the high cost of providing the information required for compliance. We welcome the fact that it would encourage applicants to get their affairs in order and to make the necessary disclosure. We wish to ensure that information is relevant. We have put in the amendment a safeguard to ensure that a party could not sabotage the arrangements by not supplying the information. That would complement the Government's aims.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment relates to the handling of applications for variations. It might help if I described the way in which the process is intended to run.
<P>
All variation applications will be subjected to a preliminary scrutiny. Earlier amendments concerned the way in which that process might work. The process applies to the current departure scheme, and it is intended to weed out applications that have no prospect of success at the earliest possible stage.
<P>
If the Secretary of State considers that there might be good grounds for a variation, but requires additional supporting evidence or other information—about contact costs, for example—he will advise the applicant accordingly and allow a further month for the information to be provided. At the end of the period, or when the further evidence has been provided if it is within the month, the Secretary of State will notify the other parties affected by the variations. He will tell them the grounds on which the application has been made, provide them with relevant information or evidence, and invite them to comment within 14 days. At the end of that period, the Secretary of State will consider the application in the light of all the evidence to hand, and decide whether to agree to a variation.
<P>
That process operates in the current departures scheme, and it has stood the test of time. It would be unreasonable for the Secretary of State to reject an application out of hand solely because the applicant has failed to provide one piece of the jigsaw. We recognise that there might be legitimate concerns about non-resident parents viewing variation applications as an opportunity to avoid or to delay meeting their child support liabilities. A non-resident parent applicant might be required to make regular maintenance payments while a variation application is being considered so as to counteract such concerns, and to ensure that child support continues to flow. Again, we considered relevant amendments earlier.
<P>
If it may reasonably be expected that the variation rate will not succeed, the full amount of the existing rate will be payable, otherwise a lower rate will be payable. The lower rate will be set out in regulations, and is intended to take account of what the rate would be if the variation application were successful.
<P>
In the light of the above, and of the safeguard provided by the regular payments condition, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> During our proceedings, we have identified two great injustices in the Bill: and we now have a third. The first was the failure to have an upper limit on the contribution of the non-resident parent—the parent without care. The second was the failure to take account of the income of the parent with care who has a considerably higher salary than the non-resident parent.
<P>
The third injustice relates to the simplified formula. We seek a means of achieving equality through equal treatment. From our surgeries, we have discovered that people do not fall into neat categories. We cannot ensure that people will fall comfortably within the bands that the Government devise. What might be equal and fair justice for one person might be rough justice for someone else. That is why the variations that we seek, especially through amendment No. 226, are important. The net result would be equal settlements for people in different circumstances.
<P>
No one would seriously dispute the fact that the present formula is too complex. The 1995 departure formula has been seen as a capitulation to fathers' groups, but to believe that it was a complete mistake would be to misread history.
<P>
As I briefly mentioned, we are making the mistake of creating a mirror image of the previous system. We are going for a simplified formula and a simplified variation scheme. We have had a complex formula and, as a result of the change in 1995, a complex departures scheme. From the evidence seen by the Social Security Committee—evidence from our surgeries suggests the same—it was a mistake to introduce a complex variation scheme and to retain a complex formula. We should have done what we are doing now. We should have returned to first principles and had a simple formula that gave people a basic idea of what to expect.
<P>
We usually try to balance common law with equity. We should ensure that the variations system creates such equity. A simple formula will increase the possibility of individual injustices. The variations scheme offers an opportunity to fit the system to the individual. We do not want these great changes to create an injustice for people who want their affairs regulated by the Child Support Agency. The new regime is much more restrictive. The Under Secretary's helpful response to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made it clear that the terms will be tightly drawn. Individuals will rub up against the system, which will increase the chances of there being an injustice.
<P>
As a fighting Opposition, it would be reasonable to expect us to look forward to that because there might be a repeat of the 1993 outcry. There have been a number of warnings that reform of the CSA will extend its responsibilities beyond a narrow band of people into middle England. It will cover a greater number of people in various income bands. Unless we are prepared to marry the system to individuals, there is an increased chance of a public outcry.
<P>
We are not without experience. I have mentioned Australia and quoted Mr. Justice Kay extensively, although I suspect that this will be my last quote because I have looked at the remaining amendments and see no way of mentioning him again, which is sad. On page 73 of the Select Committee report, in his evidence on the British decision to use a simpler formula, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``But a simple formula needs to be tied to an inexpensive method of adjusting the application of a simple formula to fit a complex set of facts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are very wise words. He went on to give the following example:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Consider two separated fathers who occupy adjoining duplexes. They are both in the same employment, earning exactly the same income. One owns his apartment outright. The other is a tenant. One can clearly afford to pay more child support than the other. Is it fair that they be assessed merely upon their identical income without regard to other aspects of their financial positions?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, very wise words indeed. The amendments would tackle that problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I would be happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I should like to quote from Mr. Justice Kay's letter in which he criticises the Australian system. He explains that one of its weaknesses is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the lack of ability to rapidly enforce arrears as and when they accrue''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For him,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the most glaring inefficiency even with our scheme is its inability to ensure collection of all money falling due under it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman not think that there is a connection between the complex departure scheme in Australia, the accrual of arrears and the difficulties in collecting the money?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That point was put to witnesses, I think by the hon. Gentleman, and remarks were made about the Australian character which I found offensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Not by the hon. Gentleman, whose name is a byword for friendship across the globe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> If the hon. Gentleman reads the report, he will see that I took the learned Mr. Mostyn to task for referring to stereotypes. I pointedly avoided doing so myself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is right. The hon. Gentleman is a friend of our great cousins across the sea and I welcomed his robust defence.
<P>
We have taken those concerns into consideration. If the hon. Gentleman is patient, he will see that our amendments to clause 15 deal expressly with his point. I look forward to his support. Perhaps he will be able to persuade Labour Ministers that the Conservative party has a legitimate point.
<P>
We examine amendments in isolation, but no one clause makes a Bill. We firmly believe that the enforcement provisions need strengthening. We are confident that we shall be able to persuade Labour Members of that, but they must take us on face value. There is sense in strengthening the clause. How can it be regarded as softness to try to provide justice? We want people's financial arrangements to be determined on the basis of their income and commitments.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough highlighted the extent of the variations. On Second Reading and in this Committee, he wisely remarked that the system will have to change when the outcry about the increased variations occurs. The amendments would provide realistic concessions. If someone has an abnormally high housing cost, that should be taken into account. Some hon. Members sneered when I mentioned that in our first sitting.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman enlighten me? What is an abnormally high housing cost? How does he define that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We would put it in regulation and produce a complex formula. But to help the Under-Secretary, we have in mind people in south-east England where there is an enormous upturn in property values. The attitude of Labour Members is, let them eat cake; let them move to the north of England—not that there is anything wrong with the north, as I can testify. [Interruption.] When I was nursing my seat, I drove down the M1 on a Friday evening and felt enormous satisfaction at passing a number of Conservative barristers going in the opposite direction to nurse not-so-safe seats. That is the ultimate class war.
<P>
I am aware of several villages where people on low incomes are eking out an existence so as to remain part of the community in the village where they were born. It is hard to tell them, ``Well, I'm very sorry, your job might be here, and you family might have been part of village life for several generations, but you have got to move out.'' The system must take account of such situations.
<P>
The cost of commuting must be recognised, especially—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The amendment refers to unreasonable housing costs rather than abnormal housing costs. Leaving aside the regional variation, does the hon. Gentleman's definition of housing costs include rent, mortgage, council tax, gas and electricity, and how much information is required to calculate it?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We would issue regulations, in which that would be carefully defined. It might be reasonable to include certain things, for example, at one time there were abnormally large rates bills in some authorities, and in such circumstances we might have tried to give some protection. Thanks to the privatisation of utilities, the cost of heating a house is steadily declining, so that might not be included in the regulations.
<P>
It is legitimate, and reasonable, for us to say that we should take care of the problem by means of regulations, and Labour Members seem to be happy when the Minister suggests such a thing. I hope that I can persuade the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) to support the amendment by assuring him that administrative convenience will be our priority.
<P>
On the subject of travel-to-work costs, many people travel considerable distances to ensure that they are in a position to give financial assistance to their families. Given the numbers who commute and the cost of fares, those costs should be taken into consideration, especially when considering the position of someone on a relatively modest salary of, say, £15,000 a year who commutes into central London and whose partner, who has an income of perhaps £200,000 a year, has responsibility for the child. It is the person on £15,000 who will have that income divided according to the various percentages. A person could find himself—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. Gentleman's amendment refers not to unreasonable travel-to-work costs but to all travel-to-work costs. I assume, therefore, that the amendment would apply if, for example, someone travelled a long distance. Is the hon. Gentleman talking about a mileage allowance, or calculating the cost of a car? Is he talking about a weekly, monthly or annual travel permit? How does he define travel-to-work costs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Wait for the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend, who is a little impatient to speak—I can understand that, as we are looking forward to his contribution—says, ``Wait for the regulations'', and that is good advice. All these matters will be defined; that is why there is secondary legislation. If the hon. Gentleman accepts the amendment, six months down the line he may find himself in the Committee discussing the statutory regulations. They may well include a mileage cost; they may benefit people who use cars that do not harm the environment; they may include the cost of an annual season ticket. Those things will be weighed most carefully. The hon. Member for Hendon may think that I am pulling his chain and merely making a debating point, but I am not.
<P>
We want to fit the individual's circumstances into the pattern of settlement that we want. People who commute, and who face considerable financial burdens in order to continue to work may find that they can no longer afford to do so. We heard recently about a gentleman who had walked the length and breadth of Great Britain protesting about unemployment under this Government. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, being a reasonable man—[Interruption] There is no need for the Under-Secretary to comment, she should protect her voice. Her time will come.
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, ``I will ensure that you have a job within an afternoon.'' What did the chap say? He said, ``I can't afford to take a job because I am being pursued by the Child Support Agency.'' I hope that that man is vigorously pursued by the Chancellor.
<P>
The recommendation is that boarding schools fees should be included in the Scheme. I suppose that that is new Labour's sop to middle England. Boarding school fees are a considerable burden. At Oakham school, for example, the fees are £3,000 a term. I have no idea what they are at Harrow.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): About £4,000 a term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Is that right? That is a lot of money. At present, only the cost of lodgings at Harrow or Oakham are taken into account. I confess that it gave me enormous pleasure to read that such a measure had been proposed but that is another matter. Why should only the cost of lodgings be taken into account? Why should not tuition fees be included? If parents send their children to Oakham, Harrow or Eton, they should benefit from that education, and fees should surely be part of the formula.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Sotto voce from Labour Members came the suggestion that we look at the description of boarding school fees on page 74, so I did. Sub-paragraph (5)(b), in line 34 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``components of such fees (whether or not itemised as such) which are, or are not, to be taken into account''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although it is true that schools such as Benenden charge more than £4,000 a term, the fees include tuition fees, living costs and other services. I suggest that the regulations and the Secretary of State's power to describe which part of boarding school fees can be taken into account will result in anyone applying for a variation on those grounds having to argue about it until the child has left school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It will require more than the usual amount of regulation. When the Minister replies to the debate, I am sure that the hon. Member for Hendon will be on his feet saying, ``Now tell me, how are we going to define all this?'' The Minister will reply that it will be in the regulations.
<P>
If there are to be concessions, there is no point in being cheeseparing about it. If somebody is prepared to make such a financial commitment to his or her child, it should be taken into full consideration. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) is right to say that it is not possible to strip out those figures. The only way to draft such provisions is to use fairly arbitrary figures. The Government have taken the welcome decision that private education in boarding schools is acceptable, so they may as well go the whole way.
<P>
The amendment also deals with private health insurance, which is often a factor in settlements. During the previous sitting, we discussed the splitting of such insurance between the parties involved in a separation, which could mean that the husband would continue to pay for private medical insurance for his children. Provision to ensure that would be a sensible addition to the Bill. I am aware of a limited number of boarding schools in the state sector, but I want to make it clear that private schools will also be included.
<P>
Amendment No. 217 proposes a catch-all provision intended to stop the Government or the Child Support Agency looking foolish and to ensure that individual needs arising from particular circumstances are taken fully into consideration. The amendment offers the Government an escape route that they can take if all else fails. It would ensure that they do not find themselves imposing injustice upon individuals, which would be the quickest way of tarnishing the CSA's image in the eyes of the general public.
<P>
The schedule is the Bill's third great injustice and will fatally damage the general public's acceptance of the CSA. In the short time that you have chaired the sitting, Sir David, Opposition Members have demonstrated that we are not here to filibuster, to stop the debate or to hold it down. However, we want proper and healthy discussion about the ways in which the relationship between the variations and the formula will be conducted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I want to speak to amendments Nos. 82 to 86, which were tabled by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George). The amendments are intended to probe the Government on where they intend to draw the line in respect of variations, and I have a few brief questions relating to them which I hope may clarify the Government's intentions. From the evidence heard by the Select Committee on Social Security—especially that given by Baroness Hollis—and from its other deliberations, we know that the Government do not want, in their terms, to reintroduce complexity into the system. However, page 23 of the explanatory notes, which deals with paragraph 2(3) of proposed schedule 4B, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The list is not intended to be exhaustive.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take that to mean that the Government do not see the list of factors detailed in paragraph 2 as conclusive and that they believe that others could potentially be included. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat amendments provide an opportunity to discuss the addition of other factual, information-based factors that could be tested in the same way as those which the Government intend to include in their variation scheme.
<P>
We must be satisfied that the variation system is robust enough to ensure that it aids compliance with the new CSA formula and regime, and is not a further spur to non-compliance. I have read the Social Security Committee's report, and some of those who made representations to it were genuinely concerned—as, I dare say, Committee members are—about the narrowing of the range of considerations that can be taken into account.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I did not intend to quote from that report, but I shall briefly quote Mr. Mostyn, to whom reference has been made on several previous occasions. In question 201, on page 82 of the report, he states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I do not believe that the crude simplicity of this formula coupled with the extraordinarily restrictive grounds for departure does strike that fair balance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendments would test whether that proposition is fair and true, and whether there is scope for moving the line that the Bill will draw a little further, so that other concerns might be addressed.
<P>
Amendment No. 82 would provide for travel-to-work expenses. Such expenses form part of the current departure scheme, so their exclusion seems harsh, and will cause resentment. Other than the argument that we should narrow the gateway through which people can travel when seeking variations to the simplified formula, what is the rationale that underpins the exclusion of such expenses? Given the importance that the Government attach to welfare to work, and given that their entire welfare strategy is based on paid employment, it is hard to fathom why they are sending the signal that, in respect of variations, the cost of travelling to work should not be taken into account.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 would attach a value to the role of carers. The Government have clearly stated their support for carers in provisions such as the national carer strategy, which was established last year, and, indeed, in this very Bill. Other of the Bill's clauses attempt, at least superficially, to recognise the value of carers, but the schedule as drafted will exclude through exemption those who provide care for their parents. That seems strange. In assessing whether additional costs are incurred through the provision of such care, would it not be possible to establish criteria that are objective and beyond dispute? In light of the importance attached to supporting and developing informal care, the schedule gives further cause for concern, and we hope that the Government will reconsider the matter.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 are intended to elicit the reasoning behind the Government's attitude to the non-resident parent who no longer retains an interest in the matrimonial home. The amendments prompt the Government to explain why regular payments towards a mortgage will not be recognised where the non-resident parent retains an interest in the property. As I understand it, this aspect of the Bill was not considered in detail in Select Committee because the Bill had yet to be published. Will the Minister explain why a distinction has been drawn? To some outside this Committee, it seems that those who retain an interest in the matrimonial home but continue to make regular payments towards the mortgage are being penalised. That issue has been raised with me, and I would welcome clarification on it.
<P>
Amendment No. 86 is intended to clarify how paragraph 2(3)(c) will operate in relation to pre-separation debts. For example, a non-resident father may have taken out a loan before separation, to finance the purchase of a car for work. That work generates income and wealth to support the family, whether the father is resident or non-resident in respect of his CSA liabilities. The schedule does not make it clear whether such a debt would be outwith the exception system. If it were, it would be a cause for concern and deep resentment, and there would be many more people coming into our surgeries once the Bill was enacted and the system commenced operations.
<P>
The same would apply to loans for the purchase of an annual travelcard. Such a loan could have been incurred to support a family before separation, but would not be included in the exception system. Consequently, the person paying contributions through the CSA would be penalised, as would their access to work. I wish to clarify whether such debts are included in paragraph 2(3)(c).
<P>
All those examples could be a source of grievance and, as such, the beginnings of further non-compliance in the system. The Minister referred earlier to statistics relating to levels of non-payment, and to failures to pay the full amount of CSA payments. I fear that, unless these matters are made clear and we have this provision built in to the system, some of those problems will reappear.
<P>
By simplifying the formula and narrowing the gateway to variations, we risk sowing the seeds of further non-compliance. Although I appreciate the need for a simple, transparent system that people can understand and readily follow, there is also a need to recognise that people's circumstances are not always the same.
<P>
I note the concerns expressed by the independent case examiner in her written and oral evidence to the Select Committee. She referred to the powers that would be placed in the hands of the officials operating the exception system. The devil will be in the detail in relation to how the regulations—and the definitions of disability, illness and so on—will work in practice.
<P>
It is essential to incorporate into the Bill further variations, which could be amplified and detailed in regulations, and which would be susceptible to a detailed evidence base—a crucial test of how they would work in future. I look forward to the Minister's response to our amendments, because they are intended to elicit from the Government whether this is the complete list, as they say in their notes, or whether there is scope for additions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, because I have raised these points during earlier debates. However, they are thoroughly pertinent to this one.
<P>
I have a different perspective on this group of amendments from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). When I put my name to the amendments, I saw them as probing amendments. Their purpose was to probe not the Government but the entire Committee. The schedule and the amendments bring us again to one of the fundamental principles underlying the Bill. When Mr. Mostyn gave evidence to the Select Committee, he said that the simplicity of the formula that had been adopted would give rise to a huge increase in pressure on the system of departures. There will undoubtedly be a huge pressure for variations, but the Government, in the way that they have drafted the Bill and the schedule, have set their face against that by reducing eligible categories for a variation by the use of thresholds and tight constraints on what can be considered for a departure. Of course, that will not relieve the pressure for such variations—it will only prevent those variations from being delivered.
<P>
It is important that the Government are able to withstand the outcry that will inevitably arise as a result of the combination of a simple formula and a highly restrictive regime for variations. Judging from the evidence to the Select Committee, and the contents of the Bill, the Government have every intention of sticking to their guns, and I congratulate them on that. However, they must have the moral courage to see it through.
<P>
Members of the Committee must be in no doubt about what the schedule entails. In effect, the formula will not be tailored to the individual circumstances of people who find themselves in the unfortunate position of having to rely on it. On the contrary, their behaviour and life style must alter in order to conform to the formula. That is a profound difference.
<P>
During the Select Committee's proceedings, I asked several witnesses whether they believed that people would respond to the stimuli and change their behaviour as a result of the incentives and disincentives laid down by the formula. The witnesses were sceptical about the likelihood of that, implying that the pressure valve will be let out in some way by reduced compliance or expressions of unfairness in other forms. In my view, they are wrong. Over time, people's behaviour will conform to the powerful messages and stimuli, and incentives and disincentives, in the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that we would be imposing an injustice on many people. However, the entire underlying principle of the Bill is based on a rougher quality of justice than that which can currently be delivered, given the objectives of the existing system. The existing formula does not work, and has to be simplified in order to deliver any justice at all, even a rougher form of justice. That rough justice aims to deliver justice to some children, which, as we have seen in considering the variations, will inevitably give rise to a degree of injustice for some people. That does not arise out of an intention to punish them or be unpleasant to them, but simply out of expediency. Some justice has to be better than no justice.
<P>
The Bill's intention is to provide the greatest good for the greatest number. That involves making a practical assessment of the best outcome, regardless of how unsatisfactory that may seem when it is measured against any absolute standard. This is a Benthamite Bill—the spirit of Jeremy Bentham pervades the Bill and the schedule. I have no difficulty with that, but I tabled this probing amendment to make it clear to Committee members that the Government do not have any difficulty with that, either. The fact that they proposed such a measure is an extraordinary development—the world appears to have been stood on its head. Do they really understand their proposal?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I, too, do not want to speak for long, largely because my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who is temporarily out of his place, covered most of the points that I wanted to make.
<P>
One reason for changing the system is to make it simple. The desire to do so involves an attempt to help CSA staff, which is commendable, and an attempt to get the system right and to make it fair. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) said, if the reform does not make the system fairer, nothing will have been achieved. He was right to discuss the concept of rough justice—he has done so on many occasions—because the system may deliver not necessarily justice but a comfortable standard of living to some people, although others may be penalised. We need to consider another concept in this context: compensation error. In order to clear up one injustice, the Bill may create other injustices in an attempt to keep the system simple.
<P>
I want to discuss two matters and to ask various questions. First, high travel costs may be incurred for various reasons, including a desire to earn a high wage. Someone who travels a lot might, because of the nature of the job, earn more money, and he would be assessed on that higher income. A self-employed person, for example, might have a fee income of £100,000. Before the tax man took a bite out of that sum, allowances could be set against it—expenses are involved in earning that money. The situation in the current context is no different. It might be necessary to increase one's travel costs in order to fit in with the Government's approach in other areas. In these days of joined-up government, the Government tell us that we should get out of our cars. I frequently do so and come to London on the train, but it costs me more to do that. I can drive here for half or a third of the cost of taking the train. Should not that be taken into account?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that housing costs could be higher in the south-east. They are also high in Tewkesbury. He explained why housing costs were high and he gave an example—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments on housing costs. One could infer from his argument that all housing costs in the south-east should, by definition, be regarded as being high housing costs. If my constituents or I were asked whether we feel that we are paying too much for housing, we would agree that we were. That is the nature of the housing market. The hon. Gentleman appears to be saying that all residents in the south-east or in Tewkesbury who are non-resident parents should expect to be treated as a special case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I understand that housing costs may be high in that situation We earlier discussed the Government's concern that children should share the wealth of their parents. The absent parent may be well off and pay enough money to allow the child to live with his or her other parent in relative calm and comfort, which they may be entitled to do. However, should not the person who is doing the paying also be allowed to live in relative calm and comfort? Should that not be included in the calculation? I do not know whether that answers the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is separate from the point made by my hon. Friend. For the reasons that I have given, those two items should be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I support my hon. Friend's amendments about departures, variations or whatever the new exceptions to the rules will be called. I worked as a journalist for The Daily Telegraph during the last Parliament and took a great interest in the Child Support Agency. Articles about the agency, and its various wranglings and difficulties, used to appear on the front page of The Daily Telegraph in most weeks. Although the complicated formula used by the agency had been created for the purposes of fairness, such a utopia was beyond any Minister in the previous Government, and may be beyond any Minister in this Government. There was constant pressure to take into account other circumstances about which people felt a grievance.
<P>
Have Ministers thought through whether they are right to proceed on the basis that they have chosen? I thought that the Government intended to create a formula that was sufficiently reduced to allow the agency to say, ``That's the amount, that's the percentage, that's what you have to pay, now shut up and do it!'' The point of the previous system was to cater for the fact that everyone's circumstances are different. All members of the Committee apart from the Ministers earn the same amount of money, but we spend it in different ways, and may have 15 to 20 different reasons why we should not pay 15 per cent.—or whatever percentage applies—towards the care of a child with whom we do not live. The Government chose a straightforward formula at the low end of what some might regard as a reasonable contribution to their child's well-being. A contribution of 15 per cent. of after-tax income is not a large amount; it is most certainly less than the amount that one would pay if one were living with the child. Given that the level was pitched so low, one would not have thought that there was a need for departures. I understand why the Government have gone down that road, but they end up in the same limbo as the previous Government, who created a more complicated formula to try to take account of a wider range of different circumstances. If the Government are saying, ``Okay, we will take away a smaller amount of your income, but we will create other exceptions to the rules that we have just introduced''—
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Will my hon. Friend comment on what I regard as an improvement in the schedule—the ability of the parent with care to seek a variation on the basis of life style inconsistent with income? Has she not had constituency cases, as I have, in which people are outraged at the way in which non-resident partners conceal their income, live in relative luxury and yet are not prepared to make provision for their children? The schedule provides greater flexibility, which we should welcome, despite our other complaints.

<P>

<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Departures have not only been in relation to absent parents and their complaints about the amount of income taken by the CSA. There are many cases—including a significant number in my constituency—where the parent with care has strongly objected to the way in which the parent without care has organised his or her assets, or disguised them, in order to avoid paying a fair contribution towards the child's upbringing, even though he or she could afford to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I have been listening carefully to the Opposition. Will the hon. Lady tell us what percentage of the total number of cases would be entitled to apply for a variation, if account is taken of all the exceptions?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question, but I am sure that he would like to put it to the Minister.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is confusing who will be entitled and who will not. That difficulty arises as soon as a series of departures is set up.
<P>
These are probing amendments, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said—
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Are they?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The answer is yes and maybe.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. and delightful Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar entertains and titillates us at the same time, so we shall listen with interest to hear whether the Minister can so satisfy us that we can maintain that they are probing amendments and not amendments on which to vote.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon asked how many cases might seek departure. That goes to the heart of the difficulties and inconsistencies in any legislation that is trying to provide support for children whose parents do not live with them. The real grievance concerns the amount of money that is paid and any system enabling those parents to evade, reduce or minimise those responsibilities will be used and abused to suppress the total. The number of cases will reflect not those who are eligible, but those who wish to gain departure.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is possible to conclude that the figure for departures, which is currently 4 per cent., could rise to 100 per cent. if the amendment was accepted.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I bow to the Minister's civil servants, who are more able to number crunch than those of us on the Opposition Benches who are less well resourced. I do not know whether the Minister is correct. I know that there is a problem in creating a structure to make a flat rate payment and then creating a series of departures to that flat rate payment, because that attracts people who want to use the formula to gain exception.
<P>
The Government's exceptions are intriguing and my hon. Friends have mentioned some. There is a problem with housing costs. Every day, in the national newspapers, we read of the increasing disparity in the cost of housing throughout the country. The price of housing in the south-east is booming at a rate that we could not have imagined some years ago, while in some parts of the north prices remain more stable and less inflated. There is certainly a considerable difference.
<P>
People who work in sectors such as nursing, and teaching and elsewhere in the public sector receive salaries that tend to be consistent throughout the country. There may be a London weighting, but that is not a huge amount. A large raft of people may find themselves earning similar salaries, but the area in which they live will dictate their standard of living. I understand how difficult it is to take account of the patchwork quilt of housing costs, but people who live in more expensive parts of the country and earn public sector salaries cannot reasonably be expected to put a roof over their heads for the same amount of money as those in other parts of the country. That will inevitably lead to as legitimate a sense of grievance as do the departures in the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will the hon. Lady tell us the size of accommodation that it would be appropriate for a non-resident parent to occupy, because nothing in her amendment would prevent somebody from trying to maximise their housing cost to avoid their liability?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point that goes to the heart of the problem of changing the Bill, and reflects the difficulties that we have already encountered. He is right that there is an incentive in the system to get a more expensive property, but he must accept what I am saying. He will be more affected as a London Member than I am in Bromsgrove, and certainly hon. Members who represent the south-east will have constituents who use the compelling argument that, because of their salary and the area in which they live, they cannot find decent accommodation. The more children they have, the more accommodation they would like to have, so as to meet the Government's legitimate aim that a non-resident parent should have joint custody of the children. However, there is no easy way to reconcile all those competing interests.
<P>
The Government must consider how they will handle that sense of grievance when it starts to build up a head of steam and when their changes to the Child Support Agency start to appear on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, just as the previous Government's attempts to create a child support agency did.
<P>
It was deeply resented that travel-to-work costs were not included in the previous regulations of the Child Support Agency. Many occupations are peripatetic and rely on people having to cross the country every day on journeys which to most of us would seem exhausting. As we now know, under the Government the cost of such travel has increased exponentially, partly because of the rises in the fuel escalator, which have made motoring extremely expensive, whether it is for work or for pleasure. Given that increase in the cost of travel, it is perfectly legitimate to include in the schedule expenses incurred when travel to earn a living is not negotiable but a necessity. People have certainly come to my surgery complaining about travel-to-work expenses not being properly included, even though they received some concessions. The concessions were worth having to begin with, but some people still do not consider the system to be fair, given their circumstances. It will be an area of vociferous debate when the Bill comes into effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Surely the Bill's answer to the hon. Lady's legitimate concerns is that, like Mother Hubbard, the single mother must learn to live in a shoe: she must move house, change her job or do whatever is necessary. The advantage of this debate is that it should make Labour Members realise that that is precisely what the Bill requires.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend always has colourful way of expressing himself, and I would not begin to compete with that, but he has made an interesting observation, because that is what we are discussing here. We all know that it is not a simple matter, but we fear that the rules that the Government have created will not be sustainable over the longer period. On reading schedule 2, I smiled wryly when I saw that the Government had given themselves a catch-all provision to enable them to introduce regulations at a later date. Other provisions may be introduced as and when the flak from the public makes the new system unsustainable. We are trying to help the Government by making suggestions that they may have overlooked or failed sufficiently to take into account.
<P>
I was interested and surprised to discover that, despite much of the Government's rhetoric, and bearing in mind their internal difficulties on education, they have permitted a departure in respect of public school fees paid by the non-resident parent. My party and I applaud that. Clearly, a child who is attending a private school will want to continue that education, and it is in the child's interest not to be moved. It is right and proper that, if the absent parent is prepared to make such a contribution, it should be taken into account in the maintenance formula. In many private schools, children stay overnight, so it is entirely legitimate for the Government to take this factor into account. We welcome the provision, which is an encouraging symbol of new Labour's willingness to adopt a reasonable attitude towards people's right to choose how they spend their private income.
<P>
Given that new willingness to adopt private market solutions, it is a pity that the Government are not prepared to extend the provision to private health care contributions. [Interruption.] We have debated the wider issue of the need for more people to take care of themselves whenever possible, so that the national health service can mop up those who cannot, and provide them with a faster and better service. [Interruption.] If the Government want to encourage behaviour that might benefit society as a whole, it is a shame that the schedule does not deal with absent parents who are willing to make private health care contributions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will Committee members please pay attention to the hon. Lady? Whether or not one agrees with the person who is speaking, he or she is entitled to a fair hearing.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Thank you, Mr. Cunningham. I fear that Committee members' pagers are receiving an interesting message. I cannot think what it might be, and I know that you would rule me out of order if I were to speculate.
<P>
I was asking the Government to consider including in the schedule a departure scheme that allows private health care contributions from the absent parent. If nothing else, that would encourage behaviour that would benefit all members of society. Those who receive private health care contributions would no longer burden the national health service, and others could, as it were, take their place. That would be in the wider interests of everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My colleagues' contributions have been so comprehensive that I hope to be fairly brief—[Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear''.] As long as I am not provoked.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the Government on this issue, because they are caught between a rock and a hard place. [Interruption.] The rock is the need for simplicity and the hard place is the need for fairness. We must take into account the circumstances of those who live on relatively low wages and are doing their level best to balance the heavy responsibilities of looking after two families. [Interruption.] It is a difficult issue, but the Government are being over-sanguine—

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already said that Committee members should do the person who is speaking the honour of at least listening to what is being said. Private conversations should be held outside the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Especially when I am talking.
<P>
As I was saying before you came to my assistance, Mr. Cunningham, the Government are being over-sanguine if they really think that there will be only 21,000 applications for variations, because it is impossible to fit the circumstances of one million families into the very narrow formula that the Government have devised. It would be much easier for the staff—as they told us—if the variations were as few in number as possible and were dealt with as quickly as possible and on the narrowest possible grounds.
<P>
Despite the Under-Secretary's reassurances, I do not believe her. I know that she honestly thinks that she can limit applications to 21,000, but she will not get away with it because of the pressure that she will be under.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Opposition Members infer that practically everybody will be entitled to the variation. However, I have been doing a bit of adding up, and their proposals would amount to at least 15 extra pieces of information being required. That is a conservative estimate. During the Select Committee's proceedings, we heard about the problems caused by delays in obtaining such extra information, and were told that that was used as a way of avoiding liability. How does the hon. Gentleman respond to that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make some clever debating points, but the current departures system is complex, and even the Government realise that one cannot have a simple formula. They have come up with a series of variations, which I shall go through in a moment. It is clear that complex information will be requested of people, or they will proffer it. With the best will in the world, that will involve the Child Support Agency in a lot of work.
<P>

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.25 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Hon. Members can now settle down after all the excitement downstairs. I shall try to settle them down with my speech, without sending them to sleep.
<P>
The subject of variations is important. I was saying that the Government are being over-sanguine in thinking that they can keep the numbers down to a level low enough to ensure that the cogs of the Child Support Agency do not become gummed up. One has only to look at the schedule to see that there is infinite scope for parents to use the variations to delay matters, to argue about matters, and to achieve what they think is justice, although that may not be ill-intentioned.
<P>
This is not simply an argument between a Government who have a marvellous formula that will work and a system that will be incredibly fast with no delays, and an Opposition who come along and try to throw spanners in the works. That would be a reversion to the bad old days. We can argue about whether it would be fair to have a system like the old departures system in a moment. However, the Government already have a problem. The CSA staff recognise that, and see the variations as a Trojan horse. Moreover, that Trojan horse is not sitting outside the gates; it is already inside the castle—the provisions are in the Bill. That will cause a great deal of trouble.
<P>
Paragraph 2(3)(a) states that the Government intend to take account of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``costs incurred by a non-resident parent in maintaining contact with the child, or with any of the children''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could involve a little or a lot. Will the Minister tell us how much she thinks that it would involve? It could involve travel, as well as other things. It can be very expensive to maintain contact with a child in today's world, in which families are often separated by great distances.
<P>
The Government, quite fairly, are already prepared to take account of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``costs attributable to a long-term illness or disability''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that could mean a lot or very little. I learned at a meeting yesterday that 9 million people are in receipt of some sort of disability benefit. If that is true, that is a great many people. The Government will respond that, as paragraph 2(4)(b) states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the question whether an illness or disability is long-term shall be determined in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, in light of the figure of 9 million people, one can see that this is a moveable feast. A great many people could argue that their liability should be reduced because they are disabled or ill. How long does a long-term illness last?
<P>
I am not trying to be difficult, but when people are faced with a Bill that they deem unfair, they will use any means to try to reduce that unfairness. One can see that there is infinite scope in the provisions for asking questions and for trying to hold matters up. I turn to paragraph 2(3)(c), which covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``debts of a prescribed description incurred, before the non-resident parent became a non-resident parent in relation to a child with respect to whom the maintenance calculation has been applied for (or treated as having been applied for)—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) for the joint benefit of both parents;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) for the benefit of any such child; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) for the benefit of any other child falling within a prescribed category''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need more information about what that means. We live in a society in which people, especially younger people, are heavily indebted. Indeed, levels of debt are frighteningly high, and it could be difficult to work out a fair way of dealing with some situations. I imagine that the next category, boarding school fees, will not cause such a problem. Only a small percentage of the population goes to boarding school, but I understand why the Government have included it in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The next category will cause considerable trouble:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the cost to the non-resident parent of making payments in relation to a mortgage on the home he and the person with care shared''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may mean very little, but I expect that it will cause problems in determining the precise payments that have been made, the current arrangements, and so on. Even if we accept the current list, it is likely that many people will apply for variations, with good reasons.
<P>
My understanding of the system is that there will be a formula, which will aim at some sort of fairness, an assessment will be made and if the person is aggrieved by it, he can follow the departures procedure—and I understand that, in this system, it will be possible to apply at the beginning of the process. It is all very well for Ministers to say that they will issue leaflets, but the word will get out that it is not just a matter of applying a simple formula, according to which one must pay 15, 20 or 25 per cent., but that various let-out clauses exist, depending on whether the parent is maintaining contact with the children, whether he or she is ill or disabled, and all the other criteria to which I referred. 
<P>
Many people will make applications, and it is simplistic to assume that people will not want to check out the system. If someone received, or was likely to receive, a demand for money that he believed he could not pay, surely the first thing that person would do would be to check out with the authority whether there was any way in which his particular circumstances could be dealt with. But that person's particular circumstances might not be covered by the list. I expect that the Under-Secretary will say that the list is narrow and not many people will be affected by it. That may be true, but I am sure that it will affect far more than 21,000 people. Leaving that aside, many more people will think that they might be affected, and they will phone up or write in, which will cause delays. That is inevitable.
<P>
Even if one considers the Government's proposals, there is enormous scope for difficulty. I believe that variations should be possible because it would be unbelievably unfair merely to employ a simplistic formula. There is no point in saying, ``This has happened and you must live with the consequences,'' because life is not like that. There are many sensitive situations, many cases of people being hard-up and many people who have been put in a certain situation through no fault of their own.
<P>
As we frame this legislation, we must have a human face. We cannot simply ignore such people and say, ``You will pay 15 per cent. of your income.'' We have already heard the example from Australia of two people living in neighbouring flats, with exactly the same income, but one of them had bought the flat outright and the other was paying rent. Cases like that will arise all the time and people will feel aggrieved. There is no reason to suppose that the Government can resist a campaign such as the one launched against the previous Government. The present Government might not have much time for the previous Government, but Committee members who were Members of Parliament at the time should remember the wave of protest that hit us. I have never known the sort of anger that welled up in our constituency surgeries at the time and the pressure that was put on Ministers. Perhaps the present Ministers can resist that sort of pressure, but I doubt it because they have shown themselves to want to respond to public opinion. Indeed, the criticism levelled against them is that they respond too much to public opinion.
<P>
In considering the departures that are currently taken into account, it is all very well for the Government to say, ``If we accept the Opposition amendments, we will simply return to the present departure system.'' They must explain why the present departure system is unfair. There is no point saying that it would take too long and be too difficult. The organisation that we are creating must deal with people fairly, it is not a matter of administrative convenience.
<P>
The current list of departures is not naturally perverse or unfair. There is no reason why it should be dismissed and thrown out of the window. It may be inconvenient to apply, but why is it wrong to take account of travel-to-work costs? That is a reasonable consideration. Some rural areas, including those in my constituency, have high unemployment and low wages, but people often have to travel long distances to work. What happens when the only job on offer for someone with a child is 40 or 50 miles away? If travel-to-work costs are not taken into account and the CSA continues charging a brutal, unaffordable rate, that person might have to reject the job and become a charge on the state. When all those cases start pouring in, the Government might conclude that travel-to-work costs should be taken into account.
<P>
The Government have accepted that there are contact costs and illness and disability costs. They intend to prescribe for pre-separation debts, although I do not understand how. Many debts that were incurred by a couple while they were together have nothing to do with a mortgage. They cannot get out of those debts. To say that it is perverse to take account of pre-separation debts is ridiculous. Those debts exist. There is no point telling someone not to take account of them, especially as they may have been incurred to provide essential equipment for the former marital home which is used by the child and the parent with care.
<P>
We cannot live in a vacuum. We must take account of the costs of supporting other children. Capital settlements, which may favour the parent with care, can fundamentally change a situation. It is perverse, unfair, illogical and lacking in natural justice not to take account of them. In an increasingly sophisticated society, non-income-producing assets should also be taken into account.
<P>
The list of departures goes on. It includes diverted income, a life style that is inconsistent with a person's income and unreasonably high housing costs, which we have already discussed. The Government's response is to ask how we would determine the rate. They say that non-resident parents will move to larger flats. It is not that simple. The people who run the CSA have concluded, after years of dealing with the problems, that unreasonably high housing costs have to be taken into account. It is not always possible for people to live in low-cost housing. Circumstances might be beyond their control. We should be cognisant of the fact that they face unreasonably high housing costs.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to consider people on low pay who spend a high proportion of their net income on housing, which makes them less able to get to work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There is an infinite variety of circumstances. People who have been trying over the past decade to work out how the CSA should be run have concluded, like my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, that it is necessary in particular circumstances to take account of unreasonably high housing costs. Travel costs may be beyond the control of the non-resident parent and should sometimes be taken into account, as should failure of a partner to contribute to housing costs.
<P>
One can see from that list of circumstances that the current departure system is not altogether bad. If the Minister is telling us that the reason why the CSA does not work is the departure system, she should spell it out.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Under-Secretary is shaking her head. If she is saying that the CSA could work well even under the current system, that begs the question why we are doing away with it.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Under-Secretary shakes her head again, but she is doing away with the old system. Is she now telling the Committee that the new variations will be similar to those in the current system? If so, we should know about it, as the information would reassure a number of hon. Members who are worried that the proposed formula is too simplistic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to assist me, as I have a difficulty. If a parent were to tell me that he or she could not afford to bring up a child because of high housing costs or transport costs incurred in getting to work, I would be inclined to say, ``You should have thought of that before you had a child.'' Why should not that argument apply to people who have departed from their children? Why should not such people have to consider the same costs that any family would consider in adjusting their life styles?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend has that point of view and has articulated it previously. I have some difficulties with it, as one cannot simply tell somebody, ``You should have thought of this before.'' I hope that my hon. Friend does not mind my saying that that is a rather hard-hearted attitude. In the real world, people do not necessarily plan out such matters or live in an ideal situation. Parents are there, children are there, and specific types of jobs and housing will be available to them. A parent may be able to earn only a particular amount of money and may have already started a second family. There may be reasons why people's first relationships broke up against their will and why it was not their fault. There are 1,001 different arguments swirling around in such matters, and one cannot make legislation on the basis of insisting that people act in an entirely logical or sensible way that is in accord with the views of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West. He has not substantiated his point, and the Government, who will have to grapple with such matters, have not substantiated theirs.
<P>
I believe that the proposals will result in many more complications than the Government have admitted. The existing departure system has been worked out fairly, and, for better or worse, we will end up with a variation system that is substantially similar to the old departure system.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have had a fascinating debate. The implicit tension that I noted on the Opposition Benches was especially interesting. On the one hand, there is the utilitarian, Benthamite Member for New Forest, West, who glories in his views and who must have taught about the poor law and about less eligibility when he was a schoolmaster, a phrase that I use advisedly. On the other hand, there is the more pragmatic, ``I know what the world's like out there'' approach with which the hon. Member for Gainsborough has been regaling us. We must find a way through those extremes so as to leave us with a workable system. We must also take account of the experience of the CSA in attempting, during the past few years, to operate an already complex system that was designed specifically to deal with matters such as those about which the hon. Member for Gainsborough spoke, and where that has left us.
<P>
In one of life's little ironies, we are talking about departures while such events are occurring among the Tory Front Bench team downstairs. We shall surely catch up on the news during the next vote. I wish to take time to clarify the figure of 21,000 departures. I said in my answer to the hon. Member for Gainsborough's query about the predicted number of departures that the figure is for a year. We are expecting about 21,000 a year, which is about 5 per cent. of the case load. They will be new cases in the system. 
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Under the current departures scheme, about 4 per cent. of the CSA's yearly intake applies for departures. Less than half—between 1 and 2 per cent.—of the applicants are successful in their application for departures. As has been seen, the reforms must be taken as a package. We are moving to a simpler system that removes some of factors currently allowed for by the basic system. Some of those will be allowed for in the new valuation scheme, but not all. We have widened the gate to some extent and are therefore expecting slightly more variations.
<P>
Opposition Members worry that the variation scheme will turn into a Trojan horse. Our intention is to keep it tightly drawn. I shall again draw their attention to the thresholds given in the explanatory memorandum regarding cash, capital assets and the value of assets. Departures will not be allowed if the thresholds are not reached. We have focused the variations scheme on areas in which the recalculated maintenance will be different because of the new calculation, given what we have said will be allowable. The current sound and fury over claims does not necessarily result in any change in the child maintenance calculations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> On the question of holding the line and not allowing the scheme to become a Trojan horse, what measures will the Government take to stiffen their resolve when the existing case load is put on to the new system and those who currently enjoy departures, but who will not be eligible for variations, kick up an enormous fuss?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Some of them probably will be eligible for departures under the new scheme. I ask members of the Committee to bear in mind two matters when they consider the issues. First, the maximum that can be taken from someone's income for the maintenance of children from a previous relationship is 25 per cent.—that covers the maintenance of three children. He would be left with a net 75 per cent. of their income, which is more than the current scheme allows.
<P>
Part of the balancing package appears in other areas. We all admit that there will be exceptional circumstances. We can list such circumstances, although, if the debate is anything to go by, people's views of what is exceptional may differ. In the variations scheme, we want to balance the allowance for such circumstances against the reintroduction of complexity by the back door. Removing complexity is the basic principle behind the Bill and the way in which it amends the existing legislation. If the CSA makes faster calculations, it can spend much more of its time enforcing child maintenance premiums, rather than merely calculating them and not getting around to checking whether they have been paid. All those elements go together in a package.
<P>
I would like to take a little time to address the many amendments that deal with the provisions on the cases and circumstances in which a variation from the normal rules of calculation may be agreed.
<P>
Central to our reforms is the simplification of the way that liability is calculated. The new child support rates are intended to provide a fair maintenance calculation in the vast majority of cases. These simple and consistent rules will provide a clearer and more efficient child support service for children and their parents. It will have maintenance flowing quickly and reliably. That will help the Child Support Agency to get things right first time and more quickly. Liability will be worked out in days rather than months, helping to eliminate the heavy debts that many non-resident parents are saddled with.
<P>
The developments I have described should support the legitimacy of the agency, which we all know did not get off to the best of starts. It is to be hoped that measures such as the child maintenance premium will help non-resident parents, unless they are completely estranged from their ex-wives or partners, to see that the money is reaching their children. That will contribute to a general sense of improvement over the previous system, and a sense that the regime is fairer and should be respected.
<P>
The new rates will enable both parents to work out at a glance how much maintenance should be payable. That will remove an enormous amount of confusion from the scheme. In fact, the calculation tables at the back of the White Paper allow anyone to work out how much they would be liable to pay in child maintenance for a given net income. The amendments would destroy those tables and make them meaningless. Once again no one would be able to predict the child maintenance that they would have to pay. Planning would be much harder and some parents would not know how the amount had been worked out. Sometimes, when constituents come to see me with notifications they have received under the current system, I do not understand how they have been worked out.
<P>
Destroying the tables as a point of reference would seriously harm the changes that we are trying to make. We would do that at our peril. We should be careful not to return to the old system by the back door.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> May I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to page 23 of the explanatory notes, which state that the list of cases in paragraph 2

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We need some flexibility. We discussed this issue at the beginning of our deliberations on the Bill. We should approach legislating in this context humbly. Other tweaks may be needed. We do not know in advance. We need to see how things work out. I am describing to the Committee the principles that will govern the Government's reaction when the system comes into being. I hope that I have done that, and explained our intention that the variations should be tightly drawn. However, I am not so arrogant as to say that we have thought of everything that will be relevant for all future time, and that we are utterly convinced that in making the regulations we need no flexibility to provide a balance between simplicity and allowing for exceptional cases.
<P>
The new approach would result in a fair calculation of maintenance for almost all parents. There will always be exceptional cases in which the child support rates do not properly reflect a non-resident parent's ability to support his children. For example, he may need to spend a great deal of money keeping in touch with them, or the net income used in working out his liability may not properly reflect the resources available to him. We therefore intend to provide for a variation from the normal rules in such truly exceptional cases and circumstances.
<P>
Hon. Members will recall that the current scheme attempts to allow for expenses not covered by the formula assessment. The existing departures scheme was introduced in December 1996. Departures were heralded as introducing added flexibility into a rigid formula and were widely welcomed. However, the departures scheme has resulted in an already over-complex system becoming even more complex. It adds further delay and confusion to a system governed by detailed rules and procedures.
<P>
Our new scheme removes much of the existing formula's complexity from the standard maintenance calculations. We want to make reasonable allowance for exceptional cases in which the rates do not produce a decent and fair result for the non-resident parent or the parent with care. However, there is no merit in allowing that to reintroduce complexity through the back door.
<P>
We have examined the matter closely and carefully. The hon. Member for New Forest, West asked whether we understand what we are proposing. Yes, we do. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) asked a similar question. We spent almost two years consulting on the matter. We did not pull our proposals out of a top hat. We did not say, ``That's the last word on the matter. We thought of this yesterday—there you are''. We had a long, complex, open consultation. The settlement and balance are not the result of a quick fix: we made a genuine attempt to establish the CSA on a fair, workable basis for the future.
<P>
We have made a clear distinction between expenses which a non-resident parent should cover from income after meeting his responsibilities to his children—such as housing costs and travel-to-work expenses—and primarily child-related expenses. The non-resident parent still has 75 per cent. of his net income to meet other costs.
<P>
We intend to allow variations to increase liability when income on which the maintenance calculation has been based does not reflect the non-resident parent's true ability to pay. That has been widely welcomed. We are determined that the grounds on which a variation can be allowed should remain tightly focused. All the rules of the new scheme are intended to ensure that.
<P>
New schedule 4B, as introduced by schedule 2, provides details of cases and circumstances in which a variation will be allowed. Many hon. Members spoke about such cases in today's debates. The majority of the amendments would add further grounds to the Bill—widening the variations scheme—or would extend the nature of expenses under each ground. Some of the proposed provisions are already included in the Bill. The provision in amendment No. 102 for recognising debts of the relationship as special expenses appears in paragraph 2(3)(c). A mortgage is a debt, so when a non-resident parent has a liability to pay the mortgage on the property where he used to live with the parent with care, we propose that those payments should be recognised as legitimate exceptional expenses under paragraph 2(3)(e).
<P>
Equally, as capital and interest will no longer feature in the normal calculations, paragraph 4(2)(a) provides that cases in which the non-resident parent has assets exceeding a value to be prescribed will be examined. Otherwise, the parent with care in such cases may end up being short changed by the simplified formula.
<P>
As a whole, the amendments would extend beyond all measure the nature and extent of what may reasonably be classed as exceptional. Indeed, they would open the floodgates. Amendment No. 86 is possibly the worst offender, as it would enable every non-resident parent to claim a variation due to his housing costs. We have calculated the costs of that. The programme costs would be £100 million; administrative costs would be £8 million in the first year; second-year costs would be £170 million; and third-year costs would be £27 million. I make that a little over £300 million for one little Liberal Democrat amendment. A pattern has emerged, which I draw to the Committee's attention without further comment.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 goes even further, because it would allow the non-resident parent who maintained contact with his child to claim a variation in respect of any and all of his expenses, regardless of whether those expenses were in any way related to the period of contact. That seems completely absurd and would wholly defeat the object of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That said, we intend to extend the nature of contact-related expenses that we are prepared to recognise, albeit not as widely as amendments Nos. 82 and 226 propose. The allowance for contact costs in the departure scheme is restricted to travel-related costs only: that is, fares, petrol costs or tolls. No allowance is made for the cost of overnight accommodation. We intend to prescribe that non-resident parents with particularly difficult or arduous journeys will be able to claim the costs of essential overnight stays in appropriate cases. That is evidence of our commitment to shared parenting.
<P>
I move to amendment No. 113. Under the new percentage-based approach, non-resident parents will, as I said, normally be left with at least 75 per cent. of their disposable income out of which to meet travel-to-work and any other expenses. If we allowed costs on the grounds of long-distance travel to work then, as the amendment suggests, we would also have to consider recognising the higher housing costs of non-resident parents who live close to work but in an expensive area. Yet again, the floodgates yawn open. All those proposals would reintroduce the complexities from which we are trying to get away.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 218, 219 and 220 would allow the non-resident parent to offset part of any costs that he incurs in providing an education for his child against his on-going maintenance liability for that child. They propose far more generous provision for school fees than we intend to allow. Although we think that it is reasonable to recognise the costs that non-resident parents incur in meeting the maintenance element of boarding school fees—because that is intended to cover the normal living expenses of the child while at school for items such as food, laundry and accommodation—we do not intend to allow the costs that a non-resident parent may incur in providing an education to be treated as a special expense. The child's primary need is for on-going maintenance, and there is no obligation in child support legislation for a non-resident parent to pay for the child's education. Where the maintenance element of fees is not separately identifiable, it will be assumed to be 35 per cent. of the overall fees charged.
<P>
On amendment No. 225, the position is that non-resident parents who apply on the grounds of being certain about the prescribed special expenses will, as now, need to establish that the costs that they incur exceed, either singly or in aggregate, a threshold below which a variation cannot be considered. That ensures that only unusually high costs should be considered a good enough reason for a parent to reduce his child maintenance payments.
<P>
As hon. Members will know, the threshold under the current departure scheme is £15 a week. In the new scheme, however, we plan to apply a two-tier threshold: £15 per week for parents with a net income of £200 per week or more, and a new, lower threshold of only £10 a week for parents with net earnings below that level. That will give parents who are less well off more help towards their special expenses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am conscious of the time, but I wanted to ensure that before the Under-Secretary sat down she addressed, if only briefly, amendments Nos. 84 and 85, which raise the issue of non-resident parents who have an interest in the matrimonial home. I listened closely to the hon. Lady when she dealt with paragraph 2(3)(e), but I did not hear her mention that. It would be helpful if she did.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I did address that point when I referred to paragraph 2(3)(e). If the non-resident parent has mortgage payments on a property in which the former partner and qualifying children continue to live but in which he no longer has any interest, that will also be considered a ground for variation.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to move to a child support system that is simple, efficient and easy to understand with minimum complexity and scope for dispute. Realistic variations of liability will be tightly drawn. They are a key feature of the new scheme and will recognise exceptional cases. We must keep the list of variations tightly drawn, otherwise, despite all the legislative work, consultation and wracking of brains to see how we can make the system work, we will end up back where we started. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn or that the Committee reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Despite her comprehensive answer, the Under-Secretary did not answer many of my hon. Friends' points. It would be repetitious for me to go over them, but three issues stand out from what she said.
<P>
First, there was an admission that she anticipates slightly more variations than under the existing scheme. That underpins all that my hon. Friends have said. Secondly, she still seems wedded to the whole business of the tables at the back of the booklet, as if somehow it is a good thing if it brings injustice to individuals. It is the obsession with trying to fit people into holes that will be the unravelling of this reform. Thirdly, she said that the Government had not picked the provision out of thin air but had gone out and consulted, given it a great deal of thought and come to an agreed position.
<P>
My understanding is that in the 16th century that is exactly what the Vatican said about Galileo's theories about the earth spinning round the sun. It said that that was absolute nonsense, that the earth was flat—because the Vatican had decided that it was. The Under-Secretary has done exactly the same: she has produced a flat earth policy for the CSA. Having said that, I accept that these are probing amendments. We believe that many of our predictions will come to pass, but we have done our best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened closely to the Under-Secretary but I feel that the issue relevant to amendments No. 84 and 85 was not dealt with to my satisfaction. However, I shall return to it later. The hon. Lady gave some impressive figures which, when rolled together over three years, sound like an extremely large sum—as is the case with much of the Government's spending plans. I accept that they are interesting figures and I shall look closely at the record to see how they are built up and perhaps ask some questions so as better to ascertain how they were compiled.
<P>
The issue of carers and their responsibilities has not been dealt with satisfactorily today. I should like to return to that matter also. I do not have the privilege of asking leave to withdraw the amendments, but I wish to put on record my remaining concerns, despite the Under-Secretary's detailed response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]

Adjourned accordingly at seven minutes past Seven o'clock till Thursday, 3 February at Ten o'clock.
