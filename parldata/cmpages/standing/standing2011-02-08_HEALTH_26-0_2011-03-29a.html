Before we broke for other business, we were discussing some important
matters on the Government’s overall approach to the regulation
of health and social care professionals and workers, and when it is
appropriate to extend regulation to new
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have made it clear that we will not rule out compulsory statutory
regulation for any part of the work force when there is a compelling
case for it on the basis of a public safety risk and when assured
voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage the risk.
It is important, however, that the costs and benefits of regulation are
fully assessed and that a clear case can be made that compulsory
statutory registration is proportionate before it is
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members,
and the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury in particular,
have expressed the view that social care workers should be subject to
compulsory statutory regulation. I do not want to belittle the very
real concerns she has raised about the poor quality of care in some
parts—I emphasise that—of the care sector. Nor do I wish
to dwell unnecessarily  on the past, but I remind the Committee
that in 2005  the previous Administration committed to
regulating 250,000 home care workers and a further 500,000
residential care workers. By 2007, however, it became increasingly
clear that the commitment to registering the entire work force had not
been fully thought through and was not being implemented. The
Government then clarified that their intention was to regulate home
care, or domiciliary care, workers in the first
instance.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Until
July 2009, work was undertaken to enable a voluntary register for home
care workers to be opened by the General Social Care Council by 2010.
In 2009, however, the General Social Care Council discovered a backlog
in its handling of conduct cases, and work on opening a register of
home care workers was postponed until Ministers were confident that the
General Social Care Council could deliver its existing
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is effectively where we found things when we came into office. As the
Committee knows, that backlog led to the commissioning of the report by
the Council 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1156<a class="bkMark" name="Column1156">&#160;</a>
                           </div>for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, which has been mentioned several
times in debates on this part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is our view that voluntary registration should be encouraged for the
adult social care work force. We will explore the scope for the Health
and Care Professions Council to establish a voluntary register of
social care workers in England by 2013. Although regulation of the
health and social care work force is sometimes necessary, under the
previous Administration there was a tendency for compulsory blanket
statutory regulation of the health and social care work force in
England to be seen as the first resort, rather than the last, in
deciding how best to assure appropriate standards of
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
all the previous Administration’s commitments to extend
regulation to new groups of workers had been delivered, an additional
1.3 million workers, many of whom are in relatively low-paid support
roles, would be obliged by law to pay registration fees to continue to
pursue their livelihoods. It is our view that the assured voluntary
route is a better route, and, more than that, we need to strengthen
local responsibility for managing problems effectively and
promptly.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s view is that there is a key role for employers and
providers in ensuring high standards of service. That role must rest
with local service providers. As the previous Government demonstrated,
it is simply not possible effectively to manage the whole system from
the
centre.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are clear that regulation of individual workers is not
always the proportionate response given the wider safeguards in the
system. Children’s services providers, for example, are
regulated by Ofsted. Many providers of health and social care services
in England must register with the Care Quality Commission and meet a
set of 16 essential safety and quality requirements. People working in
health and social care in England also fall within the scope of the
vetting and barring system. In the NHS there are specific obligations
on employers to undertake a range of pre-employment checks on workers,
and primary care providers are subject to a range of statutory checks
by virtue of the National Health Service (Performers Lists) Regulations
2004.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is clearly a need to ensure that providers are held to account for the
quality of the work force and that swift and effective action is taken
by the Care Quality Commission when there is a breach of its standards.
For those reasons, we seek a more proportionate approach that will
enable a system of assured voluntary registration to be developed for
unregulated workers, with the CHRE being the national accrediting body
for registers of health care workers throughout the UK who are
currently not regulated by statute, and for social care workers in
England.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
view is that a system of assured voluntary professional registration
should be considered in the first instance as an alternative to
statutory intervention to drive up the quality of service provision,
and that full statutory regulation should be a last resort. However, we
recognise that in exceptional cases assured voluntary professional
registration will be considered insufficient to militate against the
level of presenting risk; if the extension of compulsory statutory
regulation is necessary, it will be taken forward by the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At present,
there is no external quality assurance to enable existing holders of
voluntary registers to demonstrate that they set and enforce
professional standards effectively. The Government therefore intend to
establish the CHRE—under the Bill, it will be renamed the
Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care—as
the national accrediting body for voluntary registers for health care
workers for the UK and for social care workers in England.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is our
intention that the authority will set standards against which the
governance, procedures, registration criteria and performance of
voluntary registers can be judged, to establish whether they are
sufficient to provide assurance to the public and employers about the
training, skills and conduct of their registrants. Through assured
voluntary registration, we seek to improve service users’
experience of the system by driving up the quality of the work force.
We will also ensure that voluntary registration systems accredited by
the authority make appropriate links to the wider regulatory system and
include appropriate policies on professional indemnity and
safeguarding—including, when appropriate, procedures for making
referrals to the Independent Safeguarding Authority, or Disclosure
Scotland, if individuals are deemed to pose a risk to the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000042">&#160;</a>

is important and potentially interesting. It deals with the abolition
of the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator. One has to look
hard to discover what OPHA is. It is not to be found in the Bill, nor
in the explanatory notes or the impact assessment. That is, apart from
one line in the table that refers to the £13 million
saving that the Government anticipate making as a result of its
abolition.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000492">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">OHPA
was a new body that was set up in the light of the inquiry into the
activities of Harold Shipman, the GP. It came about as a result of the
recommendations of the fifth report of the Shipman inquiry, in which
Dame Janet Smith—now Lady Justice Smith—recommended that,
to avoid the situation that was exposed by the Shipman case of the
General Medical Council’s being perceived in her view to be
judge, jury and prosecutor, we ought to move to one whereby there is a
separation, as there ordinarily is under the law, between the police,
the Crown Prosecution Service and the judge; in other words, between
the independent adjudicator and the regulatory body. At that time, the
GMC was unhappy and lobbied hard to have the independent body that was
intended to oversee its work
removed.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
December, at the conclusion of a short review and consultation on OHPA,
the Government announced that it would be abolished. The rationale was
twofold: first, the Government thought that the GMC had reformed its
practices to make them more independent, although how it can be
independent of itself is beyond me; and secondly, that costs would be
saved, which is significant as the original start-up costs were
anticipated to be £10 million. The consultation found
that 45% of the respondents agreed that OHPA ought to be abolished,
although it failed to point out that 55%, including 35% who were
opposed to it outright and the rest who did not express an opinion or
were undecided, were not in favour of its abolition. None the less, the
Government decided to push ahead, suggesting in a written statement
from the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for
Guildford (Anne Milton) that the savings were worth while and that the
GMC would be able to adjudicate independently and
impartially.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
that time—again, this went unreported—the then chairman
of OHPA
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OHPA
offered genuinely independent adjudications, in a reformed
system… Such a system would have assured the public that their
protection from those who are not fit to practise medicine…was
in the hands of a wholly independent tribunal. Given that this was a
key recommendation of the Shipman Inquiry, it is regrettable that the
Government has decided not to proceed with the OHPA
programme.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000493">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I
will raise two issues that come out of that and ask the Minister two
questions. The first is whether the Minister is entirely certain that
the financial rationale, which seems from the consultation to be
clearly the principal rationale for the abolition of OHPA, was
adequately scrutinised. A submission from OHPA to the inquiry 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1159<a class="bkMark" name="Column1159">&#160;</a>
                           </div>stated that £10 million would be saved every year as a result of
rolling up into one adjudication body the adjudication hitherto
conducted by the GMC, the General Optical Council and the relevant
bodies for pharmacy and nursing. It thought that a united body would
save £10 million, which was the cost of the initial set-up. Is
the Minister convinced that the financial argument
makes
sense?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
importantly, OHPA’s submission concluded that, had it gone ahead
and been maintained by the Government, it would have addressed the
legitimate<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000079">&#160;</a>

concern and lack of legal soundness inherent in a system where the

                        </p>
                        <p>Is
the Minister entirely certain and content that allowing the GMC to make
adjudications on its members is the appropriate way forward? The GMC
has submitted evidence to the Committee in which it supports the
Government’s decision to scrap OHPA. Having already said that
OHPA was not a good idea, such evidence should not be a great surprise
to us. In its evidence it says that it has addressed the problem by
introducing a degree of separation between the investigation and
adjudication
stages.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000080">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The hon. Gentleman is making a good
case of sorts, but will he not recognise three points? First, some
adjudication bodies are also disciplinary bodies. Secondly, the GMC has
made substantial attempts to change itself with increased lay
representation. Thirdly, and this is an empirical point, there are more
cases and evidence of the GMC doing that—in other words, more
people have been up before the GMC and treated fairly severely than
hitherto. Some progress has been made, so the Government’s case
that reforms are in place now and that the Shipman case could not
easily be repeated is relatively valid is it
not?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000081">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not dispute that the GMC has clearly addressed
the matter and was addressing it before OHPA was established. It may be
accurate to say that the GMC is able to do this. It is certainly true
that other bodies regulate themselves and prosecute their members in
the event of their transgressing. However, the key point is that the
Shipman inquiry did point to this as a key weakness in the adjudication
and regulation of the medical fraternity in this country. We all
remember the Shipman case—it was a particularly awful chapter in
the history of medicine in this country. When Lady Justice Smith came
to the previous Government with a firm recommendation that the split
was a prerequisite of having an efficient and effective safeguard for
patient interests and efficient policing of the medical fraternity, it
was a pretty brave leap. To describe that in just six or eight lines of
a Bill with 300 clauses probably does not pay due deference and respect
to the magnitude of the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000082">&#160;</a>

his concern, the one thing that the hon. Gentleman has overlooked is a
change the Bill makes that provides for a new responsibility for the
Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, whose name and some of
whose functions we are changing. We touched on one of its new functions
this morning, when we discussed social care and fitness to practise.
The council in its new role will have the function of also being able
to refer cases to the High Court if it believes that the decision made
by a regulatory body after a fitness-to-practise hearing was unduly
lenient. That provides an important new safeguard in the system that is
independent of the individual regulator. It is not true to suggest, as
the hon. Gentleman did, that the removal by the Bill of a body that has
never been set up—OHPA was in the process of being established
when we came into office—in some way weakens the
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Office of
the Health Professions Adjudicator has never been operationally
activated. It was established in law in January 2010 and it was not
expected to take over its duties from the GMC until April this year.
The functions that OHPA was expected to perform will therefore remain
with the GMC, the General Optical Council and other regulatory bodies.
However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southport said, there has
been quite a significant change in the way that those organisations
configure themselves, the involvement of lay members, and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To the
question about the legitimate public interest and patient safety, and
whether doctors protect doctors and perhaps not the public interest,
the answer is clearly no. There is no evidence to suggest that the
current GMC-led adjudication arrangements do not properly protect the
public. The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence reviews all
decisions made by the GMC adjudication panels to assess that, and if it
feels there was undue leniency, it can refer the matter, as I
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000097">&#160;</a>

Does the Minister agree that aside from the important strengthening of
the lay representation on the GMC, there is also a requirement now for
two doctors to sign the forms before someone can be cremated? That
allows either doctor to refer to a coroner, which is an important
safeguard against one of them behaving
inappropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the consultation. It is worth bearing in
mind that the Government consulted on options for the office to
continue in its current form, for changes to be made to it, or for it
to be abolished. The responses to that consultation show that 45% of
people said yes to abolition, 35% said no, 4% were unsure, 3% did not
answer the question and 13% had no clear preference. Governments have
make a judgment based on consultation results; we took the view that,
on balance, the decision, with the safeguards that I have mentioned,
was the right one to
take.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman suggested that the measure might be being driven by an
agenda of short-term savings. I can assure him that that is not the
reason: neither I nor the Government would have accepted that as the
rationale for making the change. However, the Government are committed
to spending taxpayers’  money well and wisely. Setting
up the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator would have cost
between  £10 million and £16 million to replicate
functions already undertaken by the
GMC. We took
the view that that was not
proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000101">&#160;</a>

decisions, and whether they are, for example, compliant with the Human
Rights Act 1998. There is no evidence to suggest that the system of
adjudication operated by the GMC and other regulators is not compliant
with the Human Rights Act, and case law confirms that the system of
adjudication and fitness-to-practise arrangements used by health
regulators, which includes a right of appeal to the High Court, does
not breach that duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000106">&#160;</a>

know, I spent nine years as a lay member of the General Medical Council
and was involved in both of the governance changes that got it into a
shape where there is practically equality in lay membership of the
council itself and, indeed, of fitness-to-practise committees. The GMC
is not arguing against the change on adjudication except in one
area—members of council were in the House at a reception
yesterday, and I talked to them. In the area in question, the council
took its foot off the pedal. There is a need to change the law to
enable it to take action sooner, particularly on doctors who have been
convicted of serious offences, but who still have to be heard under
current legislation. The law will have to be changed to allow that. Is
the Minister willing to meet the General Medical Council and to discuss
in some detail the changes that will be needed, if it is to retain that

the savings that could be derived and then goes on to refer to the
submissions made by various others.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000110">&#160;</a>

is proposed is not the same as having an independent adjudicator
separate from the regulator and the investigating body, as was proposed
by Dame Janet Smith, now Lady Justice Smith. That
is a very different scenario and governance structure, and I do not
believe that what is proposed under the Bill does anything than return
us to the status quo ante, albeit perhaps with a slightly changed GMC.
The basic point about the requisite safeguards not necessarily being in
place if the GMC is acting as judge, jury and prosecutor therefore
remains.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000111">&#160;</a>

I was surprised to find that the submissions made by the individuals

summarised in one page. I therefore ask the Minister to offer us
greater reassurance than is provided by detailing who was in favour and
who was not. He should publish the submissions, so that we can read in
detail who exactly thought the measure was a good idea. After Shipman,
Opposition Members do not think that what the Government propose is a
good
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000112">&#160;</a>

the question of the GMC acting as judge, jury and prosecutor, the
council is looking at how it can enhance the independence of its
adjudication and the efficiency of its processes—the processes
that it currently operates. It is looking to see how it can go further.
The GMC proposes to establish a tribunal-style model of hearings, which
will be overseen by a separately appointed president. The objective is
a robust, fair and effective system of adjudication for doctors, so the
policy question is whether the objective can be achieved without a
separate body undertaking adjudication. We think that it can be, which
is why we set that case out in the impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000114">&#160;</a>

8 sets out the Government’s proposed changes to NICE—the

known—which give rise to a huge number of concerns. The
fundamental reason why NICE was established was to take decisions on
which drugs should or should not be available on the NHS. That
responsibility will transfer to general practitioners. There is a huge
range of concerns about that, which I shall discuss on clause stand

                        <p>Hon. Members may
remember our discussions a mere few weeks ago—it may seem
longer—about the NHS commissioning board arrangements in part 1,
which give the board a clear duty to promote innovation. Under new

19:<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Amendment 665 seeks to

in assessing new drugs and technology under the Government’s new

constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I recently
visited a company called Dialog Devices, which is based at Loughborough
university. It has developed a machine called a Padd, which ensures a
non-invasive assessment of peripheral arterial disease to prevent heart
disease and stroke. I am not asking the Minister to comment
specifically on that; we have all realised during the course of our
discussions that commenting on specific examples is not a good use of
our time. However, the point that the company made was that the NHS is
not only a provider, as we have discussed over a number of weeks, but a
promoter of innovation—and it is, in fact, a consumer. If we
want the NHS to achieve savings as part of the Nicholson challenge,
embracing new medical technology and innovation will play an important
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The chief
executive of Dialog Devices told me that if the NHS does not invest in
new and innovative products, its products go to the United States,
where research programmes and money are available. Although the company
has recently been given money to start clinical trials, it does not
have any money for marketing and going out to GPs to talk to them about
new products.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason
why I have a problem with the hon. Lady’s amendment is that
innovation needs to run right the way through the NHS. It is not for
only the board or NICE; it should be for all levels, including GPs, who
need to embrace new medical technologies, too. I hope that the Minister
will confirm that the Government’s clear view is that it is
essential for the NHS to embrace innovative products. Doing so would
make it a world-leading health service for all medical conditions, and
make it more efficient in meeting needs, given the economic legacy that
we have been left by the previous Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000148">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is unanimity of opinion about the
desirability for and necessity of the benefits of innovation, and the
importance of promoting it in the NHS. My hon. Friend is right that
such innovation should run right through the health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000149">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
sharing with the Committee the fact that the NHS chief executive has
been asked to make a report by November this year, working in
consultation with industry, academia and other interested parties to
look at how the adoption and diffusion of innovations can be
accelerated across the NHS. That report will inform the strategic
approach to innovation in the modernised NHS put in place by the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think there is agreement on the aim of driving innovation within the
NHS, but the hon. Member for Leicester West is concerned about how the
provision is formulated in respect of NICE. Although the intention is
clear, the wording of the amendment would not have the desired effect.
I will try to explain why and reassure 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>the hon. Lady about what I think is our shared purpose. The amendment
appears to be based on a misreading of the Bill, which I am
sure was not the intention, and I believe the issue
has been raised previously by the Association of British Healthcare
Industries. I will take this opportunity to clarify the situation and
offer some assurances.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 217
does not place a duty on NICE to consider whether innovation is
desirable. Instead, it does something a lot stronger and places an
explicit duty on NICE to have regard to the promotion of innovation,
which is itself established as desirable, when carrying out its work.
If the amendment were accepted, it would have the unintended
consequence of restricting NICE’s duty in relation to innovation
and the scope of the NHS commissioning board’s duty to promote
innovation. NICE’s remit, as set out in the Bill, is broader
than just NHS services. The Bill retains the remit that NICE was
originally given in 2005 for public health, and extends its remit
further to cover social care. Public health and social care would not
normally be the responsibility of the NHS commissioning board, and it
would be excluded from the duty if the legislation were constructed in
that way.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000152">&#160;</a>

reassure the hon. Gentleman that the clause places an explicit duty on
NICE to have regard to the promotion of innovation, which is
established as desirable when carrying out its work. It is necessarily
constructed in that way so as to include the full range of its remit,
which comprises social care, health care and public health. The
amendment would have the undesirable effect of narrowing that remit to
the health system and excluding everything else. It would have a
strange effect, which I hope I have explained to the satisfaction of
members of the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is our
intention for NICE, along with other parts of the new architecture put
in place by the Bill, to contribute in many ways to driving an agenda
that promotes the greater use of innovation within public health,
social care and the health service. Quality standards will be reviewed
by NICE at regular intervals to take new developments and innovations
into account. Again, that clearly links across. In terms of promoting
innovation and assessing new drugs, with value-based pricing we will
look to link more closely the price of a medicine to the value that it
offers—taking into account aspects of the value, including
therapeutic innovation and improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000156">&#160;</a>

particularly the last point about value-based pricing that will
specifically take into account the degree to which a new drug is
considered to be innovative; in other words, a premium will be applied
in some way if a drug is particularly innovative. I definitely do not
want to stray outside the scope of the amendment, but one of the
reasons why I tabled it was to probe how much value-based pricing will
seek to promote
innovation.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000158">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">All
I would say is that if more is paid for a drug because it is
innovative, that will have a cost effect elsewhere; in other words, if
more is paid for some drugs because they are seen to be particularly
innovative, they meet previously unmet needs or they have wider
societal benefits, it will cut a bit of the cake away from care
elsewhere. These are not cost-free decisions. When one pays more for
particular drugs, trade-offs will need to be made. I believe that
innovation is important, but it has to be weighed against other issues,
as I am sure the Minister
knows.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000159">&#160;</a>

that. For once, the explanatory note is slightly more helpful. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have two concerns that I hope the Minister will succeed in allaying.
The first is about mission creep. I brought this up with the chairman
of NICE at a meeting organised by an all-party group the other day.
NICE started off, fundamentally, as an organisation for examining drugs
on a value-for-money basis. Then it branched 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1168<a class="bkMark" name="Column1168">&#160;</a>
                           </div>further afield into physical and psychological
therapies and now will take on social care, public health and who knows
what
else.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
raises a competence issue, because those of us who know anything at all
about the NICE drug approval process will know that it sets a high
standard of rigour—I have attended meetings at which NICE has
actually been doing its stuff in committee—and has been very
impressive. The process has often been slow, but it has been rigorous.
Around the table are not only people who are expert on the drug but
expert practitioners in the field and also patients who provide input.
That led to a slightly bogus, quasi-mathematical process where things
such as qualys—quality adjusted life years—were analysed.
When a thing had enough qualys, the drug was considered to be value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was always a bit sceptical about that as a device for ensuring that a
drug was suitable for widespread use in the NHS, but it has to be said
that the process was diligent. There were all sorts of flaws: it was
often slow, it was contentious at times, and it did not really
differentiate between drugs that were universally of benefit to all
patients with a condition, and drugs—such as Aricept, for
example—which sometimes worked for some patients but not for
others. So there were critics, and I am sure that every MP in the
previous Parliament at some time or other would have written to their
primary care trust about some judgment of NICE simply because a patient
in their constituency had raised an issue about the non-availability of
a particular
drug.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
with all its flaws, it has to be said that the people who were doing
that specific job were clearly the best people one could pick to do it,
even though they could not do it to everyone’s satisfaction.
That was reflected in the fact that NICE, in that role, became
internationally respected. Many people looked to the NICE model as the
kind of thing that they should adopt in their own
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
I use the expression “mission creep”, my concern is that
NICE might go the same way as the Audit Commission. At one time, the
Audit Commission had a good reputation as a decent set of accountants
and bean counters, who told local authorities when they were going to
over-spend. Then it started to branch into social care, talking about
how local authorities should be politically run—all that kind of
thing, as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To some
extent, the Audit Commission devalued its currency, because it was
clearly commenting on areas where it was not expert. It is clearly not
the intention of the Government to have a body that cannot comment as
an expert body; to perform its range of functions, that body is going
to need a heck of a lot of experts. There will be other experts in the
field doing similar jobs who will have a view that may differ, and
therefore its authority may be questioned. Will the Minister assure me
that we are not going in that
direction?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
specific questions take us back to the fundamental gatekeeper role of
NICE. Essentially, what was not approved by NICE, what did not pass the
various quality tests, the NHS did not have to fund. It could choose to
fund; individual PCTs certainly did fund things that were not
NICE-approved. However, there was the function of a NICE
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A NICE
judgment meant that no person could go to their PCT with the absolute
assurance that the PCT would regard that as the appropriate
value-for-money

should get a drug—maybe because the patient had seen on the
internet that the drug might be good for them or the pharmacist had
persuaded them that the drug was the magic bullet to solve their
problem—there was some good reason to say, “You
can’t have this particular drug, or it would be inadvisable to
have it.” That may not have been an overwhelming reason; it may
have been
contested.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000175">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It did not altogether address the issue of the
postcode lottery. In my own area, people came to see me saying that a
drug was available in west Lancashire that was not available in Sefton,
or that homeopathy was available in Liverpool and paid for, but not in
Sefton. The postcode lottery still occurred but NICE tried to construct
a set of principles for value-for-money treatments for particular
ailments.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not sure whether we have completely eliminated that in the
legislation. I am not clear about it, which is why I seek
clarification. The absence of that makes the whole business of
rationing care a little more difficult. If NICE is not doing it by
saying, “This drug might have some effect but is simply not
value for money within the NHS”, who will do it?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Presumably,
doctors will have to do it, and make a decision themselves. Doctors
have to face the patient in the surgery and say, “Actually,
although you think this will work well, I do not think that we are
prepared to fund it locally. We are not saying it has no effect; we are
saying it does not represent value for money. It may have a minimal
effect in its qualy impact, as it used to be

                           </strong> We are talking about the general duties of NICE, so
we may as well have the debate now, as I am seven eighths of the way
through what I have to say. I do not think people would want me to
repeat the same points. If doctors are making the decisions, the
critical question we need to get straight is, “If my doctor will
not give it to me, but I know that it is appropriate medicine for my
ailment, can I join another practice and get it?” Can everybody
do that when they are turned down by their doctor? If so, the
implications for the NHS drugs budget are horrific. If that is not the
case, presumably we are going to adopt a model in which if I go to see
a doctor anywhere, but my consortium 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1170<a class="bkMark" name="Column1170">&#160;</a>
                           </div>will not pay for the drug, I simply do not get it, in which case my
consortium again determines what I do or do not get. It is very
important that that principle is made clear, because the scenario in
which people can shop around for doctors in order to get the drugs that
they want would have very damaging effects, if only on the health
service
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000182">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
Monitor’s role, if it is not to be a gatekeeper, is to offer
quality standards. What concerns me is whether a quality standard can
bring in value-for-money issues. In other words, a quality standard can
say that such and such an ailment is best treated in this way, and the
quality way to treat it is to use such and such a drug or therapy,
rather than another that is simply a more expensive way of doing the
same thing. If Monitor’s quality standards can involve the same
value-for-money judgments as did its previous judgments, we are back in
familiar territory, but if they do not, we are in the scenario, I
think, in which people can shop around for whatever medicine they
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000183">&#160;</a>

possibly unparliamentary language. The hon. Member for Southport has
discussed the general duties of NICE, so I feel that this is the
appropriate place to discuss those issues. As he said, NICE was
originally set up to take on the very tricky problem that health care
systems have faced throughout the western developed world—with
new and ever-more expensive drugs coming on-stream, how do we decide
what is paid for out of, in our case, the public
purse?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">NICE
is widely respected across the world for the work that it does. People
might not necessarily think that if they read only certain newspapers
or if they just accept the view that certain Ministers have expressed
about the failures of the system. Of course improvements can be made,
but other countries look to NICE and follow NICE. It was one of the
previous Government’s great achievements. Much praise is due to
my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank
Dobson), who took that step forward. He thought that it was a difficult
thing to do, but he took a very bold step in launching NICE, of which I
am very
proud.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000187">&#160;</a>

role changes and its general duties change as a result of the Bill, but
as I am sure that hon. Members will appreciate, the same issue
remains—how do we decide which drugs should be paid for out of
the public purse? The Bill changes who makes the decision. It goes from
being the responsibility of a national body to being the responsibility
of general practitioners and general practitioners commissioning
consortia or whatever they are going to be called if amendments are
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000188">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of organisations have raised serious concerns about the likely
consequences of the change, and I would like to go through them,
because I believe that hon. Members may be facing hard questions from
their constituents as the process moves forward and we need to be aware
of what they may be. I shall begin by quoting
NICE’s response to the Government’s consultation on
replacing the current system for setting prices in the NHS with a new
value-based pricing system. NICE explicitly warns that that could
increase the postcode lottery, and
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
tight fiscal environment in which the NHS will be operating over at
least the next 4 years, together with the proposed arrangements for
commissioning NHS services, will tend to increase rather than reduce
the challenge of achieving consistent access to new treatments. We
believe that there is a risk that patients and health professionals who
want to use drugs made available under the new arrangements may find it
difficult to do so unless the new arrangements retain powerful,
national reference
points”.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000500">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
just want to state those three key national things that NICE believes
need to be in place, because simply changing the way in which a drug is
valued or the price that is set on a drug does not automatically ensure
access or uptake of that drug. That will be up to the commissioning
consortia based on their available resources. I am sure that Ministers
would not say this, but sometimes it is suggested that a new way of
pricing drugs will automatically lead to their uptake. That is not the
case. It is not the view of NICE and it is not the view of many
pharmaceutical companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What NICE
says is that clear steps have to take place at a national level to try
to ensure that there is as small a postcode lottery as possible. The
first step is a clear recommendation through NICE conducting a
technology appraisal, which I think is what the hon. Member for
Southport must have been sitting
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000191">&#160;</a>

as NICE says, make the situation far worse. If the hon. Gentleman will
bear with me, I shall go on to explain why that situation is likely to
get worse. It is not just NICE that says that; the BMA, the Royal
College of General Practitioners and patient groups also have concerns.
The current system is not perfect, but my concern is that the new
system will make matters
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000193">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">NICE
believes that there should be a clear recommendation about that drug.
Secondly, there must be what is called a funding direction. In other
words, there must be a direction from NHS organisations—in this
case, GP commissioning consortia—that indicates that the drug
needs to be funded. Thirdly, NICE states that the NHS constitution
gives a clear right for patients to have access to drugs recommended by
NICE. I mention that because I have some concerns that that right may
not be as strong as it should
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000194">&#160;</a>

on to about GPs’ very real concerns. I shall quote Dr Clare
Gerada from the Royal College of General Practitioners. In her
interview with <em>The </em>
                           <em>Guardian </em>on 10 November—I am
sure Ministers will remember it—she raised real concerns that
GPs
will<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“be
exposed to lobbying by patients, patient groups and the pharma
industry…At worst, the negative impact for GPs could be patients
lobbying outside their front door, saying, ‘You’ve got a
nice BMW car but you will not allow me to have this cytotoxic drug that
will give me three more months of life’”.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000501">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is a fair point.
She says that making GPs “the new rationers” could ruin
trust between doctors and patients. In another interview that she gave
to <em>Pulse </em>magazine on 15 November she praises NICE’s
role:<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000197">&#160;</a>

Gentleman will learn, either from his own constituents or from reading
the newspapers, that there are questions about whether very expensive
drugs should be made available. We must not forget that some GP
consortia may cover very few patients—we have had this debate
already. Just two or three patients with a need for very expensive
drugs could push them into debt, and they will have to grapple with
those issues. NICE provided some protection against that, but it could
be faced locally a great deal. I think that these concerns are of a
different order; they are very difficult, and I am concerned about how

pharmaceutical companies welcome what they think value-based pricing
might mean, but others have said something different. Richard Barker,
the director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry, says that value-based pricing should not be seen as some kind
of magic bullet. On its own, negotiating a new value-based price will
not necessarily improve access to new drugs and medicines. He is also
concerned about returning to a postcode pricing system as each
individual consortium will be free to make the decision about whether
they have those
drugs.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000200">&#160;</a>

example, NHS South Central has eight products on its priority list for
funding from the cancer drugs fund, compared with 24 on the list for
NHS North West. It is also using very different criteria to determine
whether those drugs should be put on the list. If that is not done
nationally there will be variations. In the cancer drugs fund, there
are significant variations in the numbers and the criteria used. If
that is already happening, what do we think is likely to happen when GP
commissioning consortia make those decisions? I am doing my best with
limited resources to establish why different criteria have been
developed in different regions, why different numbers of drugs are
included and how the different processes work. I hope that clear
evidence and analysis will be presented to the House before decisions
are made about the value-based pricing system. Clearly, there are many
variations, and I am concerned that they will
increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000203">&#160;</a>

impression is being created that GPs will be left to interpret NICE
guidance and get on with decision making in front of an individual
patient. From my reading of the Bill, I do not think that that is the
case. A GP will operate within the whole construct of a duty of quality
that surrounds him or her via the outcomes framework. GPs and their
commissioning groups must operate with a close regard to NICE advice
and guidance. That advice and guidance will be much more far-reaching
now that it goes beyond the evaluation of individual drugs. It will be
a whole outcomes framework by disease and the various other
interventions mentioned in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000204">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> GPs must still decide whether to spend
£80,000 on a drug for the patient in front of them. It does not
change the difficulty of the decision. Nobody knows how the new
value-based pricing system will work. The consultation has just closed.
The new system is supposed to consider not only whether an individual
will benefit clinically from the drug but whether wider society will
benefit and whether the drug, technology or treatment fulfils unmet
need. Those are broad and nebulous concepts that have not yet been
pinned down. We are not sure how all of it will work, pharmaceutical
companies are not sure how it will work and NICE is not sure how it

drug companies will not suddenly and miraculously start making
complicated gene-based drugs cheaper as a result. GPs, not NICE, will
have to make the decisions. I freely admit that when NICE has made
decisions, not all PCTs have taken them up, but that is about money,

                        <p class="tabbed">In conclusion,
I would like the Minister to answer some questions in his response.
First, it seems to me that NICE has two roles. One involves producing
quality standards, which we know will cover not only the NHS and public
health but, for the first time, social care. That could cover a huge
range of different treatments and services, and will involve consulting
many more organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">NICE’s
second function will relate to the value-based pricing system. It will
at least assess drugs under the system, and will possibly help to
develop the system in the first place. As I said, that will be a
complicated process—even more complex than NICE’s current
focus on quality-adjusted life years. We must remember that
NICE’s funding is being cut by 30%. That relates to the point
made by the hon. Member for Southport about mission creep. NICE has a
huge number of jobs and tasks to do. I am sure that it would never let
its standards slip, as it holds those standards dear, but it has a big
and complicated
task.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000208">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady mentioned a postcode lottery. I may
have misunderstood the legislation, but one benefit of NICE rules is
that no PCT at the moment can refuse to deliver a treatment that NICE
recommends. There is a possibility of that happening with the Bill,
because if we change the function of NICE there will not be approved
standards in the same sense. That must produce a more uneven picture in
terms of health outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000209">&#160;</a>

amendments on that. The requirement on health and social care bodies to

(1)(a) mentions “benefits and costs” in the general NICE
duties. I would like the Minister’s reassurance that
cost-benefit analysis will not be the only method used. Given the
reduction in resources to NICE and, obviously, the breadth of work that
has been added to it, as my hon. Friend mentioned, there might be a
tendency to use quicker, less engaging processes. One of the real
exceptions to how NICE undertakes its work is the quality and
robustness of the range of evidence that it uses. As has been
mentioned, it is well respected across international health
systems.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000212">&#160;</a>

know how seductive numbers are and, over the past few years, there has
been a tendency to try to look at and pin down evidence in quantitative
form. I think that is a weakness. There are benefits to including
social care in NICE’s remit, but there is a caveat in that it
must use a broad range of methodologies to determine the effectiveness
of different interventions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000213">&#160;</a>

in this clause and the other clauses that relate 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1175<a class="bkMark" name="Column1175">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to NICE there is a dearth of detail about what NICE will do. The clause
repeatedly stipulates that most things will be sorted out in
regulations. <em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> The Minister shakes
his head and looks exasperated, but I do not see how he could demur
from that conclusion, because it says repeatedly in this clause and
others that matters will be in the regulations. I do not think that it
is illegitimate for the clauses to say that, because clearly
NICE’s role is changing quite significantly. The reason for that
change is the introduction of value-based pricing. We have a
consultation on that, and it is entirely proper that the Government
consider what comes out of the value-based pricing proposals before
they determine how the final function and form of NICE will
look.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
assumption in the value-based pricing proposals is very significant for
NICE, because it will shift from being a body that provides independent
advice to the NHS at arm’s length from the pharmaceutical
companies on the nature and cost efficacy of a given medicine to being
a price-setting body. That is the big change in play under value-based
pricing. NICE will effectively be determining what it thinks the price
ought to be for a medicine in this country, as opposed to the current
situation, whereby a company sets the price and NICE suggests whether
it is value for money, and therefore whether the NHS ought to pay it.
That change raises many questions, which are relevant to the clause,
about the general
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
NICE has not previously done that sort of job. It has done the analysis
to determine whether it thinks  a medicine is cost-effective;
it has certainly not then set a price. That is a very different skill
set from the roles that NICE currently has. It has not engaged in price
negotiation with the companies, which we assume, because it is not
clear in the Bill, will be the next step. So, will the Minister clarify
whether the value-based pricing system works? If NICE determines what
it thinks the price ought to be, will it go on to negotiate the price
or will the Department of Health do that? If it is NICE, is the
Minister confident that it will both have the skills and be able to do
that additional significant piece of work with a 30% cut to its budget?
If it is the Department of Health, which bit of the Department will do
it, because it has previously never done that,
either?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second point, far more importantly, is about the PCTs and the crucial
role that they have played in the NICE process. The issue is twofold
and it speaks in some respects to some of the matters that the hon.
Member for Southport raised. One is that, under the current system, it
is the PCTs that effectively, through their pharmaceutical committees,
make decisions on medicines that are not NICE-approved, for which there
is no guidance, and they make the decision as to whether that medicine
is going to be made available to local patients.

                        <p class="tabbed">PCTs
that are being abolished are clearly playing an important role in
determining which medicines that were not NICE-approved would be funded
and therefore that local GPs could prescribe. The second crucial role
that they increasingly provided on behalf of the NHS was engaging in
the single technology assessment and multiple technology assessments,
offering advice and guidance to NICE on clinical practice, either in
trials or post-licensing of medicines being used in the NHS. There is a
question about who in the NHS will in future be able to provide that
guidance to NICE, because PCTs have built up that expertise and it has
effectively been managers and clinicians with managerial responsibility
in PCTs who have done it. In the new system it may be that somebody is
designated with that task in GP consortia, but that is not clear in the
Bill and therefore I think that that is an open
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third question, which comes on to the substance of the comments made by
the hon. Member for Southport, concerns whether the legislation makes
it clear that the current process whereby the NHS is mandated to
provide funding for NICE-approved medicines within three months of
their launch will continue. That is the current mechanism that we have
to drive from the centre the take-up of cost-effective, innovative
medicines. It is not clear whether the Bill will continue the status
quo. It says that it may do that under regulations, but I would be
grateful if the Minister clarified whether that will continue. If it
does not continue, presumably there is a risk that the postcode lottery
will expand.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Even if the
status quo does continue in respect of medicines that are not
NICE-approved and where therefore there is local decision making, there
is still an obvious risk that, in a more disaggregated, more autonomous
NHS, there will be more postcode prescription, or more divergence in
decisions. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West made that point
in respect of the cancer drugs fund. That is the evidence that we need
to suggest that that might be a danger under the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the status quo does apply and subsequently the regulations state that
funding is mandatory—it will be provided by GP consortia in
future, I presume—how do we square that with competition law?
Will there not be problems whereby providers of alternative medicines
feel that they ought to have been given a different crack of the whip
when NICE made the assessment of their medicine versus another
medicine? Some clinicians may feel that NICE has made the wrong
decision. It opens up NICE decisions to judicial review under
competition law and other
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final and most important point is about Wales. Wales is not mentioned
in this part of the Bill. Scotland has a different system—it has
the Scottish Medicines Consortium—for assessing medicines, and
Wales has the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. The reality, however,
is that the AWSMG is a much less well-resourced and much smaller body,
which is unable to provide the enormously powerful service that NICE
does in assessing all medicines. If NICE guidance does not have a
mandatory effect across the board, or if there is less NICE guidance,

			Column number: 1177<a class="bkMark" name="Column1177">&#160;</a>
                           </div>because it is tied up with price negotiation, the AWSMG will have to
pick up the tab and try to do that role for Wales. I will be interested

what we would call traditional drugs that have long-term benefits? The
vast majority of drug development is going towards new genetic and
biotechnology-based drugs. One of the problems with traditional drugs
is that they are the same for everybody. The genetically based, biotech
drugs can help individuals to benefit, because of their genetic
predisposition. That is the whole thrust of drug policy. For many of
those drugs, the benefits may not be seen for many years, because they
will be trying to prevent genetic predispositions from coming
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000229">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady makes a good point, and those drugs,
along with drugs targeted at ageing, are precisely the kind that I had
in mind. Indeed, there was a good initiative under the previous
Government on the financing of vaccines internationally, whereby money
was effectively provided for vaccinations up front, so that children
would be protected from the ravages of disease, and they would gain
throughout their whole life. The cost of that was borne not in one
year, but over
several.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000230">&#160;</a>

context, including assessing the incremental therapeutic benefits of
new medicines. We will implement our plans for value-based drug prices
in 2014. I want to say more about that, so I shall take no

arrangements to be put in place from 2014 will ensure that NHS patients
have consistent access to effective medicines wherever in England they
live. That is one of our key objectives in designing the new
value-based pricing system. We are considering further what specific

comments on the consultation that the hon. Member for Leicester West
shared with the Committee gave the impression that the Government had
set up an Aunt Sally in the value-based pricing system, and that the
comments were about specific proposals. Of course, the consultation
made a big contribution to the early stages of an ongoing design
process. We would expect that process to continue to engage with the
stakeholders, many of whom have already contributed their questions,
their concerns and their suggestions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000236">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
makes no specific provision for value-based pricing, not least because
the policy detail is still under development following the recent
consultation. If it appears that further legislation is required to
implement the final arrangements for value-based pricing before 2014,
we will have to consider the matter separately. That should not be
taken to mean that we believe that it will be necessary; it simply
means that we need to keep the option open, and that I am being as
straightforward with the Committee as possible at this stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000237">&#160;</a>

subject that was touched upon by several hon. Members. General concern
was expressed about whether it was appropriate and how it could be
stopped. It is worth noting that reference was made to an inadequacy of
detail about NICE in the Bill. We ought to consider the relevant pages
of past legislation to see what detail they gave about NICE. For the
benefit of the Committee, I am holding up some pages that make clear
how much detail was included in previous legislation. That demonstrates
that there is a difference in the level of detail: we have provided
considerable detail in a number of the clauses that we shall be

                        <p class="tabbed">It means that
the underpinning legislation is now open to far greater parliamentary
scrutiny. NICE’s scope was increased to cover public health in
2005, but that would now require a change to primary legislation. My
hon. Friend the Member for Southport seeks the opportunity for Members
to scrutinise and to ask whether an extension of the remit is
appropriate. He did that during his remarks. We have placed all that
detail in the Bill for the first time, which means that further primary
legislation would be required to make other changes to the
remit.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I welcome the
comments of the hon. Member for Leicester West on the social care remit
extension. The change has been widely welcomed by the social care
sector and beyond. We have had a running theme during our consideration
of these clauses on the necessity of greater integration and
collaboration across health and social care. That was very much the
thinking that drove us to the conclusion that the remit should be
extended in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West also asked about clause 217(1)(a), and
whether there was a risk that it could lead to a narrowing of the types
of tools used to assess costs and benefits. Again, that is a perfectly
fair question, and I assure her that, no, that is not the intention of
the wording in the clause. We intend to ensure that a wide range of
tools is used. In respect of the social care remit in particular, there
is much discussion with the sector about how we draw on various
expertise, particularly with regard to quality
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000246">&#160;</a>

guidance on how a drug can

the question about how value-based pricing will operate and whether it
will operate at a local or a national level, that is another area in
which misconceptions and misunderstandings have run wild. We did not
state that in the recent consultation. We are considering the responses

have not said specifically whether it will be local or national. We
have asked questions and are in the early stages of design.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our priority,
as I said, is to give NHS patients better access to effective and
innovative medicines. We intend to do so by reforming how companies are
paid for NHS medicines and moving to a system of value-based pricing
when the current pharmaceutical price regulation scheme expires at the
end of 2013. The current system of drug pricing has provided stability
over time, but it does not promote innovation or access to the extent
that we are seeking. We need a much closer link between the price that
the NHS pays for medicine and the value that it delivers.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000268">&#160;</a>

about other aspects, we want the arrangements to be in place from 2014
to ensure that NHS patients have consistent access to effective
medicines. We are considering further specific arrangements that should
be in place from 2014. That is the purpose of the
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000269">&#160;</a>

been asked whether NICE will have a role in price setting. NICE will
have an important role in any new system; that is the clear,
unequivocal point. However, we have only recently finished the
consultation, and the detail of how value-based pricing will operate is
still being considered and worked through. We will continue to hold
discussions with NICE, the industry and other interested parties as we
take forward the design of the new system.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000270">&#160;</a>

together health and social care services within NICE’s remit.
Hon. Members will know that NICE has already begun to do that through
some of its existing quality standards. It has looked at public health,
health care and social care, and at how all the different bits of the
system need to work 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1183<a class="bkMark" name="Column1183">&#160;</a>
                           </div>together. It has produced some excellent quality standards. One that I

that needs to be done to tackle that problem, which is very
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to clarify whether NICE’s remit on social care
will include children’s as well as adult social care. The
explanatory notes to the Bill suggest that its remit will cover both
areas, because it refers to the Secretary of State’s being able
to commission quality standards alongside the Secretary of State for
Education. However, NICE has certainly raised with me the issue of
whether children’s social care will come within its
remit.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to ask about a point raised in a previous debate by the Minister,
who said that discussions are going on with relevant bodies. What
discussions has he had with local authorities or the Local Government
Association about the new role for NICE in its covering quality
standards and social care as well as health? Will local councils be
required to implement NICE quality standards? Have the Government
conducted an impact assessment on the implications of that for council
budgets?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me give an example. I am pretty sure that if NICE had a quality
standard for the various aspects of adult social care, it would say
that the best quality care would seek to prevent adults, and older
people in particular, from having deteriorating health. That might
require some social care support—perhaps visits from supporters
and carers. We know that many councils are raising the threshold for
the support that they provide because of funding
squeezes.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Councils
are facing substantial cuts to their budgets because of the
Government’s determination to eliminate the deficit within four
years—they are facing 26% or 27% cuts, which are being
frontloaded. As I am sure hon. Members are aware, many councils are
raising their thresholds for support. So it is important to be clear
whether the Minister has conducted any kind of impact assessment
relating to the effect on council budgets. Has the Minister had any
discussions with Ofsted about the issue? If NICE is setting quality
standards for children’s social care, will Ofsted be required to
inspect services and councils to ensure that they are delivering and
implementing those quality
standards?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other point that I want to raise is about the Social Care Institute for
Excellence. Hon. Members know that NICE was initially set up for the
health service and SCIE was set up for social care. Now that NICE is
taking on the function of setting out the highest possible quality
standards, will SCIE continue? Or will it instead be brought into NICE?
Will NICE commission its quality standards from SCIE? Will the quality
standards have the same rigour as those developed by NICE? I know it
does some excellent work, but I would appreciate the Minister’s
answers to all those questions. I am sure that hon. Members will have
other questions,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000286">&#160;</a>

difference between the two sides of the Committee on the issue, but the

in relation to NICE, which is set out in clause 217(3), already covers
adults’ and children’s social care services. Furthermore,
not making a distinction between the two enables NICE to consider
issues relevant to the transition from childhood through adolescence
and into adulthood. That is an area of public policy that has much
scope for improvement in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000287">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady also referred to the funding pressures on local authorities.
I draw the Committee’s attention to the work recently published
by the King’s Fund, which looked at the social care funding
challenge. The King’s Fund made two conclusions. The funding gap
by 2014 will be £1 billion, but—this is an important
“but”—that funding gap arises only if one does not
take into account the efficiency savings within local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once
efficiencies are taken into account, the King’s Fund concluded
that there will be no funding gap on the basis of the resource
decisions made specifically and explicitly in support of social care,
both through the funding that the Department of Health is making
available via the NHS to social services departments and the funding
that has gone into the formula grant and will continue to go into the
formula grant during the spending review period. Local authorities are
making choices, and they are making different choices about the
services that they are choosing to protect, but it is not true that the
Government have not provided a settlement to support social care, if
that is what local authorities choose to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about discussions with the LGA. In the end, that is a
matter for NICE. I have had discussions about the principles of the
Bill, particularly this opportunity to drive more integration. I have
spoken to colleagues at the LGA, and they have indicated their support
of the broad direction of travel.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
detail of how NICE takes forward its remit is clearly not a matter for
Ministers; it is for NICE to have those discussions. It will also
continue to have close working relationships with SCIE, which does some
very important work, as the hon. Lady rightly says, and will continue
to have a role to play beyond its current work producing standards and
guidance. I suspect that it will continue to have a very close working
relationship with NICE. On the issue of the future, the Department of
Health currently funds SCIE and is working closely with
NICE.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West also asked about Ofsted and inspections.
I want to make it absolutely clear that, as will be the case with the
Care Quality Commission—I say that so the question does not get
asked in a moment—Ofsted will not be bound to inspect against
quality standards. Local authorities will not have a specific statutory
duty in respect of quality standards, and nor will consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In respect of
the NHS, the NHS commissioning board will produce commissioning
guidance based on the quality standards, but it will be a matter for
local authorities to make decisions about the social care services that
they commission as independent, locally elected bodies. For the first
time we will bring together, in a clear, creditable and accredited way,
a set of standards that have been put together by the profession and
the sector and which can be drawn on by commissioners as they
commission social care services. I hope that that has answered the hon.
Lady’s questions. The amendment is unnecessary, and I hope that
she will withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000293">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That sounded slightly different from the
Minister’s original reply. I am not sure that local councils
across the land are aware that NICE will set the quality standards for
social care, so I strongly urge the Minister and other hon. Members to
have that discussion. I know that my local council has been very
focused on the new health and well-being boards and what public health
money will come over, but there is no point in having a quality
standard that joins up health and social care if neither party is
committed or able to implement it. More detailed discussion is needed.
If the Minister has had specific discussions on that subject, I am
pleased to hear it, but I urge other hon. Members to engage in such
discussions, because I am not sure that a huge number of councils are

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are designed to strengthen the
requirements on NICE to consult and involve the public, health and
social care professionals and all relevant bodies both when it draws up
and when it revises its guidance. Existing legislation does not provide
a strong or broad enough outline of how NICE should involve and consult
various bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 667
would require NICE not only to consult the public, but to involve them
in decisions. I want to say a little about NICE’s citizens
council, which I hope will continue in NICE’s new role. There is
no mention of it in previous legislation and there is none in the Bill,
but I want to say something about why I think the citizens council
plays such an important role. I use it as an example to show what we
mean by not just consulting and asking the public, but genuinely
involving them in decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
may be aware that the citizens council was set up in 2002 to ensure
that NICE hears not only from patients, patient groups and their
carers, but from ordinary members of the public who fund the NHS. An
extremely innovative body, it comprises 30 ordinary members of the
public who are broadly representative of the UK as a whole. The council
meets twice a year for three days at a time, when it takes evidence and
seeks to come to decisions and make recommendations on often very
challenging matters. For example, the council has looked at the
definition of quality adjusted life years, which encompasses not only
the extra years a patient would get from taking a particular drug, but
how healthy the patient would be and how free from disability, and the
severity of illness that remains. The council has also looked at the
circumstances in which NICE should recommend interventions where the
cost per QALY is above the stated £20,000 to £30,000 per
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am a long-standing and passionate supporter of involving the public in
more meaningful ways. I was involved in the first citizens juries
established in this country, and the citizens council came out of that
work, which is about saying that the public, given enough time and
information, can make serious and difficult judgments. The amendment
aims to ensure that NICE not only asks patients and patient groups what
they think, but genuinely involves the public in very difficult
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
668 would require NICE to consult and involve not only the public, but
health and social care professionals, as appropriate. The reason why is
obvious: NICE needs to consult a range of professionals in producing
its guidelines. I am sure that it would probably do that anyway, but
the amendment would make that
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
669 would replace the duty of NICE to
consult<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000314">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“such

appropriate”<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000505">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>with
the duty to consult “all relevant persons”. Again, it
seeks to strengthen the requirement on NICE. As NICE said in its
response to the consultation on value-based pricing, it needs to
consult patients, providers, manufacturers and commissioners. The
amendment would put that requirement for broad consultation in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 664 would add a requirement for NICE to consult all those
groups and bodies not only when it is preparing guidance, but when it
is revising it.

                        <p class="tabbed">NICE’S
reputation rests in large part on the open and transparent processes
that it adopts in developing its products. That is a key part of what
people appreciate about how it operates. In its current form, NICE
actively promotes the involvement of patients, carers and the public in
its work through its patient and public involvement programme. The hon.
Lady has described the work that the citizens council does. Whether
that continues is up to NICE; the only thing that will change under the
Bill is that NICE moves from being a creature of the Secretary of State
as a special health authority to being a creature of statute, thus
protected by the fact that it will require parliamentary scrutiny to
change in the future. It will not change the key personalities and
people involved in that organisation, so it is highly unlikely that its
change in status will suddenly make it reconsider the things that it
thinks are working well now. If NICE thinks that citizens councils are
working well now, nothing in the Bill will change its ability to
continue to run that operation in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000325">&#160;</a>

work load doubles and it has a 30% reduction in the budget. I do not

                           </strong> Let me come to the substantive point, which is
that, in our view, the resources we are providing to NICE will allow it
to develop its new role over the next few years and continue to do the
valuable work that it does now. That is the judgment that we have made
based on the resource envelope that we have provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Earlier,
references were made to NICE expressing concern about the drafting of a
particular clause. Although it is very helpful to have that feedback
via the hon. Member for Leicester West, NICE can pick up the phone and
speak to the Department directly, and does so regularly. We have a
good, healthy working relationship with NICE.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I draw
attention to the work done to date on developing the published quality
standards. There is a wide range of publication partners drawn from a
broad spectrum of stakeholders, including clinical and patient,
professional and lay, and managers and front-line staff. Because we are
putting NICE on to a statutory footing for the first time and moving
away from the special health authority approach, we do not want
anything that NICE does in the future to detract from its excellent
track record, and we have reinforced that point in the Bill. NICE will
have a specific requirement to consult the public in preparing quality
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Rather than
improving or increasing the level of public involvement, I fear that
the amendments would merely burden NICE with additional tasks that add
uncertainty and little value to the extensive engagement that the hon.
Lady partly described and that is part of the way that NICE operates.
NICE’s open and transparent approach means that when a review of
quality standards proposes significant changes, consultation will be an
expected part of the process. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady,
and I urge her to withdraw the amendment. If she feels that she cannot,
I urge my colleagues to resist it.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000332">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that facing a 30% budget cut will mean
that NICE has to look very seriously at what it does. NICE does not
know what role it will have under value-based pricing, because the
Minister is still chewing over—sorry, considering—the
responses to the consultation. If NICE is required in statute to set
those quality standards, whatever role it has, I am worried that among
the first things to go will be bodies such as the citizens council,
because it costs money and takes time to genuinely involve and engage
members of the public. I personally believe that the council represents
money well spent.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000333">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a couple of questions for the Minister
about clause 218. We were told during our first sitting that 150
quality standards would be produced within five years and that NICE now
has about three or five ready to publish. That looks like a very
difficult task against the backdrop of the 30% cut in budget, but I
have no doubt that we have debate another day.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000342">&#160;</a>

importantly, I want to ask the Minister how he thinks quality standards
will affect health care delivery in this country. In that first

likely effect of that be? NICE, as an organisation, has been issuing
both statutory and non-statutory mechanisms for a number of years now;
sadly, however, even when NICE has recommended good practice it has
been up to PCTs how to interpret that, or not interpret it as the case
may be. It has always been difficult for NICE to spread best practice
throughout the NHS. It seems to me that “quality
standards” are about doing exactly that, and that was what Sir
David Nicholson was referring to in his evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000345">&#160;</a>

in the Bill? I will not go into any great

competition law into the national health care system will result in
lawyers interpreting whether or not local commissioners have ensured
that they commission on the basis of the quality standard for their
area. That is my question to the Minister: what are the implications of
putting that in the Bill, given the great changes accompanying the
introduction of competition? Will the quality standard be the one thing
that people will look at to see whether commissioners are doing the
right thing or not?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000347">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We were
told—I assume that it is in this clause but I cannot pick it
out—is that NICE will also lay down quality standards for
providers, both public sector and independent. Those providers would
have to look at the quality standards when providing a service. That
might be a good thing, but something is absent from clause
218 or any other. First, competition was going to be based on price.
Then we were told that it would be based on quality. Nowhere in any
evidence or on the face of the Bill does it say that Monitor will have
to consider the quality standards, although we are led to believe that
it will be the one organisation that will ensure quality throughout the
national health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000348">&#160;</a>

great absence, if that is the case. I know that it was a late
conversion for Monitor to consider competition based on quality rather
than price. I suspect that we will debate that further in the House
during the next few months, but I would like to know why Monitor is
absent. Am I just misreading the clause? Will Monitor be given the
quality standards to ensure that when it comes to competition policy,
everybody will meet the quality standards laid down by

of the work that NICE will be required to undertake using the existing
robust mechanisms, tools and procedures, but with fewer resources. In
addition, clause 218(10)(b) relates to quality standards for the
provision of public health. I would like to understand the scope of the
services covered. It would be incredibly regressive to consider only
services such as smoking cessation and other lifestyle-related
interventions. Currently, NICE undertakes effectiveness reviews of a
range of different public services. If anything, given the new approach
to public health and health inequalities set out in the Bill, that
range should expand, not contract.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000350">&#160;</a>

Health England? There is no reference to that and it is very unclear
how that will work in practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley asked about the general
strategy for improving quality and how NICE works with other bits of
the system. I want to highlight two issues and ask the Minister to
provide a response. The NHS commissioning board is obviously setting
the outcomes that the service is supposed to achieve. I assume that the
NICE quality standards will demonstrate how those outcomes will end up
being delivered, because there is little point in setting an outcome if
there are no means by which it can be achieved. I
understand—perhaps the Minister can clarify this—that
discussions are going on with NICE about whether it will have a role in
determining what a reasonable outcome is. We might have an outcome of
everyone living perfect, happy lives, but there would be no point in
that. We have to know that the outcome we are setting as an objective
can be achieved. Will NICE have a role in determining the NHS
commissioning board’s
outcomes?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000357">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">How
will NICE work with Monitor? As the Minister will know, Labour Members
do not have great faith that Monitor will improve quality for patients
and the public across England. As far as I can see—I may be
wrong—there is no reference to how NICE will work with Monitor
in doing that. For example, will Monitor be required to take
NICE’s quality standards into consideration when making its
recommendations on promoting competition? Clause 221 states that
regulations may require specified health bodies to take into
consideration NICE’s quality standards. Does that include
Monitor? Why was there nothing in the provisions on Monitor’s
role about its working with NICE? If the Minister explains that and
provides some clarity on it, I am sure that others will be overjoyed as
I.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000358">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall try to spread some joy in the answers I
give to the Committee. Let me start with the point about competition.
It is important to remind the Committee again that the clauses on
Monitor make it clear that Monitor’s principal role is to
protect and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1192<a class="bkMark" name="Column1192">&#160;</a>
                           </div>promote the interests of patients. The Bill goes on to indicate the ways
in which it might do that. Those are the means; the purpose is very
clear. All too often, we skate over its purpose and move immediately on
to various concerns—often unreal and that will not be
realised—rehearsed by Opposition Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Rother Valley asked about the requirements to implement
quality standards. Under their duty to promote quality, the Secretary
of State and the NHS commissioning board will have to have regard to
quality standards in undertaking their functions. The Committee has
already discussed in some detail the meaning of “have regard
to”, but it is worth saying that the term is not meaningless;
indeed, it has a very specific set of legal meanings. We are not
talking about a tick-box exercise; there is a rigorous process of
considering the matter that has to be had regard to. The courts have
said that that duty must be exercised with real rigour and an open
mind. The commissioning consortia must have regard to the guidance
produced by the NHS commissioning board, which will draw on the quality
standards in developing its
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the pipeline of quality standards.
Five have already been published, another 10 are in production and a
further 31 have been commissioned by the National Quality Board. That
demonstrates quite good and purposeful progress towards ensuring that
we have the full suite. Part of the NICE’s work is to draw upon
its pre-existing base of quality work on guidance and
guidelines.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On whether
Monitor has to follow the quality standards, the standards are
implemented through the commissioning system, not through the board and
consortia. Monitor must have regard to the desirability of securing
quality improvement. That is covered in clause 54, which usefully
addresses the hon. Lady’s question as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On quality
standards and public health, the scope will be as broad as the
Secretary of State or the board requests. NICE will not have to make a
distinction between health, social care and public health. That will
enable a much more integrated approach of the sort that hon. Members
have raised concerns about, which the Bill drives forward
significantly.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Rother Valley expressed concern about subsection
(5)(a), and how we interpret “endorse”. There is a
misunderstanding of what that is about, which is partly answered by
subsection (10), which talks about the relevant commissioner. It means
the commissioner of the quality standard, which in this case might be
the board or the Secretary of State. The commissioner will have to
confirm that it is content for the standard to be published. Subsection
(5) refers not to the commissioning activity within the NHS, but to the
commissioning of the standard, and in that sense it has nothing to do
with competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000364">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An
overarching concern articulated in several of our debates today is the
level of resource that is available to NICE, and the suggestion that
there is to be a 30% cut. Let me make it clear that we have not
announced a 30% cut for NICE. That is speculation that has developed in
the Committee over the past few hours. The planning assumption for NICE
is a 10% to 11% reduction for 2011-12, which is consistent with other
arm’s length bodies. The 30% figure refers to the arm’s
length body sector as a whole. I hope that that reassures hon. Members
that much more resource will be available to 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>NICE than has been suggested. I am sure that the joy that the hon.
Member for Leicester West sought has now been
disbursed.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000365">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not overjoyed. I do not understand how the
Minister can suggest that an 11% cut this year will give NICE more
money than it thought it would have. On the origin of the 30% figure,
it is hardly surprising when the Government have said that arm’s
length bodies will face a 30% cut. In the first year NICE is facing an
11% cut, and there are two or three more years ahead of the spending
review period, so it is not unlikely that it would face such a cut. It
is important to have that on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
did not answer my questions about whether the directions that were
issued in 2005 remain in force for NICE or whether the Bill supersedes
them. The directions set out a detailed approach to what the Opposition
consider to be public health, which is acting on a societal level as
well as on community and individual levels.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000367">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I suspect the hon. Lady is about to ask about the
relationship with Public Health England, as well. The answer is that
Public Health England is part of the Department of State functions; the
Department is accountable to the Secretary of State. We have discussed
that already. The relationship will therefore be the same as any
relationship that NICE has with the Department of Health. Regarding the
2005 directions—I wish I could read the handwriting on my note,
which comes as a big shock as my own handwriting is very bad—the
Bill provides for the re-establishment of NICE with the functions that
are specified in the Bill. I will make sure that there is more clarity
about the directions, but our intention is that we do not lose anything
that is necessary during the transition from special health authority
to statutory
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000368">&#160;</a>

be required to implement the NICE guidance. That was one of the key
issues raised. Clause 221(8) states that the regulations
“may” make provision to require health and social care

“may” make provision for bodies to comply with NICE
recommendations. As the Minister will be aware, I do not want a debate
about “have regard to.” This debate is about the wording
that states that regulations “may” require specified
health or social care bodies to have regard to guidance and comply with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000374">&#160;</a>

would change the wording to state that the regulations
“will” make provision to require bodies to comply with
the NICE guidance. It is a small change, but it would have a big
impact. Labour Members are concerned that there could be a watering
down of the rights of patients and the clear requirement on
commissioning bodies to comply with the NICE guidance. That could have
a knock-on effect that would undermine the right of patients, as set
out in the NHS constitution, which

if the Minister could provide any clarifications, that would help the

have the changes to NICE and where value-based pricing applies. I
anticipate the Minister saying that we do not know exactly how
value-based pricing is going to work, and therefore he cannot address
that point, but I will ask him to delve into those realms to some
extent. The point is relevant because in a world with value-based
pricing, however it works, there is a crucial question about the
connection between NICE’s guidance, price setting and the GP
consortia. The Minister needs to address that issue and offer some
clarity in relation to the issue touched on in subsection (8) about the
mandatory funding, or otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000377">&#160;</a>

                           </div>on that speaks volumes about how it is very unclear at the moment how
value-based pricing will work and how it will relate to NICE’s
job and GPs’ decisions to fund medicines. That takes us to a
second hypothetical but entirely relevant
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000381">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us remember what happens now. If NICE reviews a medicine and deems it
cost-effective, it is mandatory for the NHS to fund it, and,
effectively, PCTs have to provide funding. The Minister implied in an
earlier answer that that will still pertain under the new system and
that certain types of medicine—the ones that NICE accepts are
value for money or for which the company agrees to the price point set
by NICE, I presume—will be mandatorily funded. However, I asked
him to reflect on what happens now when a medicine is not approved by
NICE and is still, as the Minister mentioned, put on the market in the
UK. That is where PCTs come in and, either through exceptional case
funding or through the pharmaceutical committees in the PCT, make
local, ad-hoc decisions on whether to fund a patient in their locale to
receive that medicine. That situation will not go
away.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
a company chooses not to agree to the price point set by NICE and
releases the medicine to the market anyway, somebody in the system at a
local level will decide whether to make that medicine available. In the
new system, I assume that will be the GP consortia. That leads me to
the specific question: does the Minister imagine that, under the terms
of the Bill, GP consortia will have similar methods, through
pharmaceutical committees of their own, of making those decisions? Will
the consortia apply things such as the exceptional case funding
mechanisms with which we are familiar? If that is the case, is he
convinced that they will have the relevant expertise? Given that they
will be doing a hell of a lot under this new system as far as I can
see, will they have the time? Is there not a risk that some will do it
well and some will do it badly, so it will be less uniform than the
system now and the postcode lottery will be
expanded?<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000383">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand the amendment would change the wording
from “may” to “will”. Clearly,
“will” is more prescriptive. My point relates to the
remarks that were made on mission creep. Where all NICE is recommending
is that a particular drug be made available, I think that Ministers can
reasonably gauge the effect of requiring any specified health body to
make it available. It is different where NICE is doing something more
complex, such as laying out a pathway of care. I was looking at the
pathway of care quality standards for strokes recently, and Members can
look at it themselves if they so wish. A complex chain is expected to
be in place with regard to how things are dealt with in the first
phase, in the acute setting and after the stroke patient has been seen
to, and with regard to how recovery is aided. Regulations to require
people to implement that will be a very tough judgment call for a
Minister to make to some extent, because he must be assured that all
organisations are capable of implementing it. That takes us back in a
sense to the debate about “have regard to”. If Ministers
are simply asking various commissioning bodies to take it on board that
that is where they should be heading and that that is the sort of thing
they should be looking to prescribe, that is
fine.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000384">&#160;</a>

is that, if we are asking people to have regard to guidance and the
guidance is “supply a drug” we know what we are asking
for and we know the system’s capacity to deliver it, subject to
funding and so on. Quality standards in stroke care are an ideal, which
is replicated in only part of the country. To replicate them right

but it is important to make it absolutely clear where we are with
regard to the NHS constitution right to NICE-recommended drugs. The
Government fully recognise the importance of consistent access to
clinical and cost-effective treatments. Subject to the successful
passage of this Bill, we intend to use the regulation-making power in
this clause to replicate the effects of the existing funding
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000389">&#160;</a>

term, primary care trusts would therefore be required to make funding
available for drugs that NICE has recommended in its technology

intervention from the hon. Member for Easington who suggested that NICE
directs. NICE does not direct. It produces technology appraisals on a
whole range of other products. It does not have the power to direct the
NHS to do anything. That power sits with the Secretary of State under
the current arrangements. What we are saying is that through the
regulation-making power that this clause will provide, we intend to
give effect in exactly the same way as now with regards to technology
appraisals and ensuring that consortia and PCTs fund on that
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000390">&#160;</a>

when NICE no longer does its value-for-money assessments and gives its

mandatory and said that certain drugs will be mandatory. Does that

be so graded—it will have to be provided by a PCT if the
consultant or the GP thinks that a patient should get

therefore be required to make funding available for drugs that NICE has
recommended in its technology appraisals. We will replicate the funding
direction that currently exists that gives effect to

constitution right to NICE-recommended drugs. That is what we will

hon. Friend went on to explore how other guidance that is produced
around care pathways might be interpreted. They are not subject to
quite the same set of directions as applies to technology appraisals. I
will also say that, when it comes to quality standards, which we have
discussed at some length today, the NHS commissioning board will have
to have regard to them. That is not a duty that can be lightly
dismissed. It is an important one in terms of the law. The
commissioning board will use that in producing its commissioning
guidance for consortia, which in turn have to take that into account by
having regard to it. It is not just a tick-box
exercise.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000393">&#160;</a>

Minister has offered. It is now clear that the mandatory funding comes
with the direction from the Secretary of State. Effectively, just as
PCTs are obligated to fund NICE-approved medicines, GP consortia will
be obligated in the same way. My question is therefore who will do the
budgetary planning in this new system in advance of anticipated
approval or otherwise by NICE of new medicines? That is currently an
extraordinarily difficult, time-consuming and expensive process,
undertaken by budgetary controllers in PCTs, who look ahead in
collaboration with NICE and plan. Who will do that in the

want to return to the amendment, and say something about the impact it
would have, were it to be passed by the Committee. It would mean that
regulations made under any regulation-making power in this clause would
have to make provision under subsection (8). That is unnecessarily
bureaucratic. Subsection (8), as it is currently framed, allows such
regulations to be made where they serve a policy purpose. To be
required to make regulations, which may simply state that there is no
specific requirement for compliance, would introduce unnecessary
complication. That would be the consequence of the

questions on that. I will resist the temptation of fast-forwarding to
the conclusion, when we are paying due respect to the results of the

clauses in this part of the Bill sit together. There are specific
clauses earlier in the Bill that deal with the duties on consortia to
have regard to the commissioning guidance produced by the NHS
commissioning board and the duties on the NHS commissioning board to
have regard to the quality standards that are produced. There are no
ifs, buts or maybes. There is no additional regulation that has to be
issued to say that this one is okay and should be taken into account.
There is, however, the issue of the relevant commissioner of the
quality standard deciding whether it should be published. Having
commissioned it, they make that judgment at that point. There is
certainly no issue on a second-class form of quality standard, which
does not have the imprint of a regulation that says it should be taken
into account. They all have to be taken into account once they are
published.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000399">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are concerned that the clause does not set out
much detail of the appeals procedure. We all know that this is a
particularly significant aspect of the Bill in relation to NICE,
because NICE has so many important recommendations to make. Some of
those recommendations are controversial and some less so, but they can
all have a massive impact on treatment, drugs and services. It is
important, therefore, that we have a chance to discuss the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000437">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
there are only two lines of explanatory notes, and they basically say
what we already know from reading the Bill. That is a classic example
of there being no detail in the Bill on areas vital to our decision
making. It is all very well to say what we did and did not do, but the
fact is that the Government were told that they were rushing the Bill
and that many areas were not covered. This is another example of that
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000438">&#160;</a>

already discussed how NICE is expanding its role in social care. An

figure by anybody’s estimation. Yet the number of appeals that
may take place in relation not just to this current responsibility but
to social care may be more or less than under the current system. I
just do not know. It would be useful to get some detail about what the
process will
involve.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000442">&#160;</a>

is no mention of the process by which an appeal is to be heard, only
the persons by whom it is to be heard. We have no idea who that may be.
We also have no idea what Monitor’s role or influence will be
here. What will the national commissioning board’s role be here?
There is an awful lot that we do not know. The impact of NICE’s
recommendations is profound for many people yet we have no detail at
all. We come back to the old phrase that regulations “may make
provision” about appeals against the recommendations made by
NICE. Will that be by affirmative resolution by the House? I do not
know what the problem is. It is a reasonable question to ask about an
important matter. Does the Minister have any time scale in mind for
when the House will first get a chance to see the details here, and is
there anything else he can tell us that will enable us to consider the

                           </strong> The reason my face showed some surprise was that
the hon. Gentleman’s argument seems to rest on a desire for
detail. He is right that we should have as much detail as possible and
that is what we have tried to provide throughout the passage of the
Bill both in our responses to points made by hon. Members and in the
letters that we have provided. I find it odd that he is so interested
in detail when he refers to what happened in the past.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000444">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The detail
that was set out in the direction that currently gives effect to the
work of NICE on appeal arrangements runs to four lines. It
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000445">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

Secretary of State directs the Institute to make arrangements for
holding appeals, on the application of persons aggrieved by
recommendations made by the Institute under paragraph 2(l)(a), on the
grounds that the Institute has failed to act fairly, has exceeded its

justified.”<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000517">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is what it currently says. The clause therefore contains more detail
than the hon. Gentleman’s Government set out in their direction.
The difference between a direction and the proposals in the Bill is
that they are before a Committee of the House and can be amended and
debated. A direction cannot.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000446">&#160;</a>

we published a White Paper in July and a Command Paper in December, and

detail how the different parts of the NHS will relate to one another

hope that my colleagues will allow the clause to stand part of the
Bill. As NICE takes forward its work, it will build on existing
practices, and we see no particular reason for that to change. I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman’s questions will be

NICE does not charge for those, and there is no intention that it

company undertakes as part of the drug development. That is an entirely
optional service, which was introduced in response to demand from
pharmaceutical companies. It is widely accepted that it is reasonable
for NICE to charge those companies that decide to take advantage of the

provision for NICE to charge will be set out in regulations, which,
before the hon. Member for Halton asks, will be subject to the negative
procedure. That is a more robust process than the current arrangements,
which rely only on ministerial directions. Ministerial directions do
not even require the signature of a Minister, let alone any form of
parliamentary
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000464">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not understand why Opposition Members are so keen to remove
subsection (4), because it merely gives a definition of “health
care”. Elsewhere in this part there are definitions of
“social care” and “public health”. A
definition of “health care” is needed to give meaning to
the provisions in this clause. I note that the amendment proposes no
alternative definition, so I confess to being puzzled by its
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000465">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
believe that NICE, as re-established, should be able to continue to
provide advice of the kind I have set out. There is no justification
for the Department of Health or the NHS commissioning board meeting the
cost of advice provided by NICE to third parties, so to continue with
such work NICE needs to be able to charge for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000466">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment would address a potential
conflict of interest. If NICE was privately advising drug manufacturing
companies and separately making recommendations on their products, such
as whether purchasing them was in the public interest, surely that
would be a clear conflict of interest. Why do it? Why should the
Department not meet the

                           </strong> Let me deal first with the conflict of interest
allegation. There is no conflict of interest. The service does not
offer guidance on securing a positive recommendation. It ensures that
drug companies can consider the requirements of NICE’s appraisal
process at every stage of drug development and may design clinical
trials accordingly. It is comparable to the service offered by the
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to pharmaceutical
companies on seeking a market authorisation. So the hon. Gentleman is
trying to suggest something that is not the case, has never been the
case and certainly will not be the case when the Bill is
enacted.<a class="bkMark" name="11033018000468">&#160;</a>

on Report and elsewhere later during the Bill’s passage. We will
