David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): It is a pleasure to see you
back in charge of our proceedings, Mr. Pope. Hon. Members
will recall that I introduced the amendments on Thursday, albeit
briefly. I shall now move on to the
specifics.</div><a name="08070173000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 35 is a probing amendment to tease out the Government&#146;s
thinking on what an independent reviewing officer&#146;s independence
means and how they believe that the reviewing officer will be able to
do their job independent of the local authority that they are helping.
Independent reviewing officers are registered social workers; the local
authority for which they carry out their work may employ them or they
may be self-employed. In the context of the amendment, that work is
participating in the statutory reviews of looked-after children cases,
monitoring progress made in accordance with the child&#146;s care
plan and reporting their concerns to the Children and Family Court
Advisory and Support
Service.</div><a name="08070173000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
11 alters those duties by adding more responsibilities. First, each
child will know who their independent reviewing officer is. Secondly,
the independent reviewing officer will be charged with assessing the
child&#146;s views and wishes and with ensuring that they are taken
into account at the statutory
reviews.</div><a name="08070173000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the proposed new subsection 25B(4) to
the Children Act 1989, which
begins:</div><a name="08070173000101"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
independent reviewing officer is not an officer of the local authority,
it is the duty of the authority&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070173000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to say what
those responsibilities are, which include co-operating with the
independent reviewing officer. With those words, the Government draw a
distinction between a self-employed independent reviewing officer who
is engaged to do the work and one whom the local authority employs. Why
does that authority not have a duty to co-operate with an independent
reviewing officer who is an officer of the local authority? Surely, our
job as Parliament is to ensure that, whoever the independent reviewing
officer is, they do their job independently, since it has
&#147;independent&#148; in the title. An independent reviewing
officer employed by a council could be put in a compromising position
if we do not say that the local authority is under a duty to co-operate
with them as much as it is required to co-operate with outside
officers.</div>
<a name="08070173000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Family
Rights Group has trained 250 independent reviewing officers. It has
found that the pressures on independent reviewing officers from the
local authorities are equally intense, whether they are an officer of
the council or self-employed. If they are independent they worry about
whether they will get more contracts if they give the local authority a
hard time, and if they are an employee they worry about whether it will
affect their career progression and future job with the local authority
if they give their employer a hard time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="08070173000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment&#146;s purpose
is to ensure that it is the authority&#146;s duty to co-operate with
the independent reviewing officer, whether or not they are an officer
of the local authority. I shall be interested to hear the
Government&#146;s response. I am reminded by my tenuous knowledge of
employment law, which goes back to when I practised as a lawyer more
then 11 years ago, that it is an employee&#146;s duty to obey
&#147;reasonable and lawful instructions&#148; from their employer.
A local authority could say to its employee who is going to take part
in a statutory review, &#147;You will have regard to the parlous
state of our finances when you take part in the review, won&#146;t
you?&#148; If they are under that kind of pressure from their local
authority and a child is saying to that independent reviewing officer
that they want an outcome that is expensive for the local authority,
how is an independent reviewing officer to advocate for the child in
the statutory review? If the law of the land says it is the duty of the
authority to co-operate with its employee in that situation, at least
the independent reviewing officer would be able to turn round to the
council and say, &#147;Excuse me, but in this situation you have the
duty to co-operate with me. I shall therefore do my job independently,
as the law requires.&#148; That is the outcome that all in this room
would hope to happen on every occasion. That was my purpose in tabling
the amendment.</div><a name="08070173000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
group of amendments includes No. 12, which is about the independence of
independent reviewing officers, and amendment No. 33, which is about
independent advocacy for children who are in contact with the
independent reviewing officer. I did not table those amendments and
will leave it to those who did to explain
them.</div><a name="08070173000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did table
amendment No. 36 so I will speak briefly to it. It is very similar to
amendment No. 33. I must declare a slight interest because some years
ago I was a founder member of a citizen advocacy scheme in
Staffordshire called ASIST, which is an acronym for Advocacy Services
in Staffordshire. It successfully set up a scheme of advocates for
adults covering the entire county and many different situations. It has
a good combination of employees who are paid to do the work and
volunteers who are trained to do it. They work as a team to provide
advocacy across the
county.</div><a name="08070173000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first time I saw the advocates in action, having helped found the
organisation, was when a large mental institution was closed down and
people were moved to independent living in the community. Advocates
from ASIST were contracted to carry out advocacy on behalf of the
residents. I know that this is a bit of a diversion, Mr.
Pope, but shockingly, I met a woman in her 80s in the mental
institution who had been admitted because she had had a child out of
wedlock when she was a young woman. That is amazing in this day and
age.</div><a name="08070173000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The advocates
provided superb skills to people who had been institutionalised for
their entire lives. The advocates got to know them, understood their
circumstances, learned what their points of view were and articulated
their views and wishes to the reviews, which determined where they
would live and what support they needed to live independently. I have
seen advocacy at first hand through that tremendously successful
scheme. To explain my interest further, I am still a patron of ASIST
because it did not want to lose contact with me when I was elected to
Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div><a name="08070173000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
36 proposes that when an independent reviewing officer seeks the wishes
and views of a child, they should tell the child about the availability
of independent advocacy services. If the child wanted somebody to speak
for them in a statutory review, they could ask somebody to be their
advocate and bat for them in front of the professionals in the
review.</div><a name="08070173000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some might
argue, as did Lord Adonis in the other place, that if the independent
review officer&#146;s role is being strengthened and they will be
charged with learning what the child thinks and wants, there is no need
for an advocate because the independent review officer can do the
necessary work on behalf of the child. I disagree with that because if
the independent review officer is to stay true to that title, they will
take account of the views of the child, the local authority, other
professionals and the parents in deciding what is best for the welfare
of the child. That might or might not be what the child wants. The
point about an advocate is that they are never diverted from speaking
up for what the child says the child wants. Ensuring that that voice is
heard in the place where it matters the most is an important
role.</div><a name="08070173000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070173000139"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): How does the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s scheme of independent advocacy for children
through the independent review officer sit with the draft legislation,
which is in line with the Adoption and Children Act 2002, and allows
for an officer of CAFCASS to be referred by the independent review
officer to take on the role as an advocate should the case
arise?</div><a name="08070173000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000140"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has
offered a way forward on who could be an advocate for a child. A
CAFCASS officer is a perfectly acceptable person&#151;independent of
everyone in the process&#151;to step in and be that advocate if that
is what the child wants. However, we should give the child a diversity
of choice. My amendment differs from amendment No. 33, which
was fully debated in the other place. That amendment seeks to ensure
that the advocate chosen by the child is absolutely independent of the
local authority. My amendment does not go that far. If, for example,
there is a member of staff in a residential children&#146;s home who
has been trained to be an advocate and has gained the appropriate
qualification, and a child wants that person to be their advocate, we
should not say, &#147;You cannot have that person because they are
employed by the local authority so they are not independent.&#148; If
the child is confident that that person could speak for them, even
against their employers, that is fine by
me.</div><a name="08070173000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
mentions the 2006 Act. I would go back a little further to the Children
(Leaving Care) Act 2000, because that is when the big debate about
advocacy first emerged in Parliament. We were given assurances during
the passage of that Act&#151;which came to fruition two years later,
I think&#151;that a child in care would have access to an advocate if
they wanted to make a complaint or a representation about their care.
Fortunately, the number of complaints is quite low, but not many
youngsters appreciate that they could have an advocate to make their
complaint for them, and they certainly do not know what a
representation is. Roger Morgan, the children&#146;s rights director,
often has difficulty&#151;even though it is his job&#151;explaining
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>people that representation could be read widely, and that there could
already be many situations where a child could access an advocate if
they wanted to. Even wanting to have their voice heard at a statutory
review could be classified as a representation. I argue that perhaps
the Government have done a good thing in the past, but they have,
through the kind of language used and the lack of publicity about
representation, denied a lot of access to advocacy to children who
already probably could have had recourse to it. Later, one or two new
clauses that try to reassert the general access to an advocate that a
child should have will be
proposed.</div><a name="08070173000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
draw my comments to a close by referring to the recent report by Roger
Morgan, the children&#146;s rights director, on children&#146;s
views of advocacy. He gives helpful guidance based on his interviews
with children. Children and young people regard the independence of the
advocate as important, mainly because the advocate would not be
involved with the issue at stake, they would be less judgmental than
people closely involved, and the process of consulting with the
advocate would be more private. On page 13 of the report it
states:</div><a name="08070173000102"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many
children and young people expressed very strong views about this. Some
thought it was important that advocates did not work for the same
organisation as the people looking after them. Others thought that
advocates should not be people in the same home as
themselves.&#148;</div><a name="08070173000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That shows a
healthy pragmatism on behalf of the children and young people: the
advocate would be somebody they trusted and their status&#151;whether
or not they were an employee of the local authority&#151;would not
necessarily be
important.</div><a name="08070173000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Roger
Morgan asked children when they thought an advocate would be of use.
These are some of their
answers:</div><a name="08070173000103"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
you feel like
complaining&#148;.</div><a name="08070173000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">They could
already access advocacy in that
situation.</div><a name="08070173000104"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
you&#146;re in a meeting and you don&#146;t understand
it&#148;.</div><a name="08070173000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is frightening
that the professional process can go on around somebody and they do not
know what is happening. A good one
is:</div><a name="08070173000105"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
you&#146;re locked
up&#148;.</div><a name="08070173000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an obvious
reason for wanting somebody to say something on your
behalf.</div><a name="08070173000106"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
you have been arrested or in trouble at school or in any other bad
situation&#148;.</div><a name="08070173000107"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
I&#146;m too afraid to ask the
council&#148;.</div><a name="08070173000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The latter is
an enlightening comment, which links to giving people the ability and
the confidence to know that with someone&#146;s help they would be
able to say the right thing at the right time. The final situation
quoted in the report
was:</div><a name="08070173000108"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whenever
you feel unable to speak for
yourself&#148;.</div><a name="08070173000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result, Roger Morgan made some recommendations, and I would like to
refer to four of
them.</div><a name="08070173000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070173000141"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): That is interesting.
Will the hon. Gentleman indicate whether those views differ across the
country?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000142"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the documents and
will happily lend him my copy in a
moment.</div><a name="08070173000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Roger Morgan
describes his methodology, which involves a number of interviews across
the country and a number of open opportunities for people to make
comments, such as through a website or by writing in. It covers the
whole of England and so is drawn from across the country. However, he
does not individualise the responses, so it is not possible to see
where in the country each person made their
comments.</div><a name="08070173000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, I
want to refer to four of the seven recommendations that Roger Morgan
made as a result of the views that he received from children. First,
all children who have a right to help from an advocate need to be told
about advocacy and how to contact an advocate. That comes back to the
point I made earlier about some children not appreciating that they can
have an advocate to make a complaint. They certainly do not understand
what a representation means and that they can have an advocate for that
reason.</div><a name="08070173000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, most
advocates should be independent of the organisation looking after the
child, although children should be able to choose an advocate they know
from their own service if they wish to do so. That is why amendment No.
36 is different from amendment No. 33. Thirdly, children should have a
choice of advocate and should be able to change their advocate if they
do not get on with them. That is a matter of practice, but it requires
a diversity of providers of advocacy services to be available.
Fourthly, children should be able to have the help of an advocate if
they need one to help get their views across and not only in relation
to
complaints.</div><a name="08070173000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is another example of Roger Morgan using his experience to say that
although the law perhaps intended a wider access to advocacy, it is
mostly coming through in connection with the making of complaints.
Therefore, I hope that the amendments can provoke a debate that leads
us to see that some changes to advocacy services will definitely be
needed in the future. Those could be achieved through changing the law
or through the guidance and practice that comes
next.</div><a name="08070173000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070173000143"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Pope. Amendment
No. 35 seems eminently sensible to me. I will wait to hear the
Minister&#146;s reassurance that it is not necessary, but I think
that it addresses some important points. Indeed, I will perhaps
inadvertently touch on some of the points addressed by amendment No.
12, because it seems that the way the position of independent reviewing
officer is being set up will make swaps between local authorities more
likely, which will be
useful.</div><a name="08070173000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I live within
a unitary authority that is adjacent to another unitary authority so I
know from experience that, with regard to careers, there is a great
deal of movement between the two unitary authorities. Because of their
proximity, it is highly likely that someone in one authority will have
worked for the other. People tend to stay in our area once they have
moved down. It is important to ensure that we are covering all
independent review officers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div><a name="08070173000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Stafford made the point about self-employed independent
reviewing officers who might find it difficult to make challenges for
fear that contracts might not be awarded in the future. My concern is
about inhibitions or obstacles on the part of the local authority,
which mean that the case cannot be strongly put for the child receiving
the sort of services that they should receive. The amendment seeks to
ensure that local authorities co-operate with independent reviewing
officers, whatever their status. To my mind, that would ensure that we
have effective challenges on behalf of all looked-after children,
regardless of the independent reviewing officer&#146;s employment
status.</div><a name="08070173000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made a note
that on amendment No. 12 I would listen carefully to the arguments
before pronouncing. I shall stick to that so the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham can be assured that I will be
listening.</div><a name="08070173000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 33 was tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Ceredigion. I have also supported amendment No. 36. As has already been
said, there is a great similarity between the two amendments. There is
a difference in that amendment No. 33 contains a more comprehensive
interpretation of the term independent. There is probably a balance
here: there should be confidence in the independence, but equally it is
important that whoever the person is, they have the total trust of the
child. The important point and the thrust of the two amendments is the
aspect of the independence and the need for
advocacy.</div><a name="08070173000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been impressed by just how many organisations and professionals
from the whole spectrum believe there is a need for independent
advocacy. Indeed, 30 different organisations have signed the joint
statement on it. I have spoken to professionals right across the field
and they all suggest that there is a need for more advocacy. Perhaps
most important of all, the children themselves want independent
advocacy.</div><a name="08070173000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070173000144"></a><b class="B">Mark
Williams</b> (Ceredigion) (LD): My hon. Friend has mentioned
the extensive number of organisations that support our amendment. Would
she agree that it is also a question of practice across the United
Kingdom and elsewhere? Wales is very much leading the way in terms of
the development of independent advocacy. The Assembly&#146;s Children
and Young People&#146;s Committee has recommended having an advocacy
unit within the Assembly, as well as a national body to provide
advocacy services for children.</div>
<a name="08070173000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000145"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank my hon. Friend. I hope that the Minister
will be able to touch on that point about equality of service across
the UK. Going back to the many supporters of independent advocacy, it
would be remiss of me not to refer to the famous reference in 1997. Sir
William Utting&#146;s report &#147;People like Us&#148; concluded
that looked-after children needed independent advocacy as a source of
protection and a means of making their voice heard. There is certainly
evidence to suggest that professional advocacy input leads to better
decision making and that children&#146;s outcomes are improved as a
result.</div><a name="08070173000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Independent
advocacy is made available now through local decision making and there
is also the right to independent advocacy if we get to the complaints
stage. But I believe that children and young people should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>have access to advocacy before something has gone wrong. The independent
review officer should inform the child about independent advocacy, what
it means, how it can help and how it differs from the roles of a social
worker and an independent review officer before each review. Following
that discussion, and where the child is clear that he wants an advocate
or the independent review officer feels that the child would benefit
from one, the local authority should be required to provide advocacy
services to that child. Obviously not all children will need or want
advocacy. It is a matter of its being available.</div>
<a name="08070173000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">At a recent
meeting of the Children, Schools and Families Committee, I asked the
Minister about children with physical difficulties. If a child has such
severe physical difficulties that they are placed quite a long way way
from home in specialist residential accommodation, surely there is a
need for advocacy. It has been drawn to my attention that that might be
a situation where the relationship with the child is an important
determinant of the choice of advocate at that point. Being able to
interpret the wishes and feelings of children who perhaps cannot
communicate fully themselves is such a delicate
thing.</div><a name="08070173000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also mentioned mental disabilities. Sadly, many children who are
brought into care are likely to have been abused in some way or other.
They may have the greatest difficulty expressing their views for that
reason. I was heartened by the Minister&#146;s response, which I
interpreted to be that in such cases as I described, it would be
difficult to think that advocacy would not be needed. I am looking for
at least an acknowledgment that independent advocacy is necessary in a
number of cases. Perhaps we will need a roll-out process, but surely we
should start somewhere by making sure that there is an absolute right
to it.</div><a name="08070173000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The independent
review officer role has been strengthened and I welcome that, but I do
not believe that the enhanced role meets the needs of more children to
have access to professional independent advocacy. The expression of the
child&#146;s views in the decision-making process by an independent
review officer who is responsible for facilitating its outcomes is
quite distinct from the representation of those views by an advocate
who is independent of the process. Review officers cannot practically
be expected to enable the necessary participation of the child in the
review process, despite the existing requirement in regulations to
ensure that the voice of the child is conveyed to the
review.</div><a name="08070173000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children
still tell the various children&#146;s organisations that they do not
feel they are listened to. The hon. Member for Stafford has just given
us some examples. One child said of his experience, &#147;I told the
IRO that I wanted contact with my sister, but that did not come up at
the meeting.&#148; That sounds remarkably odd. Independent review
officers have significant responsibilities in relation to chairing
review meetings, which means that they do not have the capacity to give
young people the dedicated support necessary to ensure that their views
can be clearly represented. Chairing a meeting and putting views
forward are clearly quite different roles. Moreover, the IRO has to act
in the best interests of the child. It is possible that they concluded
that what the child wanted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>was contrary to the child&#146;s best interests. In that situation,
would an IRO be able to represent the views of the child as
well?</div>
<a name="08070173000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Better
decision making can save money in the end. I urge the Ministers to
think again and to give further consideration to a statutory right to
independent advocacy whenever significant decisions are being made in
the lives of looked-after children, and not just when they have cause
to complain. That would be integral to the whole Government policy of
improving outcomes for children in the care
system.</div><a name="08070173000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070173000146"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): May I welcome
you back to the Chair, Mr. Pope? I want to speak primarily
to amendment No. 12. I agree with much of what has been said by the
hon. Members for Stafford and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I will
touch on the subject of advocacy at the end of my comments. I agree
that there is a case for a greater use of advocacy before things reach
the crisis stage and something has gone wrong. I certainly agree with
the method behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment in trying to
tease out the independence of the IRO and argue for greater
independence. I am approaching the matter from that same
angle.</div><a name="08070173000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I went back
over the Committee proceedings of the Adoption and Children Act 2002,
back in those heady days of 2001-02 when I was in the same role as
today, leading for the Opposition. The current Home Secretary was
leading for the Government. Great things happen to some people and not
to others. That was the piece of legislation that set up the IROs. They
came in on an statutory basis in 2004. In another place, Lord Adonis
made it clear that the primary role of the IRO was to ensure that the
child&#146;s wishes and feelings are listened to. He
said:</div><a name="08070173000109"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The role
of the IRO is central to ensuring that the voice of the child is heard.
Therefore, Clause 11 introduces a specific duty on the IRO to ensure
that the wishes and feelings of the child are given due consideration
in care planning.&#148;</div><a name="08070173000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on:</div><a name="08070173000110"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
IRO will support children&#146;s active engagement with the care

been treated unfairly.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of

said:</div><a name="08070173000111"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
vital that reviewing officers are independent of the case management

386, c. 61.]</div><a name="08070173000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was making the
case for an IRO being completely disconnected in terms of previous
employment and engagement from the responsible social services

<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="08070173000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the independent reviewing
officers became statutory in September 2004, their functions have been
set out. They are there to monitor the local authority&#146;s plans
for a looked-after child and, where appropriate, to refer the case to
CAFCASS. Will the Minister say how many referrals there have been to
CAFCASS, whether that has put a lot of pressure on it and whether it
has been able to deal with it? Has that even been a
consideration?</div><a name="08070173000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed to get around a potential conflict of interests.
I made this point during the passage of the 2002 Act and other hon.
Members expressed similar concerns. There are obviously difficulties
for officers who are employed by the authority and who, in effect, have
to challenge their employers, to whom they are contractually
accountable; whereas officers who are self-employed risk not being
given any further work if they are too challenging and are perceived to
be a thorn in the local authority&#146;s side. There is clear
potential for a conflict of interests and for an IRO &#147;dumbing
down&#148; any criticism of a local authority because it might think
that that officer is a bit of a pain and will think again about whether
to keep on or give him future case
work.</div><a name="08070173000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000147"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that in the
strengthening and widening of the IRO&#146;s role, the perception of
the independence of that role on the part of parents and children is
important? In the current system, particularly as part of the care
planning process in the court arena, we see parents challenging the
work of social workers. The court then has to employ an independent
social worker from outside the local authority to carry out a further
piece of work, thereby adding to the cost of the process. Is there not
a danger that with the strengthening and widening of the role of the
IRO, the perception of independence will decrease rather than
increase?</div><a name="08070173000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000148"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right and has
clearly seen that happen in his former job. It is crucial that the
independence of the reviewing officer is seen in practice, particularly
by the family so that they have confidence in the whole system. The
burden of proof is on the Government and the authorities operating the
system to show that the IRO is absolutely independent and makes
decisions based entirely on the welfare and interests of the child and
his family, rather than on any subsidiary interests of the employing
authority, for which it might be rather inconvenient if a decision went
the wrong way. It is therefore crucial that we get it right.</div>
<a name="08070173000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the IRO was first established, I welcomed it, and we welcome the
widening of that role, but it will not have the necessary effect unless
the IRO&#146;s independence and integrity are kept
sacrosanct.</div><a name="08070173000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000149"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Is it not difficult to pursue independence to the
state of perfection? The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment seeks to
make authorities pay for outsiders in every case. Clause 12 is about
perhaps setting up a completely independent body, just to do the job.
Does it not get more and more expensive but never achieve what he might
call the perfection of independence? Is not the better solution the
sort of independent reviewing officer that we have now as well as
decent advocacy services for children? That would save us all this
expense and worry.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="08070173000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000150"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman described
my amendments as near perfection&#151;he has certainly not done that
before. I may return to the exact terminology of the amendments and
explain why they are practical rather than
idealistic.</div><a name="08070173000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its
brief, the General Social Care Council raises points about the
qualifications and training of the IRO, and reasserts that it is
essential that GSCC registration is a requirement. The council wishes
to be involved in the development of the regulations, and it believes
that IROs should have appropriate training and accreditation. It would
be useful if the Minister commented on that. Clearly, part of the
confidence in the role of the IRO is linked to their qualifications and
ability to do the
job.</div><a name="08070173000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Mid-Dorset and North Poole touched on, albeit more in relation to
the advocate, the particular needs of children with disabilities in
communicating their wishes. During the debate in the Lords, Lord Adonis
said that he will</div><a name="08070173000112"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ensure
through statutory guidance that children with communication
difficulties or complex needs are supported either by an IRO with the
skills necessary to facilitate care planning and to elicit the views of
children with communication difficulties or complex needs, or through
an IRO who has access to specialist input from someone who has these
skills to ensure that the child&#146;s views are elicited and put
forward effectively.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords, </i>16 January 2008; Vol. 697, c.
GC530.]</div><a name="08070173000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is reassuring, but
I am concerned though whether that will happen in practice and whether
there are people capable of performing that role.</div>
<a name="08070173000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know how
short of skilled social workers we are. We will be even more short of
skilled social workers if more of them are hived off to be IROs and to
do other specialist jobs for which a social work qualification is
needed. We desperately need more social workers&#151;that is the
solution. I would appreciate a comment from the Minister on how the
capacity of the system can cope with the particular communication
skills required, as described by her noble friend Lord Adonis. If that
capacity is not satisfactory at the moment, how will it become so, and
how soon will we be at that
stage?</div><a name="08070173000073"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000151"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman also consider that a
severely disabled child, many miles from the local authority that is
providing the services, may have formed a relationship with a visitor
to the residential home? It may be easier for somebody who has a close
relationship with that child to interpret what they want, rather than a
distant independent reviewing officer, however skilled they might
be.</div><a name="08070173000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000152"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point. The issue of
children with disabilities is also relevant to the role of an advocate,
as she touched on. One of the consortium papers
states:</div><a name="08070173000113"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Disabled
children placed away from home urgently need a right to
advocacy.&#148;</div><a name="08070173000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
applies to specialist access to IROs. The paper goes
on:</div><a name="08070173000114"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Disabled
children are at least three times more likely to be abused or subjected
to demeaning treatment than other children and those living away from
home are especially vulnerable. Many children in this situation have
little or no contact with their families and are very isolated.
Advocates can help these children stay
safe.&#148;</div><a name="08070173000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, the
whole role of the position is also relevant.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div><a name="08070173000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
cites four criteria. It is a probing amendment, and no doubt the
Minister will shoot it to pieces when referring to the practicalities
of putting it in the Bill, but we think that certain benchmarks are
needed to assure the independence of the IRO. IROs should have a
minimal connection to the local authority in question. Clearly, it is
not sufficient for someone who has long been an officer of an authority
to give a judgment on former close colleagues, as their judgment might
be coloured by that, rather than the underlying needs and welfare of
the child. That is why the amendment proposes that the IROs should not
have worked for that authority.</div>
<a name="08070173000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we debated that during the
passage of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, six and a half years
ago, we looked at the possibility of the officers coming from
neighbouring authorities, but as we know, many social workers who work
for local authorities, as with many other officers in children&#146;s
services departments, can move around quite a lot, particularly among
London boroughs and between the home counties. We therefore propose
that the officer should not have worked for the local authority in
question in the previous 10 years, as that would ensure a good degree
of
independence.</div><a name="08070173000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000153"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am listening with some care to what my hon.
Friend is saying. I have a problem, which is that I live on the Isle of
Wight. I am sure that he is familiar with that in relation to other
issues. If the officer has not worked in 10 years, the problem is that
they are likely to have left employment for that time if they lived
locally, or they have retired. There is also the question of how up to
date their knowledge is. Could my hon. Friend give some indication of
how many people we are talking about&#151;one in 10 years, or 20 in
10 years? I know that it is difficult, but that would help make my
thoughts clearer.</div>
<a name="08070173000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000154"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend makes a helpful and probing
intervention. The more the Committee&#146;s proceedings continue, the
clearer it has become that the Isle of Wight is a separate universe
with a microclimate of its own, and that poses all sorts of problems.
The narrow stretch of water between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight has
much to answer for.</div>
<a name="08070173000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not looking at retired
social workers, but social workers move around the system a great deal.
With the addition of these new practices for social workers, that flow
is likely to be greater. We do not want people who are out of date and
lack the necessary training, which is why I quoted from the GSCC
earlier and commented that IROs would absolutely need to be capable of
doing the job, to be registered and to meet all the standards expected
of them. In no way are we trying to have a sort of &#147;Dad&#146;s
Army&#148; of IROs&#151;I hasten to add, lest I start to get
complaints about that analogy, that the Home Guard did a fine job.
There is no question of the individuals in question not being trained.
My primary concern is that the IRO is not too close to the people who
are effectively paying them or giving them the business, and that their
absolute primary concern is the welfare of the child.</div>
<a name="08070173000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment&#146;s third
requirement is that the IRO should be previously unconnected with the
child in question. They should have an entirely dispassionate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>view of the child&#146;s circumstances and the experiences leading up
to the event on which they are required to make the report. They should
not be coloured at all by the fact that they might have heard of that
child when working as a social worker some years before, if it was a
child who had been in the care system for many years. As a sort of
catch-all addition to the amendment, we have said that there should be
no conflict of interests. I am sure that the Minister will point to the
difficulty in defining that, but this is a probing amendment. The key
point is that there should be no conflict of interests that would
hinder the IRO&#146;s capacity to make an independent
report.</div><a name="08070173000118"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08070173000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to touch briefly on the comments about advocacy. I have in the past
supported greater advocacy as applied to certain groups of vulnerable
people. I am sympathetic to what the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole and for Stafford have said. We may have more of a debate on
that when we come to new clause 31, which deals with the subject of
advocates. Certainly, the report from the children&#146;s rights
director cited by the hon. Gentleman is excellent, as so many of them
are. I agree with his comments. I certainly endorse the responses of
children who said that it is essential that they can associate and
identify with the IROs, and they need to be able talk with them
privately and to be assured of their
independence.</div><a name="08070173000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
costing has been placed on the availability of advocacy for
children&#146;s services. An estimate by the National
Children&#146;s Advocacy Consortium showed that on the basis of a 15
per cent. take-up, introducing such a service would cost what it
described as a relatively modest &#163;3 million, excluding on-costs.
Is that an entirely unrealistic figure? Have the Government done their
own costing? Whatever the Minister may say, there is a cost element to
the reason why advocacy has not been included in the Bill. The
Government set an interesting precedent in the Mental Health Act 2007,
and I challenge them to say why it was done for that group of people
but they do not propose to include it in this
Bill.</div><a name="08070173000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Stafford, who also sat on the Committee on that Bill,
will remember that well. Advocacy services for people with mental
health problems were included in the draft Bill that was first produced
in 2004 and they had mysteriously disappeared from the Bill that was
introduced after the Queen&#146;s Speech of 2006. After the
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee report, the Government put advocacy
back in the Bill and are greatly to be congratulated for doing
so.</div>
<a name="08070173000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Advocacy was
deemed to be essential for people with mental health problems for three
main reasons. The first was to ensure a statutory right to an
independent mental health advocate for all patients subject to
compulsory powers, for which we can substitute &#147;for all children
subject to care orders&#148;, in a perfectly legitimate parallel. The
second reason was to make patients aware of that right; making children
aware would be perfectly legitimate. The third was to ensure that
patients have a right to meet their advocate in private. Again, we
could substitute &#147;children&#148; and we have already touched
on the importance of meeting in private.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="08070173000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The structure
and the rationale behind introducing an advocacy entitlement for mental
health patients subject to compulsion sits quite easily with a similar
entitlement for children subject to care orders. The pre-legislative
scrutiny Committee estimated that the whole-time equivalent of 140
advocates, which was the number deemed to be required, would cost
approximately &#163;5 million. There was debate about
whether those advocates were physically available or not, so there is
question of capacity. Although it is early days for that legislation,
has that turned out to have been a realistic estimate and how would a
similar measure pan out for children?</div>
<a name="08070173000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government still do not see
that it is appropriate to introduce similar provisions, for perhaps a
lower cost, for children subject to the care system. Given that the
criteria for mental health patients could easily be transposed to
children in the care system, why does the Minister think that the
Government were right to make that provision for mental health
patients? They were subjected to close scrutiny and a lot of lobbying,
and I did not think that they would but, to give them their due, they
did. I am keen to push amendment No. 12 as a probing amendment. I have
some constructive questions in support of the principle of advocacy and
I will be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response on why the same
principles could not be applied here.</div>
<a name="08070173000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000155"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I would like to look at clause 11, to which the
hon. Member for Stafford has tabled amendments. I am concerned: that is
not to say that I am opposed to the provision but I would like to
consider it further. Do the advocates have to give continued and
repeated help, or is someone else to do that? My concern is that the
advocates will deal with one person one day, another person another day
and a third person on a third day. It would be much better if a
youngster had continuous help. The problem with these youngsters is
that they are likely to be moved from one person to another. Can the
Minister ensure that these youngsters have continuous
help?</div>
<a name="08070173000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000156"></a>The
Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley
Hughes):</b> We have had an interesting debate and there is
very little difference between the views of Ministers and of hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee about what the amendments are
trying to achieve and the assurances that they are designed to elicit
from
me.</div><a name="08070173000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the specifics of the amendments, I shall reiterate what we
were trying to do when we developed the White Paper around four key
underpinning principles, one of which was the centrality of the voice
of the child. That is why &#147;Care Matters&#148; set out a vision
for a care system that systematically and consistently promotes the
voice of children and ensures that their voice is heard. Taken
together&#151;it is important to see them together&#151;the whole
thrust of the proposals is systemic change, with the entire care system
being child focused and decisions being made in the best interests of
the child after having considered properly the child&#146;s views and
needs, just as any parent would. That is the intention of the
proposals.</div> <a name="08070173000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The people
who are best placed to ensure that children are actively engaged in
decisions that affect them are those who already have a professional
responsibility for the child&#146;s day-to-day care, and who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>therefore have practical experience of involving the child in day-to-day
decisions. We agree completely that advocacy can have an important role
to play for looked-after children. As hon. Members have noted, under
the current statutory framework, all looked-after children should
already have access to advocacy services to help them to pursue
complaints and make representations about the services that they
receive. I accept that the latter has not happened as much as it could
have or as much as it needs to, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford said. However we believe that our proposed changes,
particularly in clause 11, will address
that.</div><a name="08070173000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Statutory
guidance makes it clear that we expect children to have access to
advocates beyond the formal complaints procedure: for example, a child
should be able to get the support of an advocate in making
representations about changes that may be required to the service that
they receive. I therefore say to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole that I do not think this is a matter of law, but a matter
of changing practice through the new statutory guidance. I am not
persuaded that providing more advocates for all looked-after children
in other circumstances would necessarily achieve what we are all trying
to achieve.</div>
<a name="08070173000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">To the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham I say that cost was not the
primary consideration. Looking at the subject in the round, as we did
when developing the policy, we see that there are already many
professionals&#151;sometimes a whole plethora&#151;who are involved
with and interact with looked-after children. Increasing advocacy for
every single child and adding an additional person into that mix can
result in more confusion between the adults&#146; roles and even
greater complication of relationships.</div>
<a name="08070173000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are doing two things. First,
to improve children&#146;s participation in decisions about their
care, we want to equip all those people who are working closely with
them on a day-to-day basis&#151;particularly carers, social workers
and designated teachers&#151;with the right skills to ensure that
they really are listening to and understanding and taking account of
children&#146;s wishes. In particular, in clause 11, we are
strengthening the role of the independent reviewing officer.</div>
<a name="08070173000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want
to improve the practice of social workers who have day-to-day
responsibility for children&#146;s cases by setting out in guidance
clear expectations for visiting looked-after children wherever they are
placed. We are revising the statutory guidance on care planning to make
it clear that social workers, too, have a responsibility to communicate
properly with children and to record information systematically in the
care plans so that care plans are comprehensive and up to date. For the
first time, we also provide for new statutory guidance on the role of
the independent reviewing officers responsible for monitoring the case
as a whole and overseeing regular reviews of the care
plan.</div><a name="08070173000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will go
through the various elements of how we want to strengthen that role,
and I ask Members to think about them as a whole. We will require local
authorities to appoint a named IRO for each child to enhance the
personal accountability and individual responsibilities of each IRO. We
will require IROs to spend time individually with each child before any
review, so that that IRO personally establishes the child&#146;s
wishes and feelings about the issues that will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>covered at the care planning meeting. The example the hon. Lady gave
about the child who wanted contact with her sister should simply not
happen, and we are going to make that
clear.</div><a name="08070173000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000157"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am anxious to know whether the word
&#147;representation&#148; is deliberate a restriction on the right
to advocacy. In the example that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole gave, if, at a case review, a child wanted it to be made
known that he or she wanted to have contact with a brother or sister,
would that entitle the child to an advocate to make sure it was said in
the
meeting?</div><a name="08070173000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000158"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> That is an interesting question. I take
&#147;representation&#148; in the terms in which we describe it
here, potentially including any aspect of the services the child is
receiving. The first and preferred option is to ensure that it is the
IRO who raises the issues that are germane to a child&#146;s future.
If that is not done, there may be room for advocacy or for some other
means of ensuring that it is
done.</div><a name="08070173000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070173000159"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Is it not too late the day after the case review
if it has not been done, and should not my right hon. Friend give a
commitment to the Committee that in the new guidance it will be made
clear that &#147;representation&#148; should be read very widely
and might include the example we have just
discussed?</div><a name="08070189000183"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08070189000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000189"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> Yes, I am happy to give the assurance that we want
&#147;representation&#148; to be read widely, and to put that on
the
record.</div><a name="08070189000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also want to introduce a duty on the IRO to monitor the local
authority&#146;s performance of its functions in relation to the
case. It is important to understand that this duty will extend the
IRO&#146;s existing monitoring role, which is confined to the
authority&#146;s functions in respect of the review. It gives the
reviewing officer a much broader scrutiny and monitoring role of the
local authority&#146;s functions in the whole of that child&#146;s
case.</div><a name="08070189000020"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000190"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Will the Minister clarify what consideration is
being given to a sibling group? The way the legislation is drafted,
each child will have its own independent reviewing officer but there
may be circumstances&#151;we see it already in the current
system&#151;where two or more siblings have the same independent
reviewing officer. Whether that is done for convenience or cost or is
really necessary is still unclear. Will there be a commitment to ensure
that each child&#146;s case is looked at individually rather than a
sibling group being looked at in the round and given the same
independent reviewing officer, even if each sibling&#146;s needs are
different?</div><a name="08070189000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000191"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> It is very important that those decisions are made
in relation both to the needs of each child and the needs of children
as a group. If each child has their own independent reviewing officer
for reasons to do with their particular circumstances, it is clearly
very important in those circumstances that all the independent
reviewing officers talk together about the needs of the individual
versus the needs of the children as a group, and communicate about
decisions that are often very difficult. The bottom line is that if
each 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>individual child needs to have an independent reviewing officer, that
should be done. We must ensure that each individual child&#146;s
needs are catered
for.</div><a name="08070189000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will also introduce a requirement for the IRO to ensure that the local
authority gives due consideration to any views expressed by the child.
We will strengthen the guidance on the role of IROs by defining a
significant event when a review must take place before any proposed
change affecting the child can occur. We will update the guidance so
that a referral by the IRO to CAFCASS is no longer seen as the last
resort, but considered as a real option to ensure proper scrutiny of
local authority decisions in any cases where the individual IRO
believes it is appropriate to escalate any well founded professional
concerns.</div>
<a name="08070189000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will amend
guidance to specify optimum case loads for IROs because, at present, we
know that one of the factors in the failure of the IROs to fulfil the
promise that we felt they had in the original legislation is the
variability between local authorities in the size of IRO case loads. As
I mentioned, that is impeding effectiveness in some services.</div>
<a name="08070189000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
address statutory guidance to the IROs themselves on the importance of
maintaining their independent voice in care planning, and on how to
perform their role more effectively. It will be the first time that
statutory guidance of that sort, on how to perform their role, will
have been issued.</div>
<a name="08070189000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we
will set out in regulations a description of the IRO similar to that in
the Review of Children's Cases (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2004
that specifies the qualifications and experience the IRO must have that
requires him or her to be independent of the management of the case.
That is a point raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham. To clarify, regulations already require that the IRO must be
registered as a social worker with the General Social Care Council and
must have sufficient experience to undertake the functions. We will set
out that description more fully in
regulations.</div><a name="08070189000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further,
we will also expect IROs either to have the skills or to be able to
access the specialist input necessary to elicit the views of children
with communication difficulties or complex needs, and to do that
effectively. Again, to answer a question raised by the hon. Gentleman,
in developing the guidance around this expectation, we will undertake
research on the type of support and skills that are required. That will
include where advocacy, particularly specialist advocacy, might provide
useful additional support to children. Through that research, we will
look at any capacity problems in relation to that specialist
expertise.</div>
<a name="08070189000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 33 and 36 would require the independent reviewing officer to give
information to the child about independent advocacy. I am happy to
commit to address that point in the new statutory guidance that will be
issued directly to IROs for the first time following this Bill. We will
ensure that the guidance makes it clear that the IRO should seek the
assistance of a professional independent advocate if they are unable to
ascertain the child&#146;s wishes and feelings. The members of the
National Children&#146;s Advocacy Consortium have already discussed
this with us and they will be consulted closely during the development
of the guidance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="08070189000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
amendments also seek to require the local authority to make
arrangements for the provision of an advocate when the need for one is
identified. That is not necessary, as it would simply duplicate
existing law. The Advocacy Services and Representations Procedure
(Children) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 already require that when a
local authority becomes aware that a child or young person wishes to
exercise their right to make a complaint or other representation about
services they receive, the authority must provide them with information
about advocacy services and offer help in obtaining an advocate. Our
reforms both to practice and to the legislative framework will mean
that we can deliver a system that puts the voice of the child at the
centre. I hope that on that basis, and given our commitment to address
those points in the new guidance issued directly to IROs, my hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford will be satisfied and feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070189000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to some of the specific questions raised by amendments Nos. 12 and 35,
regarding IRO independence and the duty of a local authority to
co-operate whether or not they are officers of the authority, I
completely understand the concern about IROs independence. In
developing the policy, I grappled with that over a long period. My
inclination initially was to go for a completely independent national
service. However, when we looked at it in detail, my view
changed.</div>
<a name="08070189000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">In consulting
a very wide range of people, we found little consensus on why IROs have
in some areas failed to have the impact on improving professional
practice that we had hoped for. The evidence was insufficient to enable
us to determine whether perceived shortcomings in case review processes
were attributable, for example, to weakness in training and support or
the variation in caseloads, or whether there was a more fundamental
problem with the whole structure. It is also worth saying that the
statutory framework for IROs only came into force in September
2004.</div>
<a name="08070189000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
persuaded in the end, not least by the views of some key stakeholders,
including the Family Justice Council, which told
me:</div><a name="08070189000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
drastic step of relocating responsibility for IROs outside local
authorities, for example within CAFCASS or some other independent
organisation, demands serious consideration. However, the level of
disruption and expense and the unlikelihood of any, or any sufficient
increase in CAFCASS resources...is a strong argument against.
Moreover, the issue of independence from the local authority, perceived
or actual, is not, in the view of the Council, the central
issue.&#148;</div><a name="08070189000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I think that means is that, in all these cases, there is an important
balance to be struck&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford said&#151;between independence and feeling sufficiently
strong and having the authority to be independent, and needing to
co-operate with the local authority in the interests of the child. What
we are asking IROs is to have not only the force of law behind
them&#151;what we are doing today&#151;but their own sense of
authority in striking that balance in the best possible way for each
child.</div><a name="08070189000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also commissioned a survey of IROs and, of the 70 responses, only three
cited concerns about potential conflicts of interest in their role.
Even in those cases, the concern was more about which part of the local
authority they sat in&#151;which department&#151;rather a
fundamental conflict of interest per se.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div><a name="08070189000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
implementing the measures, we will monitor progress very closely. If,
as we hope, the desired changes in the effectiveness of IROs can be
achieved through the new framework in clause 11, it may not be
necessary to go further. If they cannot, we include the powers in
clause 12 to establish a new national IRO service, entirely
independent, if that is
necessary.</div><a name="08070189000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000192"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> After the 2004 Act, we saw the introduction and
recruitment of regional networks of IROs, monitored by the regional
network group, as I understand it. Can the Minister confirm that that
is still an ongoing network group and will it be extended as part of
this reorganisation of the IRO
system?</div><a name="08070189000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000193"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> We have no plans to change that&#151;indeed, as
I think the hon. Gentleman is saying, there is a case for making sure
that those regional networks are as strong as they need to be. The
force of the Bill and the guidance we issue to IROs will give a greater
impetus to those networks, so that IROs can work together, talk
together and work out how to maximise the potential of the changes in
legislation that we are talking about
today.</div><a name="08070189000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
specifically to amendment No. 35, the purpose behind new section
25B(1)(4) of the 1989 Act, inserted by clause 11, is to ensure that, in
those local authorities where the independent reviewing officer is not
a salaried member of staff, the IRO is not in any way put at a
disadvantage in carrying out their functions. We expect those IROs to
have the full co-operation of the local authority. We believe that the
amendment is unnecessary, because it would make legislative provision
requiring an authority to work reasonably with its own
employees.</div><a name="08070189000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members raised the concern that those IROs employed by a local
authority might have their arms twisted because of other pressures on
the local authority, extraneous to the case. We are clear that
employees have a duty only to co-operate with lawful and reasonable
instructions from their local authority, so I do not think there is a
need to change the law.</div>
<a name="08070189000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
hon. Members will recognise our commitment to finding the right way
forward on these important and complex questions, and that what we have
in the Bill is a very considerable strengthening of IROs&#146;
independence. Nobody&#151;IROs, local authorities, other
agencies&#151;can be in any doubt about the role we want the IROs to
play. We are enshrining that in the Bill, and it will supported by
statutory guidance, for the first time, on how IROs are to undertake
their role in practice, day-to-day, in protecting both the voice of the
child and their own independence.</div>
<a name="08070189000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope, with
those assurances arising from the various probing questions Members
have asked, the Committee will feel that we have a good regime in the
Bill and that what we need to do is make sure it is put into
practice.</div><a name="08070189000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000194"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I hope you will agree, Mr Pope, that we have had
an important and interesting debate and in just 75 minutes, we have
covered two very important subjects&#151;the strength and role of the
independent reviewing officer and access for children in care to
independent advocacy. All hon. Members, and my right hon. Friend the
Minister, have made concise contributions and have deployed a strong
set of arguments for and against each position we have been discussing.
I am grateful to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole for saying that amendment No.
35 is &#147;eminently sensible&#148; and to the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham for saying he agreed with much of what I
said in support of that amendment.</div>
<a name="08070189000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08070189000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we can move on to the Minister&#146;s response to their points, as
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, the thrust of
amendments Nos. 33 and 36 is the need for independence of advocacy. I
am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister for taking a lot of
time to deal with the matter of advocacy. I think she is right to some
extent that existing law would be fine if it operated properly. The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham suggested using the
precedent of advocates in mental health services for children in care.
I would say that children in care provided the precedent for mental
health service advocates, because the entitlement to advocacy for
complaints and representations was introduced for children in care
before it was ever used for mental health
patients.</div><a name="08070189000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
role and purpose of advocacy has been developed and refined since the
child&#146;s right to an advocate was introduced. We therefore have
quite a good model in mental health: there is an entitlement to the
service, there is a right to be told about the entitlement, and there
is a right to private access to the advocate. That should be the model
in every area. I am sure the Minister is correct in saying that,
through guidance, we can get to the same position for children in care.
I hope that we will all be consulted later on the wording of the
guidance to ensure that that is
done.</div><a name="08070189000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 35, my right hon. Friend made the point that I thought
she would make, that an employee of a local authority will have all the
rights and access to resources to do their job without the need to
specify in legislation that there is a duty on the employer to
co-operate with their employee. I think we would all expect an employer
to co-operate with an employee who has an important statutory role to
fulfil. As she rightly assumed, I am concerned about arm
twisting&#151;perhaps not physical arm twisting, but the sort of
subtle pressure that I described when introducing the
amendment.</div><a name="08070189000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend reminds us, as I said in my speech, that an employer
is entitled to expect an employee to obey a lawful and reasonable
instruction. She said it would not be reasonable and lawful for the
local authority to tell the independent reviewing officer to have
regard to something outside the case review, such as the financial
situation of the council, when making their decision in their role as
independent reviewing officer. I am a little more sanguine than she is
in thinking that those pressures will not be there and will not tell in
the outcome, provided that we are careful. Again, I ask her to ensure
that that point is dealt with when guidance on the strengthened role is
produced to protect
employees.</div><a name="08070189000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I am glad that the Chairman agreed to group the amendments dealing with
independent reviewing officers and advocacy, because I believe that the
two issues go together very well. To expect the independent reviewing
officer to be absolutely independent, to stand up for children and to
deal with the plethora of professionals, as my right hon. Friend
described them, but still come to the right solution in representing
the child&#146;s views and wishes is expecting too much, whoever 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>provides the role. Even if we end up implementing clause 12 and creating
a new body specifically to do the job, I still think that it is flawed
because of the intellectual construct of that
role.</div><a name="08070189000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the benefit of many years of experience with the ASIST advocacy scheme
in Staffordshire, whose work I have seen at first hand more than once,
I believe that the advocate&#146;s role is a special and dedicated
one that should be separate from anybody who is going to make a
decision about the welfare of the child. This is about ensuring that
the views of the child are expressed properly at the right time and to
the right
people.</div><a name="08070189000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000195"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, will he deal
with the importance of continuing representation of people? It should

another
decision.&#148;</div><a name="08070189000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000196"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I was saving
dealing with his contribution to the debate until last, because that is
a point that I agree with. I think that we can be relaxed about who
becomes the IRO. We are strengthening the law relating to the role of
that post, and we are doing fine. If we listen to the representations
from the General Social Care Council and always ensure that IROs are
registered social workers who have adequate training and accreditation,
whether they work for the council, a separate body or are
self-employed, we can rely on them to fulfil their role. My point is
that that role is not to express the wishes of the child and ensure
that someone persists in giving those views at the right time to the
right people, which I think ought to be the role of the advocate. That
meets the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. A plethora of professionals
may come and go, such as social workers, consultant psychiatrists and
head teachers. One of the complaints that young people make is that
they can constantly be allocated a new social worker, so a new face
appears. Equally, an IRO will have a case load in their day job and the
case load for their IRO responsibilities might be for more than one
child.</div>
<a name="08070189000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The advocate
would be the person by the child&#146;s side, in private and in the
place where they live, talking about their wishes and desires and going
with them to the meetings. They would speak on the child&#146;s
behalf against the sea of faces of professional people, who might have
changed since the last time they all got together. The advocate would
be the one person the child trusts and knows speaks for them. Having
had their voice heard, the decision might not go the way the child had
hoped, but they would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that
they had had a fair hearing and that their point of view was stated.
That is probably one of the greatest benefits of advocacy: what matters
is not whether the case succeeds, but that it was made at the right
time and to the right people.</div>
<a name="08070189000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
combination of the position of the IRO and the availability of an
advocate, if the child wants one, to make those representations at the
right time will be the best solution for improving the circumstances of
children in care. Having listened to the Minister&#146;s explanation
of how she thinks the present law satisfactorily covers my concerns, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070189000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

hon. Members on both sides of the Committee appreciate that the
measures in the clause, taken together, represent a significant
strengthening of the role of the IRO. There is an important difference
between the position of looked-after children and that of other
categories of people, such as mental health users, for example,
precisely because we have an IRO for each and every child. I intend to
use the statutory guidance that we issue to those officers to ensure

Mr. Williams, and we are delighted that you are here
overseeing our proceedings again.</div>
<a name="08070189000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
probing amendments, and I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
response to them. They are particularly concerned with the quality and
continuity of the visiting and monitoring of children who are placed
away from the responsible local authority area. We will return to that
subject under clauses 18 and 19.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div><a name="08070189000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendments is to put in the Bill a more detailed requirement that
it should be a registered social worker or equivalent appropriate
professional representing the authority, rather than simply &#147;a
representative of the authority&#148;, which can cover a multitude of
sins. Indeed, I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s thoughts on
to what exactly the terminology &#147;a representative&#148; might
extend.</div>
<a name="08070189000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08070189000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking in many cases about children with complex requirements,
particularly if they are placed in children&#146;s homes with
specialist facilities. For all the reasons we have been debating with
regard to the Bill, it is absolutely essential that the most
appropriate person&#151;an appropriately qualified person&#151;is
responsible for the child, and provides a key link between that child
and the placing authority when decisions are made about that
child&#146;s future. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the
person who is making the visits, and who will be the direct contact
with the child in the care system, should be of significant
status&#151;they should be a registered social worker or
equivalent&#151;not just a trainee or somebody from a different
department who is nominated as the authority&#146;s representative.
It should be somebody who is completely au fait with the procedures
that put that child in the care system in the first place; with the
procedures that may ultimately get the child out of the system; and
with the level of care and facilities available to that child to assist
their progress and ensure, for example, that the child gets access to
the sort of schooling that to which we want them to have access. There
are further measures in the Bill to ensure the continuity of the school
placement and so forth. It is perfectly realistic that that person
should be a registered social worker or an equivalent
professional.</div><a name="08070189000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point I made, and which I will make again under clause 18, concerns the
large number of children who are placed out of area. Kent estimates
that it has 1,250 children in care who were placed in the county by
other authorities, and the latest estimate I have for my own authority
in West Sussex is some 700. It is therefore essential that children who
are placed at a distance have the same standard of visitor as they
would expect, and to which they would be entitled, if they were placed
within the local authority&#146;s
area.</div><a name="08070189000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
raised the issue of the use and attraction of volunteer social workers,
particularly as a preventive measure, for liaison with families. I am
not trying to row back and exclude the use of volunteer social workers,
but the responsible person who makes the decisions and will have the
contact should primarily be a registered social worker or someone of an
equivalent professional standard. However, that does not exclude
volunteer social workers from performing the role of
visitors.</div><a name="08070189000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are probing, but the underlying reason for tabling them is
to ensure that children are not &#147;dumped&#148; and get a worse
service and less monitoring than they would if they were placed in the
local authority area. That is particularly important, given that many
children who are placed away from home are there because they need a
more specialist placement. They inevitably have greater needs, which
may change, and therefore we require someone of that status who is in
regular contact with them and can make decisions based on first-hand
experience.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000207"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Kevin Brennan):</b> May I say croeso and welcome,
Mr. Williams? Thank you for joining us midway through this
morning&#146;s proceedings. As you ghosted into the room so will I
ghost in for the first half of the clause and deal with the amendments,
and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and
Families will deal with clause stand part and new clause
7.</div><a name="08070189000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that as a
general policy it is desirable that the visits should be conducted by a
social worker. However, I am concerned that the visits could give rise
to problems, and that is why new section 23ZA(5) of the Children Act
1989 requires the local authority to ensure that the visitor has the
necessary skills and experience. The supply of social workers has an
impact on the extent to which local authorities can comply with that
sort of duty, and we have to take account of such practical issues in
regulations on the frequency of visits. It would be irresponsible to do
otherwise. However, unless the visits are regular and frequent they are
unlikely to deliver the policy objective of providing effective
long-term supervision of the child&#146;s placement, and of enabling
the local authority to respond quickly to any change of circumstances.
That means that local authorities must be given more discretion as to
who they can appoint to visit the children. We will set out in
regulations further details about the functions of the local authority
representative and the frequency and circumstances in which the visits
should take place. Further details will be provided by statutory
guidance.</div>
<a name="08070189000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000208"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> New section 23ZA(5) is all about ensuring that the
person who is chosen has the necessary skills and experience to perform
the functions of representative. Different local authorities could
interpret that in many different ways. Will the Minister consider that
point in the regulations that he issues?</div>
<a name="08070189000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000209"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Yes, indeed. It is important that we make that
clear, but that is not an attempt to dilute the importance of the
necessary skills and experience. It is simply that there are
circumstances where it may not be either practical or in the interests
of the child for the person visiting to be a qualified social worker.
For example, the relationship that an individual has with a child may
be vital, and the child may have expressed a wish to be visited by a
particular individual who is not a qualified social worker but with
whom they have established an excellent relationship. It is also
possible there will be times when a visit from somebody with a
particular specialism is appropriate, for example, regarding the
child&#146;s transition to independent living. That person might not
be a qualified social worker, but they would have the particular skills
or experience relevant to the child&#146;s
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08070189000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070189000210"></a><b class="B">Helen
Southworth</b> (Warrington, South) (Lab): With reference to
the move to independent living, does the Minister expect that one
circumstance in which a visitor would need to visit a looked-after
child would be to look at the accommodation into which they had moved
to ensure that it was suitable and met their needs fully, and to
discuss whether they were coping with the accommodation and other
circumstances?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div><a name="08070189000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000211"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Yes, I would. That is an important point. We
discussed earlier the fact that sometimes a young person&#146;s
understandable enthusiasm for a place of their own in that transitional
period to independent living can quickly pale when they find themselves
living alone and paying bills and, sometimes having to cope with the
sheer loneliness. At that point, they might be at their most
vulnerable, and we have to take such matters into account. We will make
it clear that it is vital that children should be visited by local
authority representatives who have a good knowledge and understanding
of the issues relevant to them.</div>
<a name="08070189000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000212"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> A further concern is whether that person, if he or
she is not a social worker, can access the wide range of services that
may be needed for the child and contribute to the relevant
multidisciplinary
teams.</div><a name="08070189000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000213"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Yes, they will be able to do so. Rather then set
that out in primary legislation, we believe that it is more appropriate
to set out in the statutory guidance the detail on what skills and
attributes the visitor should have. Obviously, one of them is the
ability to access such resources, as the hon. Lady said. We expect that
in most circumstances the visitor would be a qualified social
worker&#151;we will make that clear&#151;but there may be cases in
which that is neither possible nor appropriate.</div>
<a name="08070189000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000214"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> On that point, under what circumstances does he
think that that visits from a registered social worker or an equivalent
professional would be
appropriate?</div><a name="08070189000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000215"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> To repeat what I said earlier, there might be
circumstances in which a young person would prefer to be visited by an
individual who is not necessarily a qualified social worker, but with
whom they have established a particularly good relationship. If a
person was suitably qualified, it would be wrong for them not to be
able to visit a young person if that young person had expressed such a
preference or where a particular specialism was needed, as in the
circumstances that I discussed with my hon. Friend the Member for
Warrington, South, including the child&#146;s transition to
independent living.</div>
<a name="08070189000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all accept
that resource issues come into play, and we have to be realistic about
that. Under certain circumstances, for example, an urgent safeguarding
issue involving a child might have to take priority over a routine
visit to another child who is settled in a long-term placement and
making good progress. In such cases, it would be wrong for a visit not
to be undertaken simply because someone was not available as a result
of having to deal with an urgent safeguarding problem involving another
young person. There are circumstances in which such decisions have to
be made, but we would expect a qualified social worker to undertake
visits under normal circumstances: that would be the norm. For those
reasons, it is important that the visitor has the right skills and
experience both to provide the support and advice that the child needs
and to establish an effective relationship with the
child.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000216"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> There are circumstances in which a child has
developed a relationship with an individual, and hopefully they have
been involved in the process to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>select that individual to assist them. We know from experience, however,
that that person sometimes has to move on, so consideration has to be
given to who will take on that role. Will the statutory guidance make
provision to assist that process to ensure that the visits do not dry
up and that a new person is appointed to take on that
role?</div><a name="08070189000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000217"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Yes, we will make it absolutely clear what the
frequency of the visits should be. We will also make it clear that the
visits should not dry up under the circumstances outlined by the hon.
Gentleman and that their frequency and regularity&#151;this is an
important part of the principle behind the clause&#151;should not
decline.</div>
<a name="08070189000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
reasons that I have outlined, it is important that visitors have the
right skills and experience to provide the support and advice that the
child needs and to establish an effective relationship with the child.
The Bill seeks to ensure that that is the case by giving local
authorities a limited degree of flexibility, but we will also ensure
that the regulations and guidance support local authorities in
achieving that aim. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham will withdraw his probing
amendment.</div>
<a name="08070189000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000218"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I began by saying that these were probing
amendments, and I was heartened by the Minister&#146;s opening
comment that it was essential that visits should be conducted by the
social worker. That is a useful starting point.</div>
<a name="08070189000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole talked about qualifying new
section 23ZA(5), and the amendment would strike it out on the basis
that we define who an appropriate person is. If we keep new section
23ZA(5), and the Government do not accept the amendments, I hope that
the regulations will define a visitor&#146;s necessary skills and
experience. The Minister said that the child might have formed a
relationship with somebody who is not a registered social worker.
Although it might be decided that it is in the child&#146;s best
interests for that person to be a link person, a responsible social
worker clearly needs to make the decisions. If a non-registered social
worker is performing the visiting duty, that role should be
subcontracted out by the responsible social worker. Although the person
doing the visiting may have formed a helpful bond with the child, they
may not necessarily be qualified to make or advise on the decisions
that must be made about the child. A fully registered social worker
must be the lead individual. If the visitor is someone below that level
of qualification, the regulations should set out how the reporting
mechanism is supposed to work.</div>

am also heartened to hear that the regularity, frequency and
circumstances of the visits will be set out. Again, my experience when
I go round some of the homes and speak to children in the care system
is that there is an enormous postcode lottery in the way in which their
social workers visit them, depending on which authorities they come
from.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000220"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> That is very helpful. That also provides a role
for a volunteer social worker as well, according to the criteria that I
have set out. I note the Minister&#146;s comments about giving a
limited degree of flexibility to authorities. There will be exceptional
circumstances in which an urgent visit is required, and a registered
social worker is not immediately available. Again, if it is to be done
in regulations we are, as usual, talking slightly in the dark. We have
not seen the regulations, but it must be made clear that it is in
exceptional circumstances that it will not be a registered social
worker performing this
role.</div><a name="08070189000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have seen different children in the same children&#146;s home
receiving quite a wide disparity of service from their responsible
placing authority regarding social worker visits. It is a key
requirement to ensure that that child does not feel neglected and
detached from the person who is making decisions about their future. If
we can get some regularity now, it is greatly to be welcomed. I am
grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification. On the basis that he
will take up some of those points in the guidance, I beg to ask leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000222"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> New clause 7 stands in my name and those of my
hon. Friends. I do not want to dwell on it. It was tabled and debated
in another place, where it was moved by the noble Lord Ramsbotham, who
has great expertise in this subject. It was supported by other noble
Friends and noble Lords. Lord Ramsbotham received some assurances from
Lord Adonis, but it would be useful to have further clarification from
the Minister about what happens to children in the care system who go
into the custody system. We should ensure that some continuity of care
is available for them, because there is a perverse incentive to
consider.</div>
<a name="08070189000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
suggest that this happens, but hypothetically there is an incentive for
a children&#146;s services authority to offload a child in care into
the custody system. All of a sudden that child is no longer a financial
burden on the children&#146;s services department, but becomes the
responsibility of the custody system, be it in a young offenders
institution or whatever. We know that the number of young people in
young offenders institutions has risen enormously. Around 3,000 young
people are effectively in prison at the moment. We also know that the
recidivism rate for inmates of young offenders institutions,
particularly those who are sent there on sentences of less than 12
months, is 92 per cent. That is alarming. Basically, sending young
people into young offenders institutions is a rapid escalator to a
career of crime. The recidivism rate for alternative forms of justice
is substantially lower. We have to be a lot smarter in our thinking
about how we deal with many of those young
people.</div><a name="08070189000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070189000223"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): We all know that there is a
wide range of reasons why young people are looked after&#151;they
have not all suffered ill treatment or neglect, for example. It
occurred to me when I looked at new section 23ZA (2)(b), which places a
duty on the local
authority</div><a name="08070189000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
arrange for appropriate advice, support and assistance to be
available&#148;,</div><a name="08070189000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
there may be occasions on which a family member&#151;a mother, for
example&#151;might be well placed to give support. If a family member
could not give &#147;advice...and assistance&#148;, he or she
could at least give emotional support to a young person in custody,
which would help to alleviate feelings of abandonment or rejection and
to maintain those essential family ties whenever possible. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>Of course, that would have to be done when it was
felt to be appropriate and beneficial to the young person, and when
they were anxious for it to happen.</div>
<a name="08070189000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000224"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. She will know
as well as I do about the experiences of young men in young offenders
institutions. I visited Feltham a few months ago, which was fascinating
if rather depressing, and some of the young offenders shared their
experiences with me. Interestingly, the worst possible offence that one
can commit against a fellow inmate is to &#147;diss&#148; their
mother&#151;I shall not repeat the fairly graphic terms in which one
can &#147;diss&#148; someone&#146;s mother that were relayed to
me. The staff say that 90 per cent. or so of the visitors
will be mothers or girlfriends, and there is an almost complete absence
of fathers and father figures who keep in contact with, or keep a
watching eye over, their children. That is the harsh reality of where
many of the offenders come
from.</div><a name="08070189000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also know that up to 50 per cent. of the people in young offenders
institutions are products of the care system. It is relevant to the
sort of people whom we are talking about that they have the right sort
of support if they have to go into the custody system. Those people
also need the right sort of continuity of support. They might have been
making some progress with the support outside, and they will need to
re-engage with it when they leave the custody system to alleviate the
possibility of becoming one of the 92 per cent. who go back into a more
severe form of the system in due course.</div>
<a name="08070189000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
shocking figures and stopping young people getting on that escalator
into the justice system is a real challenge facing all of us, as is
putting the escalator in reverse for those who are already on it. To
mix metaphors, we do not want it to be a slippery slope&#151;I think
that the Committee gets what I mean. That is the challenge facing
us.</div><a name="08070189000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause, the argument for which was better articulated by Lord
Ramsbotham in another place, with fewer mixed metaphors than I would
use, seeks to specify that the person in the care system who is
responsible for the child in care retains and continues contact and
support if that child goes into the custody system. It is crucial that
the parents&#151;meaning, more often than not, the mother, as my hon.
Friend said&#151;should be part of that. The Youth Justice Board
could tell us that in about 60 per cent. of cases, a parent attends the
case conference and keeps in touch regarding what will happen to the
young offender. Of course, there is another important conference before
release takes place. Parents should be fully engaged in the process, as
should the person outside the family&#151;that could also go for
extended family members, depending on the young person&#146;s
circumstances.</div><a name="08070189000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
the response of the Government in the Lords, I do not anticipate that
the Minister will suddenly say that the new clause is
great.</div>
<a name="08070189000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070189000225"></a><b class="B">Kerry
McCarthy</b> (Bristol, East) (Lab): I am interested in what
the hon. Gentleman says about young offenders. I have visited Ashfield
young offenders institution, which is fairly close to my constituency,
on a number of occasions. I cannot recall the figure offhand for the
number of parents who get involved in case conferences, but it is
certainly very low&#151;10 per cent. comes to mind, but I would not
want to put that on the record because I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>am not sure that it is correct. One problem is that, geographically, the
institution covers a huge area, so it is very difficult for parents to
maintain contact with the young people. Talking to some young lads due
for release, I found that those who had lost contact with their
families did not know what was going to happen to them when they were
about to be released, and the idea of having somebody who
is&#151;</div><a name="08070189000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000226"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Lady should put her
question.</div><a name="08070189000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000227"></a>Kerry
McCarthy:</b> Yes, Mr. Williams. Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that having that link, whereby somebody maintains
contact with the young person when they are released from the system,
is the right way to make progress because it cannot be assumed that
they will go back into the bosom of their family and
friends?</div><a name="08070189000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000228"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I completely agree. The hon. Lady has obviously
had the same experiences as me when visiting her local youth offenders
institute. The figures that I had were much higher than 60 per cent.,
but again there is a postcode lottery, and of course there is a
postcode lottery given that young people can be placed well away from
home.</div>
<a name="08070189000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am talking about the pure practicalities of family members being able
to maintain contact with the child. That is why it is even more
important that there is a responsible officer from the
children&#146;s services department and that there is continuity of
responsibility, particularly when the young person is about to come
out. Too often, not enough good work goes on in prison, but we know
that some good work takes place there&#151;depending on how long the
young person is inside&#151;on drug treatment, alcohol abuse,
learning disabilities and so on, which improves the chances of young
people being able to get back on their feet, only for all those support
mechanisms to be taken away when they are on the outside. They fall off
a cliff, in effect, and revert to where they were before they went into
prison.</div><a name="08070189000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is essential to have a responsible officer who sees the young person
before they go into the custody system, if that is where they are going
to end up and they cannot be kept out of it, who monitors their
progress, the treatments that they might be receiving, the developments
that take place and their achievements while they are in the custody
system, and who then takes them on when they are outside the custody
system. The new clause is designed to achieve that. I think that the
Minister will agree with the principle of it; it is just a question of
how we bring it about in practice. This new clause, championed by Lord
Ramsbotham, would be one way of ensuring that children in the care
system who go into custody receive the assistance that they need to
keep them out of the custody system in the future and to give them a
decent chance of getting back on their feet when they come out. It
would allow them to have all the other things that other children in
care might expect and, we hope, because of this Bill are more likely to
achieve.</div><a name="08070189000124"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000229"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> We are having a very important discussion on the
clause and new clause. This has to be one of the most critical things
that we need to address given the very high percentage of young people
in custody who were in care at some point. Correspondingly, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>there may be very low literacy levels and mental health conditions among
that group of people. I heard the other day that data are not routinely
collected on looked-after children in custody. I ask the Minister
whether that is the case. I presume that some data must be collected,
but surely we should have quite detailed work on this if we are to
provide the level of support that young people
need.</div><a name="08070189000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that there is a need for a qualified social worker following
through and keeping in contact with the young person. In this case, it
is a question not just of visiting but of the ability to make ongoing
assessments of the young person&#146;s needs. It is very important
that it is an holistic assessment, considering all the issues that
might apply to a young person in
custody.</div><a name="08070189000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="08070189000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conjunction with the Youth Justice Board, there are now some social
workers based in young offenders institutions, but I still think that
we need a continuity of contact with the social worker, as described by
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. If a care order is
attached to a young person in custody, there is a responsibility to
keep track of them to some degree, but if the care placement is
voluntary, I am not sure that the same provisions apply. Nevertheless,
it is an important situation in which we particularly need to give
greater support to children and young people. I would like some
clarification on that
point.</div><a name="08070189000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the past few years, we seem to have progressed quite a lot in getting
social services even to be responsible for young people in custody. It
has taken High Court judgments to move the agenda on, and the Howard
League for Penal Reform has been very much involved. We have moved on,
but the outcomes for young people who enter the custody system are
still very poor. The Bill offers an opportunity to address every
possible issue.</div>
<a name="08070189000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that however a child enters the care system, it is important to
work with all the other services to ensure that that young person is
supported when they come out. I spoke to a local youth offending team
early last year. They explained the difficulty of housing young people
who have come out of custody. Because family accommodation is not
available, the traditional route is YMCA accommodation. However, I
understand that such accommodation carries out risk assessments. I
discovered that our local youth offending team has had to place young
people coming out of custody in bed and breakfasts, which I suggest is
undesirable. My plea&#151;there are so many strands to the
problem&#151;is for continuity and an holistic approach. That
approach should include social services, local youth offending teams
and housing services into the bargain and see the process as a
whole.</div><a name="08070189000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000230"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I certainly agree with Opposition Members that
looked-after children who then go into custody are a vulnerable group,
and that they can face many serious practical problems getting back on
their feet and establishing themselves again in their local communities
when released. I agree that they are at high risk of reoffending,
although I did not recognise the figure of 92 per cent. given by the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. The one-year reconviction
rate for young people who have been in custody is about 77 per cent.,
which is still very high.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div><a name="08070189000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because of
that, the Government will publish a youth crime action plan before the
recess. One of its central themes will be strengthening the
resettlement process. In terms of that special group of young people
who have been looked after in one way or another, I recognise
absolutely that we need to take the opportunity in the Bill to ensure
and strengthen continuity of contact and what follows from that
contact&#151;it should not just be a social visit but a visit with a
purpose.</div><a name="08070189000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the amendment is intended to improve how such young
people are supported. I do not think that there is a problem with the
spirit of the amendment, but there is a problem with some of the
detail, and I shall explain that. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole asked me about information on children in care who are in
custody. Hitherto, that has been limited. We have established a system
that tells us how many placements of children in care cease because
they are admitted to custody. The first year&#146;s figures, for
2006-07, will be released in the not too distant future. That will be
the first time that we have had authoritative figures on the number of
children who went into custody from care whose placements have
ceased.</div>
<a name="08070189000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 16
provides a clear statutory framework to ensure that local authorities
maintain contact with all looked-after children, wherever they live.
That includes all the children referred to in section 23ZC(1)(a) of the
1989 Act, proposed in new clause 7. Clause 16 also enables us to ensure
through regulations that the duty to visit is extended to include
children that are provided with voluntary accommodation by the
authority but who lose their looked-after status when sentenced to
custody in a secure training centre or a youth offenders institution,
because they are no longer accommodated by the local authority. That is
all the children referred to in section 23ZB(1)(b) of the 1989 Act,
proposed in the new
clause.</div><a name="08070189000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000231"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> Will the Minister address something that is of
particular concern to me and which we have talked about a number of
times? The clause will be beneficial in many ways. Will she confirm
that it will not do away with the right of young people in custody,
determined through the courts, to have access to a trained social
worker under their entitlement to stay safe? The Minister is well aware
of the successes at Thorn Cross young offenders institute in my
constituency, which for three years has had a social worker based
there. It has seen a radical reduction in the self-harm of young
people, but it has also been working as part of a team to ensure that
young people have good and effective training while there and good
opportunities for effective resettlement when leaving
custody?</div><a name="08070189000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000232"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> My Department, jointly with the Home Office, is
funding a pilot scheme on the provision of dedicated social workers
on-site in a number of young offender institutions, with a view to
local authorities taking up the provision nationally. I shall certainly
correct myself if I am found to be wrong, but I am not aware that a
right of access to a social worker has been declared and enforced by
the courts for young people in custody. However, if my hon. Friend is
thinking of the pilot, then yes it is showing some beneficial
results.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div><a name="08070189000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
entitlement of care leavers to local authority services should be
unaffected by a custodial sentence, and I think that it would be
impossible for a local authority properly to discharge its duties to
care leavers in relation to the preparation and maintenance of the
pathway plan, the appointment of the personal adviser and the
maintenance of contact unless the care leaver is regularly visited by a
representative of the authority. As I said to the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole, that is not a social visit. It is a visit
for a purpose&#151;to assess and to ensure that things that need to
be done for that young person are mobilised and put in place.</div>
<a name="08070189000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We made a
commitment in the other place to use existing powers in relation to
care leavers to require visits to relevant children&#151;that is,
those aged 16 or 17 wherever they may be living&#151;and
that will include the children referred to in proposed section
23ZB(1)(c) of the 1989 Act. We plan to do the same in relation to
former relevant children in due course, as and when resources
allow.</div><a name="08070189000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty with the new clause is that the regulation-making power that
it contemplates is drafted in extraordinarily wide terms. Potentially,
it allows the Government to require visits to be made to any group of
children in any circumstances&#151;for example, those living in their
family home&#151;and because &#147;young person&#148; is not
defined it could similarly permit regulations to require adults to be
visited in specified circumstances. It would put on the statute book an
almost untrammelled power, with the potential to ride roughshod over
the rights of children and young persons and their families. For
instance, it could allow a local authority to visit someone who may
have been in voluntary care for a few weeks when a baby, only for that
youngster to be in custody at the age of 15. One may still want to
visit that youngster, but we need to think carefully about the
boundaries.</div><a name="08070189000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
only does new clause 7 add nothing substantive to the duties and powers
already proposed in clause 16, but it has some significant gaps. For
instance, it would not require local authorities to visit those
children who acquire looked-after status by virtue of being taken into
custody of section 21 of the 1989 Act, for example, if they are
remanded to a children&#146;s home. This group of children, on the
other hand, will benefit from the new mandatory requirement on local
authorities to arrange visits to all its looked-after children. So it
has some very wide powers in one sense but also some significant gaps
in
others.</div><a name="08070189000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Referring
to other aspects of the amendment, we intend that the person
responsible for visiting a formerly looked-after child in custody will
be an officer of the local authority&#146;s children&#146;s
services and, where possible, a qualified social worker known to the
child and familiar with his or her background. That support will be in
addition to the role of the separate youth offending team worker
responsible for planning how the child will serve the rest of the
sentence in the community.</div>
<a name="08070189000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has to
be effective co-ordination for this group of children with the shared
support from children&#146;s services and the youth offending teams.
The new visiting requirement now provides a mechanism to ensure that
this happens and puts an essential safeguard in place, so that they are

<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div><a name="08070189000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Youth
Justice Board and the Prison Service support our intention to achieve a
step change in the quality of support provided to looked-after children
in custody by children&#146;s services and for local authorities to
do for a child in custody what any reasonable parent would
do&#151;visit them and make plans for their release. That is what we
expect local authorities to do and how we expect them to behave when
they have a looked-after child who goes into custody. Clause 16 allows
for that, it requires it to happen. Having heard our approach, I hope
hon. Members will not press the new
clause.</div><a name="08070189000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000233"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I said that this was a probing new clause to try
to tease out some further detail which the Minister has given
us.</div>
<a name="08070189000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Lady said that it would be impossible in her view for a local
authority to discharge its duties without the responsible social worker
visiting, keeping contact and developing the care plan while the child
was in custody. That sends out a strong message because at the moment
that does not happen. It is important that that expectation is rammed
home loud and clear, that simply because a child is effectively off the
local authority&#146;s patch in the custody and responsibility of
someone else, that the responsibility of the local authority is not
diminished. In many cases it becomes more important to make sure that
they are fully aware of what is happening to that young person within
the young offenders institution, or wherever it may be, and that their
care plan can be adapted to take care of them when they come
out.</div>
<a name="08070189000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
greater cross-departmental working between the DCSF, the Ministry of
Justice and the Home Office&#151;she and I were at the reception last
night for the Youth Justice Board&#151;I hope that in practice that
there will be greater joined-up working between the youth justice
system and the children&#146;s services departments of local
authorities, as I know is her intention. I heard the encouraging words
of the Secretary of State who spoke last night. Unless that message is
sent out loud and clear, that in practice local authorities are
expected to keep a watch on their charges as much when they are behind
bars as when they are in their authority area then it is not going to
happen. It is a useful discussion. We have teased out further detail
than we had in the House of Lords, so on that basis I am happy to ask
to beg leave to withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="08070189000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000234"></a>Kevin

tabled, I should explain the purpose of clause 17 to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="08070189000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities must already appoint an independent visitor for
looked-after children who have no contact with their birth parents or
those who have parental responsibility. In responding to the
consultation on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>Green Paper last year, children and young people made it clear that they
wanted greater access to the support of an independent visitor. They
have told us that they value having someone from outside the system to
befriend them, to take them out, to be a source of advice and support,
and independent visitors can potentially benefit a much wider group of
looked-after children than currently have access to
one.</div>

pm</div><a name="08070189000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Their
potential in helping to support placement stability, enabling young
people to build constructive relationships and encouraging aspirations
and ambitions is considerable, and that is why we want to extend the
opportunity to have an independent visitor to all looked-after children
where they would benefit significantly from such a relationship. Clause
17 will place a duty on a local authority to appoint an independent
visitor where it appears to them that it would be in the child&#146;s
best interest to do so, and where the child wants one. We want those
who are currently eligible to maintain their right to an independent
visitor and will use regulations to ensure under new section 23ZB
subsection (1)(a) that these groups continue to be automatically
eligible for an independent visitor on that basis.</div>

subsections (1) and (2), after &#145;responsible authority&#146;

now come to the subject of out-of-area placements, which has arisen
already during the Committee, and reflects a concern which I and the my
hon. Friend the Member for Upminster mentioned previously&#151;what
happens with children who are placed out of area in terms of
notification of responsible agencies in that
area</div><a name="08070189000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
child would typically be placed in a children&#146;s home and
somewhere around 11 to 13 per cent. of children in the care system are
in a residential home, but it also involves care homes, independent
hospitals, NHS hospitals or residential schools, including maintained
boarding schools, non-maintained specialist schools, independent
boarding schools and colleges, as set out in the guidance. What this
amendment is seeking to do is tighten up the notification
process.</div>
<a name="08070189000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">What happens
at the moment is that if Stoke, for example, places a child in a
residential home in my own authority of West Sussex, for
example&#151;I have already mentioned some 700 children in my county
are estimated to be there having been placed by an outside
authority&#151;then good guidance, reinforced by Lord Warner some
years ago when he was the responsible Minister, is that the authority
where that child is placed should be notified that that child is placed
there. That must be good practice on the basis that there is a child
with particular needs who finds him or herself out of a familiar
area.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div><a name="08070189000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Worthing we
now have at least 10 independent children&#146;s homes, many
including children who are from completely different environments and
from quite a long way away. I have to say that things are getting
better and inspection regimes for some of these children&#146;s homes
are improving, but if something goes wrong, it is usually the local
children&#146;s services department who gets put in the frame, even
though that child is not their responsibility, or the local police have
to pick up the pieces, or the local magistrates then deal with a child
who has committed some offence if it has gone really wrong.</div>
<a name="08070189000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think I cited earlier in the Committee today, and on Second Reading,
the response from the probation service union, giving an extraordinary
figure of something like over 80 per cent. of children who had appeared
in the magistrates court had been in the care system but placed out of
authority area, and the first the probation service union had heard
about it was when the probation service officers were in
court.</div><a name="08070189000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
cannot be any good for all of the local agencies involved who then have
to come forward and step into the breach for somebody who is not
strictly speaking their responsibility. It is not good for people
living in the vicinity of some of these residential homes when things
go wrong, as happened to us in Worthing but, ultimately, it is not good
for the child as well. The child is being let down.</div>
<a name="08070189000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of amendment No. 15 is to tighten up the reporting mechanisms so that
when a child is placed in an authority area outside the placing
authority, there is a strict, defined duty of the placing authority to
notify the authority area in which that child is
placed&#151;nominally, the director of children&#146;s services
would be the contact point&#151;that that child has been placed there
and we have suggested that it should be within one working
day.</div><a name="08070189000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000236"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I have been listening very carefully to what the
hon. Gentleman said. It seemed that he was talking about out-of-area
placements in relation to clause 18, which is what is covered by clause
9, new section 22C. That deals with out-of-area placements in terms of
a new duty to place within an area. Clause 18 concerns placements by
education or health, which is a mechanism to involve children&#146;s
social services in those
placements.</div><a name="08070189000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000237"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I quoted the list of different agencies that
this will require. The principle is the same as we discussed in clause
9, that whichever the likely agency dealing with something when it goes
wrong should be notified. At the moment, they are just not being
notified, either at all or until after a long period of time. The
purpose of this probing amendment is to specify that they should be
notified and ordinarily, it should be done the following day, or within
a day of that child being placed in that area. It may have been more
appropriate to have discussed it under clause 9 as well, although I
think we touched on it in the debate we had around that. Whether it
goes in the Bill or whether it will be tightened up in guidance, it
should be the normal practice that a receiving authority is notified
about a child from the care system within their area as a matter of
course, simultaneously, if not in advance of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>that child being placed there so that they are aware in case anything
goes wrong and they are hauled out all of a sudden to pick up the
pieces.</div><a name="08070189000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000238"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The amendment was designed to further tie down
the exiting duties, as modified by the Bill, to notify the director of
children&#146;s services of the responsible local authority where a
child is provided with accommodation for health or education reasons
for more than three months. I am sure we will get into the wider debate
about the needs of this group of children and the services they should
receive when we debate the new clauses towards the end of the Bill. I
know a number of hon. Members are interested in those matters, but for
the purposes of the present debate, I shall confine my comments to the
subject of this clause and this
amendment.</div><a name="08070189000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do accept that some evidence suggests that children&#146;s social
care teams are not always notified when children are provided with
long-term accommodation by health authorities or education departments.
In other cases, accommodating authorities have claimed that the
notification was made, but the responsible local authority took no
action. We do not have any evidence that effective multi-agency working
and appropriate involvement of social service professionals is
inhibited by any lack of time limits on these notifications. Whether
notifications are made within one working day, or any other particular
time, is not really the issue here. The real issue is whether the
existing notification mechanism is an effective means of ensuring that
children&#146;s services authorities consider the child&#146;s
social care needs. The amendment does not address that
issue.</div><a name="08070189000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
children&#146;s trusts embed further joint working and
multi-disciplinary teams become the norm across the country, we would
expect problems with notifications to become a thing of the past. In
the short term, however, we agree that more needs to be done. That is
why we have introduced clause 18, which will help ensure that the
notifications are made. It will ensure that they are made specifically
to the director of children&#146;s services of the responsible
authority. That reflects their importance and will ensure that the
responsible authority responds appropriately to the
notification.</div><a name="08070189000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are going further in clause 19 by requiring the local authority to take
specific action in response to a notification. That means that there is
a new duty to visit all such children. We will ensure through
regulations that the visit is not a one-off but is regularly repeated
to provide an ongoing supervision of placements by the
children&#146;s social care team. We have not stopped there. We are
working with health colleagues by using the proposed new framework for
children with continuing care needs to provide practical guidance to
help bodies and local authorities work together to address the social
care needs of children who are placed in long-term residential
care.</div><a name="08070189000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand completely the sentiment behind the amendment. It is
important that all agencies and all parts of a local authority are
involved in and aware of children with complex needs at the right time.
However, I do not think that the amendment is necessary. On that basis,
I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
it.</div><a name="08070189000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070189000239"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification. This process was not deemed to be necessary before, but
clearly the system was not working before. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>That is why he sent out additional guidance, not least after a
delegation of colleagues from Worthing went to see him about the
problems with notification. I hope that this situation will improve. He
made it clear that he takes on the principle of what we are proposing.
However, the situation must be properly monitored and chased up in
practice.</div><a name="08070189000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">West
Sussex and Kent, the two authorities that I mentioned, still have to
estimate roughly the numbers of children who are involved. They should
have a much clearer handle on how many children from the care system
are placed in their authorities and more importantly, exactly who those
children are. The Minister is right that a senior responsible figure,
such as the director of children&#146;s services should know who is
in his or her area and what requirements or needs they
have.</div><a name="08070189000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy not to pursue this matter at this stage. However, we will have
to see the proof of the pudding in due course. That will be that local
authorities are able, when asked, to account for the children in the
care system within their authority area. Only when we get to that stage
will we have some comfort that the joint and inter-agency working that
we all support is happening in practice for the best interests of the
child. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070189000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>clarify that clause 18 will make a minor change to section 85 of the
Children Act 1989 to help improve the performance of the current
notification arrangements. It will require placing authorities, that is
those exercising education functions and health authorities, to address
the notification to the director of children&#146;s services. To
reiterate, this is not about out-of-area placements as in clause 9.
Clause 18 concerns placements by education or health authorities and it
provides a mechanism to involve children&#146;s services in relation
to such a notification. It also picks up minor consequential amendments
to section 86 of the 1989 Act that flow from amendments introduced in
