<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): At the end of our previous sitting, I was explaining that the landfill tax resulted from discussions that took place between the Dept of the Environment, when it was headed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), and the Treasury, when it was headed by right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). In those early discussions, it was not clear which agency should administer the tax. The Dept of the Environment saw it as an environmental tax. It, therefore, considered that the tax should be administered and collected by itself, by an agency reporting to it or by local authorities. However, the Treasury saw it as a matter for Customs and Excise, and that is my strongly held view. The Treasury's view eventually prevailed.
<P>
I mention those discussions because they show that this is not a straightforward tax. It cannot be compared to the taxes on petrol or tobacco. In those cases, the products subject to tax are readily identifiable and familiar. Therefore, it is appropriate to increase those taxes on Budget day by resolution and for the debate on them to be held subsequently, if only to stop forestalling.
<P>
The landfill tax is a good deal more complex. Waste is not always easy to define. One person's waste is someone else's raw material. The by-product of an industrial process may be a nuisance for the industry concerned, but it may be possible to put it to a productive use. In some instances, the so-called waste can be sold and form the raw material for another process. Is it correct to classify such material as waste?
<P>
Those and other considerations took many months to resolve. Eventually, the previous Government settled on two rates for the tax. One was for inert waste and the other was for active waste. The present Government have kept that distinction and, indeed, widened the tax applicable to the two rates by putting up the standard rate to £10.
<P>
A good many exemptions also exist. When the tax was announced and put out to consultation, many industries wrote in and came to see us with good or at least plausible arguments as to why their waste should not bear the tax. For example, those who dredge harbours and canals made the point that the material that they scoop out on to the canal bank is not really waste. It may appear, and occasionally smell, like waste, but such companies engage in an important and useful activity. It would greatly increase their costs if such dumped material were classified as waste.
<P>
That problem was easy to resolve, but others created more difficulties. British Sugar came to see us about the soil that is washed off sugar beet. Although I am not tremendously familiar with that form of agriculture because sugar is grown in the eastern counties, I believe that when sugar beet arrives for processing, the soil that adheres to its roots has to be washed off and dumped somewhere. Is that soil waste? In our view, it probably is not, because it is productive and could probably be returned to the field from which it came. However, the practice in the industry is to landfill it. As the Bill was originally drafted, it attracted the lower rate of landfill tax, which would have greatly increased the industry's costs. I do not remember how that matter was resolved.
<P>
Landfill tax is not a standard tax that fits easily into an existing category, and the Government's contention that it should be subject to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 is not necessarily valid. One reason for taking that view is the fact that there are many contracts between waste producers and disposers of waste. To take a simple example, someone who is building a house produces much waste and rubble, which is subject to the landfill tax when it is disposed of. If the tax was increased on Budget day, the house builder's costs would increase. He will almost certainly have a contract to dispose of waste in a landfill site, and he will have built that cost into his original calculations. His estimate that he can build the house for £50,000 will be based on the current rate of landfill tax.
<P>
People would be adversely affected if the Government suddenly doubled the rate of landfill tax. Either the landfill operator would not be able to cover his costs or if he successfully passed the costs up the chain to, in this case, the house builder costs elsewhere would rise unexpectedly and, in my view, unfairly.
<P>
Raising the tax is not like putting up the tax on cigarettes. The increase will interfere with several pre-negotiated contracts, which may be binding, and with the costings on which people have legitimately relied.It is right and fair for Parliament to debate the proposals before the tax increase takes effect.
<P>
I clearly remember rejecting the advice that the tax should be subject to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 because I thought that it was right for the powers to remain with the House of Commons. The Minister might say, "Parliament will decide whether to support the increase, and it could decide to reject it." However, we all know in practice that that is not likely to happen. The debate will take place after the increase, and it will in practice almost certainly not be possible to protect the interests of those who will be affected by the tax increase.
<P>
There is more to this innocent looking clause than first meets the eye. Other proposals in the Bill will dramatically reduce the opportunities for scrutiny, especially in relation to the use of secondary legislation,[Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory]
which opens a whole new subject that we shall, I hope, discuss later today.
<P>
It is wise to keep the landfill tax procedures as they are. They have not, to my knowledge, created any difficulties. They may be a minor inconvenience to the Government, but we should set that against our duties in Committee and in Parliament to scrutinise the powers and to ensure that any tax increase does not unnecessarily inadvertently damage taxpayers and the firms for which they work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I congratulate the Government on the clause. For a number of reasons, we think it important that landfill tax is incorporated into the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 as a tax that can be increased by resolution. That will ensure that it is seen as a mainstream tax, alongside VAT and other excise duties. Landfill tax is the first UK tax to serve an explicitly environmental purpose, and it is therefore welcomed.
<P>
I have put on record my congratulations to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who as a Minr helped to introduce landfill tax. However, I am disappointed that he thinks that it cannot be seen as a mainstream tax. His argument did not convince me. He began by saying that the tax was complex to introduce, but I believe that under his stewardship those difficulties were ironed out.
<P>
No new tax system is perfect wrinkles and teething problems frequently occur. However, I am sure that in this case they can be resolved. His argument about the complexity of the landfill tax does not hold water because that complexity would not prevent it from being seen as a mainstream tax incorporated into the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. We have witnessed the difficulties and complexities that accompanied the introduction of other mainstream taxes. However, those problems were dealt with in other ways, which did not prevent the taxes from being increased by resolution.
<P>
The next argument that the right hon. Gentleman advanced was that the clause could unfairly increase construction costs and builders' costs, which would contravene contractual and costings obligations. However, that is surely the point of the tax. The tax incentive works by providing the threat that it will increase in the future. Builders are therefore obliged to cut down on the amount of waste generated, and to consider ways of reusing or recycling that waste, rather than disposal through landfill.
<P>
Taxes such as landfill tax generate the expectation that they will increase, which is a powerful mechanism. The tax should therefore be incorporated into the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, so that increases can be expected and planned for by those businesses and households who generate waste. I am pleased by a Government press release, which stated that landfill tax would increase to £10 a tonne in 12 months' time. That is a step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): If I have understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he is suggesting that the inclusion of landfill tax within the scope of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 will enable households to plan for tax rises. My understanding of the matter is that such inclusion would mean that any announced increase would take immediate effect, giving households and businesses no time to plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has missed my point. The expectation that the tax will rise will increase the incentive to avoid the need to pay it. People will realise that the tax will move in an upward direction, and they will take appropriate action more quickly. The issue is not the rate of tax at a given point, but the expectation that it will increase. That expectation is important to the working of the incentive.
<P>
Liberal Democrats urge the Government to be more radical, and to consider the rapid introduction of a rate higher than £10 a tonne.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): The Liberal Democrats apparently accept the principle of year in, year out increases in the rate of landfill tax without regard for the implications mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. Do they propose a landfill tax accelerator, so that it goes up automatically each year?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> There is an argument for having some uncertainty, so the Government may not want an accelerator, but the hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. The Previous Government introduced the accelerator on road fuel taxes with the very argument that I am putting forward in mind the need to persuade people to change their actions and plan for greater efficiency in the use of fuel. So my argument in respect of landfill tax was accepted by the previous Government. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's suggestion may make an interesting contribution to the Government's thinking. Perhaps the Government need to introduce a landfill tax accelerator. Liberal Democrats have not discussed that, but it may be an option that we should consider.
<P>
I was beginning to think that, to a certain extent, there was cross-party consensus on landfill tax. It was introduced by the right hon. Member for Wells and was supported by other parties in Parliament. There may have been some disagreement about the details, but it was generally welcomed because it is crucial to provide an incentive to reuse, recycle and generate energy from waste. Landfill sites are an increasingly scarce resource, as the previous Government recognised. We need signals to reflect that.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a shame that the Financial Secretary is not here today because a little calculation that has been brought to my attention by the Council for the Protection of Rural England shows the significance of the issue. That Organisation used the town of Bristol as an example.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> City.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> City of Bristol, thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Apparently, in this country, we generate 400 million tonnes of waste a year, which is enough to bury an area four times the size of Bristol under one metre of waste. Clearly, that level of waste generation is unsustainable. The environmental impact of that level of landfill the visual impact, the traffic that is generated to take waste to sites and the hazards that are well known around landfill sites is unsustainable. We must act quickly to tackle the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about the traffic problems associated with moving waste to landfill sites. What method of disposal does he propose that will not involve transporting the waste from the point where it is generated to the point where it is disposed of?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Of course, waste disposal generates traffic, but it is possible to reduce the amount of traffic that is generated by the disposal of waste.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> On the internet perhaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to previous debates, in which we indulged in other flights of fancy.
<P>
Many landfill sites are found in the countryside and they generate lots of traffic on rural lanes. I would have expected Conservative Members to recognise that. Many villages and countryside communities are fed up with large lorries taking waste down narrow country lanes and causing environmental problems. If we reuse and recycle waste, it will be conveyed over much shorter distances, which will have a beneficial environmental impact.
<P>
Before the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) intervened, I was explaining our country's lamentable record on recycling and reusing waste. Currently, we recycle only 6 per cent. of domestic waste. In 1990, the previous Government set a target of 25 per cent. by the year 2000. We have come a very small way. Despite the welcome introduction of landfill tax, the previous Government were not active in implementing pro-recycling policies. Indeed, the current Minister for the Environment is on record as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I accept that, with three years to go" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is, before the year 2000 target date 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we are an awful long way away and it would be something of a miracle to achieve it."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to encourage the Government to have a go at achieving it. Make sure that you have a complete national waste management strategy. [Interruption.] I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody; I do not expect you to have a national waste management strategy, although I am sure that your contribution to the review would be most welcome. Indeed, if the review's first step was to increase the rate from £7 a tonne to £10 a tonne, then it has been too timid. I urge the Government to be more radical.
<P>
I am sure that we will hear about the problems associated with landfill tax and other incentives to cause environmental damage. For example, the issue of fly tipping is well known. In order to avoid the charges that are levied on waste sites, small commercial firms fly-tip. It happens in my constituency and I am sure that it happens in the constituencies of all hon. Members. There are other ways to tackle that problem. We could consider the charges levied by local authorities and produce guidelines to ensure that they make it easier and possibly cheaper for commercial concerns to dump waste legitimately. We could look at recycling the money that is generated from the landfill tax to local authorities so that they can take positive environmental steps to deal with fly tipping and to encourage recycling and reuse.
<P>
The landfill tax has been a success; it could be an even greater success if we apply it with full force. Denmark introduced a tax in 1986. Over 10 years, its recycling increased from 21 per cent. to 50 per cent. and dumping was reduced from 57 per cent. to 26 per cent. That shows how successful this market mechanism can be. I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Wells for introducing the landfill tax, which I commend to the Committee. The clause incorporates it into the PCTA so that it becomes a mainstream tax, and that is the right way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): It would be churlish of me to speak about recycling without referring to the Drinks Containers (Redemption) Bill which is promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie). It takes a small but significant step on the road to more efficient recycling of waste.
<P>
I always feel a little uncomfortable standing up and indulging in special pleading, although I hope to prove that I am not indulging in special pleading the greater or lesser success of which may be determined by the response of my hon. Friend the Paymaster General. I have raised this matter indirectly with the right hon. Member for Wells and must admit that the landfill tax was one of the less reprehensible measures introduced by the previous Government if that is not too much of a back-handed compliment.
<P>
It is just my bad luck to have to mention a constituency interest that is in direct contradiction to the principles of the clause. There is a small company by standards of modern Scottish manufacturing, it could be deemed a large company in my constituency called Alcan, which employs about 500 people. Because Fife lost the pits, the dockyard, the electronics industry and all its other industries under the Conservatives, Alcan is now the largest manufacturer and employer in my constituency.
<P>
Alcan imports vast quantities of red mud bauxite from which it extracts what it can to make fine powders for use by the pharmaceutical industry and others. It is left with a similar quantity of the red mud that it imported from west Africa. The cost of dumping it is at the lower level, about £250,000 to £300,00 a year, which is a great deal of money for a small company to find. Being a good company, it has tried everything short of personal consumption to dispose of the red mud: it is unsuitable for building, quite apart from the aesthetics, and it cannot be added to anything else and spread over the land. It has no useful function.
<P>
There is no alternative but to dump the dashed stuff in landfill sites, which is why I feel that I am not indulging in special pleading. The purpose of the landfill tax is therefore set at nought. The company could spend a lot of money on a new plant in west[Dr. Lewis Moonie]
Africa, where they do not have to pay decent rates, which would cost 200 jobs in my constituency and that of the Chancellor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Has Alcan investigated the possibility of returning the mud to west Africa and putting it back in the hole from which it was originally extracted?
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is even more expensive than the landfill tax.
<P>
Alcan would not complain so much were its main competitors not in France and Spain two of our great partners in Europe where alternative plants are sited around the Mediterranean. What do those companies do with the red mud? Do they spread it on their fields? No, they do not; they dump it in the Mediterranean. We cannot get away with that, and rightly so. But a cost is being loaded on our industry that is not being loaded on competitors, which is unfair.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend the Paymaster General I know that he cannot promise immediate relief for the company, just as his predecessor could not give an assurance that the Government will consider the operation of this tax and whether any anomalies in it can be addressed? At the next meeting about environmental issues in Europe, perhaps our partners in the European adventure could be persuaded to be a little more environmentally conscious in disposing of their waste material.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Good morning, Mrs. Dunwoody. 1 am glad that we are back on name recognition terms.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am quite aware of who the hon. Gentleman is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
In the interests of being helpful to his constituency, and following on from the discussion that we had late on Tuesday night, I wonder whether the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) has considered suggesting to the company that it might set up a mud wrestling industry, which would add to the tourist attractions of his constituency. Alternatively, the mud might be used by the cosmetics industry for face packs.
<P>
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells on having introduced the tax in the first place. All members of the Committee will agree that it is a necessary and effective measure, which must be continued, refined and improved. I want briefly to discuss the nature of the change in the way that the tax is collected I agree with my right hon. Friend that it is not a standard tax, such as beer or spirits duty, which can simply be added to each year. I want also to discuss the blunt instrument to be used for the proposed increase and the mechanics of the landfill tax with regard Entrust to and the related environmental crediting system.
<P>
I represent a constituency that covers all of Adur district council, which I am pleased to say has one of the best recycling records of any local authority in the country. No doubt the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) will tell me that it is a Liberal Democrat council.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey</B> rose <P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman intends to give way he will do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am glad to say that the recycling scheme of that council has always had the support of the other parties. My constituency also includes the neighbouring Conservative council in Worthing, where a similar blue box scheme has also been exceedingly successful. I see that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton no longer wishes to intervene; I am glad to have made his party political point for him. When Adur council passes out of Liberal Democrat control in the near future, Conservatives will improve the scheme and make it more commercially attractive, instead of relying on hand-outs of many millions of pounds from the European Union, which the council has done until now. But that is another matter for another debate on another day.
<P>
The landfill tax was introduced because of three main advantages identified by the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). When he introduced it in the 1994 Budget speech it did not become effective until 1996 he said that landfill tax kills three birds with one stone: it deters landfilling with waste, which helps the environment; it encourages recycling, which saves resources; and it raises revenue from waste disposal, which enables further cuts to be made in employers' national insurance contributions and thus helps to create more jobs. The reduction in employers' national insurance contributions was the pay-off, although it was a modest one.
<P>
The supposed environmental attraction of the scheme is that site operators collect the tax from the disposers and divert a proportion of it to approved environmental bodies. That diversion takes place under the auspices of Entrust. The site operator may divert a maximum of 20 per cent. of the liabilities to environmental projects and the remaining 80 per cent. the vast majority of the revenue goes to the Government. The problem is that the site operator receives a credit for only 90 per cent. of that 20 per cent., so the Government effectively collect 82 per cent. of the revenue. The exercise is predominantly a revenue-raising exercise for the Government. Only 18 per cent. goes to local environmental projects, which must, in addition, pay a 5 per cent. subsidy to Entrust.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It all sounds good, but if the site operator collects £10,000, the Govt will receive £8,200 and the environmental body will receive only around £1,900 net. The compensating measure is the reduction in national insurance contributions from 10.2 per cent. to 10 per cent. In terms of recycling resources back to local environmental projects the landfill tax is not as green as it might be or as I would like it to be and some changes could be made.
<P>
The Government are increasing the amount across the board from £7 to £10 a tonne an increase of more than 40 per cent. from 1 April 1999. That is a large increase and sends a clear signal, but it is essentially a revenue-raising exercise because the majority of that money is not being recycled to local environmental projects.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to fly tipping, which is a serious problem. We have had many problems in my constituency with fly tipping, particularly of tyres. As soon as a tip starts, it becomes a mecca for everyone in the area to dump waste. The problem needs to be tackled and perhaps extra powers should be given to local authorities to allow them to deal with the downside of the landfill tax.
<P>
I represent a harbour constituency and there is a problem with ships dumping their rubbish at sea. They dump loads of the sort mentioned by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and also their own internal rubbish, because it is cheaper to do that on the quiet, under cover of darkness, than to pay landfill tax. We must consider the downside of the tax as it stands. It would be more of a deterrent if it were not such a blunt instrument.
My first suggestion is that the Government should give sympathetic consideration to allowing a larger portion of the revenue raised to support local environment-enhancing projects, such as local authority recycling schemes and the subsidies that are still required. The Government have the scope to make the tax more environmentally beneficial instead of supposedly environmentally beneficial but really a revenue-raising exercise.
<P>
I am disappointed that the Financial Secretary is not present. She gave the Treasury's response to the Environmental Audit Select Committee's pre-Budget report, which tackled the whole subject of environmental taxes. I am a member of that committee, which did a lot of work on landfill tax. Just the other day, the Financial Secretary belatedly produced the Government's response to that pre-Budget report, which was a critical and very good pre-Budget report by members of all parties on the Environmental Audit Committee.
<P>
The Financial Secretary talked of accepting the necessity for analytical rigour in environmental measures for social equity in environmental taxes. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is important to pursue environmental taxes by consultation wherever that is possible."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was not aware that there had been consultation on the large rise that was announced on 17 March. Many of the bodies that responded to the measures were not properly consulted, and various environmental experts who will examine the implications of the tax have not had an opportunity to respond in a proper consultation to the blunt instrument measure announcing a 40-plus per cent. increase on 17 March. I challenge the idea that proper consultation has yet taken place. I see hurried notes being passed to the Paymaster General, and I am sure that he will refer to the value added tax report produced on 18 March, but there has not been proper consultation about the large increase announced the previous day.
<P>
The Financial Secretary covered other points. She stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government has made clear that decisions on environmental taxes must be made on a case-by-case basis, with due regard to the most effective mix of tax, regulation, voluntary agreements and other instruments."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This tax is simply a tax, nothing more. There was no reference in the Budget report, or subsequently, to the other three key elements that must attach to any environmental taxation considerations regulation, voluntary agreement and other instruments. My point is: fine, increase the tax, but that alone is not sufficient. This is a complicated area and taxation by itself will not solve the problems. It will lead to fly tipping and various other implications.
<P>
The Government's measures are lacking. The Financial Secretary deployed a great deal of rhetoric when she came to report to the Environmental Audit Committee: the subsequent response from our pre-Budget report recognises my concern, and calls for much more to be done, but this measure does not provide for it. The hon. Lady said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government does not consider that an increase in the revenues from `bads' <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
she was referring to environmental bads 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would necessarily be indicative of a reduction in environmental damage."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Financial Secretary does not think that the solution lies in increasing tax on things that damage the environment. Clause 146, with the announced tax hike, enables the reverse: it is purely an increase in taxation, with no mitigating legislation to accompany it. The Government have missed the opportunity to build on the good scheme introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells a few years ago. If filling licensed holes in the ground is an environmental bad, fly tipping has to be much more environmentally harmful badder, if I may use a bit of slang.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Worse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Or worse. The Liberal Democrats are as keen on good grammar as we are.
<P>
This is a complicated tax which cannot simply be delegated to an announcement on Budget day. It is an another example of the Government denying the House proper scrutiny of legislation. The Government have missed an environmental opportunity. This is typical of most of the Bill, which has dismally failed properly to translate the Government's green rhetoric into action and substance in terms of its failure to introduce a properly reducing duty on road fuel gas and its tokenism in the measures relating to conversion of vehicles for road fuel gas. Nothing has been done about company car taxation to make additional mileage less attractive, about making company season tickets more attractive so that people use public transport more often, or about discrimination between brownfield and greenfield sites. The Budget is not a green Budget and the blunt instrument contained in the clause is a back door way of increasing revenue for the Exchequer, rather than an expression of proper regard to the environmental consequences of the Government's actions and intentions.
<P>
A strong case can be made for hypothecating proceeds from the landfill tax into environmentally beneficial schemes. That could easily be done on a[Mr. Loughton]
localised basis, and I should like it to happen, so that all local authorities could be helped towards recycling levels as high as those of my local council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend has made most of the points necessary to this debate, but I want to add a few more.
<P>
The proposal to bring landfill tax within the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 presupposes that there will be regular increases in landfill tax, bringing it into the realms of mainstream, revenue-raising tax which, according to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, would be a good thing, to be looked forward to.
<P>
The landfill tax should be considered in a wider context. The Government are, as hon. Members know, consulting about the possibility of introducing an aggregates tax, which will of course have a direct impact on industries that are affected by the landfill tax. Presumably an aggregates tax would be aimed at reducing profligacy in the extraction and use of aggregates, which would, in turn, reduce opportunities for landfilling. To put it bluntly, it would reduce the number of holes in the ground.
<P>
The landfill tax also interfaces clearly with the Government's energy policy. Such issues need to be considered in the round. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, when the landfill tax was introduced, it was intended to begin to shift the burden of taxation away from employment and towards consumption and environmental damage. We all recognise that that is beneficial and that it should continue. What we are presently considering is predicated on the idea that the landfill tax will be raised regularly, so perhaps we should ask the Paymaster General what we can expect as a trade-off for rises in the landfill tax. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) suggested that perhaps those should be hypothecated to environmental works such as amelioration of local environmental damage. To some extent the mechanism of the landfill tax allows for that.
<P>
Do the Government intend to continue the previous Government's initiative in viewing the landfill tax as part of a shift from taxes on employment to taxes on consumption and waste generation? Will he assure us that the reduction in national insurance contribution that the previous Government financed from the landfill tax will continue, so that as taxes on consumption and waste generation increase, taxes on employment can be expected to fall steadily?
<P>
Has the Treasury consulted the Department of Trade and Industry? We know that consultation and relations between the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry are not always easy, but while the Treasury is introducing a paving measure for increases in the landfill tax, renewable energy policy provides subsidies for the burning of waste to generate energy and for the collection of gas from landfills. I do not say that either of those aspects of the policy is wrong, but they interface with the management of waste and the landfill tax in a way that calls for a rounded strategy.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand that the purpose of the landfill tax is to encourage other methods of waste disposal, about which I have a number of questions. Will the Paymaster General tell the Committee about the impact of the tax on landfilling? Has there been a reduction in landfilling since its introduction? Are there any statistics about what has happened to that waste? Has there been a reduction in the generation of waste? We should all regard that as a positive step. Has the waste been incinerated? I know from my constituency in Surrey that that county's waste management policy envisages an increase in waste incineration. However, waste incineration also produces problems.
<P>
Our planning system creates considerable difficulties for those whether it be a county council or a private contractor who wish to build waste incineration stations for the disposal of domestic waste and the generation of energy that can be sold into the grid under the non-fossil fuel obligation system. Everyone agrees that it is not a good idea to tip waste into the ground until it is suggested that a waste incineration plant be built in their village. Then, suddenly they are not so sure about the tipping of waste.
<P>
Waste incinerators are environmentally burdensome pieces of infrastructure. It is difficult to introduce them in a timely fashion under our planning system. Has the Paymaster General consulted his colleagues at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions to ensure that as the Treasury ratchets up the cost of dumping waste in the ground, it will be possible for people to take the alternative route of waste disposal through incineration that the fiscal measures suggest?
<P>
Will the Government ensure that incineration processes are compatible with their strategy on greenhouse gases? That strategy sets stringent targets for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and it must be considered in the wider context of energy policy. The Opposition are not too sure what the Government's energy policy is. As the Paymaster General has been closely involved in the development of that policy, perhaps we shall hear something from him on the subject during the next few weeks.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Will the hon. Gentleman cast his mind back to the introduction of the non-fossil fuel obligation? In 1989-90, the tardiness of the then Department of the Environment in producing the appropriate planning policy guidance notes defeated many of the benign environmental aspects of the Electricity Act 1989.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. It remains true that many projects that are awarded contracts under the non-fossil fuel obligation scheme introduced by the Electricity Act are never built because they are blocked by the planning system. That is not necessarily wrong, as I have said to the Minister responsible for energy matters in debates on another Bill, but we cannot consider these problems discretely, discussing landfilling on one day, renewable energy on another day, or saving the coal-mining communities on another day. The problems are all integrated and the Government must introduce an integrated approach to deal with them.
<P>
I should like to make a further point arising from the incentivisation aspect of the landfill tax if I may use such an inelegant term. The principal purpose of the tax is to encourage the use of other disposal methods for landfill materials. However, as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said earlier, sometimes there are no other viable methods of disposal. To some extent, the lower rate of tax on inert materials acknowledges that. I declare an interest because I am involved in the building industry. Whenever a building is demolished, or a site is relevelled, some materials have to go to landfill. Nothing else can be done with them; they cannot be burnt or spirited away.
<P>
Any future increases in landfill tax on combustible waste may act as an incentive to use other methods of disposal. But such increases cannot act as an incentive in the case of inert material; they simply constitute a revenue-raising measure.
<P>
I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about Entrust, and the possibility of site operators diverting up to 20 per cent. of their revenue from the landfill tax to approved environmental bodies. What percentage has been diverted in that way? The bureaucracy seems heavy handed and aimed at discouraging site operators from doing that. If the Government genuinely want environmental benefits to result from the tax, they should ensure that the 20 per cent. target is achieved on all sites. It would be interesting to know the extent of our progress on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells was modest about his contribution: he was the architect of the tax. During the proceedings on the Finance Bill in 1996, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are not alone in introducing such a tax. It already exists in Denmark, the Netherlands, France and parts of Belgium and I understand that the Italians are proposing to introduce such a tax. In general, the rates are above what we are proposing . . . This is not an environmental European tax. [Official Report, 22 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 165.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman paraphrase?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Of course, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
My right hon. Friend went on to say that the measure should not be considered as a harmonisation tax throughout the European Community. Two of my right hon. Friend's essential credentials have been maintained. That is testimony to his parliamentary career. My right hon. Friend is an excellent environmentalist, and is also very sound on Europe.
<P>
Does the Paymaster General consider the provision to be an environmental tax, a fiscal increase or both? I hope that he will provide some figures to show how much money the tax will raise. During the full year in which the tax operated in 1997-98, it is estimated that it raised £450 million. However, a total of 125 million tonnes are eligible to go to landfill. Of that, 44 million tonnes are classed as inactive or inert and would have been taxed at the old rate of £2 a tonne, or £88 million in total. A further 70 million tonnes of household or commercial would have been taxed at the old rate of £7 a tonne. That gives a total of £578 million a considerably greater yield than was estimated. Under the new rates, I estimate that 70 million tonnes will be taxed at the higher rate, and yield £700 million, and 20 million tonnes will be taxed at the lower rate, which will raise £40 million. That adds a further tax burden of £162 million. Table 1.3 on page 19 of the Red Book shows that the yield from landfill tax will increase from £50 million in 1999-2000 to £60 million in 2000-2001. That is considerably less than my estimate of £162 million. Will the Paymaster General comment on that? Does the difference relate to industries finding alternative ways of disposing of waste? That reveals a potential deficit in the system that needs to be addressed by the Government and by Customs and Excise. I know of builders who have extended the foundations of large buildings by an additional foot so that they can put commercial and industrial waste in to those foundations. By not disposing of the material through landfill they avoid paying the landfill levy.
<P>
The Committee shares with everyone else the laudable objective of preventing material from going to landfill. However, it makes no sense to incur additional building costs. We must examine the tax's distorting effect. Fly tipping which takes place in my constituency is a problem that must be addressed.
<P>
When the tax was introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, it was accompanied by a reduction in the national insurance paid by employers from 10.2 per cent. to 10 per cent. No such reduction has taken place under the present Government. Indeed, the Budget increased employers national insurance costs. Costs imposed by the Government on employers will eventually have an impact on unemployment figures.
<P>
I return to the raw figures. My calculations, which are based on figures produced by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, estimate that the tax would cost local authorities £154 million. That would be accompanied, as I have said, by a reduction in national insurance of £60 million, imposing a net burden on local authorities of £90 million. That is equivalent to an additional £5 on a band D council tax payer.
<P>
That might not sound a lot in isolation. However, increases imposed by central Government on local authorities have a cumulative effect on council taxes. How much rebate will the Paymaster General give to local authorities in respect of costs that they will incur in paying the landfill levy? It seems unfair that local authorities should have their statutory duties increased by central Government I accept that the Conservative Government did the same thing and not be compensated fully by a capping regime on the council tax or by a local government grant settlement. Will the Paymaster General comment on that?
<P>
I turn to the environmental effects of the tax. As a member of the Environment Select Committee for the final five years of the Conservative Government, I conducted inquiries into this matter. The previous Government introduced a sensible hierarchy for waste, the priorities of which were reduction, reuse, recovery and at the very bottom disposal. Disposal through landfill was the least desirable option. That was why the landfill levy was introduced.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has already asked about the effect of the[Mr. Clifton-Brown]
landfill levy on waste disposal. How will the tax reduce the 90 per cent. of household waste that currently goes to landfill sites?
<P>
I will give the Paymaster General some positive suggestions. We could do more in pre-sorting household waste that goes to landfill sites. Waste collection would have to be organised by local authorities, or perhaps waste collection authorities could get together to sort the waste. Clearly some waste is going to landfill that ought not to be going to landfill.
<P>
There are some very good recycling schemes, those for aluminium cans being the most desirable. Great energy is put by the Alcan company based in the Constituency of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy into processing raw bauxite into aluminium, so recycling aluminium cans is highly cost-effective. Pre-sortment is also a great idea.
<P>
I should like to praise my former local authority, Tewkesbury borough council. As soon as the landfill levy was introduced, it issued a home composting kit, free of charge, to every household that wanted it. composting is a useful way of reducing the tonnage going into landfill. It is a simple process and it is highly desirable for households with gardens. Composting should therefore be encouraged.
<P>
When the landfill levy was introduced, another excellent idea the setting up an environmental trust was suggested, yet we have heard nothing about that this morning. It is an excellent, environmentally friendly idea because it allows money paid as part of the landfill levy and the amount is going to be increased by the clause to be rechanneled into pilot projects for waste minimisation, recycling, compost and energy recovery. Will the Paymaster General tell the Committee how much money is being put into those environmental trusts and how well they are working?
<P>
A new regulatory body for environmental trusts has been set up, known as Entrust. I would like to know what and how well that regulatory body is doing. The Paymaster General should also be aware that more of the trusts could be used for research into waste disposal.
<P>
On the world stage we are not doing frightfully well and we do not have a huge amount to be proud of. Our principal competitors are doing far better. Let us consider the United States, for example. I have already noted that 90 per cent. of so our waste goes to landfill, but only 62 per cent. does in the United States. In Japan the figure is only 38 per cent. We should take those international comparisons seriously. The all-party environment group was recently visited by the Danish Minister for the environment who told us that only 20 per cent. of Danish waste goes to landfill. We have a long way to go.
<P>
As I made clear when we debated unleaded petrol, I am keen on using fiscal instruments to promote better environmental standards, but I am doubtful whether the landfill levy, on its own, will have the desired effect a crucial point. The Government will have to make a greater effort to persuade the general public to be more environmentally friendly. The public must be made to think more about waste and to separate it out before putting it into one bin. The Government should do much more in publicity terms to encourage a more environmentally friendly attitude.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): I will not make the obvious point to the hon. Gentleman that we have fallen behind others because of the failure of the Conservative Government over 18 years to do anything about the problem.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the debate and I would not claim to be an expert on waste management. However, I am aware that waste from the north London area is taken out to Essex and Buckinghamshire a fact that will not be lost on Conservative Members. There is resistance in those areas to the continued use of landfill. Do Conservative Members, and the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) in particular, recognise that landfill is a limited resource? If we do not want to continue to use landfill, we must use market signals to achieve that. The landfill tax is such a signal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was trying to tell the committee that, although I think that the landfill levy is part of the answer, it is not the only way of promoting better practice. My suggestions to the Paymaster General would mean that waste was minimised. That should be the Government's top priority. We can all reduce the amount of waste we produce. For example, we can use one or two fewer plastic bags every time we go to the supermarket. Reusing plastic bags is one of the practical measures that every member of the Committee and every member of the public can take to promote better practice. It is in our hands to ensure that we do not fill up every hole in the country with waste. That is a terrible environmental practice.
<P>
I have spoken at some length, but I have one final suggestion for the Paymaster General. We need to promote better practice in managing landfill sites. The practice in this country leaves something to be desired. Leachates have been produced and methane has leached out of some sites a problem that can arise many years after the landfill site has ceased being used. Housing estates have been built on top of landfill sites and methane has caused them problems.
<P>
The Environment Act 1997 and the provisions for contaminated land have considerably tightened up the management of such sites, but further action must be considered. When Customs and Excise administers the landfill levy, it should liaise carefully with the Environment Agency to ensure that best practice is observed on the sites. Sites should be properly lined. If they do not have an impermeable clay liner as their core, we must ensure that they have proper channels to drain off the leachate and to collect the methane.
<P>
This is an important issue. It is estimated that between 20 and 40 per cent. of all the methane that enters the atmosphere each year comes from landfill sites. Methane is the most damaging gas to the ozone layer and to the environment, so it is important to improve practice. on reasonably sized landfill sites, there is no reason why methane cannot be satisfactorily collected. It is an energy source and can be used. The more enlightened landfill operators collect and use the methane and reclaim some of the costs of operating their sites by carrying out that operation.
<P>
The Paymaster General may not hitherto have been an expert on landfill matters, but there is much for him to get his teeth into. I hope that he will give us some useful answers.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> This has been a good debate on the clause, which would amend the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 to include the landfill tax. I am happy that we have also been able to cover some other matters.
<P>
We all compliment one of my most distinguished predecessors, the right hon. Member for Wells, on introducing the tax. However, after reviewing the same considerations that he reviewed, we have reached a different conclusion as to whether to include the tax in the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will notice that we have given one year's notice of the increase of the standard rate to £10. However, when the increase is introduced in next year's Budget, it will be done automatically without having to complete the whole budgetary process. That is a perfectly normal arrangement, which will not stop us from consulting; it will not pre-empt any decisions and it does not mean that we will apply an escalator to the tax, as we do to some of the other taxes that come within the scope of the PCTA. I would be surprised if the right hon. Gentleman resisted our proposal, and I assure him that none of the sinister intents that he suggested lie behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Paymaster General assure the Committee that notice will always be given of such an increase? It is only by giving notice that such measures will have their intended effect. If a full year's notice will be given, what is the point of including that provision within the PCTA? Why not put it in the previous year's Finance Bill, which could easily be done, and let it take effect from next April?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I cannot give that assurance, as the hon. Gentleman will readily appreciate. The flexibility that the proposal will give us is appropriate in this case.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about exemptions. I assure him that none of the exemptions created by the previous Government has thus far been changed. The exemptions were reviewed last year and the Government concluded that the original justifications remained valid. Indeed, we intend to introduce a new exemption for waste that is used in the restoration of landfill sites.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked about contracts. Automatic adjustment of contracts is legislated for in paragraphs 45 and 46 of schedule 5 of the Finance Act 1996. Most of his points have been taken care of.
<P>
I shall respond to the points in the order in which they occur in my notes, and I hope that all of my references are exact and full, especially in relation to the questions that were asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy.
<P>
On incineration versus energy recovery and all of the other issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, difficult choices have to be made. A major consultation exercise is under way, although the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton did not seem to have taken that on board. During the consultation process we shall deal with the fact that there is an insufficient number of incinerators, and the associated planning problems, and with other difficulties. The national strategy document was published on, I believe, 9 June and responses are expected until 26 September.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) had many good ideas, and I am pleased that he raised them. I am sure that he will be closely involved in consultations with the relevant bodies. We must tackle the problem of fly tipping, which we know about from our constituency experience and whenever we pass such a site. He will be pleased to hear that £70 million has gone to environmental trusts, which is a very good start.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked how much tax was raised, but he will appreciate that I cannot recall the two sets of figures. If he wants to write to me about that matter, we shall see what we can do. The assumption is that there will be approximately 100 million tonnes, 60 per cent. of which will be active waste and 40 per cent. of which will be inert. The figure for 1997-98, which was the tax's first full year of operation, was 90 million tonnes, which already represents a reduction in the total, and the split was 55 per cent. and 45 per cent. There is less waste overall both active and inert and the split is less rich in terms of the tax paid. Compared with what was predicted in the Budget there was rather more inert waste, which attracts the lower level, than there was active waste, which attracts the higher level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does the Paymaster General consider the figures that were adduced in the Red Book to be in line with the latest expectations? The figures are 50 million for 1999-2000 and 60 million for 2000-01.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes they are based on those assumptions and on others.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked how much of the tax we would rebate to local authorities. We have given a year's notice to allow them to plan ahead, but if we were to recompense them fully, they would be under no pressure. The whole point of raising tax, especially environmental taxes, is to change behaviour. So it would be wrong in fact almost perverse to recompense them fully and would not encourage them to change their behaviour. As the hon. Member for Cotswold said, we seem to be generating far more waste than people in the United States or, to an even greater extent, Japan.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The question that the Paymaster General answered was not the question that I asked. I asked how near we were to achieving the 20 per cent. maximum that could be distributed by site operators to approved environmental bodies, not local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I was coming to that, although I thought that the hon. Gentleman raised the other point as well. If he did not, I apologise.
<P>
The current figure is 16.5 per cent., compared with 20 per cent., so we are getting there. As several hon.Mr. Robinson]
Members have said, it is early on in the tax, and we shall have to wait to see how things develop before we can make any detailed refinements or changes to it. Of course, the period of consultation will give everyone the opportunity to contribute fully.
<P>
To turn to the constituency question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, I am extremely well briefed on that topic. He will know that the Chancellor, who has a neighbouring constituency, has a similar interest. I think that he suggested that employment was split roughly equally between the two constituencies, but we cannot differentiate in that way. However, we do consider such matters carefully, especially where specific elements of competition could effect international companies. The company to which my hon. Friend referred was frozen, which is already a good start, but if the hon. Gentleman wants the company to make more specific representations to us we appreciate that the cost of £250,000 is substantial we shall be willing to meet the company's representatives. I hope that that response is satisfactory.
<P>
On the general concern about complication, raised by hon. Members including the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, the tax is not very much more complicated than income tax, corporation tax, petroleum revenue tax or value added tax. Indeed, those of us who sat through the debates on the corporation tax clauses will know that nothing could be more complicated than them. So that is not a reason for not bringing the tax within the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The reason for my intervention on the Paymaster General, to ask whether the figures in the Red Book were rebuffed, was that approximately one quarter of those increases £50 million and £60 million will fall on local authorities. Can the Paymaster General tell the Committee what proportion of that increased burden will be forthcoming in the rate support grant? Or will local authorities have to find that money from their own resources or from an increase in council tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Those issues will be covered in the consultative document. The hon. Gentleman has an almost passionate commitment to this matter, which is a very good thing, and he is also very knowledgeable about it. The same applies to the Liberal spokesman on these matters the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who generally support us. I know that both of them are in favour of a higher percentage of the tax being used not for tax revenue purposes but for various environmental schemes. It was good that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made a serious contribution to the debate he does not always do that. There is a large landfill site in his constituency, and fly tipping and unauthorised disposal at sea also take place which we must take very seriously.
<P>
We have a national strategy, and we have published a very wide consultative document, within which all those issues can be brought up. If the policy's regulatory aspects can be strengthened, we shall do so.
<P>
The answers that I have given have ranged more widely than the question of the clause's function. However, it has been a good debate. I commend the clause to the Committee, and I hope that a Division will not prove necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There seems to be general agreement among Committee members that the landfill tax is a good tax, which makes it all the more odd that the Labour party voted against the corresponding clause in the Finance Bill in 1996. In that, as in many other things, they have come round to our way of thinking on the environment, for which we are grateful.
<P>
Nevertheless, as the debate has preceeded, our concerns have increased. This is the last opportunity for the House to debate the matter before the implementation next April of the proposed 40 per cent. increase in the upper rate of landfill tax. If the clause is accepted, the increase will be debated after it has taken effect. That is regrettable because the current debate has reminded us of the environmental and political complexities of the tax. For example, the proposed increase will by definition provide those who create waste with an incentive to reclassify it as inert, or which is worse to fly tip. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham remained us of the hazards that fly tipping creates.
<P>
The Paymaster General has again said that the tax aims to change behaviour. However, behaviour can change in ways that are detrimental. Instead of paying £10 a tonne on old batteries, those who create such active waste may be tempted to fling the whole lot into the local canal and pay no tax at all. Unless care is taken, the clause's very aim could lead to environmental damage. That underlines the need for the matter to be debated fully and properly before any increase takes effect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy noted that environmental taxes sounded wonderful in the abstract but were in practice borne by consumers or companies. That additional tax burden can cost jobs and damage investment. I clearly recollect a conversation with Lord Peyton, who at that time was a member of the board of Alcan, about the famous red mud. We were able to have that material classified as inert, which proved to be of considerable assistance to Alcan. However, he told me bluntly that the behaviour of the chief executive of a board in Canada, who was a French-Canadian, could also be altered by the tax. A decision could be taken to reduce investment in this country, and to switch production to France and Spain and other countries where such charges are avoided, or perhaps evaded.
<P>
We are all in favour of a tax that benefits the environment. However, the example of Alcan shows that, in practice, such a tax can prove to be a tax on jobs and investment. Many other examples were brought to my notice, with which we tried to deal. Indeed, when that Finance Bill was in Committee, hon. Members on both sides of the House gave examples that had been relayed to them by firms in their constituencies. We had a long series of debates and considered many amendments, but the final result was satisfactory. The 40 per cent. increase will revive those concerns. I am afraid that a feature of lobbying is that it often gets into gear late in the day. I predict that the nearer we get to April next year, the more some industries and local authorities will become alarmed at the additional burden.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold mentioned the revenue support grant. He made a fair point. A local authority may have a contract with a landfill site that suddenly charges extra for more active waste. The local authority would have to absorb that cost or pass it on to the local businesses that produced the waste. If the local authority does not make those companies take on the additional tax burden and absorbs the cost itself, will it be compensated through the revenue grant?
<P>
Those important questions have not been answered and this is our last opportunity to get a response. We do not accept the arguments made, rather surprisingly, by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton who, in his breathless enthusiasm for higher taxes in all forms, overlooked the fact that increases were possible under the existing procedure. We want increases to take place only after the House has fully debated the issue and not before. He can have his environmental tax increased if he wishes, but they should not take effect by regulation. [Interruption.]
<P>
I apologize, Mrs. Dunwoody, but if I am sending you t sleep or if you cannot hear me, perhaps you could indicate your displeasure.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is quite simple. Members are asked to address the Chair. That is not just a matter of courtesy; it helps to get their words recorded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I know that you take an interest in environmental matters and I do want my comments recorded in the Official Report. I think that we will return to this issue when we debate next year's Finance Bill and I want our disquiet at the way in which this Bill is proceeding to be noted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that I was interested in all taxes being increased. That is not the case. He has failed to explain why landfill tax is not similar to VAT and excise duties, and why it should not be incorporated in the PCTA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is not in favour of raising all taxes, he is not really a Liberal Democrat he is stepping out of line. On environmental matters, the Liberal Democrats have the persistent habit of reaching for the high-tax solution. That may be all very well in general, but there are always specific examples of people, organisations and businesses with legitimate concerns. In addition, perverse incentives can be established when environmental taxes are increased. Fly tipping and the uncompetitiveness of some industries are examples of that. The Committee should be concerned about that situation.
<P>
The thrust of our argument is that the landfill tax is not like other excise duties that are subject to the PCTA. When tobacco taxes are increased, we know what tobacco is because it is a standard product, and the increases do not have secondary repercussions. That is the difference and why we object to the change in the tax procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Surely the point is that the tax is supposed to send a signal to people to change their behaviour. The more notice people are given of a fiscal change, the more likely it is to succeed in changing their behaviour. The Paymaster General's proposal to increase the tax instantly is illogical if the intention is genuinely to encourage behavioural change.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is quite right. We are not discussing just next year's tax increase. The Chancellor could announce in future Budgets that two or three days hence, or even on Budget day, there will be a 50 per cent. increase in one or other category of landfill tax. That would plunge the entire waste industry and many of the firms that produce waste into turmoil. It would not signal in advance that they could alter their behaviour accordingly. My hon. Friend is extremely perceptive.
<P>
My last point refers to a comment from my hon. Friends the Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Cotswold who asked what would happen to the money. The Treasury was initially very cautious about a landfill tax because, in those days, we were trying to reduce business taxes. In this country the Treasury is not just a finance department but also an economic ministry. In some other countries those two functions are separate, but they are combined in the British Treasury. The Treasury should have a mission to improve the competitiveness of British industry.
<P>
We were initially disturbed at the concept of taxing the environment in the knowledge that those taxes had to be borne by someone and could affect jobs and investment. We got round that dilemma by promising that the money raised would be used to relieve the burden on employment taxes. We were taxing the environment and reducing tax on employment. That is one reason why, at the general election, we had some of the lowest employment taxes in Europe. That contributed to the steady fall in unemployment which, unhappily, is about to be reversed.
<P>
The question which the Paymaster General has not answered and to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold also referred, concerns the additional tax revenue that will be running at some £60 million a year. Will that go into the black hole of general Government expenditure, or will it be used to relieve other burdens on business so that the money is recycled to the general advantage of the commercial sector?

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman who responded earlier to my hon. Friend for Kingston and Surbiton. Surely the right hon. Gentleman agrees that secondary repercussions arise from, for example, an increase in fuel tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes. That is precisely why we instituted the escalator. It was called the accelerator earlier in our debate, which is inaccurate, although under this Government it probably will accelerate. The escalator was the means of signalling in advance that fuel duties would rise in each Budget by a predetermined amount. Unhappily, the Government not only increased that but brought forward the dates, so an extra £9 billion of taxation has been inflicted on the transport sector during the course of the present[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
Parliament. That is an unexpected and most unwelcome burden.
<P>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) that, whenever possible, signals should be given in advance. That is being undermined by the clause, which, instead of being announced in the Budget and then debated before taking effect, will come into effect immediately under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. That argues against what the hon. Gentleman has just said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman agreed initially with my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon. To be consistent, he should support an escalator for landfill tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No. I do not support an escalator for landfill tax. There is no evidence that the present level of tax is not doing the job that was set for it. If the Government or the Liberal Democrats can produce arguments for increasing the tax every year, we shall be interested to hear them. If that is a pledge from the Liberal Democrats, we have been warned. It is another example of their instinct to ratchet up taxes wherever they see the opportunity.

<H4><center>Gas valuation</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Bruce </B>(Gordon): As a member of the Committee which is more than can be said for the current or previous shadow Chancellor may I ask Ministers whether they can give us a progress report on petroleum revenue tax? The clause is a technical one, which has been subject to consultation since last November. On the basis of the notes on clauses, it appears that the industry has broadly agreed to the technical change introduced by the clause, which is designed to ensure that purchase agreements fulfil the original intention. That is a perfectly sensible way forward.
<P>
But I am worried that the Government have still not published the results of their consultation on petroleum revenue tax, despite telling us, week on week, that they are about to do so. That has caused considerable anxiety to the industry, which employs about a third of a million people and accounts for in excess of 20 per cent. of all industrial investment. The industry's investment decisions are now being seriously re-evaluated in the light of the possibility or threat of an adverse change to the tax regime.
<P>
First, will Ministers give a clear indication of when they will publish the findings of the consultation? Secondly, will they acknowledge that the North sea oil industry is an extremely mature province of high risk and high cost? The principal players operate in a global market, where there are many more opportunities for investment and the technical and economic risks are much lower. Any significant adverse changes to the regime in the North sea would affect jobs and investment, not only in my constituency of Gordon in the north-east of Scotland, but throughout the United Kingdom economy.
<P>
It is not merely the threat of change that causes anxiety. The Government's failure to publish their recommendations is now beginning to affect investment decisions. Within the past two weeks, a number of operators have put development projects on hold until the Government clarify their plans for changes to the regime. That is a serious matter and I plead with the Government to end the uncertainty. I am sure that the Minister will understand that, apart from the minor technical changes, any significant adverse effect on the tax paid by the industry will have considerable costs for jobs and investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I welcome the phantom Member to the Committee. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor is not a member of the Committee, and it was not intended that he should be. That makes a difference. Perhaps the Liberal Democrat party does not have enough hon. Members for adequate coverage of Committees, but we are pleased to see the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) today.
<P>
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that clause 148 was issued in draft form last December and has been discussed with oil and gas companies. There are no outstanding requests from the industry for changes to the clause. Full details of the technical changes in the clause were set out in the explanatory note that the hon. Gentleman has read. Members of the Committee should have no problems about accepting clause 148 and I commend it to them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gordon raised issues relating to the North sea consultative document. I hope that he did so for a constructive purpose, as the industry faces great uncertainty at present because of the low price of oil. The Government are considering the situation carefully against the background and I promise the hon. Gentleman that we shall make a statement on the matter in the near future. I hope that that clarifies the Government's position. The uncertainty in the market will persist until there is a marked rise in the price of oil. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that and that we can leave the matter there for this morning.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 149</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reduction and abolition of gas levy</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to make some brief comments on the clause, following our discussions on the landfill tax and the petroleum revenue tax. My comments relate to the coherence of Government policy on energy.
<P>
We do not know what the Government's current energy policy is, but I hope that we will find out soon how they intend to resolve the contradiction between their conflicting promises to the environmental lobby to reduce greenhouse gases, and to the coal-mining lobby to preserve mining communities. The Paymaster General's presence in the Committee this morning is convenient because, coincidentally, he has been much involved in the Government's discussions on energy policy.
<P>
Clause 149 will reduce and then abolish the gas levy. By reducing the cost of gas for electricity generation, it appears to signal that gas is a favoured fuel. That is probably to be welcomed. However, this morning, we are considering that matter in isolation. Next week, the Government might announce that their chosen route out of the hole that they have dug for themselves, with the coal-mining communities on the one hand and the environmental lobby on the other, is to impose a moratorium on the introduction of further combined cycle gas turbine power generation capacity in the United Kingdom. That would look to the uninitiated as if the Department of Trade and Industry were not speaking to the Treasury, and the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing. I shall leave it to individual Members to speculate who, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade, is to be considered the left and who the right. Will the Paymaster General comment on the apparent contradiction that I have outlined? On the landfill tax, hon. Members have pointed out that market mechanisms are to be preferred when signals are to be sent to influence behaviour. One would expect the reaction to a signal sent via the reduction or removal of the gas levy that gas is the preferred fuel to be an increase in the use of gas for electricity generation. If the Government are intent on reducing the growth of gas in the electricity generation mix their view will be revealed when they make their announcement would not market-based mechanisms be preferable to a crude and blunt instrument, such as a moratorium on the construction of further capacity?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should be interested to hear what the Paymaster General can tell us from his own knowledge of the evolving, yet-to-be-revealed, Government energy policy about how that policy will interface with the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his July 1997 Budget that the Government proposed to cut the gas levy to zero with full effect from April 1998. We have now decided to implement the decision by abolishing the levy from this April, with a backdated reduction applying to the final year. Accordingly, the clause abolishes the gas levy with effect from 1 April 1998 and reduces the rate for the levy year from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998 from 4p to 3p per therm.
<P>
The purpose of the gas levy was to capture for the Exchequer the bulk of the economic rent which would otherwise accrue to the purchaser from buying gas from certain fields at below market prices. However, current and expected gas market prices are relatively low and the Government believe that there is no longer any justification for retaining the gas levy. Abolition has the advantage of removing a damaging distortion in the gas market.
<P>
In present and likely future market circumstances, the levy imposes an unreasonable handicap on those companies affected, and means that consumers suffer through higher prices. The domestic customers of British Gas Trading Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Centrica plc and the main payer of the gas levy, have already benefited through lower prices from the reduction in the levy that was announced in July.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge should await responses to the other matters that he raised in the statement of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am sure that it will not have escaped your attention, Mrs. Dunwoody, that the hon. Member for Gordon has already left the Committee. Perhaps we could send him a message to remind him that it is possible for an hon. Member to speak twice during proceedings on the Bill, and that he is allowed to speak on more than one clause. We particularly hoped that he would be present to speak on the items that we are now considering.
<P>
The code for fiscal stability is an important part of the Government's proposals. It was said of the holy Roman empire that it was not holy, not Roman, nor indeed an empire. It is certainly true that the code for fiscal stability is not a true code; is not properly fiscal it does not limit tax raising in any way; nor does it guarantee stability. Theoretically the Government could increase tax and spending tenfold and still align themselves with the requirement of the code.
<P>
I wish to comment on amendment No. 149 and the consequential amendments Nos. 150 to 163, after which I will say something about amendment No. 148, which has been grouped with the selection and deals with a related point but is slightly more specific.
<P>
Opposition Members are not opposed to the principle of some type of entrenchment. We explored a variety of administrative ways of building in some sort of restraint. The new control total was perhaps an example of administrative entrenchment, now sadly abolished and replaced in the new demotic by something called the DEL departmental expenditure limits. However, it was a form of entrenchment. We took other steps which, happily, the Government are following through on public accounting and so on, to make it more difficult for Governments to indulge in the type of profligate behaviour that this code is aimed at preventing.
<P>
Opposition Members understand fully why a Labour Government requires a code. It was Labour Governments who devalued twice in post-war history in the 1940s and 1960s. A Labour Government were responsible for the hyper-inflation of the late 1970s. So we understand why new Labour accept the need to protect the country against a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can explain the curious lacuna in his memory of the past 17 to 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I may be straying into debate on clause stand part territory here, but let me put it on record that those 17 to 18 years did not include the appalling devaluations of the 1940s and 1960s or the "Latin-American" hyper-inflation of the 1970s.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper </B>(Pontefract and Castleford) rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I will proceed to the detail of the amendments, Mrs. Dunwoody, unless you are allowing me to give way once more. I sense from your frown that you are not.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 149 and 150, and others, would ensure that the code became rules. The code is not mentioned in statute. The Government could have included it but they decided deliberately, for reasons that no doubt the Paymaster General will explain, not to provide for a code in primary legislation. Clauses 151 and 152 merely require the Government to publish a document. They do not require them to follow it; it is not enforceable upon them hence our amendment No. 148.
<P>
The key point is that the document is only a code, but that is not how the Government describe it elsewhere. In a litany of reports published since they came to power, the Government have spoken constantly about the need for rules the word that we prefer in statute. Their consultative document on the code which was published last November states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Code needs to be restrictive so as to rule out the possibility of profligate fiscal behaviour".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the Government who want to rule out such behaviour: what puzzles us is why they have chosen such a loose form of words.
<P>
Elsewhere in the document the Government make it clear that the code should be based on statute. Indeed, they suggest that the Finance Bill should effect that to the greatest possible extent. But that has not happened. The Bill does not set out the code, nor has the code been changed into binding rules. Later, when we consider amendments Nos. 146, 147 and 145, we shall argue that the clause does not establish the promised framework. The code is simply a document that has no binding force. There are no sanctions for not complying with the code. We should rectify that as soon as possible.
<P>
Since the general election, there has been a debasement of the political language. Vows and covenants have mutated into early pledges, targets or mere aspirations. We want to nail the Government to their commitment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): My hon. Friend has omitted the phrase, "a contract with the people". The right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) pledged to the country that he would reduce spending on social security. He has failed to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> My hon. Friend is right. We have heard a series of differently phrased commitments, all of which have been broken or weakened and succeeded by others.
<P>
The clause gives us an opportunity to nail the Government down. They should fulfil their promise to provide rules. There should be a code to require the Government to fulfil their commitments.
<P>
I want to draw attention to another mutation of language. In one part of the consultative document, the Government are required to "have regard" to the five principles of fiscal policy management. The final document states that the Government should conduct their policy in accordance with fiscal policy management. The economic and fiscal strategy report that was published last week provides a different formulation. On page 19, the document states that the code would ensure that the framework was "characterised" by the five principles. The explanatory notes give yet another formulation. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the principles ... shall guide ... formulation and implementation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a mess. The code should have a proper statutory basis. Rules, and nothing looser should be established.
<P>
There is no point in a code that is not enforceable. Current drafting could lead to a code that could be published and then ignored. Nothing requires the Government to comply with the code. Amendment No. 148 would provide that fiscal and debt management policy,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall be conducted in accordance"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the code. We have chosen the wording carefully. By happy chance, the amendment was drafted before the economic and fiscal strategy report was published, but the report uses almost exactly the same words on page 19. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Code requires fiscal and debt management policy to be formulated and implemented in accordance with a set of five key principles."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chief Secretary made a speech on 8 June on the south coast 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to stray a little to make the contents of the amendment clear. However, a clause stand part speech now will curtail debate later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I fully understand that, Mrs. Dunwoody, but the amendments go to the heart of the clause because they deal with its enforceability.
<P>
In a speech on 8 June, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that two rules underpinned his comprehensive spending review. He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"And whatever the pressures or difficulties we face, we will not be diverted from these tough rules."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is prepared to accept, on behalf of the Government, the discipline that the rules would require.
<P>
<H5>12.30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government persuade the Committee to keep the reference to a code, we should at the very least make that code mandatory. Although the highway code is not binding in the sense that the Road Traffic Acts are, it can be used in court. The new subsection (1A) could be so used. An association of taxpayers, banks, pension funds or City institutions might mount an action based on the idea that the Government were departing from the rules. They could use the subsection if they thought that the code was being ignored.
<P>
I think that the Government would find that helpful. It would strengthen the credibility-building process to which they attach so much importance. They would find the new subsection fully in line with paragraphs 8 and 9 fo their final document on the code which was published at the time of the Budget. Paragraph 9 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"These objectives and operating rules shall accord with the principles"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be the precise effect of my amendment.
<P>
It is alleged that the code and I do not think that there is any secrecy about it origin is based on a corresponding Act of the New Zealand legislature the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 which set a trail. It specifically requires the Government there to follow the code. Chapter 4 of that Act states:
<P>
"The Government shall pursue its policy objectives" 
<P>
With the same wording as in the consultative documents:
<P>
"in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management specified in this Act."
<P>
The code is based on that Act. Therefore, it is strange that the Government have not made it enforceable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross Cranston (Dudley, North):</B> I want to address the implications of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon). The amendments would introduce the notions of rules and enforceability. The hon. Gentleman not only suffers from selective memory, but has the passion of a convert. Having recognised that the code is a good idea, he now wants to go further than is practically possible.
<P>
At one point the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that Ministers will be up before the magistrates. That is the implication of his remarks on the highway code. If one aspect of the code is not achieved, they will be fined goodness knows how much. However, he also introduced the notion of judicial review. He raised the possibility that all sorts of groups could litigate. The hon. Gentleman previously mentioned jobbing barristers. What a gold mine it would be for them if every group in the country could litigate and seek judicial review of actions that somehow breach the code.
<P>
The history of judicial involvement with economic policy is an unhappy one. Even in this country, when the courts have become involved with such matters, they have displayed an ignorance of the economic implications of Government action. Only recently, a decision was taken on appeal: in reviewing a local authority's actions the court said that irrespective of the cost of a particular action it had to be carried out because the statute said so. When attempts have been made to enforce economic policy in the way suggested by amendment No. 148 it has led to a sad history in countries with written constitutions. As so often, the hon. Member for Sevenoaks is way off beam.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> In supporting the amendments, I shall confine my[Mr. David Ruffley]
contribution to putting a question to the Minister. The code does not entrench the two key fiscal rules the golden rule and the rule that sets net public sector borrowing as a proportion of GDP at a stable and prudent level. However proud one may be about those rules, they are not embedded in the code itself. That is acknowledged on page 17 where the code is explained. It states that it would have been open
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to embed the Government's two fiscal rules in the Code."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My question to the Minister is how he would explain the subsequent statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"However, this would be unduly restrictive. The ongoing process of strengthening the fiscal framework might, in time, require that the fiscal rules themselves are supplemented."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that. However, if the Government want to supplement the two tough fiscal rules, what is the difficulty with amending the code? If the rules are so important, why are they not set out in the document and why cannot they be supplemented later? That is a simple question and we would be grateful for elucidation on that specific point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> It is quite something for the previous Government now the Opposition to attempt to criticise the bold and imaginative steps taken by this Government to put economic policy on an open and transparent basis in line with the code of fiscal stability. It would be helpful if I reminded the Committee of the five elements and examined how they are informing various aspects of the Government's economic policy.
<P>
The code calls for transparency in the setting of fiscal policy objectives, in the implementation of fiscal policy and in the publication of public accounts a bold proposal that we have met in all respects. We are also asking for stability in the fiscal policy making process and in the impact it makes on the economy. From the day we took office, we said that we wanted to move away from short-termism and political manipulation which so disgracefully characterised the last period of the previous Government's economic management of the economy. That is what we said, and that is what we have done. That is why we gave operational independence to the Bank of England in setting interest rates.
<P>
The current proposals are a mirror of those arrangements in seeking to legislate for the establishment of the code. Just as we legislated for the Bank of England to have responsibility for interest rates, so it is for the Government, not the legislation itself, to set the inflation target. That is how the document works. We are setting a coherent legal framework to which the golden rule and others can be added. The Chancellor is committed to the golden rule in Parliament. There is no need to legislate for it.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) pointed out, Ministers will be accountable for the conduct of economic policy not to the electorate and to Parliament, but to magistrates and to judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I will finish speaking about the code before giving way.
<P>
I turn to responsibility and the management of public finances. We accelerated payments on excise duties and other taxes because we inherited a situation in which the public sector borrowing requirement was not coming down and in which the debt level was too high. In addition, the national debt had doubled in the run-up to the 1992 election, so urgent action had to be taken to restore balance. We are working towards the target of bringing the national debt down to a sustainable level.
<P>
Fairness is an essential element of the code. That means fairness between different sectors of society and, more importantly, between different generations.
<P>
Finally, efficiency is necessary in the design and implementation of fiscal policy and in managing both sides of the public sector balance sheet.
<P>
We have made a strong start on those principles of fiscal management. We will ensure that we continue to observe them by establishing the code for fiscal stability, by bringing it before Parliament and by making it subject to an affirmative resolution. I am sure that Opposition Members will take a keen interest in that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General said that including the golden rule in the Bill was unnecessary because the Chancellor has already enunciated it in Parliament. What will count as investment under the golden rule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We have taken the opportunity to split current and capital accounts. Investment was neglected perhaps deliberately by the previous Government. The national debt was increasing quickly, so they had to cut capital expenditure with the excuse that the deficit would be made up by the private finance initiative. That never happened and affairs were run down disgracefully.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has run small businesses, so he is familiar with the practice of keeping separate revenue accounts and company accounts. That practice is part of the accounting conventions which are accepted nationally and internationally and which are set out in the Red Book. As part of the Government's system of transparency, the Red Book also shows that we are planning a major increase in capital investment. Following the run-down of such investment under the Conservative Government, that should reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Implicit in remarks made by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks is his acceptance of the provisions that we are making for the transparent, responsible and fair conduct of economic affairs. Were the Conservatives ever to form a Government, he says that he is committed to putting the code into rules. That would make it subject to the judicial review that Conservative Members quite inappropriately wish to apply to our provisions.
<P>
The code, along with the publication of the pre-Budget statement, the report on economic and fiscal strategy and an expanded edition of the Red Book, will lead to transparency and responsibility. The code will appear in the Act and I hope that its principles will be accepted. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks has hinted that he accepts the idea of a code. However, it goes much further than anything that the Conservative Government ever dared to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment. To push that process further by the use of the legal system, through the introduction of judicial review, is quite inappropriate to the management of the economy. The Government will be guided by the principles that we have established.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Why are not the two key fiscal rules embedded in the code?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has already read out part of the explanation. The Government made it clear that we might wish to add to the rules; another Government might take a different view and might redefine the rules. We do not want to do that, but it is not for us to put such matters into statute. The Government are committed to the rules, which clearly are at the heart of our policy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) read out the answer to his question. It was clear. I will read it out for him if he feels incapable of re-reading it. It is not appropriate to include such matters in statute. It is appropriate to ensure that everything is transparently set out and adhered to. In doing that, we shall be responsible not to the law courts, but to the electorate and to Parliament.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The reason given for not including the two fiscal rules in the code was that the Government might wish to add supplementary provisions. In that case, would it not be possible for the Government to make amendments? The argument that they might wish to make supplementary rules in the future does not negate the argument for entrenching them in the code now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No doubt the hon. Gentleman is saying that that will be the policy of the next Conservative Government. I do not know about that. The Opposition make vacuous references to prudent management of the nation's finances, although their policy when in government was neither prudent nor managed. All that they managed to do was to run up a £50 billion deficit in 1992, to double the national debt and to leave us in a situation in which the interest payments alone were larger than the education budget. We are establishing appropriate codes and rules to which we shall be accountable. We stand by them and I commend the clause to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful for the attention that the Paymaster General has paid to this important paragraph. I understand that in future the Government might wish to introduce further provisions to supplement the two rules. However, that is the only excuse given for not entrenching the rules in the code now and it is not a logical argument. The Government already have the ability to add to the rules in future. Will the Paymaster General explain the matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General gave the Committee a miserable reply. He seems to be treating this as a stand part debate perhaps he was referring to his notes on clause stand part. The Opposition have tabled amendments to the clause and he has not replied to them.
<P>
Let me deal with the accusation that the Opposition support the idea of a code. We certainly support it for a Labour Government because of what Labour Governments have done in the past. They have a record of devaluation and hyper-inflation and it is therefore essential that they should be bound by a code.
<P>
The Paymaster General read out the five principles of the code, and we shall discuss those later. He said that the principles would "inform" the formulation and implementation of policy. That is exactly our point. We want the Government to be bound by their principles. The Paymaster General gave an example about the inflation target and that reinforces our point. If the inflation target had been put into statute, the Government and the Bank of England might not have missed it 12 times out of 13 since the Government came into office. However, it was merely a target. Under the arrangements that are now proposed, the Governor of the Bank has to write a letter.
<P>
The Opposition want to ensure that the rules are put properly into the statute and that the code is not merely a document. The Paymaster General admitted that it was a document, and said that it would be laid before Parliament. He also said that it would be just one more document, but we want it to be more than that if it is a code, it should be a proper code. It is no good the Paymaster General saying that that is inappropriate; he should explain to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) why the two rules and the five principles to which he attaches so much importance should not be placed on the statute book.
<P>
The only explanation that the Paymaster General has so far offered is that he might want to modify the two rules in future. I do not know whether he has read the clause, but subsection (4) allows him to modify the code at any time; he would not be bound for ever and a day if the rules and principles were placed on the statute book.
<P>
The Paymaster General's reply was very disappointing. If we can, we shall press amendment No. 146 to vote, but we shall withdraw amendments No. 149 to 163. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 138, line 12, after "policy", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(such that public borrowing over the economic cycle shall be for the purposes of investment only)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would put the first rule on the statute book. Ever since the Government came to power they have described the proposal as their golden rule, but there is no reason not to change it from a declaratory rule to a statutory rule. We alluded in our previous debate to the reason for that if we do not place the rule on the statute book, we will have only a subjective[Mr. Fallon]
ex parte definition of it. The Government could decide when the economic cycle, which is mentioned in the rule, begins and is deemed to have stopped and, as one of my hon. Friend's said, the Government's definition of investment could be used. They could also fiddle the various liabilities and debt guarantees, as we saw in relation to the channel tunnel fast link. If the golden rule is so important, its definition should be placed on the statute book and the amendment would do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am grateful for this opportunity to say that we have heard hypocrisy and hogwash from the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. The Conservative party's record over the past 18 years shows that the national debt was increased dramatically and outrageously, and that interest charges have been hung around the necks of the good taxpayers of this country for generations to come. Public finances have been used to pay off interest debts rather than to provide the vital services that most of our constituents know and love.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about public debt the PSBR, or public sector net cash requirement as it is now called will he at some stage turn to page 43 of "Stability and Investment for Long Term" and explain why the PSBR is estimated to increase until 2003-04, which is the whole of this Parliament's lifetime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly does not understand the golden rule that the Opposition have advocated for so long. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has plans for debt repayment of £7 billion. £10 billion and £13 billion over the three years from 1999-2000. He is pursuing an extremely successful policy and he will ensure that we have sufficient surpluses to allow us to begin to reduce our large national debt, which is a burden that hangs around the neck of this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that net public sector debt during the 18 years that the Conservative party was in power was on average 39.9 per cent. and that for the next five years, until 2001-02, the average will be 40.7 per cent? What is his answer to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I will tell the hon. Gentleman what my answer is. In addition to the record of the past 18 years, we have the record of the Opposition's amendments and suggestions during the Finance Bill, which would increase national debt and public borrowing. I can give some examples.
<P>
Having carefully costed, in consultation with the House of Commons Library, the consequences of their amendments for the financial years 1999-2000, we see that they total £5.7 billion. Coupled with their commitment to abolish capital gains tax given by the Opposition Front Bench and the twin-hatted Whip, who is not in Committee which would cost 31.3 billion, and the amendments that they tabled to the Social Security Bill totalling £1.5 billion, we see that Conservatives spending plans amass to an enormous £8.5 billion. That would not only wipe out the public sector borrowing repayment that the Chancellor of the Exchequer plans for 1999-2000 but would send the country back to the old days of borrowing and debt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North) rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot have two hon. Members on their feet at the same time. Is the hon. Gentleman giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, despite the attempts of Conservative Members to look like dogs nodding in the back window of a car, repeating the mantra "Higher figure, higher figure", it is not a higher figure in real terms? Having trawled back over the figures, for the past 18 years, in real terms, and as a proportion of GDP, it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> My hon. Friend is, as usual, entirely correct, I am grateful for his intervention. He exposes the Conservatives' outrageous profligacy and recklessness with the nation's finances, a state of affairs that led to them being kicked out of offices at the last general election, and forever consigned to the Opposition Benches.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are still dealing with the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am trying to put into context the hypocrisy of the Conservatives' public sector borrowing and lack of investment. However, I am keen to ensure that we speak to amendment No. 146. In doing so, I would not want to leave the Liberal Democrats out of the equation. If we ever had a Liberal Democrat Government I know that those three words do not often appear together I wonder how the amendment would relate to their fiscal policies.
<P>
On Tuesday, it was interesting to note that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton stated, in a few short phrases, the Liberal Democrat policy of equalising capital gains tax allowance with income tax allowance. I think that is what he was saying at column 799 of Hansard.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not going backwards, fascinating though it may be. We are endeavouring to go forwards and we are still discussing the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will remember that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The amendment considers how borrowing and investment interrelate, and it is interesting to note that the Conservatives' spending policies would add £15.8 billion to the nation's finances. That is equivalent to an increase of more than 8p in the rate of income tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman tell us whether he believes in the golden rule? If he does believe in it, what is his objection to enshrining it in the text?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> The hon. Gentleman should know that legislation sets the framework and the Government set the objectives. It would be ridiculous for the courts to determine such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is very keen to tell us about the figures that the House of Commons Library has costed for him. Has he costed the Government's 10p income tax policy?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will address the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I will address the amendment. I am glad to oppose the amendment and support my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is astonishing that the Government seem to be increasing 
<P>
It being One o'clock. The Chairman: adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
