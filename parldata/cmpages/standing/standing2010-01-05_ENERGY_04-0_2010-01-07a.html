<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000215"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much indeed. Who can start off
the questioning? Simon
Hughes.</div><a name="10010734000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
226226</b><a name="10010734000216"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): If we can
start generally, as you would expect, Joan, please. We explored with
others how much of the content of the Bill had come as a proposal from
Ofgem. We were told that some of the ideas were Ofgem generated. Could
you first tell us which of the other ideas are Government generated or
come from any other sources? Are these parts in this Bill now because
they are thought to be manageable, ring-fenced subjects that can get on
to the statute book before an election in the spring, or were they in
any event at the top of DECC&#146;s list of things it wanted to do? I
guess the last bit of that is if there are other things that DECC has
on the list but has left out, we would be glad to know that so we know
they are coming down the track, even if not in this
Bill.</div><a name="10010734000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Thank you for that question. DECC and the
predecessor group in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs have produced a substantial amount of legislation in the last
couple of years. We have the Energy Act 2008 and the Climate Change Act
2008, so we have no shortage of legislative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>bases on which we can carry forward our programmes. Our programmes are
extremely extensive, as I hope Committee members are aware, on the
issues of both climate change and energy. So there is much that we
already have as a basis for work.</div>
<a name="10010734000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is much secondary legislation, as the hon. Gentleman will know, coming
forward as a consequence of that primary legislation. We have much to
do in getting on with it in terms of our low-carbon transition plan.
Having said that, there were some crucial parts of the plan for which
we needed to legislate. That is why we have this Energy Bill. We
particularly require there to be a funding mechanism in order to
support the carbon capture and storage programme, which is essential to
reducing carbon emissions in this country and meeting our Climate
Change Act targets. That is a primary reason for having this Bill
before us.</div>
<a name="10010734000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
timing, we needed the CCS incentive mechanism to be in place so that we
could meet payments that might be required for the winner of the
competition. So spring 2011 is a crucial landmark in that respect. In
terms of the other aspects of the Bill, it is perfectly true that Ofgem
came to us requesting that we legislate to do things that both it and
we thought were necessary.</div>
<a name="10010734000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
with our concern for fuel poverty, in response to representations that
have been made and our experience of where the private companies have
carried out their voluntary agreements, we believed that it was
necessary to bring in a new social price support mechanism and that
that too should come in to coincide with the end of the voluntary
agreements in 2011. That is why, again, this is a priority for this
Government. That is why these two measures, which derive specifically
from Government as part of our essential attack on emissions and as
part of our energy security plans, are in the Bill. They are and need
to be priorities. I hope that when members of this Committee say, as
they have been doing, &#147;Let us have this and that and something
else in the Bill,&#148; they will have in mind the realities of this
parliamentary Session. It is important that the Bill&#146;s measures
get through, because they are real priorities and I believe that they
are shared priorities across the political
spectrum.</div><a name="10010734000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
227</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000217"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Minister, thank you. I have one supplementary
question and one other thing by way of introduction. I will then leave
you to colleagues. We know that there are announcements to be made by
the Department in coming weeks; the Secretary of State referred to one
about a national programme for home insulation during Question Time
this morning in response to questions from me and others. Just so we
are clear, will you confirm which announcements you already intend to
make and whether any of them will potentially require legislation? I am
thinking in particular about any national warm homes programmes and so
on. I have seen statements of the announcements that are expected from
the Department and you will have them in your grid. Are there any
announcements that have legislative implications? Bluntly, we might
think that some of those things, understanding time constraints, could
be added to the Bill, and some of our amendments might be coming down
the track by way of Government announcements in the next few
weeks.</div><a name="10010734000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> We have presented a Bill containing our
priorities that is short enough and that will have enough consensus, we
hope, to get through in the time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>available to us. It is not our intention, therefore, to look to add
things to the Bill; we have looked very carefully at what we require.
However, as with all Bill processes, as we move through Committee, we
are always willing to listen to what is being said. It is not
impossible, as you know, Mr. Hughes, that we might not
decide to do something and all agree that that is appropriate, but it
is not something that we are planning to
do.</div><a name="10010734000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
228</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000218"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> One last question. Quite a lot of the Bill, as we
have discussed, is legislation that has secondary legislation trailed
in it, not least in relation to fuel poverty. There have already been
requests for the draft secondary legislation to be shared with the
Committee before we move on to the next stage. Is that possible in all
respects where it is referred to in the Bill? If not, what is the delay
and why can we not look at the secondary legislation in
draft?</div>
<a name="10010734000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> I have to say it is not our plan to produce
the secondary legislation in draft, particularly because we have this
very short time in which to work. We believe it is possible that the
shape of the final Bill would influence what would be in the secondary
legislation, and so do not believe it would be a proper use of time to
be drafting the relevant statutory instruments at the moment. However,
I recognise very much your interest and that of others on the
Committee, and I will, as always, try to be as helpful as possible in
answering detailed questions during the Committee stage of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="10010734000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also, of
course, want to assure you that, as you are probably aware, there will
be a full consultation on the detailed policies of the CCS initiative
and on the social price support mechanism, that the regulations
themselves are subject to affirmative resolution, and that we will be
having a full consultation on the detail of the market power licence
condition. I hope that the fact that we will have those very
substantial consultations will help Committee members to appreciate
that this is not something that we seek to avoid because we have
something to hide, and that it makes administrative sense to proceed in
this
way.</div><a name="10010734000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
229</b><a name="10010734000219"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood</b> (Bournemouth, East) (Con): I am slightly
dismayed at the way in which the Minister answered the last question,
by saying that the relatively short Session that we now face is the
reason why we have a pretty light Bill in front of us today. That said,
it could be compensated by her agreeing to amendments that would beef
up the Bill somewhat, and she is now suggesting that she is closing
that door and that, &#147;If we want to get this through, we really
need to agree what we have on the table, rather than advance anything
further&#148;.</div>
<a name="10010734000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is that not a
little short-sighted, considering that there is very much a desire on
both sides of the House to expedite this process of moving forward with
carbon capture and storage? Surely we have a vehicle here in which to
do that. If there is consensus, why can we not agree on things such as
the size of the pipes, and on the introduction of exploratory works on
looking at the inclusion of gas as well, rather than waiting for the
next opportunity for a Bill to come around under another Government?
That could be some time
away.</div><a name="10010734000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> What I am trying to make clear is, first of
all, that this is not a light Bill. These are very substantial
measures, and they are very critical to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>low-carbon transition that this country requires. Therefore, I do not
think that it is light and that it needs additions simply to beef it
up, as is being suggested. Where there may be some areas that we could
agree on, the procedure is known to everyone in this room. If there are
things that are agreed upon and they can go in, they do go in, but some
of the issues that members of this Committee have already raised are
not small measures about which there could be an easy consensus. Some
of them are major issues that could not possibly be proceeded with in
legislation, unless there had been proper consultation with all the
stakeholders, for example.</div>
<a name="10010734000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
Minister could say at the outset, &#147;I am prepared to take
anything at all around which we could agree, and put it in the
Bill&#148;, because there are things that need to be done before
legislation can be effectively drawn. In the time available, I doubt if
there are any significant measures that could be added, because it
would not be possible to do it
properly.</div><a name="10010734000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
230</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000220"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I hope that that is not the Minister&#146;s
catch-all for some of the amendments that will be put forward to try to
change things. I would hate to think that we are using the
reason&#151;sound though it may be&#151;that we are coming to the
end of the Parliament and therefore need to get this Bill through. We
heard very clearly in the first sitting that had this exact
Bill&#151;the identical wording&#151;been put in front of us five
years ago, we could have had a more substantial Bill. We would have had
more time for the consultation that the Minister speaks about, and we
could have been tackling some of the issues that are now becoming very
serious
indeed.</div><a name="10010734000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> I do not believe that any Government would
have put a Bill of this nature before the House five years ago. We just
were not developed in our thinking, and neither was anybody else. No
Government in the world have put a Bill of this kind to their
Parliament to raise a financing mechanism of this type for carbon
capture and storage projects on the scale that we
anticipate.</div>
<a name="10010734000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000221"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I invite the Minister to read the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
from the first sitting, when we had the representatives from the
companies themselves, who said that they were in a position to take
advantage of the funding schemes that are being promoted in the Bill:
they could have been utilised five years ago. Those were the facts of
the day. We are now faced with this very difficult, awkward situation,
where we are running out of time and having to squeeze through a Bill
that is not going to do enough. I do not say that it is not useful, but
it is not as useful as it could be, considering the pressure we are
under to get carbon capture and storage up and
running.</div><a name="10010734000032"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000222"></a>The

the
matter.</div><a name="10010734000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
231</b><a name="10010734000223"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): It is ironic, because when the
Energy Act 2008 was being considered we tabled amendments that were
defeated on exactly the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>same grounds being used now: that there was no need for them to be
added. Now they are being introduced with a degree of urgency in the
Ofgem remit on mandatory social tariffs. Sometimes things that are
ruled out at the time have an urgency a little bit
later.</div><a name="10010734000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ask particularly about the levy. You will be aware that in the
past we talked about a preference for funding carbon capture and
storage through the receipts from the EU emissions trading scheme. We
have been told that that money is not available: it has been spent. We
have asked, and never been told, where it has been spent or allocated
to. Could you give us that evidence? It would be very helpful for us in
formulating our views in response to the
Bill.</div><a name="10010734000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> I think I may have to refer to an official
here, because I haven&#146;t got the text in front of me, but I know
that the receipting of the moneys is made in the Treasury in the
budgetary process, and someone can probably provide us with the number
of the line in the relevant document where that information can be
found.</div><a name="10010734000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rachel
Crisp:</b></i> I think Mr. Kidney has the document
in front of him. The information is found in the Treasury Red
Book.</div>
<a name="10010734000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
232</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000224"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Could you refer to the page and
paragraph?</div><a name="10010734000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan

you.</div><a name="10010734000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bronwen

<a name="10010734000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
233</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000225"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Thank you very much. We also heard from Jeff
Chapman a couple of days ago that the way in which the levy will be
operated is a contract for difference. That is not set out anywhere in
the legislation about the nature of it. Could you describe for us a bit
more how it would work and how the contract for difference approach
would work in
practice?</div><a name="10010734000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> I could make some comments on this and ask
officials to add to them, but the fact is that we are not at this point
publishing the details of the levy, so anything we say at the moment is
still part of a discussion. We have held in-depth discussions with all
the relevant stakeholders and what we have agreed in principle is that
there should be payment based on the supply and that the suppliers
clearly would make that payment. It has been suggested that doing it on
the kilowatt-hour basis is probably the fairest way, and that the way
the payments are determined and disbursed would be on the basis of
carbon abated.</div>
<a name="10010734000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bronwen
Northmore:</b></i> The proposition of a contract for
difference is that the Government would pay the difference between what
we call a strike price&#151;the bid price for CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>abated
put in by the bidders&#151;and taking account of the carbon price,
which will fluctuate. We don&#146;t want to undermine the carbon
price in the EU emissions trading scheme. Therefore, a contract for
difference allows that to flex. There was a degree of support in
responses to the consultation. People thought that was a good
approach.</div>

234</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000226"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> One more, if I may. Tony White and other witnesses
talked about the importance of having an authority or organisation that
would manage this process&#151;not just the process of the levy, but
the contracts for the pipelines and other parts of the
process&#151;and be responsible for the scoping work, to see which
sites might be able to cope with the sequestration facilities. Have you
had a chance to consider the recommendations he made in that
respect?</div><a name="10010734000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan

course, we have had an opportunity to think about them. At the moment
we believe that this is probably a premature discussion. We need to get
ahead with our competition, with our support for CCS, to get the
demonstrations on the ground and to have that learning process. In that
learning process, we have said we will have a continuing rolling review
and report by 2018. It is in that context that we should look at
whether we need any kind of authority of this nature. It is very much a
longer-term issue. I do not think that at this stage we would
necessarily want to contemplate a regulated monopoly for carbon dioxide
transport and so
on.</div><a name="10010734000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
235</b><a name="10010734000227"></a><b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): Joan, you just mentioned the
competition. It seems a long time since the Chancellor announced the
competition. The intention is to have a plant up and running by 2014.
Is that realistic? Is that time scale going to be
achieved?</div><a name="10010734000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> During the evidence that has already been
heard in Committee there was at least one
company&#151;ScottishPower&#151;saying that it could achieve 2014
and it is in the competition. Also in the competition is E.ON, which
decided that it would not wish to invest in the new coal power station,
which it wants to be part of the competition, early enough to secure
the 2014 date. We are content that they both remain in the competition
on that basis, because what we need is to see in the round where we are
going to get the best value from the competition.</div>
<a name="10010734000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The company
that wins will not necessarily have to have its project up and running
for 2014, but it is achievable. If I remember rightly, E.ON may have
spoken about 2017. As long as we are able to start when we have planned
to in 2011&#151;and much preparation has gone ahead in the
competition process&#151;we will be content to see either of them win
the competition and provide us with the basis of very useful
work.</div><a name="10010734000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
236</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000228"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> It is not much of a competition if there is only
one competitor who can reach the finishing line at the appropriate
date. Can I reinforce a point I made in questions this morning? There
are real consequences for the indigenous coal industry in the UK. It
can now compete against the economic test, but the environmental tests
are very difficult. Unless we can burn coal cleanly, the UK coal
industry is going to close down.</div>
<a name="10010734000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
reinforce the position at Harworth: when new reserves can be opened
there is going to be a cost of &#163;200 million. The company cannot
afford that at the moment. It is talking to the European Investment
Bank and has jumped many of the hurdles but the EIB is now saying,
&#147;You have got to be able to burn this coal cleanly,&#148; and
there ain&#146;t nowhere to do it at the moment. What reassurance can
you give to miners that I represent in Nottinghamshire?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div><a name="10010734000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> The reassurance is that we are seriously
trying to get the financial mechanism in place&#151;that we plan to
do that, if we get this Bill through, by 2011. That will give
confidence like nothing else to the companies. If they have that
confidence, whoever wins the competition and whether we are talking
about a few years here or there, we will be talking about quite a
long-term project. Once the companies put themselves forward for
projects 2 to 4, in addition to the competition, then that will give
considerable confidence in a longer-term future than that contemplated
to those who mine coal in this
country.</div><a name="10010734000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
237</b><a name="10010734000229"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I wish to
continue from where Mr. Tipping left off. It could be
construed from the scenario of the last two and a half or three years
that the Government now recognise that they got it wrong in the first
place and have decided to do something about it. If that is the case, I
am perfectly happy because this is a very emerging technology. So let
me lead on to what you are doing now&#151;up to four
demonstrations&#151;because I think that is an important part of the
scenario. Can I ask what response your early estimates suggest you
might have for the demonstrations over and above the first? What you
are doing about it to encourage a
response?</div><a name="10010734000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> First of all, I do not accept in any way
that we got it wrong.</div>
<a name="10010734000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000230"></a>Mr.

<a name="10010734000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Objectively I can assure you, as I spend a
lot of my time travelling and talking to Ministers around the world,
that our leadership on carbon capture and storage is very well
recognised. We have led with the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum.
We have worked with other countries. We have got the UK-China
engagement. Therefore, I do not believe, in any way, that we have got
this wrong. It has been difficult to get through this stage with the
methodology we chose for the competition.</div>
<a name="10010734000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">People might
argue that we could have set the competition up differently, but I do
not think that overall we have in any sense got this wrong. We have
been progressing internationally as well as nationally. Let me just
make it very clear that it is no longer up to four. It was up to four,
but it has been confirmed that there will be the mechanism available
and the funding base created to secure four
projects.</div><a name="10010734000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
238</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000231"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Is it definitely
four?</div><a name="10010734000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Definitely four projects. We have also
learned a lot through the competition process and we are now better
placed to be able to select further projects on a much faster time
scale, so I think that will reassure people. The Committee will have
heard in the evidence sessions that there are companies that were
previously interested themselves in the competition and then withdrew,
but are still interested in principle and are still looking
around.</div>
<a name="10010734000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We really
take heart from the fact that two of the witnesses, if I recall
correctly, were extremely positive about the funding mechanism. One
called it the best in the world. This is what will really matter. Once
people see that that opportunity is there, we are quite confident that
people will be coming forward wanting to do CCS in the
UK.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
239</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000232"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Will you allow me to press you a little further on
a question that I raised this morning in the Chamber about the
connection between CCS and oil? It is said that the window to exploit
that possibility is not very wide. Can I ask what you are doing,
because I have not seen a great deal about that potential connection in
the stuff emanating from Government? Can you tell me what the latest
position is on that and whether the Government are going to put more
energy behind that possibility, bearing in mind the estimate that we
could get another 15 per cent. out of the North sea if we move
quickly?</div><a name="10010734000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan

carbon&#151;</div><a name="10010734000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000233"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Absolutely. To shove
down&#151;</div><a name="10010734000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Into the oil wells. As you probably know,
the Canadians and the Norwegians in particular have been successful in
doing that. We remain on very good terms with people in the oil
industry. We are constantly in dialogue with them. We have an office in
Aberdeen, which is there as an interface with the oil and gas industry.
They will be able to take advantage of this, but it is a matter for
detailed discussions with the industry itself. It does not require a
legislative base.</div>
<a name="10010734000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
240</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000234"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Forgive me, I understand that you are mates with
the industry and I am perfectly happy with that. I just want to know
what the Government are doing to further this possibility, which will
be considerably in the interests of this nation.</div>
<a name="10010734000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Our role is to engage in and facilitate
dialogue. It is for private companies themselves to decide whether they
can use this mechanism and where they could use it. Some of that will
be determined by which companies come forward to take advantage of
becoming projects 2 to 4, as to their location and as to how quickly
they might be able to provide the infrastructure that could then be
used in the oil wells in the sort of time frame that you envisage. I do
not think that that is for us to determine, except by way of good
offices and constant dialogue.</div>
<a name="10010734000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
241</b><a name="10010734000235"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Phil Willis</b> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD): I do not
share the Minister&#146;s rosy picture of our position regarding CCS.
In 2005 we had an opportunity to go ahead with the Peterhead project,
which would have made us world leaders, when BP pulled out because of
the Government&#146;s intransigence in not supporting the programme.
We could have had a full demonstrator up and running and operating. I
say that by way of comment.</div>
<a name="10010734000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
enhanced oil recovery that Brian Binley raised is absolutely crucial.
In terms of being able to get some certainty, the difficult issue, as
the Minister will know with her friends in the oil industry, is that
the gas and oil fields in the North sea have to be capped as soon as
the usable oil and gas is taken out. There is then a short window of
opportunity in which they can be opened up before the saline gets into
them and they are ruined. If we do not meet those timelines, we are
finished. I do not think that it is a matter of leaving it up to the
oil companies, it is also a matter for Government policy. I make that
point as a helpful suggestion rather than because I am trying to be
difficult.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="10010734000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am really
interested in the competition and am delighted that we are now
definitely going to have four funded projects. That is a very positive
statement. The reality is that with the first demonstrator, on which we
are about to make a decision, the whole pack of cards was stacked in
favour of post-combustion&#151;collecting CO<span class="Sub">2</span> after
combustion. In reality, if you talk to the scientists and
technologists, and to your friends in the oil and gas companies, they
are particularly interested in not simply having a silo approach to
this but in looking at creating opportunities for future economic
growth. Pre-combustion is crucial. The Chinese are more interested in
pre-combustion because they can then take the chemicals out and use
them appropriately. They could also create a hydrogen facility and a
hydrogen economy at the same
time.</div><a name="10010734000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that every one of the companies that were interested
in pre-combustion, in terms of demonstrators, pulled out because the
Government were not interested. What steps can the Minister take,
including with this legislation, to encourage companies to come back in
so that we get at least one, if not two, pre-combustion demonstrators?
If we do not have those rival technologies, both of which are going to
have global impacts, we may miss a massive opportunity and,
particularly in terms of pre-combustion, we may miss the opportunity to
create a world-leading hydrogen-producing economy.</div>
<a name="10010734000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Let me respond first to the question on
Peterhead and BP. There is a lot made of this and I do not think that
it is really as people have suggested. This, first of all, was a gas
project. We have concerned ourselves with coal as a priority. We have
made it absolutely clear that the imperative, both in terms of UK
current needs and, particularly, global needs and the continuing use of
coal, is to get CCS technology developed in a way that benefits coal
and makes it possible to have clean coal. That is our priority. BP
withdrew for a variety of reasons, probably because it believed that it
could not win the competition as it did not have a project that fitted
all the Government&#146;s criteria. It had its own reasons for moving
its capital
investment.</div><a name="10010734000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us separate things. We are not concerning ourselves at this stage with
gas; we are concerning ourselves only with coal. Having said that, we
have said that we will do the four projects and, of those projects, we
hope that two of them will be pre-combustion. I therefore think that
your point is met entirely. We want to see the demonstration of both
kinds. We thought it appropriate in the first competition to go for
just one, namely the post-combustion. Despite the assertion that China
is interested in pre-combustion, it has an enormous need for
post-combustion, as does much of the rest of the world. In making
post-combustion a priority, we were thinking very much in terms of
global needs and global markets. We think that was the right decision,
but we will ensure that we have the opportunity to make comparisons to
develop both pre and post-combustion
technologies.</div><a name="10010734000072"></a>

242</b><a name="10010734000236"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I am deeply concerned about what
the Minister has said about the competition and the time scale. If 2014
is going to slip back to 2017 or 2018, that is very significant and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>undermines our reliance on CCS meeting our targets. If we are not going
to get the first demonstrator up and running until 2017 at the
earliest, when are we likely to get the next four projects up and
running? She has said that two of them will be pre-combustion. I remind
you that, during his evidence on Tuesday, Professor Gibbins said
that</div><a name="10010734000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
will have to fit a significant amount of natural gas plant with carbon

Q94.]</div><a name="10010734000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are not having the first plant until 2017, that time scale becomes
very tight
indeed.</div><a name="10010734000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> First, I have not said that the timetable
will
slip.</div><a name="10010734000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000237"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> You have said that it may well
do.</div><a name="10010734000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> No, I did not say that either. I said that
the Committee had heard from two companies, one of which said,
categorically, that it would meet the 2014 target. The other said that
it was not continuing in the competition with 2014 as its target. It
suggested that it would be later than that because of its investment
plans as it has to build a whole new super-critical station. Those are
the facts. We have not made the decision, so we cannot say that the
2014 timetable has
slipped.</div><a name="10010734000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
still believe that there is enough going on through UK Government
endeavours, through the EU and through projects around the world, some
of which are supported by other national Governments, to make it
possible to have commercial-scale CCS up and running by 2020. That is
what we had always envisaged and we have further provision for
retrofitting on a time scale that we have described as probably five
years once proven. In no way do we believe that what we have always
said is that CCS is not entirely
doable.</div><a name="10010734000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
243</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000238"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> It is interesting that the Minister quoted Jeff
Chapman from the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, who said that
this was one of the best financial structures for CCS in the world. He
went on to say that, had this Bill been put forward five years ago,
technologies would have been no different and it would have been just
as easy to introduce the Bill five years hence. That places his
contribution in context.</div>
<a name="10010734000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
concerns the urgency that I think the Minister agrees exists. There is
an amendment to include gas in the Bill with coal. Given the
discussions we have had and the delays that may occur in relation to
coal, does it not make sense to introduce a view in relation to gas at
this stage now, bearing it in mind that gas itself may be hit with
delays in the future? It is appropriate to place it in the Bill now
because there are no guidelines on how the entire project will be paid
for. There is a levy, but we do not know how much it will cost, how it
will be managed or what the timetable is. With those unfixed parameters
and given the urgency of the need to consider gas as well as coal, I
invite the Minister to think carefully about including one demonstrator
power station for gas in addition to the four coal stations envisaged
in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10010734000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> I have a different interpretation of the
comments to which the hon. Gentleman referred. He talked about urgency,
and because we are providing a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>funding system that will be the best in the world, we are creating a
sense of urgency. The opportunity of the first call for projects 2 to 4
to emerge will come later this year, so there is no question of the
competition having to run its course before the others come on stream.
This an overlapping process, so we are in position already to get ahead
with projects 2 to 4. Should we do gas this time? We think not. There
is a whole raft of reasons why we believe we should
not.</div>
<a name="10010734000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
244</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000239"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Will the Minister quickly say what those reasons
are? There is an amendment on the matter, and it would make sense to
include gas now. It is, of course, cleaner than coal. It seems that we
need to get the wheels working, given the delays that we are about to
experience with coal.</div>
<a name="10010734000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> To repeat, there are no delays. I have just
made it very clear that if we get the legislation through, we have a
funding mechanism that could be started in the spring of next year.
That is not a delay in the parliamentary process. I have just said that
the first call on projects 2 to 4 will be later this year, so let us be
absolutely clear: there is no delay. We are doing coal rather than gas
primarily because coal is the most carbon-intensive of all
fuels.</div>
<a name="10010734000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000240"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> May I correct the Minister? I was not talking
about doing coal and not gas, but saying that we should do
both.</div>
<a name="10010734000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> We believe that we need this number of
projects&#151;&#151;of opportunities&#151;&#151;to secure coal
in our mix for the future. Without four projects, we do not think there
would be enough coal in our mix, because we have already legislated to
say that we are not prepared to have unabated coal in future. No new
power stations can come on stream with unabated coal; they will have to
meet the conditions of partial CCS. We do not believe any company will
do that without financial support from the Government. That is why we
have put the mechanism in place.</div>
<a name="10010734000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000241"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> That is completely separate from gas. We all
agree with the Minister&#146;s argument about coal, but that is
separate from, and exclusive of, our approach and the issue of when we
start the ball rolling with
gas.</div>
<a name="10010734000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> We deem four projects to be necessary. We do
not think four new or retrofitted coal projects would go ahead without
subsidy, so gas would have to be additional to that. Why do we not
think we need gas now? First, because gas emissions are half those of
coal, so we are not dealing with a fuel that is the absolute priority
now. We are already prioritising for that reason, for energy security
needs, and because coal is the fuel that is going to be used by so many
developing countries on a huge scale in the future. That is why we are
doing it. As for gas itself, the expert witnesses have said, and we
believe, that gas requiring CCS will need to be fitted at a later date,
in the
2020s.</div><a name="10010734000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not just what we can learn in this country; we need to learn from
what is happening in other countries as well. We do not need to have
everything in the UK to know how to do CCS on gas. We are expecting
other countries to do this&#151;I believe that Norway may be one of
them. We are working extremely closely with the Norwegians, and we can
learn from a project in Norway just as well as we will learn from a
project in the UK.</div>

245</b><a name="10010734000242"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): Perhaps we can put
the record straight on what would have happened five years ago. My
recollection, as somebody who has been chair of the nuclear energy
group for five years, is that five years ago this Parliament would not
have entertained anything to do with nuclear or coal, in any shape or
form. So I think, Minister, you are quite right in what you
say&#151;that five years ago we would not have gone down that road of
investing money in that. The Opposition would, of course, have taken
that precisely as their point of view&#151;that it would be a waste
of money dealing with those things. You are correct in what you
say.</div><a name="10010734000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I go back to the competition? I have some problems with the
competition. We have two companies that have gone down the competition
road and are still involved. They have done that. Why do you think that
all the other companies have said, &#147;No, we&#146;re pulling
out.&#148;?</div><a name="10010734000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Three, I think, of the original four
companies, some of which were in consortiums, have appeared already
before this Committee. They have given their own reasons, and very
sound reasons they were. I made some notes at the time, and I think
that EDF told us it was involved in other European projects and that
its focus in the UK was on nuclear&#151;that was its choice. It told
us it was going to do some CCS elsewhere, but that it is definitely
focused on nuclear, which we agree is an essential part of the energy
mix in this country. I have to say that my impression of RWE&#146;s
evidence was that it appears to want everybody else to get on and try
it out, and the company will then do it when it is ready. That was just
a matter of its investment choice, and nothing to do with what the
Government were doing. Scottish and Southern was, I think, completely
supportive of what we are doing and made it clear that it continued to
be interested, even though it had withdrawn from the competition.
Centrica, for reasons I think we can understand, wanted a gas
plant.</div><a name="10010734000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
companies all had sound reasons, which I heard myself, but the most
important thing, as I have said a number of times in this Committee, is
that we now have not only that competition&#151;it is still going on
and will produce a result&#151;but fundamentally important is that we
have the opportunity for another three companies or consortiums to come

the confidence to go ahead. We are confident that enough companies are

246</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000243"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Professor Jon Gibbins from Edinburgh university
said roughly what you are saying. His point was they would have their
eyes on the results of the initial successes of the competition. My
question is: what criteria will the people who come along afterwards
have to meet? What kind of competition rules&#151;if there are
competition rules&#151;will there be? I asked that question
yesterday. Will there be no rules? Do we just pick a company because we
like it and then go ahead with it? Surely there has to be some kind of
competition to produce what will be best for the
nation.</div><a name="10010734000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan

of the work that she has been doing on
this.</div><a name="10010734000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bronwen
Northmore:</b></i> Yes, thank you. There will need to be some
form of competitive process. We have been on a learning curve with the
first competition. We do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>not propose to hold a procurement exercise similar to the first
competition but, equally, these are large projects&#151;they are not
R and D projects and you cannot do it on the basis of an R and D-type
grant with a relatively hands-off type of award. You have to find a
middle way
forward.</div><a name="10010734000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation document that we launched and the Government responded to
in November contained a set of criteria for the sort of thing that we
thought we might want to look at. Obviously, people&#146;s bids for
the price per tonne of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>abated will be an important
criterion, but knowledge transfer and the type of project&#151;we may
want to look at clusters&#151;are also
important.</div><a name="10010734000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
247</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000244"></a>John
Robertson:</b> While you are looking at that, Jeff Chapman
from CCS Association mentioned the Alberta consultation. Have you
looked at
that?</div><a name="10010734000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bronwen
Northmore:</b></i> We are in touch with the Canadians. They
ran a very short process&#151;I think they are probably at the other
end of the spectrum, in that it was very short indeed&#151;but we
will look at their experience of getting projects up and running. They
have done their bidding process, so they have winners of the
competition, but the projects have not yet started and there is a lot
between allocating the money and getting a project up and
running.</div><a name="10010734000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
248</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000245"></a>John
Robertson:</b> It strikes me that the two companies that are
still in the competition are going to be out of pocket a lot more than
the other companies that come in at the back, so what is in it for
them?</div><a name="10010734000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bronwen
Northmore:</b></i> Well, they are in the running for funding
for their front-end engineering design&#151;FEED&#151;stage. It was
announced in the Budget that &#163;90 million was available to fund
FEED studies, so one or more of them will get that funding. Also,
because of the procurement, they are likely to get stage payments
during the plant construction process, whereas projects 2 to 4 will be
paid on the output of the completed plant. There is quite a different
payment profile between the
two.</div><a name="10010734000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
249</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000246"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Okay. My last question on that subject is: does
that mean that they will get that money over and above what everybody
else is going to get in the future projects? I am worried that
companies that have stuck by the rules and gone through the competition
might, in the long term, be more out of pocket than the companies that
are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what the results are, which
will get the benefit of the hard work done by somebody
else.</div><a name="10010734000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> There are advantages, which Bronwen has
outlined, of being in the competition, because those companies will get
the money for the initial engineering studies and they will get stage
payments. They will get a better cash flow in the process of getting
their project up and running than the others will, because the others
will have to do work and then claim money on the basis of what they
have achieved. Of course, if companies that are looking to build new
power stations beyond the four projects come forward, we will expect
them to do it with their own money. At a later stage, they will have
the benefit of the information gathered and by then, we hope, there
will be a better carbon price, so it will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>become competitive and payable. Yes, companies will get advantage from
learning, but I do not think that there will be much of a disadvantage
either way, because we will be providing quite a generous
subsidy.</div><a name="10010734000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000247"></a>John

is neither here nor there, of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
251</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000250"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Exactly. It is a complete red herring. There may
be four, but the Bill is not tied into four. The Bill could be for one;
it could be for 10; it could be for 20. It is non-specific. It simply
provides a power to provide a levy and that levy will remain in place
until the legislation&#151;if the Bill gets Royal Assent&#151;is
repealed. To say that the provision is only for coal and should only be
for coal is to tie future Administrations into a technology that will
be overtaken by other technologies in due course. It must surely make
sense to have a power now, even if it is just a power to extend the
ability from dealing just with coal-fired power stations to dealing
with other technologies as well.</div>
<a name="10010734000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan

issue is that the references to coal-fired generation could exclude

about drawing out the advantages to the first two
companies&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interr</i><i class="I">uption.</i><i class="I">]</i> You can
pay me later for that. I was particularly interested in what will
happen to the intellectual property. Clearly, the Government are going
to invest &#163;90 million to help international companies with their
design work, which will then be used for projects all over the world.
How do we tie in a share of that intellectual property? In terms of the
first one or four or more demonstrator plants which are going to be
funded by the consumer paying more through a levy, how do we tie in the
intellectual property that emerges through those demonstrator plants,
so that UK plc gets the benefit?</div>

made very clear that just because the Government are facilitating the

any kind of

it?</div><a name="10010734000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> No. We do not seek to own it and we do not
seek to buy it in that sense. What we do seek is an appropriate sharing
of information. We believe that that is not as difficult as it might
seem. Companies have a real interest in being able to learn and share
information. Clearly the Government will be the recipient of much of
that information, so it may be a little difficult to deal with, but
intellectual property, as you know very well, is owned by those who
create it. This is a matter of international law. I am just going to
ask the officials whether there is anything they want to add. This is a
very tricky area and I know you would want us to be very clear, but
that is my understanding of our
approach.</div><a name="10010734000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bronwen
Northmore:</b></i> There is an issue associated with
knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing in relation to CCS

important that we and other countries work towards maximum sharing, so
that CCS can be deployed and rolled out as fast as possible to tackle
climate change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
254</b><a name="10010734000256"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): May I seek clarity before
we get to the Committee debate on one of the other issues that was
raised in the evidence sessions on Tuesday? Green Alliance and WWF were
very positive, saying that the Bill and the approach it sets out is a
tremendous step forward, and they were very encouraging of the
development. They also argued strongly that it should be complemented
by emissions performance standards&#151;clearly a matter that will
come back again. They were careful not to be pinned down to any
specific timetable for laying down emissions standards, because they
obviously also appreciated some of the difficulties. For example, you
do not want to block off current core production by getting it wrong.
They were quite clear that there should at least be a framework and a
requirement to bring in those standards as a complement to the
development of CCS and other technologies. I would be interested in
your comments on whether, in principle, that is something you support.
Are there technical or timetabling arguments against, or is it an idea
that has some
favour?</div><a name="10010734000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> It is an idea that has some favour, in
principle. We understand very well why organisations have consistently
put it forward. However, we think it is probably something for the
future, not for now. That is because we believe it is necessary to get
carbon capture and storage technology up and running, for people to
understand it and to know the extent of emissions abatement that can
occur. That is the crucial thing we need to do during, as we envisage
it, the next decade. If we tried to bring in an emissions performance
standard at the same time, we might end up with companies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>deciding that they would not invest in CCS&#151;that having an EPS
would be a disadvantage and would deter them from investment in CCS,
from taking up the competitions and the opportunity for the
Government&#146;s subsidy to be made available to them. That is the
concern.</div>
<a name="10010734000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
just think by ourselves; we go out and consult. We have widely
consulted on this question and have got back an entirely mixed
response. There are some who think it undermines the EU ETS, there
are some who, like us, think it is premature, and there are
some who are in favour; but there is absolutely no consensus among
stakeholders that it is appropriate to bring in an EPS at this stage.
We went further and consulted with the independent Committee on Climate
Change and asked its opinion, which is that it is something to be
considered for the future but not to be brought forward at this
time.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
255</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000257"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> What is the timetable for introducing that kind
of provision? Would it not potentially be to the advantage of those
engaged in an early stage in the technology? They would be ahead of the
game in making sure they could meet whatever standards there
were&#151;and not just for coal-fired stations but across the board.
I would have thought they would be the ones that would be most pleased
to have it because they would be most likely to be there at the
beginning, meeting the necessary
standards.</div><a name="10010734000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> Well, that is where the controversy lies. As
I said, there is no consensus among stakeholders. You mentioned gas,
and of course that would be absolutely critical, if having an EPS now
were to choke off investment in new gas facilities. That would have
real implications for energy security. We have to be extremely cautious
about saying that this should be brought in now. That is critical to
how we deal with emissions. Primarily, our emissions are dealt with
through the EU ETS which is a major determinant of emissions from power
supply. We also, of course, already have our carbon budgets, which
entirely constrain our economy anyway. Companies know they are
carbon-constrained through both of those processes. It is our view,
having done the consultations including with the CCC, that at the
moment this will be premature and not necessary. Of course, however, we
have the rolling review that we are putting in place alongside the
whole CCS programme. We will be able, through that process, to ask
ourselves the question at any stage whether it would be appropriate to
bring in an additional mechanism, and that could be an
EPS.</div>

is also worth noting that of course we do not require new primary
legislation to bring in an EPS. We have existing legislation through
which we could bring in such a measure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
258</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000260"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Just one other question, following up Judy
Mallaber&#146;s question. If the Government were to be absolute about
their view about the next generation of coal-fired power stations and
said that there will be no new coal-fired power stations unless there
is complete CCS from the beginning, wouldn&#146;t that give the
industry much more certainty about what the next generation of power
stations would be, on the one hand, but also incentivise people to be
much more committed to the project, to the competition and all the
other things because they know it has to succeed? It is a bit like when
the exhaust rules were changed for cars, and the automotive industry
knew that down the track they would have to comply in so many
years&#146; time, and they all did it. They may have found it
difficult, or demanding or challenging. Wouldn&#146;t it be a better
Government policy, consistent with the Bill, to say that the next
generation absolutely has to be, from the beginning, not retrofitted
but CCS
compliant?</div><a name="10010734000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> My answer is no. I do not think that the
analogy works. If you look at the automotive industry, everyone is
producing cars and trucks so everyone has to do it. In the case of
companies involved in the energy field, they do not have to build
coal-fired power stations. The proposition that you make would be a
means of stopping all investment in new coal-fired stations. Nobody
would build new ones. We are now having to provide an incentive in
order to help people to build new coal-fired stations with around a
quarter of their capacity being CCS. If we were to require 100 per
cent. from the outset, the new coal-fired stations would not be built
in this country. Virtually all our coal-fired stations would be out of
action by 2025 at the latest. We would have no coal in our energy mix
in the future. That is something that we are not prepared to accept.
There is also, it has to be said, a small possibility that CCS in its
full construction, from capture through to transport through to
storage, will not work on a commercial scale. The proposition would be,
&#147;You must do something that you don&#146;t even know would
work at all&#148; and that is just not
feasible.</div>

Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): I will rattle through
the questions.</div>
<a name="10010734000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple of
things on social tariffs. The Bill moves us from having a voluntary
arrangement whereby energy companies offer a social tariff, to putting
it on a statutory footing. The obvious question that we have asked
other panellists before is, &#147;Does that mean that the voluntary
system has failed?&#148; But really, why do we need to do this and
what will be the benefit of moving it on to a statutory
footing?</div><a name="10010734000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> If Parliament approves it, we will from 2011
have a statutory, mandatory scheme. Between 2008 and when we do that,
we have had a voluntary scheme, and before that we had neither. Each
one is arguably a step forward in the right direction. That is my
answer to the question about whether the statutory scheme shows that
the voluntary one has failed. No, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>has not. Each one is a step along the path towards something that we all
think is
desirable.</div><a name="10010734000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the voluntary scheme, let us remember that we secured the agreement of
the energy companies to spend &#163;100 million in year one,
&#163;125 million in year two and &#163;150 million in year three.
We have had Ofgem&#146;s report on the first year, where the energy
companies noticeably over-performed&#151;they spent &#163;157
million&#151;with the result that over a million customer accounts
are benefitting from social tariffs. That is a success of the scheme on
its own
terms.</div><a name="10010734000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is it beneficial to move to a mandatory
scheme?</div><a name="10010734000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
260</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000264"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> Just before you move on. Yes, that is better than
nothing, but it still only represents 0.5 per cent. of the
energy companies&#146; turnover. That is not a huge amount. Does the
statutory footing mean that the energy companies will be spending more
money, in terms of their annual turnover, on social
tariffs?</div><a name="10010734000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> Moving on to the statutory scheme, we are
going to require energy companies to pay more money towards social
price support than they do under the voluntary agreement. That will be
roughly a doubling from the beginning. We will therefore help more
people. In that sense, it is much more money. That also answers your
question about why there is a benefit to a mandatory scheme. First, it
is now getting money, so there ought to be some parliamentary oversight
of it. Equally, along with oversight comes direction, and we are able
to direct where the money goes in order, I hope, to get the best value
and the best effect, in terms of tackling fuel poverty, from
it.</div><a name="10010734000139"></a>

Kidney:</b></i> This is where the Bill, this debate and the
consultation that we are planning for the summer come in. Our current
thinking is that we would direct help first of all towards a kernel
group of people who we think are the top priority. We have said that we
think that is the oldest, poorest pensioners. Then there will be a
broader group&#151;we have heard during the debate with witnesses
which groups might be in that one. And thirdly, on the legacy spend, we
would grandfather into the mandatory scheme the existing voluntary
arrangements that the energy companies make with their
customers.</div><a name="10010734000141"></a>

probably seen a vast drop in their income, certainly in their quality
of life. Is that in your
calculations?</div><a name="10010734000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> I do not think that the value of consultation
is delay, dither and putting things off. It is about checking your
thinking with the people who have an interest to see what they think.
It is also to make the most of the great expertise that lots of people
outside Government have. To answer your question, I want to make it
clear that we are going to consult and our mind is open to the result
of the consultation. Our thinking is that the kernel group will be
those older, poorer pensioners, and that the kinds of classes that you
are talking about would be in the second, broader group that I
described.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div><a name="10010734000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason we choose that group is that every measure and target to find
people in fuel poverty is an approximation, but we think that the most
accurate is older, poorer pensioners. We find that, in over half of the
households that are in fuel poverty, there is somebody aged 60 or
above. Also, it is a relatively stable group. People in fuel poverty
move in and out according to their income and the price and energy
efficiency of their home, but older, poorer pensioners are quite a
stable group. Another issue that should be pressing on all of our minds
in this weather is that they are a group who are greatly at risk of
excess winter deaths. That is why we make them our top
priority.</div><a name="10010734000144"></a>

263</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000267"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> We all know from constituency casework over the
years that the real issue for most consumers is knowing what the
cheapest offer is, and being able to turn to it and use it. Do
Ministers therefore accept that whatever else there may be, the key
mechanism should be to require the companies to make whatever their
cheapest offer is at any one time available to all these people, in the
categories that are the vulnerable, starting with the group you have
just described? Is the starting point going to be,
&#147;You&#146;ve got to make the cheapest offer&#148;? If the
answer to that is yes, which I hope it is, is it still the
Government&#146;s view that there will have to be additional
financial support to subsidise for the fuel-poor below what the
companies can produce as their cheapest
offer?</div><a name="10010734000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> First of all, to be clear, the answer to your
first question is not yes; it is no, in terms of our thinking. Let me
go on to explain that. I think you are asking about two separate
issues. The first one is how we deliver this social price support. One
way would be to legislate, to say, &#147;Thou shalt give thy lowest
social tariff to this group of people&#148;. That is not what we are
proposing. What we are proposing, again subject to the consultation,
is, &#147;Thou shalt knock off everybody&#146;s electricity bill
this amount of money&#148;. We would state the amount of money that
they must knock off everybody&#146;s
bill.</div><a name="10010734000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
choose that, first, because of the problems you describe, about cutting
through all the verbiage about which is the best tariff. Secondly, the
electricity bill is something that is common to nearly every energy
consumer in the country, whereas some social tariffs would be for gas
users and that is completely irrelevant to people who are off the gas
grid. Thirdly, it is transparent and clear, so nobody is in any doubt
what the benefit is and we do not have to worry about the information
that is given alongside it, and it is least likely to disrupt what is a
competitive market among the suppliers in seeking customers. We heard
the concern from some of the witnesses that if they were required to
offer their best tariff to this group of people, they frankly would not
be very enthusiastic about trying to find such
people.</div><a name="10010734000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
answer to your question is that at the moment our mechanism is
straightforward: money off the electricity bill for everybody. That
still does not mean that I say you are asking a poor question about
information to customers. They should know what is the best tariff for
them in their personal circumstances. Ofgem has come to that conclusion
just as we have, and the new licence condition that you have described,
which starts this month, will require the energy companies to give all
their customers an annual statement, each and every year starting this
year, in which they must state what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>tariff is that the person receiving the bill is on and how that compares
with the standard charge they make for people on their monthly direct
debits, which is effectively the most common offer that they make of a
low tariff to
everybody.</div><a name="10010734000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
264</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000268"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> May I pursue that? I understand what you say and I
am grateful for it, but the risk is that if the offer is money off your
electricity bill, there are still going to be quite a lot of people,
particularly the elderly, the very elderly, the not very well and so
on, who can have the information sent through their letterbox but will
actually stay with what they have got because that is what people do. A
lot of people have not been used to changing their electricity
supplier. They have British Gas or whatever, and that is what they stay
with. The public purse, or the industry, will then be subsidising
tariffs that could be lower. People could be on the lower tariff but
they have not changed to it and will still be on a higher tariff and
will be getting something off that. Surely we need to make sure that we
bring everybody down to the lowest tariff, before we give them money
back, otherwise we are wasting money somewhere in the system, spending
money that need not be
spent.</div><a name="10010734000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> The consultation will test whether that
opinion is a stronger one that the one I am putting forward today. I
just want to challenge you in this way: what we find from the voluntary
agreement is that for some people on the lowest tariff available from
their energy company&#151;remember Ofgem has required what companies
call their social tariff to be their lowest one&#151;the benefit is
about &#163;20, compared to what another tariff would have been. We
are talking about a much more substantial payment than that, towards
everybody&#146;s electricity bill. I think that the actual common
benefit, which they will not have to claim&#151;they will get
it&#151;is much better, but I still say that does not excuse us from
needing to make sure consumers get the right information to make the
best choice for themselves in the energy that they
buy.</div><a name="10010734000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
265</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000269"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> I was wondering whether you could describe your
thinking about the arrangement for the kernel group, as you described
it, and for winter fuel payments. All pensioners get winter fuel
payments but, as I understand it, only 12 per cent. of them are in fuel
poverty. What is the relationship between winter fuel payments and
social tariffs into the
future?</div><a name="10010734000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> None. As I have said to you, our thinking is
that we want to target this benefit at the most vulnerable pensioners.
We intend&#151;as best we can, given the paucity of direct
information that we have on these issues&#151;to make sure that the
people who get this benefit are the ones who really need it. As to
targeting, a lot of work has been done that. Some of it will be tied to
benefits, such as pension credit, that older pensioners receive. If
this year&#146;s data-matching pilot shows that we can find all the
right people and then they automatically get their benefit, that would
be a great step forward that we would then use in the future in this
scheme. I think Charles Hendry asked about the issue this morning:
going forward, if it is successful, we would like to extend it to other
areas, targeting other groups who ought to get this benefit in the
future. Charles was quite right that Parliament requires Governments to
get primary legislative approval for each data-matching that we do in
the future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
266</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000270"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> Can I take you back to the discussion you had with
Simon Hughes? If you are having a flat-rate rebate in terms of your
bill&#151;and I understand it is a simple way of dealing with
that&#151;the reality is that people who are in the greatest fuel
poverty are often people, as we heard earlier today, who do not have
access to internet accounts or bank accounts. They are paying the
highest at the moment, particularly in terms of prepayment meters. You
may well get a poor customer who has a bill of &#163;1,000 because
they have to pay the highest tariff. At the same time, somebody who is
using the same units of electricity could have a bill of &#163;400.
There is that difference between the two tariffs. A flat-rate premium
of a &#163;100 rebate would mean 10 per cent. off the top-rate tariff
and 25 per cent. off the lower tariff. I do not understand your logic
there unless I have missed something. I am a simple
creature.</div><a name="10010734000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> I think you are making the wrong assumption
that the lowest tariff a company charges would dramatically reduce
those people&#146;s bills. I have just given the example to Simon
Hughes that for some people the difference from being on the lowest
tariff with their supplier is only &#163;20 a year. It is not a huge
benefit to begin
with.</div><a name="10010734000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
267</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000271"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> With respect, Minister, you know that generally
speaking the poorest people are paying the highest tariffs. Prepayment
meters for the poorest people are incredibly expensive, compared with
the tariffs that Simon Hughes gets in his luxury flat in
London.</div><a name="10010734000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> I want to come to that aspect because that is
not precisely the tariff issue. It is about the charge that the energy
companies make for the way in which people pay their bills. There is no
doubt that Ofgem&#146;s energy retail market probe demonstrated that
some customers were being charged far more, simply for the way in which
they paid their bills, be it a prepayment meter or by sending a cheque
every quarter rather than by direct debit. They were being charged far
more than any objective justification of the extra costs involved in
administering a prepayment meter or taking a cheque rather than a
direct debit.</div>
<a name="10010734000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
September, there has been a licence condition in place outlawing that
kind of activity, and I would like to think that a lot of that problem
is now behind us. There remains an issue, which Simon Hughes has raised
with witnesses before now, about the differential that there is between
paying by direct debit and the other ways of paying. That goes far
beyond tackling fuel poverty. It is a debate that we will probably have
in answer to an amendment that Simon Hughes has tabled for discussion
in Committee and which I will be
answering.</div><a name="10010734000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010734000272"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Can I just say that the panel has had an
hour and a half, which is about all that they were expecting? The first
witness did not come, however, so we can go on a bit. I am sure that
the panel will not mind as there are a few more questions to be put. I
ask those who want to take part to bring their questions fairly quickly
to a close, but I would not want to deprive the Committee of the
opportunity of having Mike Weir and John Robertson asking their
questions. Mike
Weir.</div><a name="10010734000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
268</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000273"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> We have heard conflicting evidence or opinion on how
the new duties on Ofgem to take account of carbon emissions and
security of supply will affect the way in which it works. What is your
opinion? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>What do you expect will change with Ofgem as a result of these new
duties?</div><a name="10010734000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> What a whole number of witnesses told you
has confirmed to me that we were right in the way that we approached
this. We all acknowledge that Ofgem has moved substantially in recent
times. I think that some of that movement is down to the creation of
DECC and the dynamism of our Secretary of State. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] We have seen
considerable movement which has correctly tackled issues both of
security of supply and of climate change and the need to reduce
emissions.</div>
<a name="10010734000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we are
doing here is really consolidating that movement and ensuring that it
continues. We are also making it very clear that this is the right way
forward and this is what Ofgem needs to do in terms of its thinking on
how it carries out its primary duty to consumers. Therefore it can and
cannot&#151;depending on which way you go&#151;be challenged on
what it is doing. So it is very much clearer than the external
pressures being put on it, which I acknowledge we have done as
Government. It is much clearer what its duty is and what it has to take
into account and so the sort of movement that we have seen in recent
times will continue and be legitimised. You heard that from a whole
host of witnesses from both companies and the NGO
sector.</div><a name="10010734000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
269</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000274"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> There has always been the sense that the
Government will set the framework and Ofgem, as a regulator, will then
implement it. There is a potential confusion here in that as
Ofgem&#146;s remit is changed, it can then decide the relative
importance of affordability, security of supply and low carbon. How
does one, with the measures that the Government have put in place,
ensure that the Secretary of State, rather than an unaccountable
regulator, has primacy in deciding
policy?</div><a name="10010734000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> We do not share your interpretation,
Charles. We really think that it is very clear where our policy
direction and our duties lie as a Government in terms of making policy.
What we have done here is not to change the remit, but to clarify it.
This is not a change. Ofgem&#146;s primary duty remains the
protection of existing and future consumers. This is quite subtle, but
nonetheless rather important. I am reassured by the evidence on that
that we have heard in this Committee, both from private companies and
the voluntary
sector.</div><a name="10010734000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
270</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000275"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> There was much less agreement among witnesses
about the nature of clause 27, and many people did not understand why
it was necessary; they were concerned that it was something that
perhaps Ofgem should be doing, even if it was not doing it properly. I
sense that this would be the appropriate home for these sorts of
measures for looking after the interests of disadvantaged customers.
Could you take us a bit more clearly through your thinking as to why
you felt it necessary to do this, particularly, to pick up the point
made by Rupert Steele, that it does seem to include an element where,
if the evidence isn&#146;t there, the Secretary of State can make
whatever assumptions he or she
wants?</div><a name="10010734000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> I am glad to pass that really tricky
question to my colleague.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div><a name="10010734000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> It is a backstop power that has been there
since the Utilities Act 2000. Our thinking in bringing it back to
Parliament&#146;s attention now is this: the probe that I mentioned
drew attention to this group of customers who were benefiting from
deals from their suppliers through dual supply. They were getting their
gas and electricity from one company and were benefiting in the sense
that other electricity consumers were effectively paying a subsidy for
the gas they consumed. That would be particularly disadvantageous to
people off the main gas grid, because they never could benefit from the
subsidy for their gas consumption. Ofgem has stepped in with a licence
condition to prevent that from happening in the
future.</div><a name="10010734000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
legal advice at the time was that, because it was dual fuel users of
gas and electricity, the power in the Utilities Act 2000, which put
this backstop in the Electricity Act 1989 for the privatised
electricity utilities and in the Gas Act 1986 for the privatised gas
utilities, might not cover this suggestion. That is why Sarah Harrison
told you that this is about plugging a gap. That is all it is about in
terms of making sure that we can rely on the power if we ever were to
use
it.</div><a name="10010734000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has not been used since 2000, so it is legitimate to ask why it should
be on the statute book at all. I elicited from Sarah Harrison, however,
why it is useful. The energy companies have to give their agreement to
those very licence-condition changes that Ofgem used to stop the abuse
of the electricity customers. If they do not give their agreement, it
goes to a process through the Competition Commission. Sarah Harrison
confirmed that it is quite useful for the energy companies to know,
when they decide whether to give their agreement or not, that, if they
withhold it, the Secretary of State might step in with something worse.
I think it is a useful backstop power and I am happy to give an
assurance on the record that it is intended as a backstop for those
kinds of
situations.</div><a name="10010734000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
271</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000276"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The assurance on the record has no legal force
whatever, does it? It is interesting to compare this with what Joan
said at the beginning of our discussions&#151;that the Bill is
focusing only on the things that are urgent and must be done now
because there is a pressing need for them, and that other things are
being kept out of the Bill because of that. But this is a power that
has not been used so far and we have no idea when it might ever be
used. That seems slightly out of kilter with what we were told
earlier.</div><a name="10010734000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Kidney:</b></i> I am not flagging this up as a particularly
significant power. It is filling a gap in previous legislation while we
have the legislative opportunity. I do not make much of it if you do
not make much of it. There is a legal precedent in Pepper <i class="I">v.</i>
Hart that if there is some doubt about the interpretation of
legislation, the judges are entitled to look at what people said on the
record. To that extent, I hope that what I have said is
useful.</div><a name="10010734000170"></a>

272</b><b class="B"><a name="10010734000277"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I got into quite a discussion with all the
groups the other day about the market power licence condition. Rupert
Steele from ScottishPower took one side and felt that it was going to
attack investment, while Ofgem thought that it was a really good idea
and thoroughly supported the Bill. Is this primarily to help the
consumer and will it stop investment in the way that Rupert Steele
claimed?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div><a name="10010734000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Joan
Ruddock:</b></i> It is most certainly there in order to help
the consumer. Ofgem has made a calculation, which is only an estimate,
that it may have cost the consumer &#163;125 million in excess
charges of certain kinds that have been levied as a result of balancing
mechanisms. It has thought for a long time that there were abuses in
the system and that it was necessary to deal with them. When Ofgem has
investigated with a view to taking action, it has found it very
difficult indeed to mount a case in which it had confidence when using
the existing rules. That is not to suggest that Ofgem is making it up
that something is happening; it has good evidence that something is
happening, but it is not able to address it effectively in the interest
of consumers at present. That is why we are putting the market power
licence condition into the
Bill.</div><a name="10010734000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that it will act as a deterrent&#151;not to investment, but to
what is perhaps going beyond normal commercial practice. We are not
denying that there can be commercial advantages because of constraints
and that this is how a market operates, but it is suggested to us, and
Ofgem seriously believes, that charges have been made and practices
have been undertaken that are not in the best interests of
consumers.</div><a name="10010734000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
ask about deterring investment. We do not believe that there is reason
to think that a narrowly drawn licence of this kind is going to deter
investment. I think a number of the witnesses from whom we heard
specifically said that they were not against it, provided that it was
properly targeted and narrowly drawn. I think ScottishPower may have
been rather against it in general, but others were not.</div>
<a name="10010734000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now, is that
a Scottish thing? At the moment the constraints are more significant
between England and Scotland. That is perfectly true, but because of
how renewables in particular are going to develop, we expect new
constraints to occur. They might be in different parts of the UK and
there might be other things that crop up that will need addressing.
That is why we are doing
it.</div><a name="10010734000175"></a>

renewable heat incentive, and indeed feed-in tariffs, will bring to
people to drive developments of renewable technologies in those areas;
and the micro-generation strategy update,

you put a provision in the Bill, or support an amendment to the Bill,
that could reduce the number of tariffs any utility company could offer

don&#146;t
you?</div><a name="10010734000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

companies how to run their businesses to that degree; I would need to
check on that. I would be very reluctant to consider an amendment such
as that although, as the Department&#146;s consumer champion, I am
all in favour of simplicity of charges and good information for
customers so that they can understand them. However, I am very hesitant
about the actual assertion you
made.</div><a name="10010734000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
before I finish, Mr. Atkinson, could I just clarify two
things? One is that I did not specifically answer Charles
Hendry&#146;s point about clause 27(7). I just want to say that the
assumptions and calculations referred to in that subsection are, of
course, governed by the purpose of the clause. That purpose is to
determine whether there have been disadvantaged customers and, if so,
what to tell the energy companies to do to take away that disadvantage.
So it is limited to that respect, but I am sure that we will debate
that directly in Committee.</div>
<a name="10010734000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point is that I said that people would automatically receive the money
off their electricity bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>if they were fuel-poor in the kernel group. That was on the assumption
that data matching works, so I think I ought to make it clear that if
it did not work I would have to find some other solution. It is
possible that there would be a small number of people, even if data
matching does work, who would not get caught by that, but who would
still be eligible if only we knew about them. There would still be a
facility for them to apply and get the
