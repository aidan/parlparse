<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): The last moments before lunch were taken up by the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). He has left the Room, so I cannot reply to him, but he was praising his constituency, particularly Pluckley, which was the location of ``The Darling Buds of May''. I was moving the amendments and speaking about land used for making films or television programmes when my hon. Friend made the perfectly serious remark, that quite a lot of outside land is used almost permanently for such work, which raises issues of access, disturbance and security.
<P>
I realise that we are debating a very large group of amendments, and that I have several to cover before I reach the important issues. They are none the less important, and although I am in favour of a light-hearted approach during the Committee stage, the amendments deal with genuinely serious inquiries.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 49 and 65 are about fish farming. I suspect that some people may wonder why fish farming involves the use of land if it always takes place in water. That is not always the case, because fish farms are often found in above ground tanks or hatcheries, and some rearing, particularly of trout, takes place in such tanks, which may be located in areas that would otherwise be open country.
<P>
Fish farms are extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Fish are obviously valuable, and some people might wish to steal them if they had free access. There is a serious risk of infection, and fish are rather susceptible to disease. The farming operation could be disturbed. Fish farms need no buildings, and we would argue that the exclusion of a building would not, of itself, exclude fish farming. We argue that such land should be excepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): My hon. Friend may recall that, last week, we discussed whether water in high areas should be exempted. The Minister dismissed that in an airy sort of way, saying how important it was to step across brooks when on a walk. Does my hon. Friend agree that fish farming in some upland areas, particularly in lakes, might be exactly what we should be concerned about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Although I have just used the example of above ground tanks, the land used for fish farming should be excepted in any context.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 refers to land covered by a chairlift or cable car, for safety reasons, which are self-„explanatory.
<P>
I assume that amendment No. 51 is blatantly obvious, but I do not see it being included in the list of exceptions. It would include land comprising the grounds of a hospital, school or college. The Minister may argue that the word curtilage should cover that, but the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) told us this morning about the legal debate about what land curtilage might include. There are obviously community safety implications in allowing access to the grounds of hospitals, schools or colleges, including the personal safety of staff and pupils and damage to property. Indeed, schedule 7 allows for the stopping up of highways on schools grounds for those very reasons. We therefore argue that we should carefully consider the access provisions and that a similar approach should apply—that it should not be classified as open country. Clearly, it would be daft to stop up a footpath along a defined route in school grounds if the legislation defines the whole area as open country.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 raises an obvious and minimal, but none the less important, point. Land covered by satellite, television or radio transmitters should be excepted.
<P>
Amendment No. 54 relates to land comprising a scheduled ancient monument, and perhaps has wider implications than some of the other amendments. Scheduled monuments are of national importance, and I am sure that we would all wish them to be maintained for future generations. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 provides for public access to monuments held under the Act. Many monuments are in private hands, but English Heritage and local authorities are able to extend access by entering into guardianship agreements. If the Bill were to extend access, that could result in ancient monuments being damaged, which the Government have recognised by providing for exclusions under clause 24 to preserve ancient monuments. However, I argue that it would be more sensible to exclude scheduled monuments from the regime entirely, so that voluntary agreements could be developed, site by site. Otherwise, without rehearsing previous debates about remaining on or walking over, it is possible that some fringe organisations will want to use ancient monuments for ritual purposes.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 returns to the matter of water, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray). We debated last week whether water should be excluded, but the amendment relates to land that mainly consists of ponds, lakes, streams and other watercourses. We appreciate that the restrictions in schedule 2 include banning the use of vessels or sailboards and we heard the Under-Secretary say that it would be all right to carry a canoe but not to use one. I know that he was trying to ridicule the debate, and he succeeded. Nevertheless, the issue is clear. There is little value in having a formal right of access over such land.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether the amendment also applies to river-banks or canal footpaths?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Neither footpaths nor river-banks are included in the definition of open country. I am obviously conscious that there is a body of opinion that thinks that the access provisions should be extended to those areas, which we might debate later, but as they are not currently so classified, the amendment does not relate to them.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 89 and 122 are, in my opinion, especially important because they are relevant to my constituency. Race courses are excepted, which is sensible for all sorts of reasons, but we believe that land used for gallops, or other exercise grounds for horses, should also be included. Amendment No. 122 would insert the word
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>including any land used for exercising or training racehorses.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear to anyone who knows about them that racehorses are highly strung animals, which can be quickly spooked or frightened. That can present a risk to all sorts of people: the person riding the horse, those who disturb it or innocent bystanders watching from the roadside or from further afield, if the animal breaks away.
<P>
Hon. Members who have been to Newmarket will have seen how the whole town revolves around horse racing. Several areas of Newmarket heath and other areas make up the gallops. In the morning, one can see trainers with long strings of horses, practising and training. Many people gather along the side of the road in the mornings to watch, especially at weekends, as it is a remarkable and attractive scene. I take my friends to see events when they come to visit; it is something unique to show people. Nobody starts to walk across the heath when the horses are being trained or exercised.
<P>
We must ensure that the exclusions cover such grounds as well as racecourses. Where a racecourse ends and the training ground begins is a moot point. My constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) adjoin on Newmarket heath, on which there are two racecourses and an area in the middle where horses are exercised. It is highly questionable where the racecourse ends and the exercise ground begins, and it would probably be far easier to exclude the lot.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 seeks to introduce the words ``Any developed land'' into the exceptions. It is inconsistent to treat particular forms of development as excepted land in the schedule, but not all developed land. The explanatory notes to the Bill state that developed land is excepted land. On Second Reading, the Minister for the Environment said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Rights of access will not apply to developed land.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 723.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
During the same debate, the Under-Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The statutory right . . . will not prevent development of land.—[Official Report, 20 March 1999; Vol 346, c. 815.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our advice is that those statements are incorrect in relation to the current drafting of the Bill. We therefore believe that schedule 1 should be amended to make the matter clear. We are not taking issue with what either Minister said, but with whether the Bill says the same thing. I hope that the Government will address that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 141 would insert into the schedule
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such land is a matter of principle that will be discussed later during our consideration of the Bill. Perhaps more than any other matter, it highlights the potential—I stress the word ``potential''—conflict in the Bill between access and conservation. Inevitably, a balance must be found. My view is that conservation should always take precedent, although others may hold different views. There is little point in extending protection for sites of special scientific interest elsewhere in the Bill if such areas can be wandered over by people using their right of access.
<P>
A large proportion of heather moorland is under some form of protection, although not necessarily under. SSSI measures; such land could be a special protection area, for instance. Heather moorland sites contain some of our most delicate habitats and are home to many protected or endangered species, including the Dartford warbler, the Glanville fritillary and early gentian on the Isle of Wight. Six of the birds on Europe's red list of the most threatened birds are moorland breeding birds, while a further six feature on the amber list. Such birds have a long breeding season, and we shall discuss them further later.
<P>
Article 3 of the 1985 EEC directive on endangered birds states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Member States shall take the requisite measures to preserve, maintain or re-establish areas of habitats for all of these birds.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are the Government are satisfied that those European obligations will not be harmed by the Bill if SSSIs are not excluded? Clause 24 allows for exclusion of access to SSSIs, but I think that it would be much better to rule them out altogether.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I accept that it is perfectly sensible to allow access to some SSSIs and that such access will not conflict with their purpose. However, voluntary arrangements could apply where such access is appropriate. That would be better than allowing access to all such sites.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lepper:</B> The hon. Gentleman has almost anticipated the issue that I was going to raise. Is it his understanding that 50 per cent. of open country in England has SSSI designation and that many of those sites have access agreements without there being any problems?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Yes. I am not sure that 50 per cent. of that land has SSSI protection, but it does have a form of protection. My contention is that it would be better to start with no access to SSSI land and make positive exceptions. That would be better than allowing appropriate bodies to exclude areas of SSSI when they think it necessary.
<P>
We are moving to the end of the beginning. Amendments Nos. 58, 59 and 64 seem pedantic, but we are puzzled by the use of the plural ``buildings''. It implies that there has to be more than one building on a site before there is an exclusion. It is a simple query, to which I am sure the Minister has an answer. The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 refers to ``building'' rather than ``buildings''. Paragraphs 10 and 2 should also use the singular, which is the purpose of amendment No. 58.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 relates to the issue of curtilage. The Bill defines land as having a curtilage, but land does not have a curtilage—a building has a curtilage— which is why we have suggested removing ``such land'' and inserting ``a building''. The Court of Appeal recently confirmed in the Skerritts case that no piece of land could be in the curtilage of more than one building. Paragraph 2 risks an error by referring to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land covered by buildings or the curtilage of such land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be safer to refer to the curtilage of a building, which is the purpose of amendment No. 59.
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 61 and 121 are probing amendments and may be superfluous. The Bill sensibly exempts aerodromes from access provisions, which no one would dispute. However, we are not clear about the definition of an aerodrome. Does it include a heliport? [Interruption.] The Minister laughs, but there are examples of areas in which only helicopters operate. We need to sure about that definition for the sake of clarity. In addition, a non-commercial or private landing strip would not be grand enough to boast the title of aerodrome but, nevertheless, it could give rise to similar risks.
<P>
I do not apologise for taking a long time to move the amendment. The amendments in the group are different. They relate to land or property that should be considered for exclusion. The Minister might argue that many are covered by phraseology in the Bill, and we are open to being convinced on that. With the possible exception of the SSSI issue, none of the amendments would dramatically change the availability of land. The areas are not huge, but they could be critical to people who live in those localities whose livelihoods might be affected, and to the safety of walkers, about which we must be concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): Amendment No. 147 in my name relates to golf courses. The hon. Member for Ashford got so excited about it that he issued a press release to the Press Association on 30 March in which he alleged that golf courses
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>could be thrown open to ramblers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This Labour amendment would allow anyone to walk across a golf course, disrupting play whether inadvertently or deliberately. It would be dangerous for walkers and hugely irritating for golfers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suppose that that relates to the rotten and unethical behaviour of ramblers that the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex mentioned. The hon. Gentleman rounded off his press release by saying that I want
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to make life miserable for golfers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is absurd.
<P>
A number of golf courses are in open country, as defined by the Bill. If the Bill is unamended, it will extinguish customary rights of access, which are enjoyed by many people, to walk across golf courses. Golf course owners might turn a blind eye now, but what if a course is transferred to another owner? The law of the land will extinguish pre-existing customary rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I would venture to suggest that pre-existing rights are linear rights. There are two issues to consider. One is whether people should be allowed to walk across fairways, which might damage them, and the other is a matter of safety. I am not a golfer, but has the hon. Gentleman ever had a golf ball in his head?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> In my head?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Sorry, on his head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> That is the customary precision that we expect from lawyers. No, I have never been struck by a golf ball, or anything else for that matter.
<P>
The Open Spaces Society, the Ramblers Association and other organisations on the Opposition's hit list have told me that the public have a right of access over a number of golf courses. For example, Doddington golf course near Wooler in Northumberland is on a heather moor. People walk over it to enjoy the ancient settlements—that should interest the hon. Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) who stressed the importance of ancient settlements—and the rocks, which have curious cup-and-ring marks. People do not stick to the paths to see the fascinating rocks, which are on the edge of the golf course, but wander over the course when it is safe to do so. People who walk in the countryside are sensible. They will not walk across a fairway if a game of golf is in progress. People do not want to be struck on the head by a golf ball.
<P>
The golf course at Brackenber moor near Appleby in Cumbria is registered common land with no right of access. However, it is rough land over which people wander. No one wants to stop golfers playing their game, but we want to preserve people's rights to walk freely over golf courses, many of which are in beautiful parts of the country. If, during an important tournament, it was important to keep the public off the golf course, the restriction provisions in the Bill could be triggered.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I do not intend to spend long discussing each amendment in this large group, though I shall mention in passing amendment No. 204, which I tabled. I declare an interest, in that I am a member of Wincanton race course. That could have a bearing on the matter of exclusion affecting race courses and gallops.
<P>
I do not entirely go along with the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and his exhaustive list. His fertile imagination did the Committee a service in envisaging the many possibilities, such as fish farms at the top of mountains. However, his point was important. The definition provision is imperfect and does not deal with some circumstances that might, but equally might not, be held to be common sense. Some of the amendments in the group are important. Land used for gallops is usually contiguous with open land of one sort or another, which raises the issue of whether it is included in access land. Problems could arise about that. The hon. Gentleman shied away from discussion of amendment No. 91, about land in Wales
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>known as coed cae or ffridd land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Interruption.] I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. It has not been selected. Had it been, I should have spoken to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It has been moved into the next group. I shall discuss it when we reach that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who was more alert than I.
<P>
The point raised by the hon. Gentleman about the reference to land
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>covered by buildings or the curtilage of such land<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
was a good one. The Minister would do well to consider the wording carefully, as it seems likely to cause problems. I agree that land does not have a curtilage—buildings do.
<P>
Excluding all sites of special scientific interest from the Bill, as amendment No. 142 would provide, would, as the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) intimated, wreck the Bill, since so much open land is part of those sites. However, a large proportion of those SSSIs are geological ones and there is no reason to restrict access to most geological sites. There is a need for conservation bodies carefully to assess whether there are risks to conservation. I believe that later provisions provide for relevant restrictions; we shall put that to the test.
<P>
Amendment No. 204 deals with the slightly different matter of land on which an ecological or other experiment is being done. There are a few permanent sites of that kind and it would defeat the object of scientific research and the Bill if those rare areas of land were included in open access. They would not, as far as I can see, be susceptible to exclusion by virtue of other definitions in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) raised an important issue in drawing attention to paragraph 6. Why are there these specific exclusions in the Bill? Why are golf courses, race courses and aerodromes excluded? Why are they considered land that cannot be walked across, but not analogous areas used by other sports. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made the point that cricket pitches are often situated on the edge of open land. There seems to be no specific reason why a cricket pitch should be considered differently from a golf course. I have been hit on the head by a cricket ball and by a golf ball and they both hurt. Why should a race course be included, but not gallops? Why should an aerodrome be included, but not other landing strips? There is a problem with definition. The Minister could help us by explaining why those specific exemptions are made and not others. Or he could explain to us why there are not many more because there are other areas that fall into a position similar to a gallop or cricket pitch.
<P>
This group of amendments gives us the chance to explore the Minister's thinking and the definitions that are being written into schedule 1. I do not believe that the wording is adequate for the purposes for which the Minister intends. The Committee should not agree this plethora of amendments, intriguing though many of them are. We are indebted for a definition of war games to my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. I believe that that could be useful in future legislation. He is claiming from a sedentary position, that it is not an original definition. Why the Bill is worded in the way that it is, whether it covers all the eventualities that we would wish it to and whether it extends further than we would wish are all questions that have not been answered. The Committee must give its consideration to those matters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire dealt effectively with the major grouping of amendments. I want to address the question of gallops as opposed to race courses and to say a word about the hon. Member for Pendle's proposal on golf courses. I do not play golf, but I can see that it would be irksome if people were to wander across the course as one was about to make an ace shot. Equally, I do not see how it is possible—given the hon. Gentleman's point—to make a blanket restriction against walkers because of the localities of some golf courses. Therefore, I am unable to agree with him.
<P>
On the question of gallops, it is important that the Committee and Ministers pay careful attention to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. On Newmarket heath, the Berkshire downs, at Lambourne in Berkshire and in Yorkshire around Malton, there are some of the major training centres for racehorses in Britain. I am not sure whether I need to include Newmarket heath in my remarks because I suspect it has a substantial body of byelaws, which may or not may not come within the compass of the Bill. It would be dangerous for people to walk across these gallops, which are often in remote and out of the way places, when large numbers of horses are working on them, some of them at great speed and often in bad visibility. There is a safety aspect to this; not necessarily for the walkers, who I am sure would use their heads, but for the horses and the work riders. This is not special pleading. There is a distinct difference between the situation at race courses and on gallops. On race courses, horses run under highly controlled and disciplined conditions, and with strict rules on how, when and where they can run against each other. However, the gallops are largely unregulated, and rightly so, because they are used for training rather than for public racing. Valuable horses are trained on such sites by brave young men and women, whose activities may present a danger to people who walk across the gallops. Will the Minister consider that matter?
<P>
Finally, let me turn to the problem of curtilage. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is a skilled and learned lawyer and is experienced in this matter, so I hope that Ministers will pay close attention to his remarks. Concern about giving people the chance to walk in places where there are buildings, barns, stables, kennels and byres where there are lambs, sheep, cattle and goodness knows what else will run through the whole of our consideration of the Bill. It is important that the rules are clear on access in and around such buildings. Will the Minister provide clarification?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> There are times when farmers need to bring livestock nearer the farmstead, such as when lambing occurs. It is vital at such times that the animals are not disturbed. I am not saying for one moment that walkers would want to disturb them, but they would do so by their very presence, especially if they are travelling in numbers. Their presence could lead to abortions and other such problems. All of us who have lived in rural areas have seen such disturbances, and great care must be taken in drafting the definition.
<P>
It will surprise the hon. Member for Pendle to learn that I had sympathy for his remarks. When current or ancient rights to walk are in place, they should be preserved at all costs. I am proud to say that my constituency contains a championship golf course called Aberdyfi, to which there are rights of access. The arrangements have worked well for many years and I hope that they will continue to do so for many years to come. I shall endeavour to be concise and more precise than I was when I last addressed this point, which concerns the danger to which people may be exposed and the risk that too many visitors will damage fairways. Such damage will not be caused intentionally, but by the mere presence of people who are probably wearing walking boots and so on. Such footwear is, of course, normal kit, but it is not proper for a golf fairway.
<P>
As I understand it, a list of exceptions that is contained in a schedule in legislation is usually exclusive and therefore cannot be added to easily. If I am wrong, we can resolve all the problems that have been discussed. Could the matters about which hon. Members have spoken so eloquently be dealt with by order? Could they be dealt with legitimately by the local forums? Could exceptions be made because of local circumstances? Hon. Members have spoken eloquently and properly about many local circumstances, some of which might be especially telling in given localities. I have two questions: first, will the forums be able to deal with such matters? Secondly, can exceptions be introduced subsequently by order? The answer may be yes, but I do not know. However, those might be ways of dealing with the current impasse between the Government and the Opposition on this matter.
<P>
All the points made were valid and worthy of discussion. Heliports, for instance, are becoming more common nowadays and they are extremely dangerous for anybody who happens to walk across them when an aircraft is about to land. Will the Minister consider those points?
<P>
It is accepted that cultivated land will not be subject to new rights of access, but the schedule provides no guidance on how the concept of cultivated land should be interpreted. In the Committee on 28 March, the Minister for the Environment noted that land used for hay and silage crops would not be mapped as open country—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member while he is in full flow, but I am advised that cultivated land is the subject of the next group of amendments. The hon. Member may wish to reserve his remarks until we reach that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am obliged, Mr. Stevenson. Thank you for that guidance. I therefore ask the Minister whether the exceptions will be introduced by local fora or, which is more likely, by way of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Those listening to the debate or reading it in Hansard may groan inwardly and say, ``What appalling detail. Why does it have to be dealt with in this way?'' However, contrary to what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, detail of this sort is precisely what Committees should be involved in. Schedule 1 goes into fine detail and I hope that the Government will listen carefully to the experience and knowledge of all Hon. Members on all sides who contribute to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I fully accept what the hon. Gentleman says. I said something similar this morning. However, the Government are not likely to give way on this aspect this afternoon. I do not mean to be defeatist, but I wonder whether those two stop-gap measures are possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I accept entirely what the hon. Gentleman says. I may have given the hon. Gentleman credit for remarks that were made by others. The main reason for attributing the remarks to him was to prove that I could say the name of his constituency.
<P>
Other hon. Members have suggested that the matter of exceptions is far too detailed and should not be dealt with in Committee. I contest that view. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is too detailed and that, because the Government may not listen to what we have to say, we should leave it to local forums to decide or to the Secretary of State to make orders. However, that seems to go against what lies behind schedule 1—namely that the Bill lays down the principles that we believe should be applied. The local access forums and others can refer to the Bill and know what the Government believe should happen, but apply the rules locally within that context. Were it not for that, there would be no point in listing the exemptions of land in schedule 1. The Bill could allow the right to roam and leave it to local forums to apply it locally.
<P>
It is important that we should get schedule 1 right, because the thrust of our debates has been how to avoid conflict developing between those who would walk and those whose land they would walk over. The purpose of the Bill is to avoid conflict and the increase in tension that could result from the Bill's enactment, and getting schedule 1 right is central to that aim. If we can say precisely and clearly what is excepted land, and therefore what is not excepted land, local forums, walkers, ramblers and others will at least have clarity in their approach. That, of course, is what we all want.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made a tour d'horizon of the amendments. I agree that the Committee should think carefully about them, although I do not intend to go into the same detail. However, I shall pick up on one or two of his comments, and I hope that the Government will listen carefully.
<P>
The state of farming today means that a great many farmers, encouraged by the Government, are finding ways to diversify. Several of the exceptions that we propose in our amendments would apply to such farmers. As you pointed out a moment ago, Mr. Stevenson, we shall talk later about what is and what is not cultivated land. However, it is clear that several of our proposals would be alternative uses of cultivated land. A farmer considering whether access will be granted over his land will know that cultivated land is exempted. However, if he decides to offer his land for war gaming—people make fun of war gaming, but two or three farms in my constituency make quite a lot of money from war games—the question of access suddenly becomes important again.
<P>
In that context, Mr. Stevenson, I should declare a non-pecuniary interest. I am the chairman of the horse and pony taxation committee, which makes representations to the Government on tax matters affecting horses and ponies. I am also an unpaid consultant to the British Horse Industry Confederation, which acts on behalf of the horse racing industry and the other horse industries and makes representations on their behalf to the Government. Therefore, when I talk about gallops, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex, I am to a degree wearing that non-pecuniary hat.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill is right to exempt racecourses. No one would want to ramble across Bath racecourse in Wiltshire, which is just outside my constituency. Wiltshire has some fine training establishments. Manton immediately springs to mind; it is one of the largest and finest training establishments and, as other hon. Members have said, many horses go out on the gallops in the mornings. Manton is next door to the Templars estate, which I have mentioned before. Access at Templars has been held up by the Countryside Agency as a fine example. The estate allows linear access for walkers, and all sorts of sports and activities take place on the estate while the farming land is preserved. The estate has made its gallops available to Manton, so those other activities, including walking, are going on alongside that quite dangerous activity. Gallops should be exempted. So, too, should open air manège, where the horses can run around in circles rather than up and down the field. As has been pointed out, there could be potentially dangerous consequences for walkers, and for horses and riders.
<P>
The definition of racecourse is equally important in that context. For example, Barberry Castle is on the estate that I mentioned; it is the only racecourse with fixed wooden fences. The well-known Marlborough cup challenge is run there once a year, but it is on private land. Under the Bill, it would not be a racecourse, and would therefore would be open to ramblers—again, with potentially serious consequences.
<P>
The Government should define racecourses much more clearly. For instance, it would be perfectly reasonable for point-to-point racecourses to be open to walkers for most of the year, but not on those days when a race meeting takes place. The intention behind the exemptions is not spelled out in the exemptions themselves. The Minister ought to give careful consideration to how ramblers can be protected from horses and under what conditions the right to roam should be allowed across that sort of land. That is the subject of amendments Nos. 89 and 122.
<P>
The same applies to a number of farms, in my constituency and elsewhere; farmers who simply cannot make money from farming have given over large areas of land to car racing or bike racing. That is not exempted land under schedule 1, but it should be. They hazardous occupations. Motorbike scrambling up and down hillsides, as can be seen in many parts of my constituency, is a hazardous occupation, and for ramblers to get mixed up in it would be hazardous for ramblers and riders. The Castle Combe racetrack in my constituency is a car racing circuit and I doubt whether it would be exempted. Again, the Minister might clarify the matter. I mentioned war gaming, which some Labour Members laughed at; it is another diversification for farmers, but they would want to be certain that ramblers would have no reason to go across it. I move on to the important matter of shooting ranges. The second biggest activity in the countryside involves horses, but the third biggest is shooting, an important industry into which many farmers are diversifying. Shooting at ranges and clay pigeon shooting are important activities in many parts of the countryside. Labour Members raise their eyes to heaven, but those activities form an extremely important part of the rural economy. If we are to help farmers out of the catastrophe they currently face, we must help them to get involved in activities like equestrianism, shooting, war gaming and fish farming. The Government pay lip service to encouraging farmers to become involved in those areas, but the Bill will discourage them. In drafting schedule 1, the Government should give greater consideration to what farmers will do in future.
<P>
Land designated as a site of special scientific interest is important, but is missing from the exemptions. Therefore, amendment No. 141 proposes that such land should be excepted. The reason given for not including SSSIs is that, to do so, would include a very large area of land. I am not certain that that is correct. When an hon. Member previously mentioned half of all land, he was including SSSIs, AONBs and all other designations. Another hon. Member made the interesting point that mineral-based SSSIs need not be exempt. I think that we would all agree that there is no reason to exempt a quarry, which is unlikely to be damaged by walkers. However, areas that are designated as SSSIs because of their wildlife or plants could be damaged.
<P>
It would be useful to know from the Government what percentage of SSSIs fall into that category. I pray in aid the Woodland Trust, a highly respected organisation established by the Government, which has called for buffer zones to be established around SSSIs. Are we to believe that the Woodland Trust is wrong on that? It would be useful to know what percentage of SSSIs is mineral based and what percentage is nature based, as well as to know what impact would be made on the right to roam if the nature-based SSSIs were exempt.
<P>
Moving away from farming, I want to speak in favour of two other exemptions. Amendment No. 54 would exempt land comprising a scheduled ancient monument. In Wiltshire—I refer to Wiltshire because I happen to know it well, but the same arguments apply to many other places—there are many scheduled ancient monuments, many of them underground and unexcavated. The obvious one is Stonehenge, but there are 3,000 exempt archaeological sites surrounding Stonehenge on which the Army and tourists are not allowed. However, access to such sites would be allowed under the Bill and, suddenly, those precious, previously unexcavated sites—stone-age hill forts and such like—would be open to ramblers and could be badly damaged. There are a significant number of such sites, which it would seem reasonable to exempt from the Bill, or at least to control access to.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 would exempt land comprising the grounds of a hospital, school or college. I shall declare a sort of interest in that I was brought up and educated in Dunblane, where the consequences of a school ground being open to a walker had the most catastrophic result. [HON. MEMBERS: ``No.''] I raise the matter with a heavy heart because my mother was one of the doctors who went into the school immediately after the tragedy, but I raise it because the security around the school grounds in Dunblane has been greatly increased since that time. The school is situated in open fields and the dreadful Thomas Hamilton entered over a fence and walked across the field unchallenged, with the catastrophic results that happened four years ago last week. Unless we find a way of protecting school grounds, there will be no way to avoid such a catastrophe in the future. I do not raise the matter lightly. It weighs heavily with me personally. The Bill may already contain suitable safeguards, in which case it is up to the Minister to point them out. If I have missed them, he must forgive me. However, it is important to find a way to exempt school—and also hospital and college—grounds from the right to roam.
<P>
I apologise for detaining the Committee somewhat on this point, but we must get the exceptions right if the Bill is to prove workable and if we are to avoid the conflicts that many Opposition Members fear will develop between the owners and users of land and the ramblers.

<P>

<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire on his exhaustive, if not exhausting, speech. He set himself a Sisyphean task, because every time he had pushed an exception up the hill he came back to collect another. He certainly collected an extensive list. I congratulate him on his thoughtfulness and assiduousness. I shall try to reply to all the points that were made, though I shall not necessarily go through the entire list of exceptions, for reasons that the hon. Gentleman will soon understand.
<P>
The Government have in mind a different concept, with respect to schedule 1, from that which seems to prevail among the Opposition. I should like to explain the background as we see it, our reasons for drawing up schedule 1 as we have, and how we want excepted land to fit into the framework of access land in general. We discussed that last Tuesday, when I said that I would try to return to it in more detail today.
<P>
The duty of countryside bodies is to map land that qualifies as open country. Land that is not open country should not be mapped. The countryside bodies' criterion for mapping open country and registered common land is set out in clause 1 and is a matter of whether the land is ``wholly or predominantly''—and I do not think that a better alternative for the word ``predominantly'' was suggested when we debated that this morning—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>mountain, moor, heath or down,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or is registered common land. That is the fundamental part of the mapping process, and I think that that is common ground for us.
<P>
Anyone will be able to comment on the consultation maps prepared by the countryside bodies, which will take representations into account. Owners and others with an interest in the land will also be able to appeal against provisional maps, again on the grounds that land shown as open country or registered common land is not, in fact, wholly or predominantly mountain, moor, heath, down or registered common land. Clauses 5 and 6 cover that. The process provides landowners and farmers with an important opportunity to ensure that land that does not meet the criterion is removed from draft and provisional maps before the right of access is brought into force on access land mapped by countryside bodies.
<P>
It is not our intention that the provision for excepted land in schedule 1 should provide for every possible eventuality that requires access to be excluded from open country and registered common land. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) raised the obvious question why golf courses, but not the other things that he listed, should be excluded. Golf courses often occur on mountain, moor, heath and down. Aside from the fairways the general environment is often semi-natural—heath or moor, typically. There is a real likelihood that golf courses will appear on access land and they need to be excepted. However, for example, motor racing circuits, television studios, burial grounds and the mass of places specified in the amendments are highly unlikely to be mapped as mountain, moor, heath or down. Similar principles apply to other types of place such as aerodromes and race courses, which I shall not deal with in detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall happily give way at any stage, but it may not be helpful to do so now, when I am trying to set out in general terms how the Government's approach differs from that of the Opposition.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I want to challenge the Minister on the point that he was making. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made the point that making any exceptions means that all are necessary. If some matters are to be left to the consultation and appeal mechanism, as the Minister says, one wonders why any exceptions should be specified. The consultation and appeal process could deal with everything.
<P>
The Minister specifically supported the exclusion of golf courses because they commonly appear on heath, moor or down. In the same way, race courses often appear on downland, but he has dismissed the question of gallops, which are usually in the same places as race courses. I hope that he will explain why gallops should not be part of the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was right to say that it may be better for the hon. Gentleman to wait so that I could more fully set out our approach. I was pointing out that principles similar to those affecting golf courses also apply to aerodromes and race courses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy asked whether the list was exclusive. It is, but it cannot be amended by regulation as it is in the Bill. Any sites that merit temporary or longer-term restrictions can be dealt with on their merits under chapter II. We hope that the local access fora would express views on the merits of such restrictions. The hon. Gentleman also asked why there were no provisions to amend the list of exceptions by order or regulation. That is a matter of judgment. The Bill should be explicit about the types of land or features that should be automatically exempt from the right of access and to allow local variations as to what land was excepted would confuse walkers. The categories listed in schedule 1 are not exhaustive, but are the important cases, which justify automatic exception.
<P>
The Opposition's amendments seem to deal with all conceivable circumstances. I pay tribute to them for the comprehensiveness of the list and respond to them with blanket exceptions to rights of access. However, our policy is that, in the clearly defined circumstances in schedule 1, the right of access will not apply, but other cases for restrictions or exclusions should be considered on their merits under chapter II.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): As the Minister has resisted our amendments on access points, by giving local discretion, will there not be great confusion among walkers who will be able to wander on gallops in one local authority or countryside agency area, but not in another? If signs and access points are not allowed, how will walkers know what the situation is in any one area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> There is nothing to stop a landowner or farmer erecting an appropriate sign. I accept that we could clutter up the countryside with an unnecessary number of signs, but, as with so much of the Bill, we must exhibit a degree of common sense. There is no reason why signage should not provide walkers with warnings regarding their safety and advice on where best to walk.
<P>
I am happy, if it is the will of the Committee, to go through each of the amendments, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire did. However, it is preferable to make clear the principles that underline our response to the amendments. There are basically half a dozen principles and considerations, which in various permutations apply to these amendments.
<P>
The first is that the features are seldom to be found in open country. To that extent, the exception does not arise because they would not be mapped in the first place. Secondly, they are excepted as being buildings or their curtilages. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, whose legal talents have been remarked upon so frequently in the Committee, and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, raised the matter, but I, too, have the advice of learned lawyers. They say that a recent judicial decision on curtilage was given in the Court of Appeal in February in the case of Skerritts of Nottingham Ltd. v. the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. In that case, the appellant was unsuccessful in arguing that a stable block Iying about 200m from the English country house was not part of the curtilage of the house. The court held—this is the point—that land is considered to be within the curtilage if it is part and parcel of the principal building or other structure. Land is within the curtilage if it is owned and enjoyed with the principal building and can be regarded as ancillary to it. It is a question of fact and degree in each case. Examples are a yard, basement area, passageways, driveway and gardens. Curtilage therefore has a meaning that can be flexibly applied to the facts of each case. There is no reason to suppose that a statutory definition of curtilage will be any more helpful than the court's interpretation, which appears to work satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Having gone down this legal avenue, I will give way. I was seeking to illustrate the use of the word curtilage, why I think it is meaningful and why it is relevant to what I am about to say about the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Schedule 1, paragraph 2, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land covered by buildings or the curtilage of such land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that had read ``the curtilage of such building'', the matter would not have arisen. What the right hon. Gentleman has said bolsters the argument for the amendment. The court case makes no difference at all because land has to be pertinent to a building to be within the curtilage of a building.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am aware that amendment No. 59 amends paragraph 2 so as to except land covered by the curtilage of a building instead of the curtilage of land covered by buildings. This amendment in our view would have no material consequence and therefore I resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am concerned about the degree to which we are becoming bogged down in the issue of curtilage. What I have said is perfectly clear. I do not want to spend so much time on the meaning of curtilage and the legal application of it that we lose sight of what we are meant to be discussing: the definition of excepted land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's wish to avoid a detailed argument. However, we are considering amendments that deal specifically with excepted land. In every instance, the judgment to which he referred associated curtilage with a building, rather than with land where a building was situated. We cannot merely brush that aside; it highlights a specific problem with the wording of paragraph 2.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If I may read before I speak, I shall proceed, as I have received a relevant message. In the spirit of freedom of information, which hon. Members are about to debate on the Floor of the House—if they ever reach it—I shall convey that message to the Committee. The concerns raised about paragraph 2 relate to a matter of grammar. In our view, there is no substantial difference between curtilage of buildings and curtilage of land covered by buildings. I understand that the latest case on curtilage, to which the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire referred, has no effect on that. That is as far as I shall go on the issue. I confirm the remarks that I made earlier, and I have submitted to the Committee the legal advice that I have received. Hon. Members may return to the matter later if they wish.
<P>
I should like to outline the criteria by which we have judged the amendments and which explain why we do not think it right to accept them or to speak about each one separately. First, most of the land whose addition is proposed by the amendments is seldom found in open country. Secondly, most of the proposed additions are already accepted as being buildings or the curtilage of buildings or land. Thirdly, under the general development order, planning permission will be required in respect of land use that exceeds 14 days or, in some cases, 28 days. For example, that applies to clay pigeon shooting. Fourthly, the landowner can use his discretionary right of closure for 28 days in respect of some activities, if he wishes to do so. If the activities continue for longer, planning permission will be sometimes be required. In other cases, however, the landowner can exercise his right for to direct further restrictions or closures under clauses 22 to 24.
<P>
A further consideration applies in cases where the restrictions contained in schedule 2 come into play. They ensure that walkers must not interfere with the lawful rights of others. Having followed the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire as he spelt out each amendment, I should comment that one or other—and sometimes several of them—applies in any case. That is why we do not think that the amendments should be made. I do not disagree with the principle of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but changes such as those proposed are not necessary in the great majority of cases, because the sites to which they relate are excluded for other reasons.
<P>
I shall provide some further examples to illustrate my point. Mobile homes, which are dealt with by amendments Nos. 34 and 35, and burial grounds, which are dealt with by amendment No. 37, are seldom found in open country. When they are present, they are likely to fall within one of the existing exceptions, such as that which applies to buildings and their curtilage. If they do not fall into such an exception, application can be made to the relevant authority for access to be restricted or excluded. Other activities on access land may be infrequent. Activities such as war games or clay pigeon shooting will usually require planning permission if they occur on more than 14 or 28 days in each year, depending on the activity. As I said, landowners can use discretion for periods of up to 28 days.
<P>
Many of the amendments would except land that already falls into one of the exceptions contained in the schedule. Amendment No. 46 deals with land used for television studios and amendment No. 50 deals with the base stations of a chair-lift or cable-car system. Both facilities will fall within the current definitions of buildings and curtilages. Several amendments deal with activities that are compatible with a continued right of access. For example, amendment No. 29 refers to land comprising a highway, amendment No. 35 refers to hardstandings and amendment No. 50 refers to chair lifts—presumably it would apply to land underneath the cables. Amendments Nos. 89 and 122 apply to training gallops, which were mentioned by several hon. Members. Opposition Members seem to be unwilling to accept that access might be compatible with the training of horses. They should visit Epsom downs, where the training gallops are situated on land to which a statutory right of access applies. They should also visit Cleeve hill near Cheltenham, where the same public rights and private interests coexist without apparent problems.
<P>
I take the points made about safety by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. Indeed, similar issues were raised by the hon. Member for Ashford during our first sitting. Walkers who visit access land must take due care and be responsible for their actions and safety. We should not assume too readily that access is incompatible with the continued use of land for other purposes. Experience shows that that is not true.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As far as I know, I am the only Member to have ridden winners under rules, so I know that riding horses can be an extremely hazardous pastime. It is one thing to consider rights of way on the downs and to know where people are likely to come from and go to, but it is completely different to talk about enabling people to wander all over the place. The purpose of the Bill is to encourage increased access. Unless cognisance is given to my remarks, an accident will be waiting to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I take his point seriously. I am telling him, however, that on Epsom downs, and such places, there have been training gallops in areas where the public have exercised a statutory right of access for many years, and as far as I know, there have been no accidents. However, a landowner or other interested party who is concerned about such matters can still apply for exclusions on safety grounds. That is the fallback for all of the exceptions. I am not trying to dismiss the amendments; some are unlikely and arcane, but some are perfectly sensible and reasonable. The fact that they are not contained in the schedule does not mean that they are not excepted or that access cannot be excluded through application for a direction under chapter II and, specifically, clauses 22 to 24.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 54 and 141 seek to exclude from rights of access land comprising scheduled ancient monuments and sites of special scientific interest. Hon. Members will know that part III reflects our commitment to the protection of SSSIs. We are determined to ensure that vulnerable habitats have the necessary protection. Again, there should be no automatic presumption that the conservation of such sites is incompatible with access, especially when account is taken of the modest nature of the new right and the restrictions that will apply to it. Many ancient monuments and SSSIs are currently freely open to the public. We have made provision to ensure, that when conflict does arise, the relevant authority may consider excluding or restricting access if necessary on the advice of the relevant advisory body. I repeat what I said on Second Reading: I have the strongest intention to ensure that animals and wildlife will be fully protected in the lambing and nesting seasons. The Bill contains provisions to protect them. I expect restrictions for temporary closures to be applied for and agreed by the local access forums. A dispute will go to the Countryside Agency. Guidelines will make it clear that I expect them to err on the side of ensuring that wildlife is fully protected.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to sports pitches. It is unlikely that they will be mapped as mountain, moor, heath or down. My experience of sports pitches is that they are highly maintained, perhaps even manicured. They are not consistent with the semi-natural environment that we expect of mountain, moor, heath and down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I raised the issue of sports pitches in connection with common land. As they are often on common land, there is, presumably, access over them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is a different matter if they are on common land. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was concerned about sports pitches that were halfway up mountains, preferably on a flat area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> A level playing field.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle was worried that golf courses would be removed from excepted land. He spoke with characteristic force of the many golf courses on common land that co-exist with rights of access on foot. He omitted to mention that some golf courses have a right of access on horseback. I understand his concern that the exception of golf courses might reduce existing access. However, I have thought hard about his amendment and have decided that it would go too far. We do not intend that the new right of access should interfere with the management of land, but on golf courses the possible conflict between golfer and walker could give rise to real concerns about safety and effective management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Let me finish, then I shall give way.
<P>
I accept that the two interests co-exist happily on many courses, but in most cases where there is an existing right of access over golf courses, the golfers are the later arrivals and have accepted the right of access as a consequence of their chosen location. For those reasons, it would not be right to impose new rights of access across golf courses. However, I assure my hon. Friend that there is no reason why existing access opportunities over golf courses should be lost. Statutory rights of access will continue by virtue of clauses 1(1) and 15(1). Where access is tolerated on golf courses—the so-called de facto access—there is no reason to suppose that that will not continue. I do not expect the current state of affairs to change, but we should not provide a blanket opportunity for access across all golf courses, especially those courses that have not been imposed on an existing right of access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> My right hon. Friend has covered the point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As I have tried to explain, the amendments are unnecessary. It is not that such exclusions should not be made—in some cases they should—but provision is made elsewhere in the Bill for them to be made, based on the merits of the case, and that making a blanket provision in schedule 1 is therefore unnecessary. The amendments would introduce a whole host of additions to the schedule that no walker could be expected to remember while out in the countryside. However, I repeat that if there is a need to restrict or exclude access to land mapped as open country that does not fall within the exceptions listed in schedule 1, the owner may exclude access on up to 28 days each year, and anyone with an interest in the land may apply for a direction under chapter II.
<P>
What the Opposition are trying to achieve with the amendments can be achieved, but for the reasons that I have explained we believe that it would not be right simply to include a massive list of exceptions in schedule 1. The object can be achieved better in other ways. On those grounds, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the validity of much of what we have said. I am grateful also to the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy for their general support in trying to extract from the Government a greater understanding of how the exceptions will work. As I said in my opening remarks, I am quite prepared to accept that many of the exemptions listed in this plethora of amendments are unlikely to occur on open land, but they could. I accept also that owners have the opportunity to appeal against their land being included as open land. However, the exercise has been worth while.
<P>
There is obviously a difference of approach between us. In particular, I believe that the presumption must be in favour of conservation, which is the reason for my earlier remarks about SSSIs and ancient monuments. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex, I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Pendle on existing rights over golf courses. I certainly do not want existing rights extinguished.
<P>
I want to press the Minister on several matters, however. He said specifically that the mapping process would not include land that was not open, and that the matter would then go to consultation and, if necessary, to appeal. I hope that I did not misunderstand him, but he said that several of the exemptions listed in the amendments would not appear in open country. He cited mobile homes. I accept that a mobile home is not a particularly common sight in open country, but I bet that they are sometimes seen. However, holiday and touring caravans and camp sites most definitely are common on open land. Indeed, the amendments mention not only mobile homes but caravans and camp grounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Minister airily dismissed a number of our amendments, saying that such things would not commonly occur on downland. I described in some detail the Marlborough downs, where racing, gallops and a variety of other activities occur that are listed in the amendments. Such downland would come under the Bill's provisions. Does not my hon. Friend agree that the Minister should deal with those points in a less airy fashion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I was trying to approach the debate in a spirit of understanding and generosity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is a mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend thinks that I am mistaken to do so. However, until the Minister proves otherwise, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, although I think that he has not understood some of the issues raised about what actually happens in the countryside.
<P>
I shall move on from the issue of campsites and refer to gallops. I omitted to declare my membership of Newmarket race course, which I thought irrelevant to this matter, though the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome prompted me to do so. I am talking about the gallops, which are nothing to do with the race course: they just happen to be close to the race course. The Minister said that there is no problem on Epsom downs. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) pointed out that the purpose of the Bill is to encourage people to go out into the countryside. There will probably be a seismic shift in the number of people taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the Bill. We shall return to that subject again, certainly when we discuss liability. I think there is an inconsistency here: a galloping horse is dangerous whether it is in practice or on the race course.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The Minister for the Environment, in making the plausible points that his officials gave him, used the example of Cleeve hill, outside Cheltenham. At Cleeve hill, there are—I stand to be corrected on this—no more than three or four trainers, if that. There are few trainers now at Epsom downs, which is near London. At Newmarket, there are 60 to 70 trainers with thousands of racehorses out on the gallops every morning. At Lambourne, the situation is the same. At Manton, the yard used as an example has one trainer and is in the middle of nowhere. I am sure that the Minister could come to a perfectly sensible accommodation along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. There are two or three major training establishments, and they are not the same as two or three trainers, with perhaps thirty horses each, out on Cleeve hill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend who has a greater knowledge of these matters than I have. He is right, of course. I referred in my opening remarks to the Newmarket area where, of a morning, one can see hundreds of horses being exercised. That is a different ball game. I would like the Minister to come back on that point.
<P>
The second group of amendments I would like to press the Minister on deal with the issue of curtilage, which he wishes to avoid. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made the same intervention as I would have made if I had been able to. The Minister said that we might think the grammar of the Bill faulty—the Minister used the word grammar—but that our proposal would make no difference. I contend that it does make a difference. Paragraph 2 says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land covered by buildings or the curtilage of such land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have had several light-hearted comments about highly paid lawyers exploiting loopholes in the legislation. I can foresee somebody bringing a case challenging the assertion that land can have a curtilage, which is precisely what the grammar of this exception states at the present. The purpose of amendment No. 59 is to remove that inconsistency by changing the words ``such land'' to ``building''. The Bill would then be clear, that it was a building that had curtilage and not land. I do not think the Skerritt case has any bearing on this, because it did not address the issue of whether land could have curtilage. I hope the Minister will come back on that, too.
<P>
The Minister did not refer to the issue that my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire and I raised concerning school grounds, college grounds and hospital grounds. It is fair to say that they are not usually in open country, but sometimes they are. Again, that issue should be addressed.
<P>
The final issue I would like to press the Minister on is related to amendment No. 90 on developed land. In his opening remarks, he said that if exclusion were allowed for more than 28 days, many of the proposals in my amendments, such as the provision relating to clay-pigeon shooting, would require planning consent. Implicit in that statement is that the land would be excepted. The Minister is frowning, but I had assumed that that was the relevance of planning consent, which otherwise becomes meaningless. On Second Reading, the Minister clearly said that rights of access would not apply to developed land, but that is not what the Bill says. Our advice is that schedule 1 does not exempt all developed land. I hope that the Minister will respond to that particular point, on which many other exceptions hinge. Planning consent was one of the criteria under which the Minister seemed to believe that all exceptions could be dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am sorry to pick up the point, but that interpretation cannot be correct. Several other categories of exemptions under schedule 1 would also require planning consent, such as railways, golf courses, race courses and aerodromes. Therefore, the mere requirement for planning consent cannot explain why a particular category should be excluded from schedule 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right and I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Paragraph 11 of schedule 1 says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land is not to be treated as excepted land by reason of any development carried out on the land—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it continues—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and that permission has not been granted.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would tend to imply that if permission were granted, the land would be exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw my attention to that, although we shall consider the matter in due course. It also implies that development has an exclusive impact on land.
<P>
I conclude by remarking, somewhat flippantly, but perhaps with a sting in the tail, that this is a large group of amendments, on which it would take a considerable amount of time to vote. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will respond to the points that I raised while we consider further action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall try to respond to the various points raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Mobile homes will fall within the exception for buildings and their curtilages. Caravan sites are unlikely to be on open country, but I accept that they could be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> What?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Well, such sites are often managed intensively. Therefore, they are likely to lose their semi-natural qualities. However, if they are mapped, as they might be—the Bill is messy in one sense and the categories are not always precise—judgment may be exercised as to what is appropriate locally, in the light of the principles set out in the Bill. If the sites are mapped, restrictions will be considered on their merits. It is not the case that inclusion in schedule 1 is the final decision on exception—quite the opposite. The examples cited are the most obvious ones, which should carry an automatic right of exception, but there will be many other cases in relation to which, depending on the merits of the case, restrictions can properly be applied. Under schedule 2, people visiting caravan sites must not interfere with the lawful activities of others who are on the same land.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> In his remarks on curtilage, the Minister made the case that we have been pressing for some time. He said that a mobile home would be exempted if it was within the curtilage of a building. That is exactly what we said at the beginning and, in effect, he has agreed with us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Mobile homes are likely to be buildings because they tend to be permanent, although they are not necessarily so. Touring caravans are temporary and would not qualify as buildings, but I repeat that restrictions could still be sought for them.
<P>
I was asked about developed land. I should point out that planning consent does not automatically engender an exception. It will do so only if it falls within one of the categories in schedule 1. Under the definition set out in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, development includes the making of any material change in the use of a building or other land. Amendment No. 90 would deny the public access merely because of a change in land use for which planning permission has been given. Such provision is not apt for our purposes, as the uses that we want to exclude are already specified in paragraph 1 of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will remind me of any other points that I have not covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall do so willingly. I take the Minister back to the words he used on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Rights of access will not apply to developed land.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 723.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The comments that he has just made seem to negate that remark. I am not trying to pick a fight; I merely want to know which remarks are accurate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Extant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank my hon. Friend.
<P>
In addition, I remind the Minister that he has not referred to two further points. First, will he comment on school grounds? Secondly, will he explain whether land can have curtilage, a point to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I said that cultivated or developed land would be excepted. Developed land generally falls into the excepted categories set out in the schedule, which include buildings and their curtilages. However, it also provides for the exception of engineering works and land covered by underground mining. I agree that the definitions are very precise. We shall move on to them during consideration of the next group of amendments, so it may be best to leave further discussion until then.
<P>
I did not mention gallops. The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex made a point—I hope that I can attract his attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The Minister has my wholehearted attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman made exactly the point that I make; there is a great difference between the various gallops. Drawing on his own knowledge, which is greater than mine, he said that not many trainers operate on Cleeve hill and possibly on Epsom and Walton downs. Newmarket, however, has a vastly greater number. That is why the same rules should not apply irrespective of the size of the enterprise. In respect of Newmarket heath, I remind the Committee that if an activity that occurs on land mapped as open country or registered common land is so dominant that it is incompatible with access—that is the point that the hon. Gentleman was making—restrictions should and, I am sure, will be sought under chapter II. That, rather than a blanket exclusion of gallops under schedule 1, is the right response. I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I want to deal with the matter differently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No, I am concluding a long response.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I had intended to intervene on the Minister, but as he has finished perhaps I may make some brief remarks.
<P>
I hope I shall be forgiven if I have missed anything, but the Minister dismissed several amendments about particular uses of land, on the ground that if a use such as war games or clay pigeon shooting were to be carried out on a certain number of days a year, or more often, planning permission would be required. I understood him to be saying that the requirement for planning permission meant that the land would be developed land, which would be exempt under schedule 1. The Minister now seems to be saying that developed land would not automatically be exempt: only developed land specified in the schedule would be exempt. If that is so, why does the planning permission requirement devalue the amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It does not devalue the amendments. I have been at great pains to explain that I do not want to devalue, or, to use the phrase that the hon. Gentleman has constantly employed, airily dismiss, the amendments. I simply say that there is a better way to deal with this issue. That remains my view. The list in schedule 1 is not exhaustive, but is our best reasonable judgment of what should be given an automatic, blanket exemption. However, restrictions will be appropriate in plenty of other cases. It will be possible to achieve the hon. Gentleman's aims in a much better and more focused way under clauses 22 to 24.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hear a ticking watch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have a terrible confession to make, Mr. Stevenson. I am not mechanically minded, and when someone set the alarm on my watch for 6.40, they unfortunately set it for 18.40. My watch is also a few minutes fast, and I do not know how to reset it.
<P>
To risk returning to my favourite issue, curtilage, it may be helpful to say that the point that hon. Gentlemen pressed constantly was correct. They were correct, their instincts were correct, and our grammar was correct. I shall explain how that is consistent. The phrase in paragraph 2 of schedule 1 is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land covered by buildings or the curtilage of such land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that case, ``such land'' is land covered by buildings. Therefore we were both right. That is an excellent way to end the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> In his concluding remarks, the Minister has managed to prove the point that he made at the beginning, which is that the Bill is in a mess.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I said that it was a messy Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It is the same thing in the end. The Minister has sought to allay Opposition Members' concerns. I want to reflect on the issue of curtilage, and I certainly want to reflect on the issue of developed land, on which confusion exists about what is excepted. I therefore wish to keep amendments Nos. 59 and 90 in reserve. I know that they would not be voted on at this juncture, but I may wish to press them to a vote when they become due, subject to my thoughts over the next 48 hours. With that proviso, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Here we go again. This group of amendments addresses similar issues to those addressed by the previous group, inasmuch as it addresses the issue of exceptions. As Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Stevenson, you have rightly grouped together those amendments that have an agricultural aspect. One or two of the amendments are extremely important, and raise issues that have been touched on in previous debates.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 refers to land that is currently in set-aside. It is simply a matter of clarification as to whether the term ``cultivated land'', which is the first of the exceptions, includes land that has been cultivated and will almost certainly return to cultivation, but is currently not under cultivation because it is under a set-aside scheme, which could apply for five years, or, in the case of some schemes, up to 20 years. Will the Minister explain that? If it is to be included as open land, the issues of signage and stiles arise if they have to be provided during the period of set-aside. There is also a risk that applying access rights to set-aside land could discourage people from taking up the more environmentally friendly and longer-term forms of set aside, which are designed to improve conservation.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> People might be discouraged from developing set aside and the land might be disqualified and no longer regarded as being set aside. One of the conditions of the set-aside scheme is that such land has to be able to be cultivated. If it could not be cultivated by virtue of access arrangements, it might be disqualified.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I shall later discuss an amendment that establishes what is cultivable. The hon. Gentleman's point relates to disqualification from the set-aside scheme or from conservation schemes. I hope that the Minister will comment on that matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land used for the keeping of horses.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have much experience of the agriculture sector, but I am confused about whether the keeping of horses is an agricultural activity. In some respects, it is clearly not an agricultural activity—for example, horse stables are rateable but farm buildings are not—but in some European countries, although not in this country, horses are regarded as agricultural animals. There is considerable confusion in that regard, which was added to—it was a welcome addition—by the Government's announcement after the agricultural summit last Thursday. They sought to encourage farmers who want to move into equestrian activities. The Government's welcome decision has further confused the question of whether the keeping of horses is agricultural, and we have tabled amendment No. 31 in an attempt to remove doubt.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 refers to ``animal pens or enclosures'' in relation to access land. I hope that the Minister appreciates that open land often includes animal pens or enclosures and that the keeping of sheep or cattle on hills is an essential part of agriculture. Sheep and cattle can be seen dotted over open country, and husbandry is usually carried out in stone walled areas—for instance, sheep are gathered, dipped and shorn in such areas. If people entered those areas, there would be a risk of injury to them or to any animals present. The amendment would exclude unscrupulous walkers from such areas—I do not suggest that all walkers are unscrupulous, but, as in all sectors of society, there is an element who might abuse their right of access and enter the relevant structures. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy earlier said that it is particularly important to ensure that people do not disturb livestock during lambing and calving time.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 repeats some of the points that I raised in relation to an earlier amendment. It is important to regard land that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>covered by haystacks, silage or other stored agricultural produce<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as land that is part of someone's livelihood. Haystacks and strawstacks, for example, are extremely flammable. It is better to be safe than sorry in this context—we should ensure that such land is excluded and avoid risks. For example, an individual might discard a cigarette unwittingly and cause a fire. Piles of timber are also flammable.
<P>
Amendment No. 91, which was touched on earlier, is specific to Wales. It involves land known as coed cae or ffridd land—what I would describe as in-bye land, to use an English phrase. That is land on the perimeter of what is considered open land. It was mentioned by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey). Such land, between the open hills and what is obviously enclosed, is an important part of farming activity. It is husbanded.

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas (Clwyd, West):</B> In the interests of precision, could the hon. Gentleman venture a definition of coed cae or ffridd land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I have just said that it is that land that is between what is obviously mountain and enclosed fields. That is quite common in north Wales, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware. In many of these amendments I seem to be finding common cause with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. More than 20 years ago I was a parliamentary candidate for part of Snowdonia and was thoroughly trounced by Plaid Cymru, but I am glad that we make common cause on this issue. Such land is a typical part of the north Wales landscape. Farmers use such land for ewes and young lambs. Interestingly, although I have referred to north Wales, the designation of the pilot map in the upper Swansea valley was amended to exclude this land after representations from commoners. There is a clear precedent there.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 120 deal with the definition of cultivation. Amendment No. 56 seeks to add ``and cultivable''. It is a bit of a mouthful but its meaning is quite clear. Amendments Nos. 57 and 120 deal with grassland. I suspect that some of those who are in favour of leaving the definition of cultivated as it is will argue that it means where the soil surface is disturbed, such as in ploughing or ripping it up with some form of earth-moving instrument. That is not adequate. A lot of land is commonly ploughed or cultivated for the growing of crops or perhaps for the reseeding of grass, but cultivation applies to the general husbandry of crops.
<P>
As I said last week, grass is a crop. It is just as much a crop as wheat, barley or anything else. It requires a considerable level of cultivation in terms of fertilisers and, perhaps, agrochemicals. The growing of it certainly requires implements such as harrows, rollers, mowers and whatever. A whole raft of implements are used on grassland. The uninitiated will often think that grass just grows, but it is a vital part of a farmer's operation. How much of the grass will grow and how much he can utilise, whether for conserved fodder or grazing by sheep or cattle, is crucial.
<P>
The Opposition believe that, to extend the right of access to such grassland, would be against the interests of the farmer. Mention has been made of the plight of agriculture, especially, dare I say, the livestock sector, which will not be appreciated by my arable constituents. The farmers typically operating in the areas mentioned in the Bill face immense problems. Further difficulties and damage to their crops, including grassland, are the last thing that they want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned grassland and in-bye land in north Wales. Important in-bye land also runs into the moor in the uplands, and farmers and others have planted that area with hard woods. Is that not another reason for taking great care when people are to walk though such land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. Earlier, we touched on areas of land that may include small pockets of woodland. However, my hon. Friend is right to say that the land being so planted is sure to increase. That is the only possible use, given the dire straits confronting the livestock sector.
<P>
To sum up, amendment No. 56 would insert the word ``cultivable'' into the clause. Amendment No. 57 is self-explanatory and would include grasslands subject to the normal processes of husbandry. Amendment No. 120 would include land that is to produce hay, silage or haylage; land used for intensive livestock grazing; and land which, by ploughing or other means, has been converted into cultivated land within the preceding 20 years.
<P>
That is critical. There are different views on the matter, but in the past couple of decades, quite a lot of former hill land has been reclaimed, often with significant amounts of Government grant. Rocks have been removed or buried and land recultivated and reseeded with a more productive grass sward so that it becomes an important element of productive farm land. As all that investment and work has already been undertaken, it would be wrong to list such land as land for open access.
<P>
A great deal of damage can be done. Last week, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said that it can be difficult to cut a field of grass when people have walked across it close to cutting time. If the grass is partially trampled, it is no longer standing, making it harder to cut. The Minister will say that dropping beer cans or other things in such fields is already an offence. However, such items will be obscured by grass in fields destined for hay or silage and will only be discovered when the machine hits them. There are several risks relating to that.
<P>
In a hay field, grass lies on the ground for a few days when it is turned, weathered and cured before being baled. Again, to the uninitiated, a field of grassy swathes may be an attractive place in which to rest or sit, but that interferes with husbandry management practice.
<P>
All our amendments are serious and are targeted at the use of term ``cultivated land''. There is an element of choice between amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 120, but they are complementary and could all be included in the Bill. I could make other points about animal welfare and the risk of being trampled by cattle. I was interested to discover that cattle have trampled six people to death in the past 10 years. We would not wish to precipitate such an occurrence.
<P>
In conclusion, there are a raft of reasons why land that is clearly part of the farming system being managed for grass production should be excluded from open lands.
