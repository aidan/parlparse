<H4><center>Tuesday 16 June 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/188/1998188.htm">Registration of Political Parties Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the sittings motion, I indicate for hon. Members' convenience that they have my permission to remove their jackets. I remind members of the Committee that it is customary to await the consent of the Chairman before doing so.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the Registration of Political Parties Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I begin by welcoming your invitation to partial informality, Mr. Gale, which I am sure will not apply to the Committee's proceedings in general. I know from previous experience that you will handle the Committee in a manner that is both fair and firm and that if any members of the Committee, myself included, were to incur your displeasure, you would show it strongly. We shall therefore try to avoid doing so.
<P>
The Bill has 26 clauses and three schedules, and it passed unopposed on Second Reading. I am aware that the Opposition have some concerns that they wish to debate. However, we should be able to dispatch the Committee's business speedily, but with the necessary degree of scrutiny. I hope that our deliberations will take place in a spirit of co-operation and friendliness. In my experience, it is more pleasant to conduct a Committee in that manner than by other means.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I begin by saying, Mr. Gale, that it is a pleasure to find that you have been appointed to chair the Committee. We look forward to working under the supervision of your watchful eye.
<P>
I agree with much of what the Minister has said. About 10 days ago he and I, and one or two of the staff of the House, left this Room after 12 sittings on another Bill. We thought that we had served our duty for the time being, only to discover that we are here again. I doubt that we shall be detained for as long as we were on that occasion. Nevertheless, the painstaking way in which we scrutinised that previous piece of legislation--which to satisfy your curiosity, Mr. Gale, I reveal to be the Data Protection Bill--suggests that we shall apply the same treatment to this Bill. However, the subject matter that we shall discuss on Tuesday and Thursday mornings will not be so difficult and indigestible, and is likely to be easier to understand. As we are all politicians, the issues will arouse slightly more passion than those that surround data protection.
<P>
The Minister is right to say that we shall be raising some aspects of the Bill for discussion on forthcoming Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Bill is a crucial piece of the Government's constitutional jigsaw, without which the legislation will not work.
<P>
Such a crucial cog in elections to a new Scottish Parliament, to a Welsh assembly and to the European Parliament next June must be properly designed and constructed. That is our wish.
<P>
We hope to debate potential abuses that might result from the registration of political parties. For example, some people may support more than one party, not just with their votes but with their money and their organisation, in an attempt to deceive the electorate. That matter needs a thorough airing in Committee.
<P>
We shall raise the issues of whether the arrangement for registration should be open to public scrutiny before decisions are taken and whether they should be subject to appeal. We want to ensure that the Government will give proper guidance to returning officers. We have grave anxieties about the Bill's proposals to include party emblems and logos on ballot papers, which is a novel departure from the usual practice, as you, Mr. Gale, with your experience of elections over many years, will know. We shall have some entertaining and fruitful discussions on that subject.
<P>
We are anxious about the wording of schedule 2; and in that context I pay tribute to the Clerk of the Committee, who guided us in raising the matter. It is crucial to debate the drafting of schedule 2, which introduced the concept of the requirement for nomination papers, which are submitted to a returning officer in a constituency, to be certified by the political party that the person nominated represents if that political party is registered under the terms of the Bill.
<P>
In the previous Standing Committee of which the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) and I were members, there was a constructive and co-operative spirit. I cannot promise that we will accept the Government's arguments so meekly in this Committee, as we will be debating matters that are crucial to the political process. However, I can promise the Minister that we intend to improve the Bill and to try to persuade him that there are matters to which the Government might turn their mind, in Committee or on Report, to achieve that improvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I, too, congratulate you on your appointment as Committee Chairman, Mr. Gale. I thank the Government for introducing the Bill, as it seeks to tackle some problems. We were keen for this extremely interesting measure to be introduced because, unlike other proposals, it is preventive. There are broad arguments to be advanced on the subject because one can never be sure that actions will have the desired effect.
<P>
The Committee should, therefore, have some interesting debates. The Liberal Democrats will table amendments, but we believe that the principle behind the dual approach of registration and use of emblems is the right way to start. We will ask questions about regional variations, circumstances in Northern Ireland and gender balance as well as about misleading titles. We look forward to working constructively with all Committee members, to ensure that the resulting legislation is broadly acceptable to all political parties and that it achieves what it sets out to do. I look forward to working under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and to future sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall be brief. The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and I will end up disagreeing about some of the issues that he raised. I shall reflect on his final point about schedule 2. If he wishes to discuss his specific concerns outside the Committee I shall certainly consider them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale referred to the previous Standing Committee on which we both served, which considered the Data Protection Bill. In that Committee, an Opposition Member suggested that the material before it was sometimes so complicated that it gave the impression that I was reading my speech backwards. It struck me occasionally that if I had done so the Committee may not have noticed.
<P>
I shall try my best to be slightly more coherent in this Committee. At least the subject matter is more digestible. We will sometimes disagree because that is the very stuff of electoral politics. The more constructive and co-operative such disagreement is, the more enjoyable it will be and, in the long run, it will result in better scrutiny.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank hon. Members for their kind remarks to me and, more especially, to the Officers of the House on whose services we rely so heavily. I am certain that proceedings will be conducted with courtesy, if not always with total agreement.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
