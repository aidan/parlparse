<H4><center>Clause 188</center></H4>
<H4><center>Insurers in financial difficulties</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): At the end of our previous sitting, I was in the middle of asking the Government about those who will be running the consultation scheme. I was prompted to do so by having read about the width of the powers and the scope of the responsibilities of the scheme manager. For example, under clause 188(3), the measures that the scheme manager may take in relation to insurance companies include giving them assistance to enable them to continue insurance business. Thus, an ailing or bankrupt insurance company may be given funds so that it can continue in being, which could be an enormous continuing liability. The judgments that will have to be made will be difficult, controversial and far-reaching.
<P>
Will those starting the scheme, formerly the scheme manager in the corporate sense, be authorised persons and have to undergo the necessary procedures to obtain permission to operate in such a way? The decisions that will have to be made will be akin to market decisions and judgments. A great deal of money will be at stake and the implications could be profound for both the stability of the market and the security of investors. What procedures will those people need to go through to be registered for such business?
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right. Some subtle judgments will have to be made. The existing arrangements with the policyholders protection board work in the same way, so the judgments will need to be made currently by those who are carrying out that work.
<P>
I shall explain why such an approach has been taken. Usually, policyholders and the compensation scheme are at a significant disadvantage in the event of liquidation, because of inevitable delays, disruption for policyholders and the extra costs associated with liquidation. The administrative costs of liquidation can be extremely high and higher than the alternative arrangements that can be made under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985. I refer to the Kingscroft Insurance Company, the Walbrook Insurance Company, the El Paso Insurance Company, the Lime Street Insurance Company and the Mutual Reinsurance Company—the KWELM companies—all of which had provisional liquidators appointed to them in 1992. The additional administrative costs incurred as a result of liquidation amounted to £60 million.
<P>
The general view is that it would be in everyone's interest if it were possible to avoid liquidation, not to facilitate the companies carrying on as normal, but to ensure that there is a more orderly run-off and, if possible, that the liabilities for existing policies are honoured. I understand from the latest accounts of the policyholders protection board that about 14 companies are currently on the books. The problems faced by policy holders will be minimised as will the liability on the compensation scheme.
<P>
The people involved will require significant skills, as do those doing it now. We are aiming for the same thing, even though the FSA rather than the policyholders protection board will do the work. I do not know, but I imagine that a number of the same individuals will do the work under the new arrangements. The FSA is consulting on a proposal to set up management committees for each of the sectoral sub-schemes, of which this will be one. In so doing, it will be aware of the need for relevant expertise and continuity between existing schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for that response, as far as it goes. I am aware of the need for these powers, or something like them, and I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation that the people making decisions need to be of high quality and properly trained. The specific question that I asked was whether they will have to be authorised persons. The FSA will require all sorts of people to meet certain specified standards. They will be assessed to find out whether they are fit and proper persons. Indeed, they will be investigated to see whether they can do the jobs to which they will be assigned. We have been through all of that. I suppose that it is right that the FSA should require its employees or associates to meet the same standards and follow the same disciplines as the policyholders protection board. All I am asking is whether the people making the decisions will be authorised persons, as defined in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are not proposing that the people involved in this part of the FSA's work should be treated differently from any other of the FSA's staff, many of whom will be required to make difficult judgments. The short answer to the right hon. Gentleman's question is no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am a little surprised at that. We have discovered another example of the FSA writing rules for other people, but being disinclined to live up to the rules itself. This is another asymmetry. Market participants will have to meet defined standards and will face severe penalties if they fail to do so, but the FSA—or, in this case, a body set up by the FSA, which is separate from the authority—will not have to register its personnel or meet the same standards. That is rather surprising. It is a new form of immunity, which I find rather regrettable. Unless it is explained, I must express my alarm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): The role is different from the general role of FSA staff, who will be doing their regulating. This is a quasi-business role requiring knowledge of and expertise in the insurance industry. The staff are not going round making inspections, checking records or assessing whether individuals are fit and proper. I am not saying it simply for the sake of making a point, but it would be extremely inappropriate not to have duly qualified and authorised people from the insurance industry handling that task.
<P>
I note that clause 188 empowers that body to invest in insurance businesses in order to keep them alive. Here again, the logic seems pragmatic. I understand that it may be cheaper to do that than to allow an insurance business to be bailed out, but taking decisions of that magnitude is not a job for a regulator; it is the job of an investor—someone who knows about the insurance industry and what, if any, financial limitations will be applied in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Opposition Members see cause for alarm where there is none. The general view is that the policyholders protection board has worked pretty well. Indeed, a private Member's Bill amending the 1975 Act reached the statute book in March 1997, just before the general election. The Bill was piloted through the House by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), with the support of the Government of the day. The amendments enshrined in that legislation are reflected in the changes that we have made in the Bill.
<P>
I defend those arrangements on the grounds that they are non-contentious—the previous Government supported the latest changes—and that, as far as I am aware, no problems have been encountered in their operation. We have no reason to fear their continuation. Of course, the FSA must ensure that its staff are qualified for each of the many different jobs.
<P>
I do not understand the right hon. Gentleman's question about authorised persons, or in what sense he meant it. He clearly did not intend the clause 28 meaning of that word. The FSA should do everything necessary to ensure that all its staff, whatever their job, are properly qualified. We can be confident that the FSA will do so, and that there will be no greater cause for concern in that part of the FSA's activities than in any other, particularly given the long-standing arrangements operated by the policyholders protection board, which have worked well with support from Governments of both parties for 25 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The fact that this arrangement has worked well in the past is to be welcomed. However, many aspects of the financial services industry worked perfectly well before regulation was introduced. It is not an argument for not considering the regulatory context.
<P>
Our point is that, as we interpret clause 188, the individuals concerned will be carrying on insurance business. To do so, they should be authorised persons under parts III and IV. That point may not have been focused upon before. Indeed, many issues are tucked away and have not been focused on. However, given what already happens with the insurance scheme and what the Government intend, we understand that one of the main purposes of the Bill is to look at the whole territory, to rewrite it or tighten it up and to make sure that everything is as it should be. However, there is an omission: the tasks being undertaken by those people cannot properly be carried out by someone who is not an authorised person.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Financial Secretary asked what I meant by authorised person. To enforce my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) observations, many earlier parts of the Bill dealt precisely with the issue of authorised persons and made it clear that people were not permitted to carry out certain activities unless they were authorised persons. Pages and pages of the Bill lay down the detailed requirements and penalties that attach to people who undertake those activities when they are not authorised.
<P>
As we noticed, the compensation scheme operators will stray beyond what might narrowly be called compensation activities and into virtually running businesses. They will certainly decide whether other businesses should continue trading, be rescued or be allowed to die. Those are intensely risky decisions, and our modest request is that those involved should be authorised persons. In that way, the same disciplines and regulations will apply to them as apply to the rest of the market. So far, I am unaware of any reason not to take that approach, beyond the Minister's reassurance that everything has worked fine up to now.
<P>
We are entering new territory. The Bill's purpose is to take forward regulation on a wider, all-encompassing basis, and it provides for the relevant activities to be expanded by secondary legislation. Therefore, my concerns and alarm have rather increased over the past few minutes. We have not tabled an amendment to tackle the problem, but I am sure that we shall find ways of raising it later in the Bill, even if we do not vote against the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee longer than necessary, but I do not think that the people in the FSA, about whom we are talking, will be carrying on regulated activity, as it is likely to be defined. They will certainly make some difficult decisions. The arrangements under which those decisions are made and, in many cases, the individuals who make them, will be precisely the same as before. However, those involved will not be carrying on a business activity and will be appointed by the FSA for the purpose in the Bill. That is quite different from somebody carrying on a business and selling financial services products to members of the public or carrying out other regulated activities that are set out in the Bill. I do not, therefore, see the analogy that Opposition Members suggest exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I find that reply slightly remarkable. Is the Minister saying that I would not have to register if I undertook the activities in the Bill as a private individual? In other words, I could rescue an insurance business or facilitate the transfer of an insurance business to another insured person. If I were to enter the market in those ways, to take just two powers, the FSA would quite rightly ring me up and ask, ``Are you authorised?'' I am amazed that the Minister thinks that such activity is not regulated. We shall look back at our earlier debates with a new eye. Indeed, if there are problems about the scope of the Bill, we shall refer to the Minister's remarks.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 188, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 189</center></H4>
<H4><center>Annual report</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 697, in page 95, line 35, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The scheme manager shall lay the report before the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons and the Chairman shall, if so required, attend before and give evidence to the Committee.'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`5A.(1) No appointment of chairman or of Chief Ombudsman shall have effect without the Authority having given not less than 30 days notice of the intended appointment to the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.

(2) If the Committee shall so require within the further period of 30 days from the date of such notice, the Authority shall arrange for the intended appointee to attend before and give evidence to the Committee.
<P>
(3) In deciding whether to proceed with the appointment, the Authority shall take into account or, with regard to an appointment to the position of Chief Ombudsman, procure that the scheme operator shall take into account, any views expressed by the Committee as to the individual's suitability.'.<P>

No. 700, in schedule 14, page 225, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The scheme operator shall lay the report before the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons and the Chairman shall, if so required, attend before and give evidence to the Committee.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 697 is intended to ensure the accountability of the compensation scheme to Parliament. Amendment No. 699 relates to schedule 14, which deals with the ombudsman, and is intended to subject appointees to scrutiny. Amendment No. 700 is intended to ensure the accountability of the ombudsman scheme to Parliament.
<P>
The points that underlie the amendments are self-evident. The two schemes are important: their lines of accountability under the Bill are virtually non-existent and the Treasury Committee is best equipped to do a thorough job of monitoring the activities and leadership of the two bodies. In view of their substantial powers and budgets, it is appropriate to have an effective channel of parliamentary accountability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> This is an important matter and parliamentary accountability was raised in the report of the Burns Committee, which recommended that the Treasury Committee should review the authority's annual report. Let me remind hon. Members of the Government's response:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government would also regard it as a helpful development if the relevant committee were to decide to scrutinise a wider range of relevant material, for example the reports of the Ombudsman and Compensation schemes and publications of the Consumer and Practitioner Panels.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The aspirations of the hon. Gentleman and the Government are the same.
<P>
The scheme manager will be under two separate statutory obligations to produce annual reports—one to produce an annual report and accounts under the Companies Acts and one to report to the authority under the clause. I understand that the current operator of the ombudsman scheme, Andreas Whittam Smith, and the chief ombudsman, Walter Merricks, are keen for the Select Committee to take an interest in the way in which the scheme operates. They propose to ensure that copies of their reports will be made available to members of the Committee and placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The board manager of the compensation scheme—whose position, as we saw this morning, has just been advertised—may well take a similar view. If a copy of the report does not materialise, the Committee already has powers to require a copy. It may further reassure members of the Committee that the FSA proposes to follow best practice based on Nolan principles in making its appointments to the board of the scheme operator. It has already done so in making its initial appointments.
<P>
I welcome any scrutiny that the Committee feels able to give to the operation of any of the arrangements established by the Bill. However, speaking as a former member of the Treasury Committee, I do not believe that it is right to compel it to do so. It may not want to examine all the issues in every year and its interest might be determined by the success or otherwise of the scheme. I hope that the Treasury Committee—and indeed other Committees of the House—will want to consider the operation of the regime from time to time. Opposition Members are right to hope for that. The amendment is too prescriptive, however, and I hope that they will withdraw it, accepting that they are right to encourage the Treasury Committee to follow these matters with close interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I listened with great pleasure to the Financial Secretary's comments and confirmation that the proposed arrangements are based on the recommendations of the Burns Committee, which the Government said they would follow as part of the agreement to carry over the Bill. However, he suddenly became like the reluctant bridegroom. There is no sensible reason why the law should not impose on the Treasury Committee and burden it with such a task. The Treasury Committee exists to serve the nation and Parliament. If Parliament decides that that Committee can play an important role, I cannot understand why it should not do so.
<P>
Without the amendments, the Burns Committee's recommendations and the excellent echoes of good intent from the Financial Secretary could be as nought. The Treasury Committee may or may not have a role; it would not be required to become involved. Democratic accountability is based on legal requirements. Therefore, I cannot understand the Government's reluctance to accept the amendments. If they wish to redraft them, using different words to achieve the same effect, it is no skin off our nose, but simply to ignore such matters is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): If my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has not said it all, he has said a great deal. The bridegroom is very reluctant; he is keen to agree to all the ideas, except when it comes to ensuring that they happen. The Financial Secretary said that the proposal is important, that the Burns Committee had recommended the approach, that the Treasury Committee could usefully scrutinise such issues and that the most important person on whom the proposal would impose a burden—Andreas Whittam-Smith—is in favour of greater scrutiny, but when it came to the crunch, he said that he wanted to reject the amendment. I hoped he would say that, although the Government did not like the amendment, they would table another on Report with which they felt more comfortable and which would allow the Treasury Committee discretion to deal with the matters to which he referred. If the Treasury Committee wanted to consider such matters not every year, but every three years, for whatever reason, it would be permitted to do so. Those are fine-tuning legislative issues, not matters of substance or principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): In fact, the Burns Committee recommended that there should be a report to Parliament, not to the Treasury Committee, and it did so deliberately after discussion, taking the view that such issues were important and that Parliament, having received the report, should decide how to handle it. The Burns Committee did not recommend that the report should go before the Treasury Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is correct. The Joint Committee did not say specifically that the report should go before the Select Committee; it said that there should be a report to Parliament and it discussed how that should be accomplished. Since then, matters have moved on. As the Financial Secretary rightly said, those who will be most affected have said that a report to the Select Committee is probably the most appropriate approach, and I agree.
<P>
Only one of the three amendments in this group relates directly to the clause; the others deal with the ombudsman scheme. One of the amendments constitutes an attempt to obtain greater accountability for the compensation scheme. The other two amendments represent attempts to achieve greater accountability for the ombudsman scheme, one of which deals with confirmation hearings for the ombudsman. With your permission, Mr. Malins, I might return to them at the appropriate point in the stand part debate on schedule 14 rather than going into great detail now.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to talk about the amendments, now might be the appropriate time to do so as they are under debate.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> In that case, I shall go into more detail on the ombudsman scheme, even though that is jumping the gun in the sense that we have not yet reached that part of the Bill.
<P>
Consultation paper No. 4, which was published a couple of years ago, acknowledged that there was a problem about who would monitor the people being put in place. Who would guard the guardians? It was suggested that the job be left to the FSA, but, in the end, the favoured suggestion was the creation of the scheme board. That decision was further fleshed out in paragraph 4.30 of consultation paper No. 33, which made it clear that the commissioner would have no powers, only a responsibility to make recommendations.
<P>
The ombudsman will have a lopsided set of incentives. He will have little incentive to protect firms from excessive pressure, but every incentive to side with consumers when he deems it appropriate. If I ran the scheme, I would be most concerned about a major consumer case for which I was held responsible because I had invited a restriction of ombudsman activity in some way. I would be much less worried if the ombudsman process aggrieved a business, even legitimately, as the comeback to me would be far less severe under the present drafting.
<P>
A parliamentary Committee, involving public interviews with witnesses called to explain their behaviour, would be a far better place to ensure proper accountability for the scheme and the board. It would also provide greater publicity for the scheme itself. One of the objectives of the fundamental reform taking place is to give greater public prominence and make things simpler for the public to understand by unifying the schemes. Action by a Select Committee would presumably assist with that.
<P>
The industry is more likely to have a fair hearing in front of a Select Committee than in what will inevitably be a behind-closed-doors discussion with the board followed by a report, which is the current proposal.
<P>
Another great advantage of a Select Committee is that it would be committed to providing periodic review of the process that we are placing on the statute book. The Minister said that the Treasury Select Committee might not want to burden itself with that, which is true. We should be happy to table an amendment to take account of that or would be satisfied if the Minister were to return on Report with something that could enable the Treasury Committee to exercise flexibility.
<P>
I should like to say a little about the background to my thinking on the matter, which has been greatly influenced by the work of the Select Committee on Public Administration in relation to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, whose cases are taking longer to investigate. Incidentally, something similar is already happening with the financial services mixture of schemes.
<P>
The parliamentary ombudsman's investigations are becoming more expensive per case. The general feeling on the Public Administration Committee—on which the Economic Secretary served and whose discussions she may well remember—was that a form of more direct accountability of the ombudsman to Parliament was the most appropriate way of keeping an eye on perceived increasing costs and the time taken for investigation. That is why, after some discussion, the Select Committee eventually decided in its recently produced report on quangos that appointments to major quangos should be subject to confirmation hearings. There was no dissent to that decision from any Labour Members serving on the Committee, which has a Labour majority.
<P>
However, the Bill clearly makes provision for a quango—indeed, a classic one. Some may say that the Bill creates a quango to end all quangos or the biggest ombudsman scheme there has ever been. If I may go further, it is the mother of all ombudsmen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Ombudsmum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Indeed. I am wary of taking my lead from the Opposition Whip, as he previously misled me into thinking that the action of a member of a Committee on which he sat led to the demise of the Greater London council. However, on this occasion, he is dead right to talk about an ombudsmum.
<P>
It is worth briefly examining what the report on quangos said, as it is extremely relevant to our discussion. The Select Committee took extensive evidence on the question of how to ensure parliamentary scrutiny of appointments to such powerful posts. An objection was made that that would lead to a US-style power of appointment by Parliament which was quite out of keeping and without precedent in the British system. In volume I of the Select Committee's sixth report, Professor Bogdanor said that some kind of confirmatory hearing that falls short of the powers of a congressional committee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``could exert a salutary effect in raising standards of public service in Britain. An adverse report on a particular candidate would receive much publicity and deter the Government from making such an appointment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Fear of an adverse report could do much to persuade candidates to make sure that they had thoroughly absorbed the public service ethic.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with that sound evidence, which is why we tabled our amendments. Indeed, one of them follows the wording of the Select Committee's recommendation as closely as possible. I will not read out that recommendation, as it would amount to reading out the amendment again; for those who are interested, however, it is in paragraph 92 of volume 1 of the Select Committee.
<P>
Therefore, there is an accountability problem, as the Minister has more or less accepted. In fact, he has accepted every single argument except the conclusion that it is logical to include in the Bill a means of giving a form of accountability to the Treasury Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Before considering the question of accountability and the importance of getting accountability through Parliament, I wish to ask for clarification of the concept of scheme manager. I confess to a misunderstanding or a lack of understanding; I hope to be enlightened.
<P>
I have looked at the report produced by the shadow ombudsman on that subject that was recently circulated to us. Under the heading ``How is the new body to be accountable?'', he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The new organisation (referred to in the Bill as `the scheme operator' and currently known as Financial Services Ombudsman Scheme Limited) is an independent corporate body limited by guarantee, whose directors are appointed by the FSA.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the expression ``scheme operator'' mean the same as ``scheme manager'', as found in clause 189 and in previous clauses, which we have been considering? I feel that it might.
<P>
I jump ahead to clauses dealing with the establishment of the financial services ombudsman scheme under part XV, which we shall soon reach. I am muddled about how the elements of those clauses link. The amendments seem to criss-cross schedule 14. I would be grateful if the Minister could provide a small guidebook—I was going to say a vade mecum, but one must avoid Latin—on how one may find one's way around the intricacies of the intermingling sections.
<P>
I should return to the key point raised in the Joint Committee. On page 69 of that committee's report is a recommendation that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Ombudsman Scheme should be required to report annually to Parliament''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
although, admittedly, only on the adequacy of its budget. How does that requirement link with the question of accountability?
<P>
If a body is accountable only to the institution that establishes it and which appoints its members, and if its link with Parliament is only through Treasury Ministers, it will be difficult in practice for Parliament to keep much watch on what that body does until something goes dreadfully wrong and the matter becomes one of deep public concern or even scandal. Neither we nor Ministers wish to establish such a system.
<P>
Although there have been Select Committees for almost 20 years, they are still, to some extent, in their infancy. Those of us who are trying to think of how to strengthen Parliament still wonder whether the way in which the Select Committee system works is as efficient as it could be. We are seeking to modernise—to use a currently much over-used word in its best sense—procedures for a new and immensely powerful body. We wish to ensure that we have an accountability system that will work.
<P>
I support what my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and for Arundel and South Downs have said. I am genuinely seeking truth and a means of finding my way through the complex intermingling of provisions, so I anticipate the Minister's explanation with interest.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Chichester set out a range of arguments for my being reluctant to be a bridegroom—I found them convincing and I hope that he did too. He explained how the Procedure Committee has taken several decisions on what it wants to do. It is for the Treasury Committee to decide how to discharge its remit. He accepted that there would be a need to be flexible and not too over-prescriptive about the requirement that is placed on the Treasury Committee, and the best way to do that is not to have it spelt out in legislation. The Treasury Committee has a responsibility for keeping an eye on what is happening to this and other aspects of financial services regulation. Our response to the Burns Committee made it clear that we would be pleased if it looked at what was happening to the compensation and ombudsman schemes. There is no need to enshrine in the Bill any more than that. The scheme is required to publish a report. If there is a problem, the general powers of the Treasury Committee allow it to require documentation to be provided. We agree that this needs to be flexible, but it is not appropriate to include that in the Bill.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) asked a number of questions as a seeker after truth. I have a good deal of sympathy because I once asked similar questions—perhaps I should make my helpful aide memoire available to him. Part XIV sets up a compensation scheme and establishes a framework for the scheme manager. Part XV sets up the ombudsman scheme and establishes the framework for the scheme operator. There is a scheme manager for the compensation scheme and a scheme operator for the ombudsman scheme. I accept the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point about complexity and hope that I have explained the matter.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> That is helpful, but I need further clarification. We know that the scheme manager is a body corporate which will be run by a chairman and members of a board. According to the shadow ombudsman's circular, his corporation is known as the Financial Services Ombudsman Scheme Ltd. which, as a limited company, is also a body corporate. Therefore, it too must have a chairman and board members. Are they the same people? To what extent do they do the same job?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right: the ombudsman scheme operator is a body corporate. The chairman of that is Andreas Whittam Smith; the ombudsman is Walter Merricks. There is a body corporate with a board and chairman, but there is also an individual, supported by a number of staff, who is the chief ombudsman. Both are corporate entities.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The ombudsman can also give compensation. Therefore, are two compensating bodies being run in parallel? We have two corporations: the ombudsman, which I regard as the chief executive to the board that is chaired by Mr. Whittam Smith, with 320 to 400 staff, and the scheme manager, which is responsible for the compensation scheme. As a corporate body, the scheme manager will have a chairman and a board. I cannot remember whether the Minister has told us how many people the compensation scheme will employ. Will he enlighten us on that? Are they both really necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that they are because they do rather different jobs. The ombudsman will respond to complaints from people who are unhappy with what has happened to them, while the compensation scheme is available for difficulties triggered in a variety of ways, especially in cases of default by a firm that cannot meet its existing liabilities. The ombudsman scheme is about resolving complaints; although it can require firms to make payments to complainants, those are two different tasks. That is why they are dealt with separately in the Bill. I have not said how many people will work for the complaints scheme, but I have no doubt that that information can be provided in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister partially answered my questions about the amendment on annual reports by saying that it should be left to the Select Committee and we should not tie its hands. However, he did not answer the points that I raised about confirmation hearings—he just ignored them. I should be grateful if he would come back to that important matter.
<P>
The person whom we are appointing will be running the biggest ombudsman scheme in the world. He is being given huge powers and will be able to impose mandatory decisions on firms with no recourse to law. Opposition Members suggest that someone who is given such powers should be subject to some form of parliamentary scrutiny. As the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) pointed out, the Burns Committee did not specify the type of scrutiny, but most people agree that it should probably be the Treasury Committee.
<P>
In the last week a report on quangos has been published. It suggests that major quango appointments should also be made subject to some kind of Select Committee scrutiny. I am really asking the Minister for a reaction to the view that there should be a form of confirmation hearing, although short of the sort of mandatory powers that lie in the hands of congressional hearings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman's closing phrase shows the way forward. If I understand him correctly, he is not calling for mandatory hearings of that kind. The point that I made—I think that the hon. Gentleman is saying the same—is that it ought to be for the Treasury Committee to decide how it discharges its oversight of this area. I certainly do not think that it is appropriate to spell that out in the Bill, which seemed to be the suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am suggesting that the Bill should give the Select Committee the power to hold a confirmatory hearing and require the provision of due notice of appointments to that Committee so that it can exercise its power. I am not suggesting—this is the distinction between what I suggest and what goes on in the United States—that that Committee should then have the power to refuse an appointment, which it does in the US. That is what I meant when I said that the powers that are vested in the Select Committee should not be mandatory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The matter has been well aired, but perhaps the Minister misread our amendments. They would not force anyone to do anything. We are simply saying in respect of the compensation scheme and the ombudsman scheme that they should send their reports to the Select Committee. It is up to the Select Committee to do with them as it wishes; the clause contains the phrase ``if they so require''. It may not so require. The provision empowers the Select Committee, if it wishes, to summon both chairmen to discover what has been happening. Without the power, it seems that the Treasury Committee can do nothing about that; it is up to the two schemes to decide whether they fancy sending the reports. The amendments do not force the Select Committee to do anything. Likewise, in terms of the appointment, it simply requires that, before the FSA completes its appointment, it should send a notice of the intended appointment to the Treasury; it is then up to the Select Committee to respond. The amendment would enable the process that we and the Minister consider desirable to be set in train. I do not understand why the Minister thinks that the amendments are too strong: they are merely enabling amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> But the Select Committee already has that power. Under Standing Order No. 152 it can send for persons, papers and records. It does not require an additional power in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does the Treasury Committee have the power to require that the appointment of the chief ombudsman shall not be made until 30 days after it has had notice of the intended appointment, and does it already have the power to require the chairman of the new ombudsman and compensation committee to send it its reports? If it is the latter, I accept that the amendments may be unnecessary. I am certain that the former does not apply: I am sure that the Treasury Committee does not have a power to interfere in the FSA's method of appointing the chief ombudsman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The Treasury Committee has the power to require whatever papers it wishes to receive; it does not have the power of which he spoke initially.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> If everyone, including the Minister himself, agrees that the scheme's budget should be reviewed annually by Parliament, can he explain why logically, that cannot be extended to a more wide-ranging review of the activities for which the budget pays?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The only difference between us is how prescriptive we wish to be about how the Treasury Committee behaves. I suggest that it already has all the powers that it needs to require information and documents. The scheme's operator will produce an annual report, to comply with the Companies Act, so the information will be there and publicly available, and the Treasury Committee can obtain it. I do not think that that Committee has any powers to carry out its remit in this respect. The powers already exist.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 193 provides full immunity for the scheme manager. Our amendment is fairly clear; it would add the provision that immunity would not apply to the scheme manager if an act or omission was shown to have been in breach of contract or to have been negligent. If the scheme manager causes loss because of negligence or breach of contract, it should be liable to compensate the firm or investor affected. That would help to make the scheme manager fully alert to its responsibilities, and it can protect against the risk of being sued by purchasing insurance, which would be a legitimate operating expense.
<P>
We have raised the issue of immunity in other contexts, but this is separate from the immunity of the FSA itself. It follows the principle of not giving immunity to staff; but in the matter of compensation it is appropriate that the scheme manager should have immunity against breach of contract or negligence.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The amendment raises a serious question. I shall start from basic principles. I have always said that the FSA should have total or at least substantial immunity. Although it is a hugely powerful body that deals with hugely powerful players, it can be strongly argued that it would be inhibited in its regulatory functions if it did not have substantial immunity. However, I keep a tiny window open because it is important that the FSA should be accountable.
<P>
I have spoken of two basic principles. Regulators who deal with huge players need substantial immunity so that they can play properly. However, no one should have total immunity; people should have to look over their shoulders, otherwise they could become overbearing and slack.
<P>
The scheme manager, however, is a satellite of the FSA that deals with compensation. Here, the basic principles do not point strongly at all towards immunity. All that the compensation scheme has to do is effectively to decide on and administer compensation for those customers or consumers who have lost out because regulated businesses in the financial services industry have failed. It is therefore necessary to provide compensation.
<P>
The amendment seeks to deal with what might happen if the body corporate to be charged with running the compensation scheme is so careless or negligent that someone who has already lost out, because the insurer or provider with which he contracted cannot pay up, receives no compensation—if, because of dilatoriness or incompetence on the part of that body corporate, the person who has already suffered loses out again.
<P>
A significant sum might be owed to a very small player—a consumer. It is not as if the risk of an action for damages could be held over the compensation scheme by one of the big players to frighten it and stop it carrying out its task. The justification for immunity does not apply in such circumstances.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it would be perfectly possible for this statutory body to obtain insurance against its own negligence at rates that are probably even more competitive than those that solicitors, barristers or other professionals can obtain for their protection. It would be thoroughly healthy for the body to know that it had better look to its laurels and carry out its work properly, in which case it would never have to pay compensation. The board will not be dealing with the whole gamut of everything that can happen in the industry; it will deal with individual cases that have been reported to it and where compensation has been sought. I do not see the argument for the board having immunity against its own negligence or breach of statutory duty—or to use the phrase in the amendment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in breach of contract or negligent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not understand how the argument for the board having immunity can be put on its feet. I look forward to listening to the Minister trying to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise for missing the start of the debate. It is an important subject, on which we have touched before. We said that statutory immunity is objectionable in principle, even though there may be reasons for extending it, at least in some form, to the FSA, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire suggested. We believe that the provision should be circumscribed and limited. Our amendment would limit it; statutory immunity in cases of negligence would not be allowed.
<P>
I am struck by what the Government profess they want to do about quangos and what they are doing in the Bill. Some time ago, I was sent a glossy document from the Cabinet Office, ``Opening the doors'', which is about quangos. I am aware that the corporate body may not be a quango, but quango is a shorthand way of describing non-departmental public bodies. The compensation scheme is analogous to a quango even if it is not precisely in that category. Reading through the foreword by the former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the main proposals, I was rather impressed. They are all admirable proposals, but they are not reflected in the Bill in the way in which the FSA or the compensation scheme has been set up.
<P>
For example, recommendation 7 of the document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government proposes to invite Parliamentary Select Committees to take a more active role in scrutinising the work of the NDPBS''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet, when we tabled an amendment to do that, we were told that that was not right and that the proposal had been rejected. It is true that Select Committees can demand to see people and papers, but it would have been helpful and in the spirit of this glossy document if that had been put beyond doubt in the Bill. It would be an encouragement both to the Treasury Committee and the FSA to give evidence before a parliamentary Committee.
<P>
The Government said that they were trying to reduce the number of quangos, but they are setting up more. The document further states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Rigorous financial management and policy reviews . . . will be undertaken at least every five years''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dealing with a clause that is fairly narrow in relation to statutory immunity and the amendment narrows it even further. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not stray too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Always alert to your command, Mr. Malins, I shall return immediately to the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Various matters appear in the quango document that are not reflected in the Bill. Most strikingly, there is nothing in the document about statutory immunity. One might have expected a reference to the need for some quangos to enjoy statutory immunity in special circumstances, but the thrust of this glossy document is against any such departure. As we have pointed out many times, there is an enormous gap between what the Government say and what they do. We noticed that with respect to the public right to know and open government. The Government signed up to the right rhetoric, but never delivered in principle Now we hear that quangos should be made more accountable, but the Bill embodies few of the relevant recommendations, particularly on statutory immunity. That is why we are alarmed. It would go some way towards repairing the Government's reputation if they were to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman about the Government's reputation. A new corporate body is being set up, but it is replacing five existing schemes—the building society investor protection scheme, the deposit protection scheme, the friendly society protection scheme, the investors compensation scheme and the policy holdings protection board. That has been widely welcomed and it represents an important step forward.
<P>
Unlike Opposition Members, I see no more merit in restricting the scope of the compensation scheme's immunity in this case than for the FSA. The compensation scheme is not a regulator. It is set up for the specific function of ensuring that consumers do not lose all their deposit or investment when an authorised person becomes insolvent. In some cases, consumers might be able to recover some, perhaps all, of their investments from the authorised business once the winding-up action is complete. That will take time, and while the winding-up is happening consumers could suffer significant hardship. The compensation scheme deals with that by enabling payments to be made at an early stage. To do so, the scheme manager must be able to take decisions about whether to make payments when full information about the circumstances of the failure might not be available. If the scheme manager needed to be constantly alert to the possibility of legal action—the aftermath of a business failure is the sort of climate in which legal actions are common—it could seriously interfere with the swift processing of claims. I suspect that the whole Committee would agree that that is the most important objective in setting up the scheme, so its very purpose could be defeated by the amendment.
<P>
Claims for breach of contract, referred to in the amendment, are irrelevant because the claimant does not have a contract with the scheme for the payment of compensation. Claims for negligence are also inappropriate when the scheme manager has to make difficult judgments, which should not be swayed by the need to avoid negligence actions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Can the Minister give one example of a difficult judgment that the scheme manager would have to make?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We could all envisage circumstances in which judgments about what is happening to a business and what steps should be taken to protect its clients will have to be made, especially when the business is in serious difficulties. We do not want the scheme manager to feel that he has to give preferential treatment to the claimant making the most noise, or the one threatening a damages claim, instead of to those prepared to wait patiently for the default to be resolved to the benefit of all claimants.
<P>
It would be wrong in any case to believe that immunity in damages puts the compensation scheme beyond the reach of any court. If a person believes that the scheme manager has acted beyond the scope of his powers, contrary to what is required by scheme rules, there is no restriction on appropriate action. The scheme manager's immunity from damages is not absolute, as is spelled out in subsection (2).
<P>
The amendment would force the scheme manager to base judgments on the likelihood of being sued for damages, which is not sensible. The scheme manager should be able to act quickly, in line with the information that is to hand and with what is appropriate and permissible under the scheme.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will feel able to withdraw the amendment. It would not help the effective operation of a decent compensation scheme, which we all want. However, if Opposition Members press the amendment to a vote, I hope that my hon. Friends will vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> When I moved the amendment, I said that there should be no problem with the compensation scheme obtaining professional cover for any risk of negligence, just as every operator in the financial services industry is obliged to obtain such cover. In a sense, that is a major answer to the concerns that the Minister raised.
<P>
If one sits back and thinks about the arguments for excluding immunity against negligence and breach of contract, one realises that they are pretty weak. The main party to whom the clause is relevant is the individual who has already suffered or might suffer loss. Such individuals will go to the ombudsman to get that put right. As we discussed elsewhere in the Bill, those involved in the part of the ombudsman scheme that deals with insurance arrangements, which in reality do not form part of a single ombudsman scheme, would need to be adequately qualified as regards the insurance industry to administer the scheme correctly; indeed, we feel that they should be authorised. However, we have been told, ``Oh no, they can include any old person whom the FSA cares to appoint. If they make a mess of things as a result of negligence, people cannot have a go at them.'' The correct approach is for such people not to be immune from action against them. They should get their insurance like anybody else. Ideally, people who work for a part of the scheme manager that requires industry expertise will also need to be authorised.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister always gives careful answers, and I am amazed that the words that he read out from the brief did not stick in his throat. His comments about the need for immunity would apply just as much to a charity, a local authority, a public transport operator and any public body that provided services that were not for profit. Indeed, they could apply just as well to bodies that provided services for profit if those bodies did so in good faith.
<P>
We are talking about a perfectly simple scheme. The compensation authority has a statutory duty to provide compensation in a competent manner to those who need it and who fall within the circumstances in which compensation is appropriate. It is being suggested that we give with one hand and set up a body that is intended to be competent. Not many hours ago, before lunch, the Minister used words such as ``efficient'' and ``effective''. However, the body that we are discussing is so far from being efficient and effective that it will be either negligent or in breach of contract, although breach of contract is slightly less likely than negligence under the present circumstances. Yet, the citizen for whom the compensation authority is to be set up has no remedy. The whole idea is that the citizen will have a remedy if a private sector body fails. He will go to a public sector body for a remedy. That body will have a limited and precise function and if it messes it up in a thoroughly unsatisfactory way, it will be negligent. However, those involved will turn to the citizen and say, ``Too bad chum. We realise that we've made a complete mess, but we have statutory immunity and you can go and whistle.'' That is the suggestion, which is fine if there is a massive task of regulation. I say that it is fine; at least it is an argument. In this context, however, the suggestion is of a defined and specific function that could perfectly well be insured against.
<P>
The Minister's arguments simply do not stand up. He talks about difficult judgments. People beating on the door and arguing for compensation may harass the authority. Some of them may threaten to sue if they do not get their money quickly, but, providing that the body acts in a reasonably competent way, responds to letters and says, ``We're considering your case carefully, but 1,100 people are affected by the scheme and we've got to work out in a reasonable time what compensation is available and how it should be divided up'', it will have nothing to fear and will not be found negligent.
<P>
The Home Office owes compensation to people whose pistols it confiscated pursuant to the statutory scheme that I voted against shortly after the election. So far as I can recall, it still has not finished paying that compensation two years later, which gets jolly close to negligence. The Home Office is liable for damages eventually if it fails to do so; it has no statutory immunity and has not asked for it. I dare say that it would take a long time before such a thing amounted to negligence. However, the position is exactly the same: there is plenty of money to pay compensation and no heavy burden.
<P>
I see an increasing effort by quasi-government bodies, or bodies set up statutorily, to try to spread, in a pernicious way, the notion of immunity in cases when there is no fundamental justification for it. Will the Minister go away, think again, consult his colleagues and ask where the matter will end? If he will not do that, I am sure that we should vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is another occasion on which we have become more worried the more that the debate has gone on. It is now beyond doubt that the Bill sets up a priest class of commercial operator that is not subject to the law and, more than that, not subject to the normal dictates of what is required of authorised persons. I link the two.
<P>
In an earlier debate, the Minister said that it was not necessary that authorised persons be involved. He did not give any terribly convincing reasons, but I now know what the reason is: authorised persons could not get away with negligent behaviour. The authority would rightly catch an ordinary insurance company that was negligent, but those commercial operators taking commercial decisions in the marketplace will be allowed to be negligent. Not only will they be allowed to escape the strictures of the FSA, but they will be immune from the law. That is wholly objectionable. Many of their duties, in so far as they run the compensation scheme, are analogous to running an insurance company, but there is a big difference. The contributions are compulsory—there is no escape—so there will be a state-run insurance company with a monopoly. In my view, that makes regulation by the FSA in the usual way even more necessary, which means that those involved should at least be authorised persons. They should also be subject to the normal dictates of the law.
<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire is right: one can imagine many circumstances in which the state-run scheme will get into the most terrible muddle. Any idea that those involved in it will be limitlessly wise and virtuous is contradicted by the experience of many nationalised concerns. In many ways, they will be more likely to get into a muddle. There are already anxieties about the quality of staff working for some regulatory bodies.
<P>
Immunity affects not only senior management, but goes right down to all employees and officers. A newly appointed, unqualified member of staff who makes a serious mistake destabilising the market or jeopardising investor will be immune from external disciplinary action. We shall have to rely on the normal management process within the organisation. We can hardly rely on that, as so little detail has been given about how the scheme is to be run.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The provision is highly objectionable, as a corporate body will enjoy statutory immunity and will avoid the FSA's normal regulatory process. For those reasons, I advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to respond briefly to Opposition Members' points about insurance. Of course, a cost would be associated with the insurance suggested by them. I certainly do not have the impression that there is enthusiasm in the industry to fund the costs of such action. That would not help effective compensation and I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> One recognises a last ditch effort when one sees it passed down on a piece of paper. The Minister referred to cost. Will he give us an idea of the scale of the cost of the insurance, as opposed to the costs of the scheme generally? I suspect that it is minimal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is the Minister asserting that the industry would like statutory immunity to be extended because it is fearful of the costs? That would be astonishing. I am sure that that would not be so if the industry were consulted. However, if it is, I would be grateful for the Minister's confirmation.

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have not detected great enthusiasm in the industry for picking up the costs of legal actions that would take place, were such an arrangement to be implemented.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked about costs this morning. I can certainly give him information about total costs arising under the current scheme. I do not have a figure for the insurers' costs, but it will certainly be a significant sum.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is there immunity under the current scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Of course, the existing compensation schemes that I listed are rather different animals from the FSA and the proposed compensation scheme and do not enjoy immunity.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In that case, the Minister can quite easily find out whether existing schemes insure and what the costs are. I suspect that he will find out they do insure and that the costs are tiny. Will he be kind enough to do that and reconsider the whole matter in view of the nasty charges that he has made which have no strength.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not regard my argument as a last ditch effort, but as a strong, convincing one, which is why I wielded it. However, I am certainly happy to inquire after the information requested by the right hon. and learned Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 674, in Clause 197, page 99, line 7, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 675, 676 and 686.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Before I debate the amendments, I should like to say a few brief words about this key part of the Bill, which provides for a single ombudsman scheme. For the first time there will be a one-stop mechanism for dealing with consumer complaints across the financial services industry as a whole. This is a major element of our reforms under the Bill and a major step forward in consumer protection. I am glad that the Joint Committee recognised the importance of the arrangements, giving them a generally favourable report.
<P>
Several ombudsmen and arbitration schemes currently operate in the financial services sector—the banking ombudsman, the building societies ombudsman, the FSA complaints handling service, the insurance ombudsman bureau, the investment ombudsman, the personal insurance arbitration service, the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman and the Securities and Futures Authority complaints and arbitration service. Some of those schemes are provided for in legislation and others are purely voluntary schemes run by the relevant industry. Some trade associations—for example, the Association of British Insurers—require their members to join a voluntary scheme.
<P>
Before I outline the reasons for putting the new scheme in place, I should like to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of the current scheme's staff and the support given by the industry for its operation. I note that Mr. Walter Merricks, the ombudsman, is present in the Room: he cannot be seen, but I can assure Opposition Members that he is with us. It would be wrong to construe the new regime as a criticism of the efforts and achievements of existing schemes. Indeed, people in the industry have been commended for their efforts in setting up many of those schemes and for the work that has been done over a considerable period. However, the existence of so many schemes has confused consumers. It is often difficult for consumers to know where to turn if they need help to resolve a complaint. The proliferation of arrangements has not helped the schemes to bring their roles to the attention of the public. Some complaints can fall between the jurisdictions of the various schemes, while others may be covered by more than one scheme. Differences exist in the way in which the schemes operate and in the extent of their powers. Part XV will establish a simple, more transparent framework for the resolution of consumer complaints. It sets out the broad details of the new single, independent and compulsory ombudsman scheme for the speedy and informal resolution of disputes between authorised firms and their customers.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 675 and 676 are intended to remove the name of the scheme from the Bill and allow the scheme operator to choose the scheme name. Amendment No. 686 is consequential. When the Bill was first drafted, the name of the scheme used was neutral; it reflected the authority's title and that given to the compensation scheme. However, the body corporate that will run the scheme has been set up and the chief ombudsman has been appointed. The move to a new scheme, with new premises, is under way. The scheme is starting to form its own identity. With that new identity in mind, it was thought that the name ``the financial services ombudsman scheme'' was not right. In particular, the scheme operator and the chief ombudsman thought the use of the word ``scheme'' too rigid and not user friendly. Accordingly, they proposed that the scheme should be allowed to choose its name. We saw no difficulty with such a request and tabled the amendments accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Economic Secretary has said, part XV is important, as it sets up the new ombudsman arrangements. Without offending Mr. Merricks, I intended to call the ombudsman scheme ``son of Leviathan'' because it is a substantial sub-empire within the FSA. Its budget has just increased by £5 million to £20 million and 400 staff are envisaged. There are 200,000 written or telephone complaints per annum and 30,000 responses. If the Bill succeeds in regulating the industry, it is difficult to believe that its task will be as large as that. As it is, in effect, a quango, it should be properly accountable to Parliament and, as we suggest, to the Treasury Committee.
<P>
Sorting out the politics has been a major problem in the prescribed territory. That is reflected to some extent in the amendments and in the desire of those running the scheme to choose its name. I do not object to that; I am sure that a good and sensible name will be chosen. However, I should like to lay down a few markers.
<P>
First, I should like to know whether the customers of European economic area passported firms can use the ombudsman scheme and whether it can find against such firms if they do business in this country, or yet again, will roughly half the people be excluded because they must go to the Rome ombudsman if they deal with an EEA passported firm.?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, we are especially uncomfortable that the arrangements are lopsided. If I were a disgruntled consumer, I could tell the ombudsman that I was fed up with my service provider, who would be obliged to adhere to the ombudsman's findings, but if the consumer does not agree with that and thinks that the ombudsman should have supported him, he can go to court. The double jeopardy problem arises for the industry. Either the ombudsman's finding should be binding on both provider and consumer, or both should be able to go to court. Instead there is an extraordinarily lopsided arrangement, which I believe was inherited from the insurance side of the industry rather than copied from the FSA arrangements, which were more along the lines of arbitration procedure.
<P>
I am most concerned about the funding of the arrangements. Most members of the Committee who have independent financial advisers in their constituencies know that the most frequent and widely justified complaint occurs when consumers—perhaps slightly at the Government's encouragement—thinking that they could get some money out of an IFA, have taken their case to the ombudsman but have had to pay £500 for the privilege of being innocent, which, for a small business, is a significant sum. There is general talk about half of it being financed by a general levy but, implicitly, the other half along the lines of the present financing method. It is important that the small practitioner in the industry should not continue to suffer the injustice of paying £500 when he is wholly innocent.
<P>
The next big point of principle is that the ombudsman is empowered completely to rewrite the Bill. He has the power not to find in accordance with the rules and regulations—which is what the Bill is all about—but in accordance with what ultimately he considers fair and reasonable. If he considers something that conflicts with the Bill to be fair and reasonable, effectively he becomes yet another regulator who creates law.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We argue strongly that the ombudsman should be obliged to stick to the terms of the law and regulations and not go it alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Just let me finish this point. I am aware of the strong objections from many people who have been involved with present ombudsmen and arbitration schemes in the financial services industry
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is narrow, and the hon. Gentleman makes some clause stand part points. It might be for the convenience of the Committee if we do not have a clause stand part debase, so I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to make slightly wider comments on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Does that mean that points that would usually be made in the a clause stand part debate may now be made in this debate on amendments?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have noted the way that the debate is going. A few general points have cropped up on what is a very narrow amendment to a short clause. I shall be more relaxed than usual in this debate on the amendment, on the basis that we shall not then need a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I stand duly criticised, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I meant no criticism of the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Have you already decided not to have a clause stand part debate? It might be easier for us all if my hon. Friend stuck to the rules and we had a clause stand part debate because at least we would know where we were?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My view is not set in concrete, so I shall back-track slightly as I note that one or two Opposition Members appear as anxious as I am that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs should stay within the terms of the amendment to enable us to have a short debate on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I will shut up, Mr. Malins. We have no objections to the amendments. The Minister herself, admittedly to a lesser extent, made general comments when introducing part XV. I had not intended to pre-empt the stand part debate, but part XV merits an overall review as well as a review of its individual clauses. As for the Government amendments, we are happy to accept them.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We welcome the financial services ombudsman and the way in which he is setting about building up his team to carry out the substantial task that my hon. Friend rightly described. It is important to keep a sense of proportion A scheme that employs between 300 and 400 people and which now costs £20 million a year is very big indeed. From my calculations on the back of an amendment paper, if there are 200,000 complaints a year, that means that about £100 is available per complaint, and roughly 500 complaints to be dealt with by each member of staff in a year. That does not sound unfeasible. Some complaints will be pretty footling, but others will be serious and will require a substantial effort to investigate. [Interruption.] I have been handed a helpful note reminding me that we are not yet on the stand part debate. Consequently, I shall treat what I have said as a trailer.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No 675, in page 99, line 9, leave out `ombudsman'.
<P>
No. 676, in page 99, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The scheme is to be operated under a name chosen by the scheme operator but is referred to in this Act as ``the ombudsman scheme''.'.—[Miss Melanie Johnson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am delighted to be able to make a stand part speech on the clause and I promise not to refer back to the amendments that we have just agreed.
<P>
Clause 197, which introduces part XV, is crucial because it sets the tone for the whole part. Subsection (1) sums it up, in that it contains a heavy element of aspiration. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This Part provides for a scheme under which certain disputes may be resolved quickly and with minimum formality by an independent person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We hope so, but that is exactly what we are going to be debating. It is a description of what the Government hope will happen, not necessarily of what will happen. In trying to achieve that aim, the Government have made several big decisions. I want to list four, although I do not intend to linger on them at any length because there will be better places in which to elaborate on them when we reach schedule 14.
<P>
First, the Government decided on a single scheme to replace the existing network of ombudsman schemes and arbitration schemes, which total eight, or arguably nine, depending on how one treats one of them. Secondly, they decided to go for a compulsory ombudsman scheme, rejecting the arbitration approach that is, all firms must be members of the scheme, and the option of using the Arbitration Act 1996 has been ruled out.
<P>
Thirdly, the Government decided that the ombudsman's findings should be enforceable against firms but not against complainants, whether individuals or consumers. The latter will have recourse to the courts, but firms will not. The widespread implications of that, which I will address later, were covered at great length in the Joint Committee report. It is important that there is a clear framework for part XV and that we understand the aspirations behind subsection (1).
<P>
The Government's fourth big decision is that the ombudsman scheme should be accountable to an ombudsman scheme board rather than to Parliament, a Select Committee or, as an original consultation document proposed, to the Financial Services Agency. Taken together, those decisions create, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, a leviathan ombudsman. We will have the biggest ombudsman scheme in the world, with a budget of £20 million. In addition to the 10,000 firms that will operate under the compulsory jurisdiction, the scheme will cover firms that operate under the voluntary jurisdiction.
<P>
The scheme is expected to handle at least 150,000 telephone inquiries and at least 30,000 complaints—there will, of course, be many more—that will lead to conciliation procedure or awards. The figure of 30,000 is taken from consultation paper 33. Why is it up so hugely on the original figure of 12,610, which is the sum of existing complaints as set out in appendix 3 of consultation paper 4? Either we are discussing apples and pears or something is seriously wrong with one of the two figures that are in the public domain.
<P>
We have a massive scheme on our hands and we must ask what effect it will have on the industry. I am worried that we are creating a restrictive and invasive procedure that will lead to a loss of competitiveness among firms. The object of an ombudsman scheme is the opposite of that. Voluntary schemes were created to inculcate and further public confidence in the markets, which in turn would benefit the firms that operated in it.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are several basic reasons for my concerns. First, the service will be free at the point of use to consumers. Even the £50 entry fee that applies to some schemes that this jumbo scheme replaces is being removed. That £50 marks a seriousness of intent and a reluctance to cough it up probably means that a complaint is not serious, which is a sensible way of restricting frivolous complaints.
<P>
Secondly, a practical limit is not imposed on the depths of an ombudsman's inquiry—no ombudsman scheme has such a limit, but the problem is that the decision is justiciable by the consumer. The ombudsman is bound to be careful to ensure that all avenues are covered before a pronouncement is made. That is likely to lead to a deepening of an inquiry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain what he means when he says that a decision is justiciable at the suit of the consumer? He certainly cannot mean that the consumer can sue the ombudsman scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> If the consumer does not like the ombudsman's decision, he can decide to go to the courts and see whether he can do better from court action than he did through the ombudsman. The reasons behind the ombudsman's decision will then be subject to substantial judicial scrutiny. That judicial scrutiny is likely to lead an ombudsman to be extremely cautious in making his decision and is likely to lead him to go to greater depths than he otherwise would so that he covers every angle.
<P>
One must remember that ombudsman schemes were originally designed as informal, flexible and quick means of resolving problems, and were often slightly rough at the edges. That is how they originated in the 20th century. I shall not delay the Committee with their real origins, which lie in the immunity of Crown bureaucrats operating in rural Sweden—I somehow sense from the mood of the Committee that I would not be supported in doing that.
<P>
I have given two reasons why I think that there is a risk that the industry might find itself adversely affected by the scheme. I say ``might'' because the jury is out—it is difficult to know how the scheme will work in practice because it is such a demarche, unprecedented in its scale in Britain.
<P>
The third reason why I am worried that the scheme might prove a burden to industry is because the ombudsman is insufficiently accountable. We have already discussed that matter, and I shall not refer to the points made on the amendments to an earlier clause. However, that is why I have become increasingly concerned the more I have read these clauses over the past few days.
<P>
I would like to give a comparison by briefly putting what we are doing in the context of what is happening in United Kingdom ombudsman schemes. I shall concentrate on public ombudsman schemes, although there are also private ombudsman schemes. Generally, there is pressure for the consolidation of public ombudsmen—the Bill reflects that by its consolidating eight schemes into one, as the Minister enumerated in her opening remarks to the amendments. There is also increasing concern that inquiries are becoming ever lengthier. For example, the average length of an inquiry by the parliamentary ombudsman used to be one year until a few years ago; it is now two years. The costs of each inquiry are rising, and there is concern also about the accountability of the ombudsman—he does not seem ultimately to have anybody looking over his shoulder.
<P>
The big change in ombudsman schemes generally has been that everybody who might be affected, such as Government Departments, has made huge efforts to put in place informal conciliation procedures to obviate the need to go through that increasingly cumbersome process. That has resulted in a fall in the number of cases that have gone to the parliamentary ombudsman. We should be heading along the same route that is now being mapped out for the parliamentary ombudsman—more parliamentary accountability, and an attempt to generate more informal resolution of disputes before they reach the ombudsman.
<P>
What is happening in the financial ombudsman field? According to the figures, proceedings are becoming lengthier. There has been a steady increase in the length of banking ombudsman inquiries, from 170 days in 1993{**nrl**}94 to 193 days in 1995{**nrl**}96. Although the methodology used by the banking ombudsman annual report to describe the length of cases was subsequently changed, anybody reading it carefully would conclude that it has risen above 193 days since then, and probably to well over 200 days. That is in line with the general trend in ombudsman cases.
<P>
Since the Joint Committee reported, the estimated cost of running the new scheme has increased, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned, from £15 to £20 million. That is an increase of one third. Another reason for lengthier and costlier proceedings is their lopsided application, to which my hon. Friend also referred. Decisions are binding on firms, but not on individuals. That will lead to greater legalism. The reason for that is twofold: first, the ombudsman will need to take into account issues of natural justice; secondly, he will need to take into account conformity with the European Court of Human Rights. He will need to ensure that what he has done constitutes a quasi-judicial process, which could stand as a test of scrutiny of article 6. That would result in even less informality, and a greater likelihood of lengthier and costlier proceedings. The consumer has nothing to lose—there is no entry fee—so consumers will have no incentive not to apply to the ombudsman, and, in many cases, they will have incentives to go to law if they do not like the ombudsman's findings.
<P>
We are moving in the opposite direction to that of attempts to improve ombudsman schemes in Britain generally. That is highly regrettable. I will not say a great deal more now, except to refer to the FSA's list of objectives for the ombudsman scheme. I ask the Committee to listen to those objectives, and to decide whether, on the basis of what I have described, they will be achieved under part XV. The first objective is that the new arrangements should be comprehensive in their coverage, which they are. The second is that there should be accessibility for consumers, which has been improved. The third is that the new arrangements should be fair and impartial between both parties—consumers and firms—but that is certainly not true. The scheme does not treat firms and individuals equally—one party may go to law but the other party may not.
<P>
I shall miss out a couple of objectives, and move on to those of transparency and accountability. An adequate system of accountability has not been put in place. On the need for a system that is flexible, simple and prompt, the new arrangements are not likely to provide greater flexibility. Once the new articles are put in place, there is always the risk of a ruling on ECHR article 6. It is unlikely that the system will be more prompt; a trend towards longer and longer investigation is more likely. For all those reasons, I am extremely dubious that the aspirations set out in subsection (1) are achievable. We shall need to look extremely carefully at the next few clauses and at schedule 14 before allowing them on the statute book.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Several times, we have heard the Opposition allege that the provisions for the ombudsman are asymmetric as between the customer and the practitioner, An individual who takes a case to the ombudsman may not discover until afterwards that the practitioner can sue him. He will then face immense costs, and the only outcome of that will be that no one will ever go to the ombudsman.
<P>
As soon as that provision is imported into the scheme, the scheme will be totally negated. No sensible individual would risk taking a complaint to the ombudsman if, in the end, he had to go through an expensive legal process because the practitioner wanted to take him to court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The hon. Gentleman may not be aware of the fact that, in the vast majority of ombudsman schemes, the ombudsman's recommendations are not binding on either party and both parties may go to law. That is the position for the vast majority of such schemes in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Nevertheless, the point remains; it certainly is not the case for the insurance ombudsman scheme, which is widely used. However, the drift of the Opposition's remarks is about the effect of those schemes on the industry. What has been their effect so far? There is no evidence that any of the voluntary ombudsman schemes have had an adverse effect. Why should this scheme do so? It has been said, quite rightly, that such schemes were introduced to give individuals confidence in the financial services schemes of which they were customers. Why has that changed? What is different?
<P>
Week in, week out, I have listened to the Opposition's arguments, but not once have I heard them say anything in favour of the consumer. We constantly hear the plea that everything in favour of the consumer would cause havoc to the industry. I do not believe it. The Opposition would remove access to redress for individuals from the calendar if they had their way. That is exactly their argument.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester made such a comprehensive introductory speech that not many extra points need making. I congratulate him on his extremely helpful survey of the development of ombudsman schemes in the United Kingdom. I never heard such a comprehensive and succinct survey, and I learned a lot.
<P>
I want to explore the relevance of article 6 of the European convention on human rights to the question of imbalance—if there is one—between a firm and an individual over an ombudsman's failure to make an award or finding in favour of a consumer. I can see the sense of that in one direction; it would be rather a pity if the sensible ombudsman schemes that manage to produce moderate awards, and that do justice, should as a matter of regular habit be taken to court by petulant firms; but that is not terribly likely.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
People are most likely to be upset with an ombudsman's decision in big cases, when a substantial award is at risk and the firm in question rushes to its lawyers to find out how to protect itself. Given that the individual can go to court, but the firm cannot, it will have to look to the limited weapons at its command—article 6 probably providing one of the more effective weapons. As the Minister knows, that deals primarily with the right to a fair trial and applies to civil as well as criminal matters. Firms will want to find out from their lawyers whether the way in which the ombudsman is going about matters about which they are fearful will lead to condemnation of themselves in an unfair or disproportionate way. If so, they can be upset on article 6 grounds. It is not desirable that they should have to do that, and I hope that such cases will be rare.
<P>
I wanted to put down that marker in order to receive the Minister's preliminary answer about the imbalance, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. Would not it be better for the matter to be left open, so it is even on each side? I look forward to learning whether what has happened in the history of ombudsman dealings has led to such an imbalanced provision being put into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I put two points on the record? I am deeply concerned that there is no charge. In nearly all the circumstances that I can think of in which goods are free, such a service stimulates limitless demand and receives little checks on the extent to which it can grow. Much of what has happened in the financial services industry during the past two years has encouraged people to try to get something out of the financial business they have been involved with, although they may not have been harmed as a result of such transactions. They often just want to exploit some of the doors that have been opened under the various reviews that have taken place. A completely free service encourages such behaviour, which is not the intention of the ombudsman scheme.
<P>
My second point concerns the argument about lopsidedness. Why did the Government not consider making the ombudsman scheme judgment binding on both sides, especially given that the use of an ombudsman will invariably start with someone saying to him, ``I've got a complaint.''
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall do my best to answer briefly some of the points that have been made, but many of them will be covered under later substantial Opposition amendments. You are generous, Mr. Malins, to allow such a debate to take place now but, given that we have yet to discuss amendments to subsequent clauses, it seems sensible to go into more detail then.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford for his remarks about Opposition Members' apparent lack of concern about ensuring that consumers are offered a fair deal. One of our main aims and one of the FSA's key objectives is ensuring that consumer protection is at the forefront of the work done under the Bill. It is regrettable that that has not weighed more heavily in some hon. Members' remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> May I put on record that the Opposition strongly support consumer protection and we are strongly in favour of an ombudsman scheme? From the start, we have wanted to strike a balance to ensure that the industry is not damaged by the excessive pursuit of consumer protection. It is easy to wipe out all crime. That was done in eastern Europe for a generation, but there were no civil liberties as a result. It is easy to protect consumers against financial service abuse: simply wipe out the industry and there will be none. We are trying to find a sense of balance, which is why we want competition and competitiveness to be an objective in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> A point well made is a point sensibly made, but the comparison that the hon. Gentleman made was not sensible. [Interruption.] As several of my hon. Friends say, it was a little over the top. However, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for agreeing that consumer protection is important and that all members of the Committee recognise that fact.
<P>
Several hon. Members, especially the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire, have asked whether the scheme is balanced correctly. The scheme is designed to be impartial; it is not meant automatically to take the part of the consumer. That is how ombudsmen have operated, and I hope that they always will because it is vital to their credibility. However, it can be difficult for consumers to get redress when pitted against large firms with many resources. Indeed, this morning, I left the Committee to take part in a debate in Westminster Hall, in which we discussed the difficulties of one gentleman—a constituent of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr Beith)—who had great difficulty in getting due redress in a pensions mis-selling case.
<P>
The aim of the scheme is to end the divide so that disputes can be heard on the middle ground in an attempt to achieve conciliation. I should like the hon. Member for Chichester to know that clause 197 will oblige the ombudsman to resolve disputes quickly. The scheme exists not only to settle disputes at the end of a formal process, but to provide conciliation for parties in the early stages of disputes. That is our intention under the clause and the Bill overall. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would encourage that aim.
<P>
The benefits for firms are that they, too, will avoid a drawn out and formal process in the courts in some cases and, therefore, the negative publicity and the other effects of bringing cases into the public arena. Belonging to such a scheme and promoting that fact is an important part of customer care. I hope that all members of the Committee recognise those benefits.
<P>
Of course, voluntary schemes, which are binding on firms but not on consumers, can be successful. However, that is one of the good features of the existing industry-based schemes that will be continued in the new arrangements—for example, in those for the insurance ombudsman scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked whether the ombudsman's determination was too broad. Clearly, we shall consider the matter in greater detail when we debate Opposition amendments to clause 200, but we must bear in mind the Joint Committee's conclusion that we must not allow the scheme to become over-legalistic. Indeed, there is a danger that, if we specify too much, such an outcome will become difficult to avoid. That consideration leads to questions of the length of time that it takes to determine such matters, and of the scheme's cost and effectiveness with regard to resolving problems and securing redress for the consumer.
<P>
The Member for Chichester raised the question of the cost of the scheme. I understand that, due to resourcing and staffing difficulties, the banking ombudsman has a backlog. Clearly, the larger, more fully resourced scheme will be better able to resolve complaints quickly and expertly.
<P>
Opposition Committee members described the scheme as son of Leviathan, which was most unfortunate. I can assure them that that is not the name that has been selected. [Laughter.] Such a description is unfair, because if one puts together the eight or nine existing arrangements, one will of course arrive at something that is much larger. We should bear in mind that aggregation always results in something bigger. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Chichester makes remarks from a sedentary position—

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Our only concern is that it appears that it will be bigger than the sum of its parts. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall deal with those points now if the honourable Gentleman wishes. We anticipate that the cost of establishing the new ombudsman arrangements will be approximately £3.65 million. In addition, there are likely to be operating costs of, at a very rough approximation, £20 million a year, which contrasts with the current aggregate figure of about £15 million a year for current schemes. However, there are differences. The new scheme's costs are estimated from the year 2000 to its commencement at some future point. Current aggregate figures are taken from last year's budget, so there is a considerable time lag.
<P>
Of course, the new scheme's scope is broader than all the others combined, which is another reason why the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The old schemes do not include all the factors that are included in the new scheme's figures. For example, the FSA scheme excludes arbitration costs, and the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation scheme and the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman exclude overheads. Some figures are not comparable, and it is difficult to make an accurate comparison for a variety of reasons. However, the evidence suggests that we are introducing a scheme that is broadly comparable with the existing arrangements in terms of cost.
<P>
The ombudsman aims to create a level playing field for the resolution of complaints. Charging individuals to make complaints would be likely to preclude complaints from going through the scheme. The cost to firms is relatively low, but, as I believe I have said, the scheme should in any case encourage firms to resolve complaints before they reach it. We shall return to the question of costs and associated matters in due course.
<P>
Finally, I return to the question that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked during his opening remarks—which now seem some time ago—about customers of EEA passporting arrangements. Those customers will be subject to the scheme's jurisdiction in exactly the same way as UK firms.

Question put and agreed to.
