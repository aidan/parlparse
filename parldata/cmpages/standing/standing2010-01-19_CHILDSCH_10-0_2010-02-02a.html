<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000715"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> Good afternoon, Mr. Betts. I welcome
the Committee back to its
deliberations.</div><a name="1002033000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for somewhat interrupting the flow of our proceedings, but in
the short break, I found some statistics that might be of interest to
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, although I will see
whether there are more that might be of use. Ofsted is currently
reviewing its pool of specialist special educational needs inspectors,
as recommended by the Lamb inquiry. Of the 386 Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectors who inspect for Ofsted, a quarter specialise in inspecting
one or more area of SEN. Ofsted has not yet provided me with figures
for additional inspectors, but they will be included in the response to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s recent parliamentary question. I hope that
information helps him and other Committee
members.</div><a name="1002033000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 165, we share the desire that parents not be left waiting for
a long period following an annual review meeting before they receive
the authority decision on whether amendments are made. The annual
review cycle already has statutory time limits. Section 324 of the
Education Act 1996 requires the review to be completed within 12 months
of the statement being made or of the previous review. The deadline set
by the amendment could go beyond that 12-month period. If the review 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>started at the beginning of December and there was an eight-week period,
the deadline under the amendment would be the end of January, whereas
the statutory deadline would be the end of December. I know that is not
the intention of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, but
that would be the effect of her
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
always, I will try to help the Committee. Perhaps there is some
confusion over this issue. I am perfectly satisfied with the existing
statutory limit for the review period of 12 months after a statement is
made. An issue arises if somebody appeals the result of the
review&#151;perhaps the hon. Lady means that there is an issue with
the appeal time. I will give an example. If a statement is made at the
end of December and a parent appeals the review, the appeal to the
first-tier SEN tribunal could take six months. If the parent does not
agree with the first-tier SEN tribunal, they can take the matter to the
second tier, which could take another two or three months. Clearly,
that raises
issues.</div><a name="1002033000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
process is the responsibility of not the Department for Children,
Schools and Families, but the Ministry of Justice. A lot of work has
been done to streamline that appeal process, but I know it causes
issues. I say to the hon. Lady that I will speak to the Ministry of
Justice about the appeal time to see whether anything can be done. The
Ministry of Justice has worked exceptionally hard to ensure that the
appeal time is kept to a minimum. As always, I can talk to my
colleagues to see what can be done as a consequence of this important
issue&#151;another Minister is in the room to hear me say
that.</div><a name="1002033000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000716"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I thank the
Minister. I had an overriding concern that the whole thing was getting
dragged out at different stages, so I tabled the amendment to probe the
situation. I will be grateful if he has further discussions with the
Ministry of
Justice.</div><a name="1002033000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000717"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course, and we can discuss what can be done. I
know that everyone is working hard on that. Following my brief
comments, I hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham
will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000718"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): The Minister
got those statistics rapidly, so it would be churlish of me not
acknowledge the helpfulness with which he has approached our
amendments. The clincher before lunch was his assurance that a video
will be available for people who need assistance to use the tribunal
system. As I said, these are probing amendments, and our good debate
has clarified some points. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000719"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we come to clause 9, I would like to make
two brief comments. First, while we made some progress this morning, it
would probably not be described as rapid. I know that there is
enthusiasm in the Committee for a later sitting this evening to try to
make further progress, but nevertheless I have a responsibility to the
House to try to ensure that we make good progress. While I can keep
hon. Members in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>order, I encourage everyone to be as succinct as possible, because
ultimately the one thing that we cannot change is the 5 pm deadline on
Thursday when proceedings have to
conclude.</div><a name="1002033000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it is my view that the next two groups of amendments will allow
sufficient debate to mean that we shall not need a stand part debate on
clause
9.</div><a name="1002033000013"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
9</h4><a name="1002033000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Exceptional
provision of education in short stay schools or
elsewhere</div><a name="1002033000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000720"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I beg to move amendment 166, in
clause 9, page 11, line 29, leave
out &#145;compulsory school&#146; and insert
&#145;participation&#146;.</div><a name="1002033000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000721"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 168, in
clause 9, page 11, line 34, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1B) In
relation to England, each local education authority shall make
arrangements for the provision of suitable education at school or
otherwise than at school for 16-19 students pursuing such examination
courses as may be specified in an order made by the Secretary of State
who, by reason of illness, may not for any period receive suitable
education unless such arrangements are made for
them.&#146;.</div><a name="1002033000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000722"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I will keep my comments
succinct.</div><a name="1002033000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are focused on the first aspect of clause 9, which I
generally welcome. I have long been interested in the education
provision for children with long-term illnesses, probably because I
spent seven months in hospital as a teenager. I have also carried out
quite a lot of constituency work relating to the issue, so I have been
thinking about what could be improved. Clearly, the requirement for
full-time education up to 16, as it stands, is a great improvement.
However, I am concerned about the statutory guidance, which will have
to be revised because, as I am aware from case work, parents are not
always told about their rights when they apply for home tuition and
perhaps have no knowledge  about the choice of alternative
education. I know of children with long-term illnesses who have been
placed in pupil referral units that were not what I would  say
was suitable education. The statutory guidance will be
important.</div><a name="1002033000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Minister for enabling me to talk to some of his
officials because that clarified what was troubling me about the
clause. It became apparent that the compulsory school age was one
matter, but that we would change the participation age in the near
future. By the time it is raised to 18, my second concern will have
been addressed. However, I feel that the Bill should say
&#147;participation&#148; rather than &#147;compulsory
school&#148; age, because people should have the right to participate
in school along with their peers and be supported in alternative forms
of education, should that be
appropriate.</div><a name="1002033000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
168 is more direct than amendment 166. I do not want to make
legislation on the basis of one case, but I would like to refer briefly
to a constituency case that relates to the background of the amendment.
The daughter of one of my constituents has ME. She eventually had home
tuition and got five good GCSEs. She wished to do some time at home and
some time at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>school in the sixth form to pursue her A-levels, but that turned out to
be a nightmare. At the time there was the triangle of the Learning and
Skills Council, Connexions and the local authority, and we could not
obtain a promise of funding for home tuition. She has gone back to
school but, with ME, is finding it difficult to cope with full-time
study in the sixth
form.</div><a name="1002033000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause retains the position whereby it is effectively up to the local
authority&#146;s discretion to provide post-16 education, but that is
wrong. When we have young people who wish to pursue A-levels or other
courses of their choice, there should still be a duty on the local
authority. I realise that the Minister might want to add conditions to
such a policy to ensure that students follow appropriate courses, so
with great help from the Bill team, I have tabled amendment 168, which
states:</div><a name="1002033000601"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
relation to England, each local education authority shall make
arrangements for the provision of suitable education at school or
otherwise than at school for 16-19 students pursuing such examination
courses as may be specified in an order made by the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the provision is expressed in a way that the Minister
considers
acceptable.</div><a name="1002033000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
parents have a very sick child, they are so busy sorting out their
health needs that a battle with the education authority is just one too
many things to cope with. My constituent has had a difficult time. We
know that quite a lot of young people have ME, and I am sure that we
can think of other health conditions that make it difficult for young
people to attend school full time, yet from which they might well
recover. I hope that my constituent&#146;s daughter will attend
university in due course. I will be very grateful if the Minister will
consider the amendments. I tabled them not to oppose the Government,
but to close the
loophole.</div><a name="1002033000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000723"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The clause is extremely important. It will ensure
that full-time education is available in alternative provision not
only, as the law states at present, for those excluded from school, but
for those who might not be at school for medical or other reasons. As
such, it is one of those clauses that sometimes pass a Committee by,
despite their significance, and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole is right to draw the measure to our
attention.</div><a name="1002033000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to ensure that the provision is enacted as soon as possible. As
the hon. Lady said, the compulsory school age of up to 16 is obviously
easily defined under law. As for post-16 education, raising the
participation age will not happen until 2013 for 17-year-olds, and not
until 2015 for 18-year-olds, and her concerns are about the provision
of full-time education for those people in the interim. Through
guidance laid out alongside the Bill, we intend to explain what is
expected to happen. The raising of the participation age is good
legislation, and we must ensure that what everyone regards as a good
way forward does not create a difficulty, albeit even in the short
term. We intend to address that through
guidance.</div><a name="1002033000671"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="1002033000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole seeks to amend clause
9(2)(a) so that local authorities would be under a duty to arrange
education for all children of participation age who, for reasons of
illness, exclusion or otherwise, may not for any period receive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>suitable education. I assure her that the amendment is not necessary. In
accordance with the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act
2009, local authorities will have a duty to ensure that enough suitable
education or training is available for all 16 to 19-year-olds in their
area. We intend those provisions to come into force on 1 April this
year. It is our intention that local authorities and education
providers will take steps to ensure that special arrangements are in
place to support a young person&#146;s continued participation in
learning. When  the powers for funding a commission transfer
to  local authorities in line with the ASCL Act, those local
authority functions will be further strengthened.</div>
<a name="1002033000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 168
would create a new duty for local authorities to arrange suitable
education for 16 to 19-year-olds who
are</div><a name="1002033000602"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;pursuing
such examination courses as may be specified in an order...who by
reason of illness, may not for any period receive suitable education
unless such arrangements are made for them.&#148;.</div>
<a name="1002033000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the hon. Lady
that in our view, this amendment is also unnecessary. The Education and
Skills Act 2008 created a new legal duty for local authorities which,
once in force, will require them to exercise their functions so as to
promote effective participation in education or training for all 16 to
18-year-olds, including those who suffer from illness. In addition,
local authorities will be required to exercise their new functions in
the ASCL Act, to secure the provision of education or training for 16
to 18-year-olds, with a view to enabling those persons to fulfil the
duty to participate. As I have said to the hon. Lady, alongside that we
intend to put into guidance the need for local authorities to provide
education or training opportunities for the young people covered by the
clause. The hon. Lady has highlighted a slight gap, which we intend to
fill through guidance, and with that assurance, I hope that she will
withdraw the amendment.</div>

local authority consider that, for reasons which relate to the physical
or mental health of the child, it would be impracticable or otherwise
inappropriate for full-time education to be provided for the
child.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
192 would mean that that requirement would apply only following an
independent assessment of the physical or mental health of the child.
It reflects concerns raised by the National Autistic Society, which
said in a briefing to members of the
Committee:</div><a name="1002033000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recognise that there may be some circumstances where it may be
inappropriate for a child to be in full-time education, but have
concerns about:</div>
<a name="1002033000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">Who would make
the assessment about what is appropriate for the child and;</div>
<a name="1002033000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">Whether the
clause would provide local authorities with a wide &#145;get out of
jail free&#146; card not to provide education for children for whom
they are unable to find appropriate education locally or whose needs
mean that provision would be very
expensive&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div><a name="1002033000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the wide lack of understanding of autism and the potential for a
conflict of interest, we believe that assessments on appropriateness
would have to be made independently by someone with experience and
expertise in the child&#146;s condition. Autism is a complex
condition and without a full understanding of how to communicate with
the child and what their needs may be, it is unlikely that a fair and
comprehensive assessment would be
made.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with that assessment, which goes
on:</div><a name="1002033000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
use of the word &#145;impracticable&#146; in the clause is of
particular concern here. We would like to know in what cases it would
be &#145;impracticable&#146; for a child to receive full-time
education, if this is not related to
cost.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful and would reassure the National Autistic Society if
the Minister could address that specific concern in his response. The
NAS also
states:</div><a name="1002033000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
assurance that there will be independent assessments to determine state
of the child's physical/mental
health&#148;</div><a name="1002033000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
be helpful, and that is what the amendment seeks to
do.</div><a name="1002033000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
191 reflects concerns raised by Barnardo&#146;s. In its briefing, it
said:</div><a name="1002033000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
Barnardo&#146;s accepts that it is pragmatic to allow exceptions, we

goes on to
explain:</div><a name="1002033000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
know from the experience of our services and the young people they work
with that some young people facing temporary barriers to

up drifting out of education
altogether.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
191 would insert a new subsection requiring that any decision about not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000728"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> This string of amendments focuses on the words
&#147;impracticable or otherwise inappropriate&#148;. As has
already been said, they have been viewed as a &#147;get out of jail
free&#148; card. There is concern about how that will be interpreted
at a local level. Amendment 167, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Yeovil  and me, suggests that there must be
consultation  with parents, carers and medical professionals.
Taken with amendment 192, which seeks a full independent
assessment, both amendments make a strong support package and both are
important.</div>
<a name="1002033000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
what the National Autistic Society
said. Another amendment that we
tabled&#151;amendment 187 &#151;was
suggested by the Special Educational Consortium. The
amendment would delete &#147;impracticable or otherwise
inappropriate&#148; and
insert</div><a name="1002033000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;detrimental
to the child&#146;s
well-being&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is suggested because there is a concern that the local authority is
given too much discretion. There need to be checks and balances on that
discretion, because we all know how very expensive an out-of-area
placement can be, and one has to be clear that the child&#146;s
interests have been put
first.</div><a name="1002033000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
find amendment 191 quite appealing. We have submitted amendment 158,
whereby</div><a name="1002033000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
local authority must...draw up plans...to allow the child to
return to full time education as soon as this is
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may pick up the teenage pregnancy point that we mentioned earlier. It
is a difficult area. Even though  we are talking about a
relatively severe condition&#151;a very special condition&#151;and
they will all individually be very different, we need the checks and
balances so that we put the child&#146;s interests first rather than
the monetary interests of the local authority. I know that they are a
big constraint for a small local authority. I hope that the Minister
will be able to give us some reassuring words on all these
amendments.</div><a name="1002033000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000729"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Approximately 70,000 children are affected by the
issue each year. Let me reiterate the point because, as I think we all
know from our constituencies, it is an important and emotive topic. The
clause will for the first time make full-time education available for
those who are in alternative provision who have not been excluded from
school. I think we all regret that that does not happen at the moment,
so the Bill will put that right. However, in putting it right, we do
not want to create unintended consequences. Having said that the
aspiration is for any young person who is not in school or who is in
alternative provision to have full-time education, it may be that in
certain circumstances&#151;for example, for medical reasons or the
best reasons&#151;it is simply not appropriate or suitable for that
to happen.</div>
<a name="1002033000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members would expect for a Minister of the Crown, I would not quite
call subsection (3AA) a get-out provision, but there could be a great
deal more clarity and certainty in the phrasing and in what we mean. As
I say, we do not want to have a clause that everyone supports if tucked
away in it is something that says we do not expect children to have
full-time education 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>if it is simply inappropriate for them. We do not want the measure to be
used by some as a way of avoiding their responsibilities under the
clause.</div><a name="1002033000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole to withdraw their amendments. I will take
some legal advice on the matter and come back on Report with a
Government amendment to try to deal with the points raised by them and,
indeed, many others. I hope that is helpful to
them.</div><a name="1002033000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000730"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): Referring back to a comment made
by the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton, will the Minister clarify how the clause will affect
pregnant teenagers? Clearly, being pregnant is neither an illness nor a
disability. Those girls are not being excluded either. Will he reassure
me on that matter&#151;in relation to this clause or elsewhere in the
legislation&#151;because where the young woman&#146;s desire is to
continue in the secondary school that she has been attending, it might
be problematic to provide suitable and appropriate
education.</div><a name="1002033000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000731"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a very good, concrete example of the sort
of person we mean. It might be someone with a medical condition or it
might be someone who for other reasons&#151;for example, a young girl
who is pregnant&#151;is in alternative provision. As the law stands,
unless such a young person is excluded from school, there is no legal
entitlement or necessity for the authority to provide full-time
education for them. I think we all consider it to be an anomaly that if
someone is ill or is not in school because of particular circumstances
and they are in alternative provision, they are not legally entitled to
full-time provision, whereas if someone is excluded from school, after
six days out of school, the local authority is legally obliged to
provide full-time education for
them.</div><a name="1002033000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
exactly the circumstances that my right hon. Friend referred to of a
young girl in such a situation&#151;I am sure we can all think of
other examples where somebody is not ill, but for certain reasons they
are unable to be in school and they are in alternative
provision&#151;if the clause is passed, the legal necessity will be
to ensure that full-time provision, where appropriate and necessary, is
provided. I want to frame the clause in such a way that although it
makes that a legal certainty for young people in that situation, it
allows flexibility where appropriate. We want to do so in a way that
does not allow anyone to evade their responsibilities. I hope that was
helpful to my hon. Friend. With those remarks, and our commitment that
we will table a Government amendment on Report to do what I think my
right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley and Opposition Members
want, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000672"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000732"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was impressed by the Minister&#146;s response.
He is right that the law is improved by clause 9 and that, in putting
right a law, he does not want to create the unintended consequences of
having to provide full-time education for children who clearly, for a
variety of reasons, cannot cope with it. I now understand that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>is also cognisant that, in trying to tackle any potential unintended
consequence, he does not want to create more of such consequences. As
such, he has agreed to take away clause 9(3), which will insert
proposed new section 19(3A) into the Education Act 1996, and I am
grateful to him for doing so. I do not claim that my amendment is
perfectly drafted, and I understand why he wants to take further
advice. If he wishes to consult, Opposition Members will be happy to
participate in that and make the legislation exactly right. I know that
people outside the House, particularly the National Autistic Society
and Barnardo&#146;s, will be pleased with the Minister&#146;s
response. With those few words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000735"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Clause 10 introduces the new primary curriculum as
recommended by the Rose review. It will replace section 84 of the
Education Act 2002 with proposed new section 83A. The new section will
replace the requirement to study mathematics, which was set out in
section 84(2)(a), with &#147;mathematical understanding&#148;. The
clause will also replace &#147;English&#148;
with</div><a name="1002033000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;understanding
English, communication and
languages&#148;</div><a name="1002033000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
&#147;science&#148; with &#147;scientific and technological
understanding&#148;. It will take out &#147;history&#148; and
&#147;geography&#148;, which are separately itemised in the 2002
Act, and replace them with &#147;historical, geographical and social
understanding&#148;. It replaces separately itemised &#147;art and
design&#148; and &#147;music&#148; with &#147;understanding the
arts&#148;, and &#147;physical education&#148;
with</div><a name="1002033000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;understanding

than the last one, which looks like replacing running and jumping in
the gym or playing field with sitting at a desk studying human anatomy,
the others appear to be the same as before, but with the word
&#147;understanding&#148; plopped in front. If that is all it is,
why worry? However, if that is all it is, why bother changing the

<a name="1002033000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I asked

Q1.]</div><a name="1002033000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does
mean something different, or why else go to all the bother? Jim
Rose&#146;s interim report was greeted with howls of derision and
criticism, because it revealed too openly the aim of moving from
discrete subjects to the cross-curricular teaching methods of the
1960s. That was odd because Jim Rose is one of the so-called three wise
men who, in 1992, conducted a government inquiry into low reading
standards. Their report explicitly criticised progressive teaching
methods:</div><a name="1002033000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Over
the last few decades the progress of primary pupils has been hampered
by the influence of highly questionable dogmas which have led to
excessively complex classroom practices and devalued the place of
subjects in the
curriculum&#148;&#151;</div><a name="1002033000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jim
Rose, Chris Woodhead and Professor Alexander said in 1992 that the
place of subjects in the curriculum had been
devalued.</div><a name="1002033000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, the clause takes primary education towards an
outcome-based education system&#151;known as OBE for short, in the
jargon. The OBE approach has been defined by many educationists, pro
and anti, but it is best summed up in Kevin Donnelly&#146;s
book&#151;which cites the South Australian framework, which adopted
OBE&#151;as</div><a name="1002033000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;understandings,
dispositions and capabilities which are developed through the Learning
Areas and form an integral part of children&#146;s and
students&#146; learning from birth to Year 12 and beyond... These
understandings, capabilities and dispositions are personal and
intellectual qualities, not bodies of
knowledge&#148;&#151;</div><a name="1002033000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is the issue at
stake.</div><a name="1002033000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
approach to education originates in the 1920s at Teachers college,
Columbia, New York. Wherever and whenever it is tried, it fails. It
particularly fails those children who have no access to education
elsewhere, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>other than school&#151;they have no access at home or through a
personal tutor. Kevin Donnelly says in his book, &#147;Dumbing
Down&#148;:</div><a name="1002033000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Australia&#146;s
adoption of OBE is the reason why our education system is consistently
at the centre of controversy. Since the development of the Keating
Government&#146;s national statements and profiles in the early to
mid-1990s, all states and territories have adopted OBE to various
degrees. Internationally, only a handful of countries have attempted to
implement OBE and those educational systems that outperform Australia
in the TIMMS tests ignore OBE in favour of a more academic and
teacher-friendly
syllabus.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of maths, the debate is best summarised by the US
mathematician David Ross, quoted in Kevin Donnelly&#146;s
book:</div><a name="1002033000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reformers think that students should struggle with mathematical
problems on their own and that, from these struggles, methods of
solving the problems will emerge. Having devised these methods
themselves, students will understand the abstract conceptual structure
of the methods. Their opponents think that unless students are taught
the traditional algorithms, they will not be able to do
math.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Donnelly
goes on to quote from Rhonda Farkota who argues that successfully
mastering higher-order skills first requires being taught the basics in
a structured, systematic
way:</div><a name="1002033000621"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is generally accepted that a student-directed approach is more suitable
when it comes to the employment and cultivation of higher order skills
where reasoning and reflection are required. However, for the
acquisition of basic mathematical skills, the research clearly shows
that teacher-directed learning is better suited. Needless to say, these
basic skills must be firmly in place before students can approach
problem-solving questions with any degree of
competence.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, that is the debate to have plagued education in this country
for 50 years. It is all about what has been termed the constructivist
approach, which is defined as</div>
<a name="1002033000622"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a theory of
learning that builds on the work of Piaget, Bruner and Vygotsky...
Adoption of a constructivist approach in the classroom involves a shift
from predominantly teacher-directed methods to student-centred, active
discovery learning and immersion approaches via cooperative group work,
discussion focused on investigations and problem
solving.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Kevin Donnelly states that when applied to maths, it means that
memorising times tables, mental arithmetic, learning by rote and
mastering basic algorithms, such as long division, give way to using
calculators, co-operative hands-on learning and relating maths to real
world
applications.</div><a name="1002033000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remember meeting a primary school teacher who said, &#147;You
don&#146;t teach children to multiply by 10 by adding a zero, or to
multiply by 100 by adding two zeros. That is just mechanical and
doesn&#146;t teach them an understanding of maths.&#148; That view
is widely held, and probably explains an incident that happened to
me a few years ago when I spoke to a year 6 group in a primary
school in my constituency about the campaign to ensure that every child
in sub-Saharan Africa had a teacher. I asked them how much we could
raise if we asked every taxpayer, of which there are about
30 million, to pay 10p. Almost immediately, a teacher burst
in and said, &#147;They can&#146;t answer that question.&#148;
They were the brightest year 6 children in the school, who were
co-ordinating the campaign. Members will probably remember receiving
letters in which we were invited to go to the school and receive a
model of a teacher that they wanted to have in every sub-Saharan
country.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div><a name="1002033000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is the
teacher told me that those children could not do that kind of
calculation; they had not been taught how to multiply large numbers.
The obsession with not teaching algorithms means that children cannot
do problem solving, because they do not have the tools to do it. Jim
Rose let it slip that the constructivist approach is behind the reforms
recommended in his report. He
said:</div><a name="1002033000623"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the recent past, Ofsted commented on maths and said that children are
taught sums, but often do not know what sums to do or how to apply that
knowledge when it comes to a practical situation. Given that sort of
evidence, which has come forward fairly consistently, I think that the
way in which we are suggesting things should be structured is very
sensible.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Children,

Q1.]</div><a name="1002033000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
10 covers the new primary curriculum. The  76 prescriptive
objectives in the maths programme of learning and the 84 prescriptive
objectives in the English programme of learning are clearly crafted in
a way that takes the curriculum in a constructivist direction and an
outcomes-based approach. If I am wrong, as Jim Rose says, there is
nothing different from what we have now. In either case, we should not
be amending the national curriculum as set out in clause 10.</div>
<a name="1002033000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to come
to the English curriculum when we debate the next set of amendments and
the programmes of study. Amendments 54, 52 and 53 would replace the
phrase &#147;areas of learning&#148; with &#147;subjects&#148;,
which is the term used in the Education Act
2002.</div>
<a name="1002033000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000736"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I seek some clarification. Given that hon.
Gentleman thinks that head teachers should have more freedom in
implementing the curriculum&#151;that is certainly my party&#146;s
view&#151;should there not be the opportunity for one school to
choose a cross-curriculum route and another to choose a subject-based
route, because that would give parents a choice, and I believe in that
sort of
choice.</div><a name="1002033000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000737"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady: a very prescriptive
curriculum that insists on a certain philosophy of education is
proposed, and we should be giving the discretion to head teachers to
use the philosophy that they think will deliver the highest standards.
As a quid pro quo, parents should be able to choose the school that
they think will be best for their own children. In my judgment, schools
should have to publish on their website the educational philosophy, the
approach and the curriculum in their schools, so that parents can make
an informed choice. What we have at the moment is wrong. It is a
centralised approach, the levers of which have been used to promulgate
a particular ideology of
education&#151;</div><a name="1002033000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000738"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is not
yours.</div><a name="1002033000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000739"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, it is not the one in which I believe. I shall
finish my point, and the Minister can jump
in.</div><a name="1002033000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a system has failed whenever and wherever it has been tried. It is not
new. It has been tried many times in this country, and whenever it is
tried, it results in a poorer outcome of education for children. Let us
consider, for example, the phase when children did not know their
multiplication tables. Such periods do enormous damage to young
people&#146;s confidence in learning maths and taking it to a further
stage. Even though it is now in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>the national curriculum that children should learn their tables to 10
times 10 by the time that they are nine-years-old, that still does not
happen in many schools. I agree with the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole. She is absolutely right. It should be a matter for the
professionalism of teachers, but that is not the system that we have at
the moment, and what we have is moving in the wrong
direction.</div><a name="1002033000673"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="1002033000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000740"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I apologise for jumping in. The hon. Gentleman
accuses us of pursuing an ideology, but what is he
pursuing?</div><a name="1002033000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000741"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am happy to have a debate about approaches to
education. For too long, such issues have been debated among
educationists behind closed doors. Those who are affected by it are
excluded from the debate. I feel strongly as a Member of Parliament and
as a shadow Education Minister that we should be debating such matters
in public and I take every opportunity to do so. I believe strongly in
phonics and learning multiplication tables by rote, so that the child
has an automaticity and is not busy floundering, working out seven
times six in a long division
sum.</div><a name="1002033000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000742"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> What is the
answer?</div><a name="1002033000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000743"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Forty-two, incidentally. That system is the best
approach to teaching maths and to teaching children to read. Children
should be taught general knowledge, history and the geography of this
country and of the world. However, as I said to the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole, such matters should ultimately be for
schools, but that does not mean to say that Members of Parliament and
shadow Ministers should not take part in such debates and let the
public contribute to
them.</div><a name="1002033000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
organisation that takes part in the debate is the Campaign for Real
Education. It has commented on the clause. It said:</div>
<a name="1002033000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sir
Jim Rose recommended that primary schools should do away with the
subject-based curriculum and subsume the subjects into 5 &#145;areas
of learning.&#146;&#148;</div>
<a name="1002033000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went on to
say:</div>
<a name="1002033000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
goes completely against the advice of good teachers who emphasise that
the subjects provide structure for essential knowledge and
content.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
documentation and Jim Rose&#146;s report are defensive about the
accusation of subsuming subjects, and the final report goes to great
lengths to deny that, particularly following the outcry that greeted
the interim report. However, the wording of the six areas did not
change between the interim report and the final report, and it is that
wording that will last if we implement clause 10 when Jim Rose is long
forgotten.</div><a name="1002033000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording of the clause changes &#147;subject&#148; to &#147;areas
of learning&#148;, but we believe that subjects matter. The
constructivist approach is that learning how to learn is more important
than subject content. It asserts that generic learning skills can be
taught and then applied to subjects later&#151;I am not sure when,
but later. But the only genuine cross-curricular skill is literacy. How
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>read and write can be improved as we write a history essay or write up a
geography field trip or a chemistry experiment, but learning French is
different from  learning maths or physics. The mind is
developed by learning and understanding more and more concepts, by
remembering more and more pieces of information and by developing
knowledge, not by being told how and what to
think.</div><a name="1002033000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Kevin Donnelly writes,</div>
<a name="1002033000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
essential aspect of what it means to be educated is to be taught
traditional subjects like mathematics, history, science, literature and
music. Such subjects have evolved over hundreds of years and each is
unique in the way it defines how we experience and understand the world
and our place in
it.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
influential book is &#147;The Schools We Need: And Why We
Don&#146;t Have Them&#148; by E. D. Hirsch. He is critical of the
objectives approach to the curriculum. He said that, in that
approach,</div>
<a name="1002033000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
first defines a few highly general &#145;objectives,&#146; and one
then carries them through several
grades&#148;&#151;</div><a name="1002033000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
is an American academic; he is referring to years. As his objectives
are quite general, they are then repeated each year&#151;the theory
being that they are taught in increasing depth. Hirsch argues that that
leads to repetition and boredom as children learn the same issue over
and over again in increasing depth. It also leads to gaps  in
children&#146;s knowledge as the broad objectives result in some
subject content being taught over and over again while correspondingly,
other important areas are missed out altogether.</div>
<a name="1002033000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 238
would undo clause 10 and return to what is in the 2002 Act, with the
exception that languages would be put in as a core subject for key
stage 2, together with English, maths and science. It emphasises that
music should be a separate foundation subject, rather than being
subsumed into &#147;understanding the arts&#148;. Finally,
amendment 50 would take out the Henry VIII clause that gives
the Secretary of State the power under secondary legislation to
amendment the curriculum which has, until now, been amended only by
primary legislation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000744"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I find this debate slightly odd in that I appear
to agree with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton,
although I obviously come to this from a totally different perspective.
I will speak  to the whole clause, but I will not repeat myself
later, Mr. Betts.</div>
<a name="1002033000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that we should restrict ourselves to cross-curricular work for every
school, although I appreciate that some excellent work is going on in
our schools, where inspired head teachers have managed to work around
the straitjacket of the national curriculum and introduce innovative
teaching programmes and methods that suit their children. Personally, I
would probably choose a school with something similar to the Rose
curriculum, but I cannot accept that we start imposing that on
everybody. I am content to let hon. Members have a choice of schools
that are subject-based. I come at this from a different perspective,
but we agree on the point that the head teacher and the school should
have more freedom. However, we risk taking away one
straitjacket and starting to put on another, and that is what I object
to.</div>
<a name="1002033000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
our position is clear. In amendment 182 we have tried to convey the
point that the governing body and head teacher should have
responsibility. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>amendment 183, we want to stop a situation where the Secretary of State
can start fine-tuning the curriculum from the centre on an almost
annual basis. We have suggested that that should happen not more than
once each Parliament, so that we can review its
effectiveness.</div>
<a name="1002033000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming from a
totally different perspective, I have some difficulty in supporting the
amendment, but I am reassured that we in Opposition think that there
should be a choice for parents and a minimum curriculum entitlement
that can be interpreted in different ways by different head teachers in
different communities. It is important to have something that is right
for children, and I am not supporting the full Rose review for those
reasons.</div>
<a name="1002033000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it is
important to look again at what the Children, Schools and Families
Committee said about the national curriculum&#151;this point is
picked up in the next group of amendments, so I will not repeat it. The
report stated:</div>
<a name="1002033000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
take the view that the main purpose of a national curriculum is to set
out clearly and simply a minimum entitlement for every
child.&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is important. It goes
on:</div><a name="1002033000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are not convinced by the proposed Programmes of Study for the primary
curriculum put forward in the interim report of the Rose Review, which
seem unnecessarily
complex.&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with both those statements.</div>
<a name="1002033000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000745"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Ken Purchase</b> (Wolverhampton, North-East) (Lab/Co-op): I do
not favour a dogmatic approach to teaching, nor do I believe that many
different schools offering many different platforms of learning is an
appropriate way for urban areas in our cities to take advantage of the
choice that is being suggested. I favour a more eclectic approach to
teaching.</div><a name="1002033000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
listened with interest when the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton mentioned Piaget&#151;an interesting name to bring up.
He may correct me, but I recall that the essence of Piaget&#146;s
view is that children develop to think in the abstract at different
ages. It is different for boys and girls. From the ages of five to 15,
children develop an ability to think in an abstract way. Given that
teachers work with children who develop rapidly and those who develop
slowly, those who take a great leap and those who do not get off the
diving board, an eclectic approach to teaching seems to be necessary.
That approach would give children, particularly in tightly knit urban
boroughs such as mine, the opportunity to go to a school and get an
appropriate teaching method so that they can reach their
potential.</div><a name="1002033000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge both Opposition parties to recognise the relatively dogmatic view
in the way in which we teach subjects, rather than areas of learning. I
appreciate that it is not a totally dogmatic view. The hon. Gentleman
made an excellent case for his point of view. However, I think
eclecticism should rule the day in the teaching platform so that our
children get the maximum possible choice in the school that they attend
to enhance their
abilities.</div><a name="1002033000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000746"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Betts. I referred back to the evidence that Sir Jim Rose
gave before the Committee and was struck by his comments about how the
primary curriculum can take what is learned at the foundation stage for
early years into the structured secondary stage. As we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>all know, there is a play-based approach for the foundation years, which
teaches communication, language and literacy; personal, social and
emotional development; physical development; knowledge and
understanding of the world; creative development; and problem solving,
reasoning and numeracy. How the transition into primary is made is
important. Children make the transition out of foundation and at the
end of year 6, they make the transition into years 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11,
which are obviously more
subject-based.</div><a name="1002033000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are all concerned about education and how it is delivered. For me, good
teaching is the key component, whatever the system. In most primary
schools, the most important person is the generalist teacher and there
might be a classroom assistant and specialists who can be called on in
certain
areas.</div><a name="1002033000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Jim&#146;s review of primary education reassured me about the
emphasis on numeracy and literacy. I also felt encouraged that primary
schools give some of the best examples of where subjects are studied in
cross-curricular experiences, which can better engage children and help
them to understand just how arithmetic, for example, might apply in
other settings&#151;that is not always the
case.</div><a name="1002033000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to think about this age group and the transitions they make from
foundation into primary and onwards into secondary. We must bear that
in mind when we try to impose on them a certain approach, such as the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton with his more secondary
view of
education.</div><a name="1002033000596"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><a name="1002033000747"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): I agree with
the right hon. Lady&#146;s point about good teachers providing good
quality education for all our children. Does she think that the
programmes of study we have heard about, with their 84 objectives for
teachers to fulfil, will help to provide good teaching, or are they too
prescriptive?</div><a name="1002033000674"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="1002033000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000748"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> My understanding, from the evidence witnesses gave
the Committee a few weeks ago, is that while there might always be room
for manoeuvre to see whether the 84 objectives should be reduced, the
number has actually been reduced since previous Governments were in
power, when the system was far more prescriptive. That was the evidence
we were given. I would not say no if asked whether some of the
indicators and prescriptive ideas could be reduced further, but I think
that they are going in the right direction. One of the opportunities of
looking at a cross-curricular theme is that it might allow a classroom
teacher&#151;we are usually talking about one classroom teacher and
perhaps 30 children&#151;to think about how those areas can be
blended together.</div>
<a name="1002033000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The example we
were given in evidence was that of Charles Darwin. Many schools
approach their targets or indicators by combining the science element
of Darwin&#146;s work with the historical context in which he lived,
creative writing and art. As I understand it, we are going in the right
direction on indicators, which is down, and that is
welcome.</div>
<a name="1002033000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000749"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Some interesting comments have been made. It was
interesting that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
accused us of having 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>an ideological obsession with one form of teaching and then went on to
present his own ideology regarding what should constitute a primary
curriculum. I totally accept that there is a clash of views about that,
and I do not use the word &#147;ideology&#148; against him in a
disparaging sense, because we are just talking about different views on
how things should be done, but let us take the debate beyond that. It
seems to me that if people accuse each other of ideological fanaticism
with regard to how the primary curriculum should be organised or
taught, it leads to a sterile debate. I would not accuse him of that,
except perhaps a bit with regard to phonics, but not on anything else.
I take your point, Mr. Betts, about going a little broader
than the specific amendments because we will not have a clause stand
part debate.</div>
<a name="1002033000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our approach
is the result of an extensive review by Sir Jim Rose, who impressed me,
frankly, during our evidence session. I have been impressed by him
before, and although not everyone would agree with his evidence, I
thought that it was clear and that he made a good philosophical, as
well as practical, case for what he was suggesting. We are, of course,
not alone: since 2005, eight countries have reorganised their primary
curriculum around areas of learning rather than around subjects,
including France, Spain, Germany and New Zealand, so it is not as
though we were pursuing a rip-roaring Government initiative on which we
were alone in the
globe.</div><a name="1002033000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the level of support, Mick Brookes, the general secretary of
the National Association of Head Teachers, has
said:</div><a name="1002033000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
makes me want to go back to teaching&#148;.</div>
<a name="1002033000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Independent Schools
Council has said:</div>
<a name="1002033000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Overall
the recommendations reflect current thinking and practice in our
schools. In general terms, much of what is proposed is already
happening in the sector.&#148;</div>
<a name="1002033000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not upset my hon.
Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, by quoting from the
General Teaching Council for England. The Historical Association has
stated that it</div>
<a name="1002033000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has always
maintained that the national curriculum as it stands is
over-prescribed, and this is detrimental to teaching and learning. We
fully support a modified framework that supports the development of a
less prescriptive and more flexible National
Curriculum.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley is right that the number of
objectives in the national curriculum used to be around 280. It sounds
like a good debating point, but we are proposing a reduction from 280
to 84, so there is a reduction in the number of objectives.</div>
<a name="1002033000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We talked a
lot about maths. Sir Peter Williams, who carried out the independent
review of maths in primary schools in 2008, has said that Jim
Rose&#146;s recommendations will give teachers more freedom and
flexibility. That is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, North-East, made about the need for flexibility. It was
the point that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole made,
too. Jim Rose&#146;s recommendations will give teachers more freedom
and flexibility to use maths in exciting and creative ways in the
classroom. That is the important bit, because that  is where
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton thinks that it is a
question of either/or&#151;we either have subjects where everyone
learns how to count, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>or areas of learning where no one does anything except play around with
dice, while rolling around in the sand; that is his caricature.
However, Sir Peter Williams
said:</div><a name="1002033000633"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Jim
Rose&#146;s recommendations will give teachers more freedom and
flexibility to use maths in exciting and creative ways in the
classroom, as well as focusing on the basics of times tables, mental
maths and
fractions.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is not a choice between teaching young people to count and them
enjoying themselves and having fun. Of course it is important that the
basics, as everyone calls them&#151;reading, writing and
counting&#151;are done in primary school. However, we think that
reorganising them in the way that we propose will allow less
prescription and more flexibility for the teacher to teach in a way
that they feel is appropriate to the learning of the young people in
the classroom, which is the point made by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Don Valley and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
North-East.</div><a name="1002033000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a caricature to say that our primary schools do not teach young
people to count, read or write. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton said that there are people who do not learn their times
tables, but there is a subject-based curriculum in place now. As my
right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley said, it is a question of
good teaching, the appropriateness of the curriculum and ensuring that
the basics are there. However, there are other things about maths, as
Jim Rose pointed out; that is why he talked of mathematical
understanding, as well as of maths. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton said that literacy was the only thing that he could
think of that was appropriate in many other areas, but I would have
thought that numeracy was another skill much used across the
curriculum.</div><a name="1002033000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000750"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister cited third parties that supported his
policy. However, when he quoted them, we saw that what they supported
was the increased flexibility and reduced prescription. Although the
clause may reduce the number of objectives, there are still 84 of
them&#151;the system is still prescriptive&#151;and no one seems to
be supporting that aspect. Other than increased flexibility, what is it
about the outcomes-based, &#147;areas of learning&#148; approach,
which France, Germany and New Zealand have adopted, that is an
improvement on the current system?</div>
<a name="1002033000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000751"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is like the hon. Gentleman answering his own
question. I cannot answer, &#147;Flexibility&#148; or &#147;The
fact that it is not over-prescriptive,&#148; but if I do not say
that, what is the answer going to be?</div>
<a name="1002033000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is
that it depends. The approach that we propose will allow people to
develop their professionalism and feel that they can teach in a way
that is appropriate to the needs of their particular class, rather than
feel&#151;as some do&#151;that they are in a straitjacket. It will
also allow teachers to teach in the classroom in a way that establishes
links across a range of topics, rather than just teaching subjects in
compartments. Many teachers, professionals and parents feel that that
is a better approach.</div>
<a name="1002033000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will have read about
the areas of learning. It is important to put on the record, in case we
are accused of not believing that focused subject content is important,
that the documents on each area refer to the need for focused subject
teaching. Indeed, in the document on mathematical understanding, the
first sentence states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div><a name="1002033000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Learning
in this area should include an appropriate balance of focused subject
teaching and well-planned opportunities to use, apply and develop
knowledge and skills across the whole
curriculum.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not saying that because we are talking about areas of learning,
subject content is not important. However, that is the caricature that
the hon. Gentleman seeks to portray.</div>
<a name="1002033000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to say, as an opening, before I deal with the specific amendments, that
the clause has been welcomed by the profession and many professionals.
The Rose review is good, and it will mean the return of flexibility to
our primary schools, which is what classroom teachers in schools and
communities up and down our country have been asking
for.</div>
<a name="1002033000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000752"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister almost implies that he agrees that
subjects should be taught, in which case why not leave the legislation
as it is in the Education Act 2002&#151;an Act piloted by his
Government? Why not leave that provision and scrap all the prescriptive
lesson plans and programmes of study? We object to those programmes
because they promulgate a particular ideology of education. If the
Minister went back to the wording of the 2002 Act and scrapped the
programmes of study, we would have
agreement.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000753"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> On the programmes of study, people will want to
know what it is we are requiring people to learn under each of the
headings. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that we should
simply say, &#147;Do maths, English, history and geography&#148;?
The areas of learning for the first and second key stages are laid out
in the Bill, which
mentions:</div><a name="1002033000635"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;understanding
English, communication and languages...scientific and
technological
understanding&#148;</div><a name="1002033000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so on. Is he suggesting we should not have a programme of study? That
we should not specify what people should learn? I know what the hon.
Gentleman will say to me&#151;that I have not got a clue what pupils
will be doing under any of the programmes, and his amendments will say,
&#147;We need a bit of meat on the bone. We need a bit of detail on
the proposals.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000754"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way to
enable a proper, responsive debate. However, I am suggesting, as I said
in my opening remarks, that the programmes of study say the same thing
year after
year:</div><a name="1002033000636"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
recognise how authors of moving-image and multimodal texts use
different combinations of words, images and sounds to create effects
and make
meaning&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later
in the primary curriculum, the programme
is:</div><a name="1002033000637"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
evaluate structural and organisational features, including the use of
different presentational devices, layouts and combinations of formats,
and their
effects&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is the same thing year after year, as the programme becomes more
sophisticated. That is the problem. I would not want to take away all
content from the curriculum, but let us set out in simple terms the
knowledge and skills that children should have by a certain year group
in school, and not have these amorphous, over-complicated phrases that
can mean all kinds of things to different people and will lead to a) a
certain type of education and b) potential huge gaps in
children&#146;s knowledge and skills.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div><a name="1002033000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000755"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I just do not accept that. I know the hon.
Gentleman will have read the document. I go back to the point about
good teaching made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley.
The document lays out the essential knowledge and what the skills
should be. It lays out the breadth of learning. Every professional to
whom we talk recommends organising teaching around areas of learning,
which show how the themes, topics and skills link together in a
cross-curricular way. That frees up the curriculum and allows teachers
to teach in an appropriate way without taking away the importance of
knowing facts, of knowledge and of the basic skills that the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton believes
in.</div>
<a name="1002033000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000756"></a>Mr.
Gibb</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="1002033000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000757"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will take one more intervention before we move
on, or you may feel that we are straying too far, Mr.
Betts.</div>
<a name="1002033000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000758"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister is talking about pedagogy. Issues about
cross-curriculum teaching are for the teacher to decide; they should
not come out of a Government report, Government legislation and
Government programmes of study. These are pedagogical matters for
teachers. Policy makers and Government should ensure that all children
have a minimum level of knowledge and skills. That is what we policy
makers should be doing, not telling teachers whether to use
cross-curricular or group teaching, or &#147;circle time&#148;. All
those are matters for teachers, and we should keep out of that
area.</div>
<a name="1002033000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000759"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is an amazing comment. The hon. Gentleman was
continually telling people that they should be teaching phonics.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The national curriculum and areas
of learning laid out in the Rose review promise an exciting time for
schools, and have been broadly
welcomed.</div><a name="1002033000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me deal quickly with the specific amendments. Amendment 50 would remove
a power relating to the key stage 1 and key stage 2 curriculum. That
power, which is in the Education Act 2002, relates to the primary
curriculum. Before the proposed curriculum areas could be amended by
order, the Secretary of State would be required to refer any proposal
to the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency, so that it
could undertake statutory consultation with head teachers, governing
bodies, organisations representing school interests and other
appropriate bodies. The Secretary of State would then have to consult
on the draft order before laying it before the House. Without that
power, any future changes to the areas of learning, no matter how
small, would require primary legislation. To change one word in the
title of even one area of learning would require primary
legislation.</div>
<a name="1002033000675"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="1002033000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
checks and balances for when the curriculum is amended by order are
more than sufficient, even though they are not in the Bill.
Furthermore, the amendment would introduce the anomaly that the
existing power to amend the curriculum by order would continue in
relation to key stages 3 and 4, but not key stages 1 and 2.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div><a name="1002033000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 52
and 54&#151;taken with amendment 238 &#151;fail to deal
with the feeling of overload among primary teachers trying to teach
high levels of literacy and numeracy and the 10 subjects of the
national curriculum. The rigid retention of subject fails to address
the need for smoother transition from the early years foundation stage
to key stage 1, which was a good point made by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Don Valley. The six areas of learning in the Bill build on
the early-years foundation stage and will help to prevent the sudden
change that can happen at the age of five, with the move from
play-based provision of early years areas of learning and development
to 10 separate subjects of the primary
curriculum.</div><a name="1002033000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed areas of learning continue to incorporate traditional
subjects, which is at the heart of the debate between the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and myself, such as English, maths,
science, history and geography, particularly during the middle and
later stages of primary. However, they also provide greater
opportunities&#151;this is the key difference&#151;to strengthen
and deepen subject knowledge through well-planned cross-curricular
studies, where children can use and apply subject knowledge across the
curriculum. The six areas of learning included in the Bill have been
subject to extensive consultation and development, and together they
constitute a broad and balanced curriculum and have had strong support
during consultation.</div>
<a name="1002033000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some 71 per
cent. of respondents to QCDA&#146;s consultation agreed that areas of
learning helped children to make useful links between related subjects.
In a National Foundation for Educational Research survey of teachers,
72 per cent. of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that areas of
learning would improve manageability for classroom teachers. On
amendment 182, it will, of course, be the responsibility of head
teachers to develop the curriculum for the areas of learning to meet
the needs of their children, which gives some of the flexibility that
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole wanted. That has always
been the responsibility of the governing body and the head teacher of
every maintained school, and it will remain so. That process includes
ensuring access to the curriculum for children who may be learning
English as an additional language, children with special educational
needs and children with disabilities.</div>
<a name="1002033000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
primary curriculum is not only a better match to the early years
foundation stage and what already occurs in many primary schools; it is
also less prescriptive and more flexible and allows schools to tailor
the curriculum to meet the needs of all pupils in their care. Some 70
per cent. of respondents to the consultation agreed that the curriculum
will give the schools the flexibility to adapt the curriculum to meet
the needs of all pupils, and 69 per cent. agreed that it is less
prescriptive than the existing
one.</div><a name="1002033000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 183, we believe that reviews should be carried out only when
it is absolutely necessary. As recommended by Sir Jim Rose, it is our
intention to have regular and planned curriculum reviews over time. The
recent review of the primary curriculum, to which the clause relates,
was the first review for a decade following only two other reviews of
the primary curriculum since the national curriculum was introduced
more than 20 years ago. The new secondary curriculum introduced in 2008
contained the first significant changes since 2000. We believe that
schools and pupils should have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>periods of curriculum stability, but, nevertheless, the curriculum
should be dynamic and involved, so it can meet the changing needs of
our children in a rapidly changing
world.</div><a name="1002033000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is very important. I know that I have strayed wider than the
amendments, but a useful and interesting debate has resulted from doing
so. All the evidence from the consultation indicates that the
profession agrees with the direction in which the clause is taking us.
It will be seen as a significant and substantial change. In the light
of that, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. I do not
often say that, but if he presses his amendments to a vote, it is
important that we vote against in this
case.</div><a name="1002033000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000760"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It has been an important debate, highlighting the
philosophical issues that bedevil education. Ideology has bedevilled
education in this country and in the United States since the 1920s,
coming to Britain in the 1950s in particular. For 50 years or more we
have had an ideological debate about education, the consequence of
which has been damage to our state education system. Talking to
educationists in other parts of Europe&#151;not those, incidentally,
cited by the Minister in adopting such an approach to primary
education&#151;they find it extraordinary how the British state
education system has gone down that
route.</div><a name="1002033000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
many decades children were not taught to read using the
tried-and-tested method of phonics, common throughout the world,
whereby children are taught the alphabetic code and how to blend
letters together and to decode words. Extraordinarily, I was not taught
using that method&#151;people of my generation and younger were
not&#151;but by the &#147;look and say&#148; or whole language
method, in which children are meant to absorb words by being exposed to
them, with words being repeated over and over again. Bright children
could pick up learning to read in that way, but less able children
could not, which is why in 1996&#151;I realise that was towards the
end of the last Conservative Administration&#151;a National Audit
Office report showed that 23 per cent. of adults in this country had
literacy rates that prevented them from being able to read the dosage
on an aspirin bottle. That is the consequence of 50 years of a
constructivist education ideology, which I believe has been hugely
damaging to our education
system.</div><a name="1002033000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000761"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and am
aware that perhaps I should not distract, but I want to make a point
about the difference. I hear a rigidity in his tone and would like a
reassurance that in putting forward the case for synthetic phonics, he
appreciates the exceptions, deaf children being a big one, and others
with some form of hearing impairment. It is important that where
children do not respond to synthetic phonics, other methods are used as
well. I appreciate that for a large number of children phonics is a
good scheme, but there are exceptions. Also, children who learn by look
and say in their pre-school years should certainly not be held up by
phonics if they are already reading fluently when they go to
school.</div><a name="1002033000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000762"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> On the latter point, if children are reading, of
course they should never be held back, but pushed ahead and encouraged
to read ever more sophisticated books and texts. I absolutely agree. I
do not agree with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>the approach that prevailed in the 1970s, when parents could be
criticised by teachers for allowing their children to race ahead and
learn to read. That approach was absolutely wrong. Every child should
be stretched to the best of their ability. The hon. Lady is also right
about a small percentage of children having particular neurological
conditions who have a problem with any method in learning to read, and
phonics is not the panacea for such
children.</div><a name="1002033000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the point that I am making is a wider one about the constructivist
approach, which also applies in maths&#151;we have a severe problem
with maths in this country. That same figure of 23 per cent. in
literacy also applies in maths&#151;according to the survey done by
the NAO in 1996, 23 per cent. of adults could not add two figures
together to come to the right
number.</div><a name="1002033000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000763"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> In many respects, I have a lot of sympathy with the
concerns, which I think are sincere, being put forward by the hon.
Gentleman. My view, which may be a perception, is that while there is a
long way to go, actually the debate between phonics and real books has
moved on in some respects. Certainly in the schools that I go to in my
constituency, and having brought up three children myself in the past
20 years, what I have seen is much more of a mixture of phonics and
books. We had the basics, but we are not trying to displace the
enjoyment that can go along with it&#151;reading stories and so forth
is part of that. That is what is happening in most schools I know. If
it is not being delivered properly, there might be a problem with the
teachers in the schools not doing what they need to do, and the head
teachers not delivering what they need to deliver. I do know whether
the problem is because of the curriculum or because the teaching is not
as good as it should be, and I have no truck with
that.</div><a name="1002033000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
consider that the debate has moved on. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely
right about maths. The Ofsted report showed that, while people were
being taught to add up, in some cases when it came to a real life
situation and applying that learning, it was not happening. We must
have a mixture of skills and knowledge, and apply it to scenarios
outside the classroom. We have been moving towards that, and such an
area of learning will allow us to develop towards it even
more.</div><a name="1002033000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000764"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was not terribly impressed by the particular
Ofsted report that I cited. It did not properly reflect the real
problem of teaching maths in our schools. I shall pick up on the hon.
Lady&#146;s point first. Children enjoy reading when they can do it.
They are not taught the basic skill of how to translate the jumble of
things on a page into a word and still struggle with it, yet they are
taught to memorise passages and pretend to read it back to teachers.
Seven-year-olds have read to me a text from
&#147;Winnie-the-Pooh&#148;, but the word &#147;Pooh&#148; was
not on the page; it was just &#147;Winnie&#148;. Where did they get
that word from? Clearly, they had memorised it. That is the problem
with the &#147;look and say&#148; approach. Some children just
memorise and do not learn the skill of decoding, so when they come
across a new word they struggle with it.</div>
<a name="1002033000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Phonics can be
enjoyable. When children learn to do it and enjoy it, they can go
straight into reading books. The key thing about the reading books is
that they must not go beyond the phonic knowledge of the child. If the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>child had only learnt the basic consonants and the simple vowels, such
as those in &#147;The cat sat on the mat&#148;, fine, but if the
rhyme went on and said, &#147;The cat sat on the mat and saw an
elephant&#148;, and the children were encouraged to guess the word
&#147;elephant&#148; because they had not learnt the
&#147;ph&#148; sound, all the education psychologists at
universities say that that would damage the children&#146;s ability
to learn to read. They must acquire the skill to decode. When people
play the piano, they learn that the middle C looks different on the
stave than it does on the piano. Until children are told such things
and practise them, and they become automatic in the brain, they will
struggle to play the piano. The same theory applies to how reading is
taught.</div><a name="1002033000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now deal with rigidity, to which the hon. Lady referred. I accept
that nothing in what I say is meant to be rigid. It could be that
research from the States and about Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire is
wrong, and that I am wrong, and that it is not best practice. There
might be an even better system of teaching children to read than
synthetic phonics, but we need to debate the issues fully in public and
not allow the debate to be swept under the carpet, as it has been for
50 years. We must have the debate openly and let parents choose the
philosophical approach that they want for their children. That is my
party&#146;s approach to
education.</div><a name="1002033000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
people have money and can choose their education, they tend to go for
such an approach to teach their children to read. The problem is in the
state sector and the levers of the state seem to be held by people who
want to impose their ideology on our education system, which is what
has been so damaging in the past 50 years. The clause applies to our
schools a particular approach to primary education. If the Minister was
just increasing flexibility and wanted subjects to be taught as
subjects, it would be hard to disagree with him, but that is not what
is laid down in the clause nor what the programmes of study have said
either. Given that we have had a wide debate, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000767"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Amendments 148, 48 and 51 would remove the
requirement to specify programmes of study in the national curriculum.
That is where the national curriculum has gone wrong. What the public,
parents and policy makers have always wanted from the national
curriculum was a simple statement of the core knowledge and concept of
pupils&#146; needs to be taught in each subject, each year. It is as
simple as that; a de minimis level to ensure that children are not
missing out on key elements of their education. Even with a measure
that, as the Minister says, purports to reduce prescription, we still
have a hugely prescriptive set of objectives. There are 84 for primary
English, and 76 for primary maths. They prescribe not curriculum
content but an approach to education that is
controversial.</div>
<a name="1002033000676"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="1002033000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me take the &#147;Understanding English&#148; programme of study as
an example. This has objectives that run from E1 to E24 for the early
part of primary school, from M1 to M29 for the middle years of primary
school, and from L1 to L31 for the later years. Among the early
objectives for four, five and six-year-olds, E3
is,</div><a name="1002033000638"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000768"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am trying to understand what the hon. Gentleman
is saying. We have programmes of study, and he gave some examples of
those. What is a curriculum objective? If curriculum objectives were to
be laid out for English, how many would he expect to have? Does he have
any examples to give to the Committee, so that we can understand the
difference between the sorts of things that have been laid out in the
programmes of study, and the sorts of things that would presumably be
laid out under the subject-based curriculum that he favours?
Presumably, content, skills, knowledge and some sort of objectives
would have to be laid out. How many of those would the hon. Gentleman
expect to have, and what would they be?</div>
<a name="1002033000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000769"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> They would be very few and they would relate to the
reading ability of the child, their writing ability, and the level of
words and degree of difficulty to which the child should be spelling.
In subjects such as geography, we would ask specialists to specify at
what age they think people should know certain things and what is
important. However, it would be things such as the rivers of the United
Kingdom or the countries of Europe. I remember learning the map of
Europe by heart in what is now year six, and my knowledge of Europe
today is based on that. If the Minister wants to look into the issue
further, he could look at the core knowledge curriculum developed by E.
D. Hirsch in America and the core knowledge schools. That curriculum
sets out a simple set of knowledge, concepts and skills that children
should acquire in each year of state education in the United States,
and it is very effective.</div>
<a name="1002033000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000770"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> What is the difference between curriculum
objectives and programmes of study?</div>
<a name="1002033000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000771"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The programmes of study, as drafted by the
Government, are based on an outcomes-based educational system that
drafts them in very broad terms that are the same for several years
running. I would give examples if I had the right piece of paper in
front of me, but in the science curriculum, for example, it will say,
&#147;the development of life&#148; and there will be the
development of life in each of the years. However, because it does not
say that children need to learn about seeds, mammals and then reptiles,
children could often learn the same facts about seeds in each year but
in increasing depth. That is the point; issues are being repeated over
and over again. That is seen in history, which has already moved to a
competence-based approach in key stages 3 and 4. Very often, we find
that children are learning the same period of history over and over
again, but they are learning a different historical skill in each of
the years, which may or may not be useful. What they are not doing is
learning a broader part of the history of this country and the world.
They are learning the same period over while they develop their
historical skills. That is the difference in
approach.</div><a name="1002033000205"></a>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div><a name="1002033000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000773"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, we have made it clear that schools that opt out
or become academies will not be subject to the national curriculum. The
national curriculum should be for schools that remain within the
maintained
sector.</div><a name="1002033000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000774"></a><b class="B">Lynda
Waltho</b> (Stourbridge) (Lab): I have been there not just as
a parent but as a teacher. I was trained in the middle years, so I have
taught in both primary and secondary schools. What the hon. Gentleman
talks about sounds even more prescriptive than the things he has been
denouncing. Am I right in assuming that what he is saying is that on 2
February, all six-year-olds will do page 27 of such and such a book
about the Tudors, or about the sources of rivers? It sounds even more
prescriptive than what he has
denounced.</div><a name="1002033000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000775"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, I am not saying that at all; I am saying the
opposite. As policy makers, we are the people who levy the taxes from
the public and who provide a free education system at the point of use,
which is very expensive. As policy makers, we are trying to say what
our education system needs to provide. The system in clause 10 and in
the programmes of study that come with it promulgates a very particular
approach to education that I have described in my previous remarks. It
is an outcomes-based education system, which has been tried and is in
place in some parts of the world. We can assess the results of the
system if we wish, but as policy makers we should be aware of what is
happening&#151;of what the system is doing. The provision has been
carefully drafted so that it ticks all the boxes for people such as me.
None the less, it is still an outcomes-based education system with
broad curriculum objectives. What I am saying is that as policy makers,
we need to ensure that young people leave school educated, and that we
should debate among ourselves and with the general public what it means
to be educated. Do we want children to leave school
illiterate?</div>
<a name="1002033000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000776"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b><b class="B"> </b>Is the hon. Gentleman talking about primary
school?</div>
<a name="1002033000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000777"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes. Well, this debate goes wider than primary
school, but we are focused on that. Do we want children to leave
primary school illiterate? Do we want them to know nothing about the
continents or countries of the world? Is that something we want to
preserve for secondary school? Do we want them to know the rivers, long
division, long multiplication and equations? Do we want them to know
how to add and take away fractions? The role of policy makers is to say
that by the age of 11, children should know certain things. That does
not mean to say that I think they should learn fractions during the
afternoon of 4 June. What I am saying is that by the time they leave
primary school, or by the time they are nine, they should know or
should have been taught certain things. It may be that they are taught
by brilliant teachers and still cannot remember certain
things.</div>
<a name="1002033000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
role for policy makers in Parliament, and therefore Government, to set
out a minimum of what children should know by the time they leave
primary school. That is all I am saying. Teachers should be able to
teach in whatever way they see fit. If they think they can teach by
standing on their heads, good for them.  If they want to use
cross-curriculum methods or an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>outcomes-based approach, that is fine, so long as when children leave
primary school they are reading at a sufficiently fluent level and have
reached a particular level of maths. I do not see how anyone could
object  to that.</div>
<a name="1002033000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000778"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> I do not object to it, but it seems even more
prescriptive than what the hon. Gentleman has denounced. It is not just
about children coming out of school with a list of things they can do;
they should have learned in a way in which they can apply all of that.
For teachers and parents, from my experience, a holistic approach is
best, rather than a prescriptive shopping list for each subject that
children come out with at the other end.</div>
<a name="1002033000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recently, the
Children, Schools and Families Committee took evidence about young
people going to university. According to it, although they may know
certain things, they cannot apply their knowledge because they have
been taught how to get the right answers, not about thinking and
applying knowledge. Part of what teachers&#151;and, to a certain
extent, parents&#151;do is to help children and young people function
as a result of their education and apply their knowledge and skills,
rather than knowing a list of geography and history
facts.</div><a name="1002033000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000779"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady is talking about pedagogical skills.
That should be left to the professionalism of teachers. We can debate
those issues, but they should not be part of a national curriculum.
That is why I object to the programmes of study; they are very
pedagogical.</div><a name="1002033000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
applying maths, the evidence says that in the early years in primary
schools, children should acquire the basic skills, such as how to
multiply 30 million by 10p and come up with &#163;3 million as the
answer. They should be learning not necessarily real-life examples but
algorithms and techniques, such as, in order to get 10 per cent. of a
large figure, the decimal point can just be moved one point to the
left. Once those basic skills have been acquired, they can be applied
as children get older and acquire higher order
skills.</div><a name="1002033000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is happening is that people are not acquiring the basic skills and are
having to learn them in secondary education, when they should be
beginning to learn how to think. Therefore, when they arrive at
university, they have not learned the higher order skills. That is the
problem I am trying to
highlight.</div><a name="1002033000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000780"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I have looked at the areas of study and although I
agree that some of the wording could be in plainer English, I think
they are helpful to teachers. For example, the part covering history
and geography talks about geographical features. The River Don flows
past a school in my Don Valley constituency. We have Conisbrough
castle, which Harold passed by on his way to the battle of Hastings.
Sir Walter Scott wrote &#147;Ivanhoe&#148; at the Boat inn. This
was all in my maiden speech, so hon. Members can look it up. My point
is that the skills identified in the document can be used and applied
locally.</div>
<a name="1002033000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coal mining is
clearly the main historical industry of the past 100 years in
Doncaster, although the situation has changed. The environment, the
houses and the landscape have all been affected by that industry. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>inner-city areas such as Coventry and London, the effects of the second
world war can be seen on the landscape, for example in places where
bombing took
place.</div><a name="1002033000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not clear to what extent the hon. Gentleman is trying to prescribe
what teachers should teach, whether in history or geography, and
whether the immediate environment is to be used as the stepping-stone
at primary level, which will be the catalyst to spark young
people&#146;s imaginations for more generic learning down the road. I
used to have the skill of being able to recite every king and queen of
England. I will not attempt to do that today. I used to think it was a
pretty interesting party skill, but it did not tell me any more of what
I needed to know about the history of
England.</div><a name="1002033000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000781"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I do not disagree with the right hon. Lady. There is
nothing wrong with schools taking children out and showing them local
historical sites; in fact it is commendable. Of course they should do
that, but they should not just go to see local things in Don Valley.
They should know about the battle of Hastings, which took place at the
other end of England. They should know what was happening in
Europe.</div><a name="1002033000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000782"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I really do not understand the
Conservative party&#146;s position on the issue of core skills and
core knowledge versus the ability to opt out. An e-mail has come into
my hands exchanged between the Liberal Democrats and one of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party&#146;s advisers, in which the Conservatives
make it clear that that they would allow providers to set their own
curriculum. The question that went back to the Conservatives from us
was, &#147;Even if it does not include a proper narrative of British
history?&#148; and their answer was, &#147;Yes, they could opt out
of the national curriculum.&#148; How on earth can there be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000783"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman is confusing two parts of our
policy. Once a school has opted out of the system and becomes an
academy&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption</i><i class="I">]</i> not
immediately&#151;and new providers come in, at that point, there will
be sufficient capacity in the system to give parents a genuine choice,
which is key. If someone from Sweden sets up a school in this country,
they have to attract parents to the idea of sending their child to that
school. They will only go to that school if they believe it is offering
the curriculum that they&#151;parents who now have a genuine choice;
in other words, those who have sufficient money to have a
choice&#151;want. It is our belief that they will choose schools that
provide a high-quality education. However, they should also be free to
send their children to progressive schools with the Kunskapsskolan or
Bedales type of approach. However, I believe strongly that most parents
will want to send their children to a school that provides rigorous
academic education, where children leave fully educated and skilled in
reading and have a good grasp of
maths.</div><a name="1002033000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000784"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> What on earth has choice got to do with the presence
of one academy? There could be an academy serving a town where there is
no choice at all, and four ordinary maintained comprehensive schools
offering 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>the potential for real choice. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s policy would
impose a monopoly of one provision on a town that relies on one
academy, but not allow choice to operate where there are four secondary
schools.</div><a name="1002033000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000785"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> If that scenario develops, there will be a lot of
parental dissatisfaction. Therefore, a new provider will come in.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> They will. That is the essence of
our proposal: we will make it much easier for schools to establish by
removing the bureaucratic hurdles that schools will have to go through
and the rule on surplus places. We believe that as a consequence of
those reforms, many new providers will come in and provide things like
the Harris academies, which give a first-class education. Their school
in Crystal Palace was graded by Ofsted as perfect in everything that it
examined. I believe that our system will lead to a huge opening up and
diversity of providers, who will have to provide the kind of education
that parents want for their
children.</div><a name="1002033000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000786"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for being so
patient. He will be aware that at the moment, academies are at the
forefront of schools using their flexibility to drop core subjects such
as history a year earlier than was thought to be specified in the
existing national curriculum. If an existing academy decided to drop
history earlier&#151;at age 10, nine or eight&#151;what would he
do?</div><a name="1002033000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000787"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Existing academies are subject to funding agreements
that will prevent them from doing so. However, we believe that there
will be a rapid increase in new providers coming into our system. I
repeat: if schools are not providing the type and quality of education
demanded by parents, a new provider will come in. It will be easier for
new providers to come in, and they will begin to provide the education
demanded by parents. Children will drift away from schools that are not
teaching history beyond the age of 11, toward those that do. At the
moment, we have a system that is letting down significant segments of
our population, and I believe that this is the only way in which we can
tackle underperforming schools in our system in the long
run.</div><a name="1002033000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000788"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> If that is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party&#146;s policy, I urge him to think again. He is a strong
advocate of a core curriculum. Is he really saying that the only thing
he is relying on to protect young people where there is potentially one
school in a catchment area is the market mechanism? It could be four or
five years before another school is established. A young person could
have missed the opportunity to get an education in precisely the type
of core subjects that the hon. Gentleman has always argued are
important.</div><a name="1002033000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000789"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> But if schools want to do what the hon. Gentleman is
proposing&#151;speaking to many heads, I doubt that they will want to
do so&#151;they will probably be deficient in many other areas, in
schools that are currently not providing a high-quality education to
parents. The hon. Gentleman is painting a scenario of extremis, and I
do not believe that we will go down that route, because we are dealing
ultimately with a profession and its members are professional
people.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div><a name="1002033000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000790"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): Having visited a Kunskapsskolan
school in Stockholm and, indeed, state schools there, is the hon.
Gentleman aware that what creates choice for parents in Sweden is not
the provision of those schools, but the over-provision of places?
Without keeping places paid for but empty in schools, at huge cost, it
is impossible to provide parents with the choice that he implies would
be provided. I am eager to hear whether he thinks that any putative
Conservative Government would be able to fund&#151;would be willing
to fund&#151;the level of over-provision that Swedish schools happily
fund to guarantee that parental
choice.</div><a name="1002033000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000791"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, there needs to be capacity in the
system&#151;the hon. Gentleman is right&#151;but there is not a
huge cost, because schools are and, under our proposals, would be
funded only on the basis of the number of pupils in the school. If a
school is undersubscribed compared to its capacity, it will have to
close classrooms, turn the radiator off and reduce the staff
accordingly. That is the system in Sweden and it works there and does
not cost huge amounts. Incidentally, Sweden introduced the system in a
recession and it proved very cost-effective. So it is not usually
expensive to have money following the pupil and to have surplus places
in the system at the same
time.</div><a name="1002033000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000792"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are beginning to stray quite a way
from the specifics of the amendments before us. Could we now come back
to the amendments? We have had an interesting debate, but perhaps the
hon. Gentleman will come back to the
amendments.</div><a name="1002033000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000793"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, I will, Mr. Betts; I take your
point. The objectives that I read out some time ago, from the programme
of study, are all about deconstructing texts. Kevin Donnelly
says:</div><a name="1002033000644"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Deconstructing
texts not only removes the focus from learning to read with
discrimination and understanding, but the joy of reading is destroyed
as students are forced to view literature through the narrow prism of
what is currently defined as
acceptable.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Donnelly
goes on to
say:</div><a name="1002033000645"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Primary
school children instead of reading for enjoyment are told that they
must become &#145;active meaning makers through critical reading and
thinking
strategies&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is that phrase &#147;making meaning&#148; again, now cited by an
Australian academic. These are all in the programmes of study: L10,
L15, L16, L19 and
L20.</div><a name="1002033000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key to reading in primary schools is to ensure that early on, children
have mastered the skills of decoding text effortlessly. As that is
being mastered, children can read to learn, read to increase vocabulary
and read to increase comprehension. We need to encourage children to
read for pleasure and to read book after book after book. That was
certainly the approach taken in the elementary school that I went to in
Canada, where every time that any child finished a book, up on the wall
went another leg of the bookworm. As a seven-year-old, I would have
been mortified if I had had to analyse the text. Ensuring that children
understand the story is enough at that
age.</div><a name="1002033000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would take out the phrase &#147;programmes of
study&#148; and replace it with &#147;curriculum
objectives&#148;. Amendment 193 was inspired by the NASUWT, which
said in its brief to members of the Committee:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div><a name="1002033000646"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposals put forward in relation to the incorporation of PSHE into the
National Curriculum made it clear that the subject orders would not
include attainment targets or statutory assessments. Although the Bill
does not introduce such provisions, it does create a legal framework
within which attainment targets and statutory assessment might be
introduced
subsequently.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
193 would apply that approach, not to PSHE but to understanding
physical development, health and well-being. Clause 10(2) gives the
Secretary of State power to apply attainment targets and programmes of
study to all six areas of learning. The amendment would remove that
power from the sixth learning area&#151;physical development, health
and well-being, which is not an area that I believe should be examined,
not because I was not any good at PE and physical development, but
because I do not think that every area of the curriculum needs to be
assessed, tested and subject to a
target.</div><a name="1002033000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
150 would ensure that the attainment targets and assessment
arrangements were kept under
review.</div><a name="1002033000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000794"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I started the important debate on the last string
of amendments by pointing out that I felt that I and my hon. Friend the
Member for Yeovil were coming at this issue with a different approach
from the Conservatives. With this string of amendments we are running
parallel and are never going to meet. That is quite bizarre. Perhaps I
should refer to our three key amendments, which I hope have a coherence
and consistency that I felt were distinctly lacking in the previous
debate.</div>
<a name="1002033000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
strongly that there should simply be a minimum curriculum entitlement
set down for all children. That truly means giving the freedom to
implement that to the head teachers, governors and teachers. It applies
to all schools; we do not start picking and choosing. If it is good for
academies then, we would argue, it is good for maintained schools, and
we think that should be the case. We need a minimum curriculum
entitlement, but we do not need prescribed from the centre masses of
detail and prescription, of which we have had a lot in the last half
hour or
so.</div><a name="1002033000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
moving on to amendment 160, we think the minimum curriculum entitlement
should be determined by the Secretary of State, but after consultation
with all relevant bodies, and it should be reviewed not more than once
in each Parliament. We have to put an end to the constant tinkering
with the curriculum from the
centre.</div><a name="1002033000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
161 looks at assessments in relation to the primary curriculum. We
currently have a situation where, perhaps excepting Government
Ministers, there is a strong feeling that teaching to the test at key
stage 2 is distorting whatever curriculum has been set down. It would
not matter if it was areas of learning or subject-based, when we get to
year 6 in many schools the key stage 2 test overcomes everything else.
In line with moving to a minimum curriculum entitlement, we want a
proper review of the validity and viability of assessment processes. We
are not just making a cheap political statement of &#147;Scrap this,
scrap that&#148; but looking at it seriously and seeing that the
assessment is there for a purpose, to develop our children&#146;s
learning rather than becoming an end in itself, with so many
objectives, many going back to the school and the local authority. Our
children are losing out and not having that rich curriculum necessarily

<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>at the moment. In many schools, excellent head teachers and teachers
give the necessary leadership and it is possible to have that rich
curriculum and survive with the test. We do know examples of where that
does not happen, and therefore it is important to have a proper
review.</div><a name="1002033000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000795"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> What an illuminating debate this
is.</div>
<a name="1002033000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000796"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> Are you
sure?</div><a name="1002033000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000797"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am sure because it sets out the coherent
position that the Rose review laid out for the reform of the
curriculum. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton did his
best but was left with a paucity of detail. The difference between
&#147;curriculum objectives&#148; and &#147;programmes of
study&#148; is not clear to me. The hon. Gentleman just listed a
range of content and said something like, &#147;Because it is content
and your programmes of study are vague and I do not agree with them, we
are going to call them curriculum
objectives.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge laid out from her experience
some of the consequences of the constraints that the hon. Gentleman
would place on teachers. The hon. Gentleman chided me
earlier&#151;without using the words flexibility and allowing
teachers to teach in the way that they want&#151;and asked the
advantage of what we are doing. Essentially, the Rose review allows
that return of flexibility, of teacher professionalism, and of allowing
schools to determine how best to teach their young
people.</div><a name="1002033000678"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="1002033000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would change the current national curriculum system of
setting out programmes of study, assessment arrangements and attainment
targets for the areas of learning. They would take out all the
programmes of study and therefore the essential knowledge. The hon.
Gentleman talked about English; under each of those areas of learning
the appropriate essential knowledge is laid out in the national
curriculum handbook. The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friends will be
able to read that and see what the essential knowledge is. The key
skills for each area of learning are then laid out. The document is
concrete and specific. It then lays out the cross-curricular studies,
which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley and my hon.
Friend the Member for Stourbridge rightly pointed out, are absolutely
essential. The Rose review and many professionals say that any
programme of study rather than some content-based curriculum objective
is absolutely
essential.</div><a name="1002033000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
heart of the debate and of our difference is that the hon. Gentleman
says that the content must be laid out as a prescriptive list and we
say that of course content is important, but the use of that knowledge
and being able to apply it in a cross-curricular way is a key
fundamental part of any curriculum reform. The amendments in the first
group laid the matter out in one way and this group lays it out in
another, but the debate is essentially the same. I am sorry to deal
with the matter in this rather restrained way with a lecturing tone,
but people read these
debates.</div><a name="1002033000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as essential knowledge, key skills and cross-curricular studies,
there is breadth of learning and trying to develop that. Teachers feel
excited and inspired 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>because the document is driven not only by
content&#151;knowledge&#151;but by skills and understanding. That
is all laid out. It then lays out the curriculum progression in three
stages: the early stages, years 1 and 2; the middle stages, years 3 and
4; and the later stages, years 5 and 6. It lays out what teachers would
reasonably expect of their pupils in those situations. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments completely cast that aside and say that
none of it is relevant or appropriate, or leads to good teaching or
learning, which is at the heart of what we
want.</div><a name="1002033000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its place, the hon. Gentleman wants curriculum objectives&#151;a list
of content. As soon as someone starts to list content, people will say,
&#147;You haven&#146;t included this&#148;. To try to make a list
of content for history, geography, science, maths, English and so on,
in a way that is manageable for the curriculum is difficult. If the
hon. Gentleman looks back at the introduction of the national
curriculum about 20 years ago, he will remember that the people
introducing it were plagued by trying to lay out the content that
schools should cover. Reform ever since has been to reduce the amount
of content, to make the curriculum manageable for
schools.</div><a name="1002033000251"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000798"></a>Lynda
Waltho:</b> My hon. Friend has just reminded me of the
nightmare introduction of the national curriculum. I remember folders
upon folders of different subject areas, which we had to divide down
into how many children we had. I literally had to have my clipboard
with me so that I ticked something when a child showed some skill or
showed that they understood the knowledge, and it was horrendous.
Children do not learn in such a way. Sometimes young people look as
though they have understood something and then one might find a week
later that they have not quite grasped it yet. It was impossible to do
that, and it will be impossible to do a similar thing in terms of
subject knowledge. It would be ridiculous. It points to the fact that
the Conservatives are not talking to the professionals who actually
deliver education. It is naive.</div>
<a name="1002033000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000799"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> What my hon. Friend has just said and the passion
with which she said it outlines the difficulty that the hon. Gentleman
will find himself in when he tries to list content in the way that he
started to when I asked him what he meant by curriculum objectives
rather than programmes of study. With respect to the previous
Conservative Government, it bedevilled them when they tried to do it.
They were castigated for not having all those things in
it.</div><a name="1002033000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Rose review lays out programmes of study and of course contains skills
and cross-curricular provisions as well. It is not clear from
amendments 48 and 51 what function the curriculum objectives would be
intended to fulfil. Nor is it clear how they would provide access to
the knowledge, skills and understanding, and curricular continuity
across the key stages&#151;a point made by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Don Valley&#151;to which all children are currently
entitled through the national curriculum programmes of
study.</div><a name="1002033000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will know that the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) laid out 24 areas of history in
the <i class="I">Evening Standard</i>, which he said were an essential part of
the history curriculum.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div><a name="1002033000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000800"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Over nine
years.</div>
<a name="1002033000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000801"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> If the hon. Gentleman tries 24 areas over nine
years, he will be castigated. It will be 30 over six and 58 over 10.
That is where it will end up if the hon. Gentleman is not careful. He
also started to get into trouble with the free school notion. He does
not understand the illogicality of the point that he made to the hon.
Member for Yeovil. He said that it is an essential curriculum&#151;so
essential that everyone should do it&#151;and then he said,
&#147;But we are going to set up loads of schools that do not have
to.&#148; That is an illogical position&#151;his Whip wants me to
finish; my own Whip does, too. I totally disagree with him, but he laid
out what he thought with clarity and passion, and then said, &#147;It
is so important for every school to do this that we are going to set up
a system where schools can do what they want.&#148; Whatever the
rights and wrongs of it, the logic drives a coach and horses through
it, let alone the chaos that would result in the system from the market
free-for-all that he envisages in school
places.</div><a name="1002033000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
I hope the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will withdraw
his amendment. On assessment, we recently had an expert group look into
the future of testing arrangements and we have made changes to key
stage 2, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole will know.
Formal assessment arrangements exist at the end of key stage 2 with
respect to maths and English. There are, of course, attainment targets
laid out in the national curriculum document. They will remain the
same. The Government have no intention of changing the assessment
arrangements at present. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000802"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This has been an interesting debate, but I do not
know whether the Minister understands what he is introducing, or
whether he believes his own rhetoric about reducing prescription and
increasing flexibility. That could easily have been achieved in
secondary legislation by simply getting rid of or slimming down the
objectives in the programmes of study. If he examines the programmes of
study and reads Kevin Donnelly&#146;s book and/or E.D.
Hirsch&#146;s book, &#147;The Schools We Need: And Why We
Don&#146;t Have Them&#148;, he will see that that conforms closely
to an outcome-based approach to
education.</div><a name="1002033000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first two items in the English programme of study for essential
knowledge are,
(a),</div><a name="1002033000647"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;how
language is used to express, explore, and share information, ideas,
thoughts and
feelings&#148;</div><a name="1002033000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
(b),</div><a name="1002033000648"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
power of language and communication to engage people and influence
their ideas and
actions&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
broad phrases can mean almost anything, and the real devil is in the
detail, which is set out in the programmes of study, which again tend
to lead to repetition in different years, and focus on a particular
competence-based curriculum rather than a knowledge-based curriculum.
It is ideological, and that is why I feel so strongly that it should
not be in this legislation. It has become a feature of the QCA&#146;s
approach to our education system during the past six or seven years,
and it has done untold damage.</div>
<a name="1002033000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">If clause 10
goes through and the programmes of study are inflicted prescriptively
on our primary schools, I know what will happen. Someone will go into a

<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>primary school on the date mentioned by the hon. Member for Stourbridge
and will see written on the board, &#147;Today we will do N15.
Objective: authors.&#148; That approach to education will kill the
joy of learning, and of reading, and it will be a retrograde
step.</div><a name="1002033000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

guidance for teachers on how the national curriculum will be taught,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000823"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We have spent a long time doing geography,
English and history. We are now going to do sex, and personal, social
health and economic education as part of it. The next few clauses are
clearly a contentious part of the Bill. They concentrate on what is in
PSHE. We have all been lobbied heavily, particularly on how far the sex
and relationship education elements of the Bill should go.</div>
<a name="1002033000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the outset,
it is worth saying that my worry about the way in which this part of
the Bill is structured does not derive from an objection to PSHE. A lot
of stuff mentioned in the Bill should be taught to children. I am a big
advocate of far better sex and relationship education, which
historically we do badly in this country, and I am sure that many
members of the Committee have all had some pretty inadequate
experiences of its teaching in our schools. It is a bit of a postcode
lottery.</div>
<a name="1002033000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three matters at the heart of why we are worried about the structure of
this aspect of the Bill. First, I am concerned about pressures on the
curriculum and the timetable in schools. Secondly, our overriding
concern must be about the quality of what is taught to our children
under the headings of PSHE, and sex and relationship education in
particular. A third important matter that we must bear in mind is the
rights, responsibilities and considerations of the parents.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div><a name="1002033000598"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Clearly,
what is at stake is parents&#146; power to withdraw their children
from particular aspects of what is now being proposed as compulsory in
schools. That is a problem. A parent&#146;s right to withdraw their
child from certain forms of teaching is a principle that has lasted
until now and that goes to the heart of parental choice, by which we
still set great store.</div>
<a name="1002033000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">This part of
the Bill is a bit of a muddle, and I think that it will cause problems
if it passes as currently structured. That is why we have taken as the
basis for a proper debate the principle that PSHE should not become
such a structured, compulsory part of the curriculum. Schools are
successfully incorporating it in other ways into their curriculum and
timetable.</div><a name="1002033000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Virtually
every week&#151;I am sure that the same goes for my hon. Friends on
the Front Bench and other hon. Members&#151;I am approached by some
outside organisation such as a charity, voluntary group or business
saying what amounts to &#147;Such and such a subject really should be
part of the national curriculum. This is such an essential subject that
we must make sure it&#146;s absolutely up there with all the other
subjects that children must learn in schools.&#148;</div>
<a name="1002033000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of the
lobbying and briefs that we have had for this aspect of the Bill, I
received a perfectly reasonable brief from St. John Ambulance saying
that basic first aid should be part of the national curriculum and that
we must find time to ensure that all our kids have basic first aid
skills, because it is an important subject. I am sure that we all agree
that it is an important subject. If more people knew basic first aid,
perhaps fewer people would suffer from accidents and so on.</div>
<a name="1002033000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also had a
brief from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds saying that
there should be a statutory purpose for the environment and sustainable
futures as part of the national curriculum. Again, it is an important
subject&#151;I am sure we all agree that we want our children to be
more environmentally aware&#151;but the RSPB thinks that it should be
part of the national
curriculum.</div><a name="1002033000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list goes on and on, with various organisations with axes to grind. The
trouble is that the time in which our children can learn in schools is
limited. If we cram more and more into the compulsory part of the
national curriculum, something must give. Either we must drop other
subjects altogether, or the other subjects that remain compulsory will
be diluted in some way. That is the balance to be struggled with, and
that is why objections to the structure of this part of the Bill are
based largely on what is practical in our schools and what children can
actually cope
with.</div><a name="1002033000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
55 is a way of plotting territory. It would remove PSHE as a compulsory
subject. A selection of our amendments have been grouped together as an
either/or option. If PSHE is to become a statutory part of the
curriculum, amendments 58 and 106 would cap the amount of time overtly
devoted to it in the curriculum.</div>
<a name="1002033000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is part
of the nonsense of including such a subject in the compulsory
curriculum. It may be that PSHE is being taught successfully now
through other subjects and a range of different media. My concern is
that everything that comes under the heading of PSHE and all the things
that I would describe loosely as healthy living&#151;domestic
science, healthy eating, cooking and doing additional sport&#151;are
largely academic if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>children do not have the core skills, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton articulated so well, of being able to
read, write and understand what they are being taught. We must strike a
balance in what we are teaching our
children.</div><a name="1002033000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
we have sought to put some limits on the amount of time that will be
taken up by PSHE if it is to remain as a core curriculum subject. I am
probing the Minister to tell me how she thinks that such a matter will
be articulated within the school
timetable.</div><a name="1002033000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000824"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): Just for clarification because
I have never been very good at maths, how many minutes a day will this
amendment mean? We are talking about 5 per cent., but has the hon.
Gentleman worked out what will happen in the classroom if the amendment
is accepted? Will the subject account for half an hour or an hour? I am
just not sure what sort of proportion it will be of the week&#146;s
lessons and
time.</div><a name="1002033000309"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000825"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point. My hon. Friend
tells me that the time roughly equates to that of half a GCSE. A GCSE
takes up 10 per cent. of the curriculum time, so PSHE will take up
roughly half that. The hon. Lady can then work out how much physical
time in minutes and hours that will take. Putting it alongside other
GCSE subjects puts the matter into a more useful perspective.</div>
<a name="1002033000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
outlined the basis of amendments 58 and 106.</div>
<a name="1002033000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 56
takes a PSHE requirement out of the Education Act 2006. Amendment 59
inserts the 5 per cent. cap in subsection (3), and amendment 77 would
take PSHE out of the core curriculum.</div>
<a name="1002033000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know
that we have a very serious problem with sex and relationship education
in this country, and we need to ensure that our children and young
people have a far better grasp of responsible sexual relations and
responsible relationships. Let me touch on some of the figures. One in
10 sexually active 16 to 24-year-olds have chlamydia, 75 per cent. of
sexually active 16 to 24-year-olds do not use condoms. The number of
under-age children having sex doubled between 1990 and 2000 and
continues to increase. The cases of HIV have trebled since
1997.</div><a name="1002033000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of the problem is the quality of the teaching of sex education. The UK
Youth Parliament has produced a very interesting study about the
existence of a postcode lottery in the teaching of sex education. In an
analogy that I have given in the past&#151;this was the case in my
school although with different names&#151;Mrs. Miggins,
the geography teacher, happens to have a couple of free periods on a
Thursday afternoon so she gets to do sex education this term. We need
far better standards in the quality of sex education, which need not be
taught by teachers who are in school. There is a case for saying that a
better quality of sex education can come from outside bodies. By that I
mean specially trained teachers from voluntary organisations who have
their specialisms and a better empathetic relationship with the
children, who are not in front of the same teacher in a class 
on some completely unrelated subject for other parts  of the
week.</div>
<a name="1002033000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we must
concentrate on the quality of how we teach some of those subjects, and
that is not solved by just saying, &#147;It must occupy a certain
part of the curriculum in the classroom now.&#148; There are far more
imaginative ways in which we can do
it.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div><a name="1002033000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
consideration is the role of parents. One of the witnesses, Gill
Frances, made the point that the number of children being withdrawn
from sex and relationship education is so small that the age
consideration is something of a red herring. The withdrawal rate is
0.04 per cent., according to Ofsted, which equates to around 3,000
children in England. We shall come to the issue in a later clause, but
I cannot understand why the right to withdraw children from the subject
is to disappear in respect of a certain age level under the changes
recommended by the
Government.</div><a name="1002033000680"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="1002033000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the new guidance that the Government recently distributed about
changes proposed for clause 13, which emphasises the important nature
of marriage and family life. Genuine improvements are being added. Some
have queried whether the Government are changing their policy, in
respect of giving parents the ultimate right over whether to withdraw
their children from certain subjects if that conflicts with their
ethos, religious instructions and so forth.</div>
<a name="1002033000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s own public consultation on the subject showed that
the majority of parents, carers and guardians wanted to retain their
current right to withdraw children from the sex and relationship
element of PSHE. The Government need to make a better case for why they
want to bring about substantial changes to the curriculum in schools.
They need to make a better case to assure people of what is going to
give if we place greater emphasis on PSHE, and why the quality of the
teaching of those subjects would be improved greatly if it were made a
compulsory curriculum
subject.</div><a name="1002033000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the reasoning behind the amendments. We shall come to a little more
detail about some of the aspects of sex and relationship education
during discussion of the age opt-out considerations in the later
clauses in the group, but that is broadly why we think the clause, as
structured, would prove a muddle, with unintended consequences. It
would not necessarily improve the quality of teaching of some of the
important aspects under the heading of PSHE and it would alter the
relationship between the school and the community of parents. The best
way of teaching such subjects has been through an understanding between
the schools and the parents about what is best for the children. Making
the subject compulsory changes the dynamics of that relationship. The
Government need to make a stronger case for why they want to do
so.</div><a name="1002033000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many ways, the amendments are probing, but they set out the premise on
which we want to address some of our later amendments in more detail,
as part of the changes to PSHE and to sex and relationship education in
particular.</div><a name="1002033000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000826"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I have often proposed that PSHE should be
compulsory, because it is so important that it is carried out well.
Every child should have the opportunity to learn about the whole range
of issues. Every child should have the entitlement to learn about life
skills, as we have often heard from other Members of Parliament. I do
not think that we can go on any longer with how the subject is being
delivered across the whole run of schools. Of course there are
excellent examples within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>individual schools, but I do not think that anybody would attempt to
argue that overall we are dealing well with PSHE in this
country.</div>
<a name="1002033000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 6
touches, in part, on some of the points that have been made. The
compulsory element must be matched with quality provision; that is so
important. One element of that would be an assessment of the capacities
of schools to provide quality PSHE. Equally, what proportion&#151;it
need not be a rigid proportion&#151;of the curriculum PSHE might take
up must be established. Obviously, a lot of PSHE can be delivered in a
cross-curricular manner, and it would be very well delivered in that
way. However, there is a lack of clarity at the moment.</div>
<a name="1002033000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">In retrospect,
I applaud the Government for how long they took to consult with
everybody. I was so anxious that we should get on with things that I
think I criticised them for the length of the consultation. However,
having reached the point that we are at today, we can look back and say
that a thorough job has been done.</div>
<a name="1002033000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it may be
that our new clause is redundant; it may be that the Government have
actually done the work already. Nevertheless, the Liberal Democrats
very strongly support in principle what the Government are doing in
this area.</div>
<a name="1002033000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000827"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I concur with the hon. Lady; I firmly support the
idea that PSHE should now be a compulsory element of the curriculum. My
understanding is that the Youth Parliament, which the hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham referred to, has also supported it for some
years. In fact, I remember that when I was Minister of State for Public
Health, we were lobbied to that effect and I supported the idea then. I
am very glad that Ministers in the newly formed Department for
Children, Schools and Families have come round to that point of view
today.</div>
<a name="1002033000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
issue is also about the quality of education that is provided. I am
afraid to say that many young people that I have spoken to over the
years have complained bitterly about the quality of how aspects of PSHE
were taught within schools. First, there was the embarrassment of
teachers who were not trained to teach it. Secondly, we need to think
about how we need to deal with these issues, particularly sex and
relationships education, given that a teacher may have a very mature
11-year-old&#151;I use my words wisely here&#151;and a very young
11-year-old in the same class. There are many issues about how to deal
with this subject in a mixed-sex school, given that some sessions are
more appropriate for girls-only classes and some sessions are more
appropriate for boys-only classes.</div>
<a name="1002033000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">For a long
time, whenever we have debated sex education&#151;it is why the
relationships aspect is so important&#151;we have adopted a rather
schoolboy-ish and giggling attitude towards it; I do not want to be
gender-specific, but that is the case. That means that we do not really
get into the depth of relationships, as we need to.</div>
<a name="1002033000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
about informing young people about how to use contraceptives, whether
condoms or other forms. However, it is also about the ability to give
young women and young men an understanding of the dangers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>of what happens if they do not use contraceptives, and about teaching
them to say no or to demand that such protection is used if they are
going to have sex. It is about being assertive and having control over
their relationships, and that has been missing from our debates on the
issue. Whenever we debate it, all the shutters go down and we do not
have an adequate conversation that really equips young people to make
the right decisions at the right time when they are on their own and
faced with peer group pressure. Undoubtedly, peer group pressure is
hugely significant.</div>
<a name="1002033000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
parents, I was pleased to hear Gill Frances, the lady from the Teenage
Pregnancy Advisory Group, say in her evidence to us the other week
that, overwhelmingly, parents do keep children in these classes. She
also agreed that 15 was the right age for these young people to have
the appropriate support in terms of sex and relationship
education.</div>
<a name="1002033000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also remind
the Committee that parents often say, in every survey, that they do not
feel equipped to have such conversations with their own children and
that they want others&#151;whether the school or others acting on
behalf of it&#151;to provide the opportunity for their children to
have those conversations in an atmosphere of privacy, trust and
confidence. That is an important element of the proposed legislation
and it is long  overdue, but the proof will be in how it is
delivered. How well it has been done will be apparent when young people
in five or 10 years&#146; time speak about the quality of that
experience.</div><a name="1002033000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000828"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Ms Diana R. Johnson):</b> At this late stage in the
day I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Betts. I am
pleased finally to be on my feet. I apologise for sniffling and
coughing throughout today&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="1002033000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Don
Valley, who as usual took a common-sense approach to the issue, and
those of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, who welcomed
the fact that PSHE will now be made statutory. I hope that I will be
able to deal with the three areas that the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham is concerned about: pressure on the curriculum,
the quality of PSHE and the rights and responsibilities of
parents.</div><a name="1002033000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
group of amendments covers a number of aspects of PSHE provision and
serves to raise concerns about the nature, content and merits of
statutory PSHE being introduced in schools, the overall impact it will
have on schools and delivery of the existing
curriculum.</div><a name="1002033000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6 would introduce a new clause into the Bill requiring the
Secretary of State to assess the capacity of maintained schools or
academies to deliver PSHE by way of an impact assessment, and to have a
report produced for
Parliament.</div><a name="1002033000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal with amendments 55 and 56 together. Amendment 55 would
prevent PSHE from becoming part of the statutory secondary national
curriculum at key stage 3. Amendment 56 would create a strange
position, in that PSHE would become part of the statutory secondary
national curriculum at key stage 4 by being inserted into the existing
section 85 of the Education Act 2002, but would then cease to
be  part of the national curriculum once the new provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>introduced by the Education and Inspections Act 2006 are commenced.
Presumably, the intention of the hon. Gentleman who tabled the
amendments was that PSHE should not be part of key stage 4 at
all.</div><a name="1002033000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all know that PSHE prepares children and young people to deal with
real-life issues, giving them the knowledge, skills and understanding
they require to lead confident, healthy and independent lives. Research
has shown that young people want opportunities to discuss issues that
are relevant to their lives, including emotions, relationships and
health issues such as mental health, sexual health, diet and exercise,
not to mention topics such as careers. Of course, many families discuss
such issues, but children and young people tell us how important it is
to have a perspective in school, where they can discuss these issues
among themselves. Sad to say, those things are not always discussed
anywhere near adequately at home. Children tell us that
clearly.</div><a name="1002033000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also consulted schools, teachers, parents and faith groups. There
was strong support for making PSHE part of the national curriculum at
all key stages, including primary. PSHE contributes to the Every Child
Matters agenda and to fulfilling the five outcomes framework by helping
children to understand what it means to be healthy, to stay safe, to
enjoy and achieve, to make a positive contribution and to achieve
economic
well-being.</div><a name="1002033000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know from Ofsted reports looking at PSHE that although in some schools
it is taught well, provision varies throughout the country. That is why
it is important to make PSHE statutory. The key point in that regard is
to ensure that PSHE at key stages 3 and 4 builds on pupils&#146; own
experiences and on the work carried out at key stages 1 and 2, and
complements other areas of the curriculum. We need to be clear that if
PSHE is to be effective, it must be delivered in a variety of ways to
the different age
groups.</div><a name="1002033000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give Committee members an example of the topics that children and
young people will be deprived of if the amendment is accepted. At key
stages 3 and 4 they will not be able to explore and learn about topics
such as drugs and alcohol, bullying, body image and the changing nature
of the relationship between the sexes. It is in the crucial later years
that young people should have the opportunity to look in depth at
topics such as sex, sexuality and relationships; they should benefit
from the wider range of experience and knowledge with which they will
engage.</div>
<a name="1002033000681"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="1002033000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000829"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I do not disagree with the hon. Lady about the
importance of those subjects. However, she needs to say why they would
be much better taught, but not to the detriment of the other things
that children are at school to learn, if they were a statutory
curriculum subject. It is the quality that concerns me, and the hon.
Lady should address that aspect.</div>
<a name="1002033000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000830"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I agree that quality is most important in making
PSHE work for our young people. I shall speak in a moment about the
amendment, which would restrict the amount of PSHE taught in schools.
The wider expectation is that PSHE will help with combating social
exclusion and disaffection and equipping young people with the skills
and attitudes needed to react positively to the pressures of modern
life.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div><a name="1002033000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to
amendments 58, 59 and 106. They would restrict PSHE to no more than 5
per cent. of curriculum time at key stages 3 and 4, presumably so that
it does not impact on other parts of the curriculum or on school
activities. That is entirely unwarranted. The national curriculum has
always left it to schools  to decide the proportion of the
school timetable that is  to be given to subjects. I see no
good reason to change
that.</div><a name="1002033000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would also contradict the provisions of section 87(4) of the
Education Act 2002, which prohibits programmes of study from requiring
the allocation of particular periods of time to the study of a
particular subject. The comments of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton about a 10 per cent. figure for GCSEs are not
correct. Timetabling has always been the preserve of the school, and it
would be strange to impose such a requirement in respect of only one
subject.</div><a name="1002033000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allocating
curriculum time for PSHE would be detrimental to a school&#146;s
flexibility to organise the content and delivery of the curriculum to
meet the needs of its pupils, and to introduce approaches to teaching
and learning within and across curriculum subjects and on a
cross-curricular basis. We already know that when PSHE is taught well,
it does not have to be a discrete subject taught once a week. It can be
taught with a variety of other curriculum
subjects.</div><a name="1002033000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
77 would remove the definition and overarching principles that have
been designed to safeguard the delivery of PSHE. It is particularly
important for statutory PSHE that we provide clear and consistent
messages, and they should be underpinned by a clear definition of PSHE.
Schools, parents, children and young people and the wider public need
to be kept aware of the range of issues covered by PSHE, as well as
being given more opportunity to consider the rationale, key concepts
and topics that underpin the subject.</div>
<a name="1002033000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to embrace a number of key principles that we believe should
underpin the teaching of elements of statutory PSHE. They are equally
important. Responses to our consultation on PSHE revealed concern that
protection was needed against inappropriate and unbalanced teaching,
particularly of some of the more emotive elements. Although it is
important to recognise that pupils in schools come from various
religious and cultural backgrounds, we should not ignore the wider
religious and cultural make-up of the nation. It is this balance that
the principles
strike.</div><a name="1002033000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring
PSHE to be taught in a way that promotes equality will encourage the
acceptance of diversity and emphasise the importance of rights and
responsibilities, along with other principles. We wish to strike an
appropriate balance. Removing those principles would remove some of the
safeguards and assurances that parents and pupils seek for the teaching
of this subject. As I have said, many elements of PSHE raise
contradictory views. The principles will enshrine in legislation the
need for teachers to be sensitive to those views, providing children
with information but always in the context of a balanced view.
Amendment 77 would remove that protection; it would damage rather than
improve effective PSHE provision in our
schools.</div><a name="1002033000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6 would require the Secretary of State to assess the capacity of
maintained schools and academies to deliver PSHE; it would be done by
way of an impact assessment and a report would be produced for
Parliament. The Committee may be aware that an impact assessment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>for the delivery of statutory PSHE was published by my Department last
November. Copies were laid alongside the draft Bill for hon. Members in
both Houses. A further impact assessment would be both unnecessary and
a costly
burden.</div><a name="1002033000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me take the opportunity to address the issue of the capacity and
ability of schools to deliver statutory PSHE, and the perception that
the subject will be an additional pressure on the existing school
curriculum. I am aware that little primary research has been conducted
on the delivery and impact of statutory PSHE education as a whole. Most
research that has been undertaken has been small-scale and focused on
specific strands within the context of PSHE, such as education about
sex and relationships, or drugs and alcohol.</div>
<a name="1002033000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much of the
commentary available on the quality of PSHE in schools is based on
inspection evidence gathered by Ofsted, and suggests that the quality
of PSHE programmes is generally improving. From what we have seen and
heard, my Department would generally endorse that position. However, as
I mentioned earlier, Ofsted&#146;s latest report concludes
that</div><a name="1002033000649"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this
broadly encouraging picture conceals some
variation&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inconsistency
in coverage and variability in quality is of concern. By making this
subject statutory, we can achieve a step change in the quality of that
provision.</div><a name="1002033000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
number of pupils currently withdrawing from sex education probably
reflects the fact that there is no core content. Schools provide sex
and relationship education in many different ways, and what they teach
depends on which part of the country they are in, and what kind of
focus and attention the leadership of the school gives to that issue
within PSHE. With PSHE becoming statutory, and given the list of what
is expected to be taught in sex and relationship education, it is not
clear whether the numbers will change. That is why it is important to
put the right of withdrawal in the Bill. As the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham knows, we will discuss that matter under a
different group of
amendments.</div><a name="1002033000352"></a>

Loughton:</b> I did not disagree with a lot of what the
Minister said. Towards the end of her comments she said that by making
PSHE statutory, we can achieve a step change. I want to achieve a step
change, because a lot of the things that are defined&#151;somewhat
rigidly&#151;in the Bill are things that we need to do a heck of a
lot better, such as teaching kids about the downside of binge drinking,
achieving better mental health, being more aware of mental health and
emotional problems at an earlier age, and ensuring that they are more
conscious of how they can live, eat and exercise more healthily. We all
agree that we need to achieve a lot more than we currently
do&#151;one need only look at the figures for the obesity epidemic,
or at the one in 10 school-age children with a mental health problem
and so on. We all agree on what we want to achieve, but simply saying
that by making something statutory we can achieve a step change does
not actually achieve it. Our concern is that making PSHE a statutory
subject in the curriculum per se will not achieve that change&#151;it
all depends on how we go about
it.</div>

Loughton:</b> Right at the beginning, I made it absolutely
clear that this was about the way in which, and the imagination with
which, PSHE is taught, and about how it engages children to ensure that
they learn more and that they want to learn. We do not necessarily
achieve that just by making it a statutory subject. In these probing
amendments, I am trying to get at why the Minister thinks that the act
of making something a statutory subject will automatically lead to a
step change, in her words, that will improve quality in all subjects,
which is what we all
want.</div><a name="1002033000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have taken a slightly more analytical role. We are not saying that PSHE
should not be taught. Of course it should be taught, but there are many
ways of doing that. We heard a very good example during the witness
stage when John McIntosh, I believe, alluded to the British Museum
series that is currently on Radio 4, which was mentioned earlier. It is
a brilliant series about the history of the world in 100 objects.
Having listened to some of the programmes, I invested in an iPod so
that I could download them all and listen to the whole
lot.</div><a name="1002033000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
15-minute programme about a paleolithic hand axe from the 14th
millennium BC can teach a whole range of subjects: eating; how our
ancestors used tools; and how those tools influenced their living
habits, grazing habits, and lifestyle. The programme discussed
geography and changes in the climate that affected the lifestyle of
those people. It dealt with a whole load of subjects, all within the
analysis of one lump of old
flint&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div><a name="1002033000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000834"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> You can learn such a lot from
it.</div><a name="1002033000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000835"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> That is entirely the point, because it is not
the object in itself that teaches people, but what you do with
it.</div><a name="1002033000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000836"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> While this is interesting&#151;the hon.
Gentleman was about to say what you do with it&#151;it is important
to recognise that by making PSHE statutory we are not saying,
&#147;That&#146;s it, everything will be fine from now on.&#148;
Having a statutory programme of what we expect to be taught in PSHE
will give schools the focus to ensure that they deliver the skills and
knowledge that we want our young people to
have.</div><a name="1002033000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
I did not mention bringing in experts. I went to see a class in a
Catholic primary school in south London where PSHE is taught
effectively. The school brought in a local GP and an expert who worked
with young children to address how bodies change as a baby becomes an
old man. The children had a basket of underwear, and they picked up
various items of underwear and talked through who they thought would
wear
them.</div><a name="1002033000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in that we need to be imaginative
and we need to use experts, but I do not think that his idea about
prescribing less than 5 per cent. is what this is about. We
need to recognise that we need to do this much better than we have in
the past, and that we need to use a variety of methods to do
that.</div><a name="1002033000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000837"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> What I want to prescribe is that schools have
maximum flexibility to teach PSHE as imaginatively and effectively as
they wish. To return to my analogy, it is not the lump of stone that
matters, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>the explanation to the children, and the way in which their imagination
is fired so that they want to listen and learn more as a
result.</div><a name="1002033000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister gave an excellent example, and I am sure that all of us have
come across others. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton and I are patrons of Life Education Centres,
which is a charity that takes its mobile classrooms to schools to teach
kids in an imaginative way about problems with smoking and drugs, and
about healthy eating. It uses a high-technology classroom and some
really inspiring teachers, and gets a very different result and
reaction from the children than might have been achieved with the same
old teacher in the same old classroom teaching PSHE as one of the
statutory
subjects.</div><a name="1002033000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not saying that PSHE should not be taught. Of course it should be
taught, but it needs to be taught much better. We are saying not that
it should not be part of the curriculum, but that schools should have
much greater freedom to be able to inspire their kids in the way in
which they think is best to get the results that we all
want.</div><a name="1002033000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
comes down to quality. Simply putting a subject on the curriculum in
this raw way will not on its own lead to the results that the Minister
seems to think will automatically be
achieved.</div><a name="1002033000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000838"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I do not think anybody believes that just putting
something on the curriculum produces results in and of itself, which is
why we need other mechanisms to ensure that delivery actually happens.
Is the hon. Gentleman saying that making this statutory is harmful to
the prospects of delivering PSHE, particularly sex and relationships
education? If that is the case, what is his alternative? I asked him
that question before and he did not answer
it.</div><a name="1002033000682"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div>
<a name="1002033000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000839"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I started off by saying that something has to
give, because there is a finite amount of time in a school day to teach
the things that we want our children to learn. Simply introducing a
more regimented requirement in relation to how we teach PSHE and all
the things in this list that go with it must have an impact on what the
school is teaching in the rest of school time to everybody else. This
is the Government&#146;s own policy. Again, I note that, according to
Ministers,</div>
<a name="1002033000650"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Recent
curriculum developments have been aimed at reducing the statutory core
and allowing schools even more autonomy to organise their
curriculum.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 3 November 2008;
Vol. 482, c.
185W.]</div><a name="1002033000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
stated by a DCSF Minister. Making PSHE a statutory subject in that
respect would appear to be a step in the opposite direction. That is
the point we are making.</div>
<a name="1002033000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
something of a debate, but we must go a lot further to reassure people
about what we are going to achieve. Will the Minister say how the
simple act of giving PSHE a higher profile and greater weight within
the school day, and prescribing it for schools to follow, will improve
the quality of the teaching? At the end of the day, the quality of the
teaching will make the difference, and that is what we are trying to
get
at.</div><a name="1002033000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is all too easy just to bung the subject on the curriculum and tick the
box, but that will not achieve the outcomes that I think we all want to
achieve for our  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>children. Having said that, I do not want to take up the
Committee&#146;s time any further, so given the Minister&#146;s
reassurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000371"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000840"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I beg to move amendment 76, in
clause 11, page 13, line 12, leave
out
&#145;modern&#146;.</div><a name="1002033000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal with amendment 76 quickly because a dinner break beckons. We
tabled this probing amendment because one of the subjects that the Bill
provides that schools will have to follow is &#147;a modern foreign
language&#148;, and we are purely querying why that is set out in
clause 11(1). By proposing to take out the word
&#147;modern,&#148; I am asking whether the Minister thinks a
classical language&#151;be it Latin or Greek&#151;would hold the
same weight as the modern foreign language that she wants to be taught
to our children. Hence, this is a probing amendment to establish her
views on Latin or other similar subjects that are not classified as
&#147;modern&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000841"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Perhaps I ought to start by paying tribute to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s creativity in moving the amendment in the
middle of our debate on
PSHE.</div><a name="1002033000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would change what constitutes a language for the purposes of
the curriculum at key stage 3. The study of modern foreign languages
has been statutory at key stage 3 since the inception of the national
curriculum. Until the implementation of the new secondary curriculum in
2008, schools had to teach a working language of the European Union
before offering any other language, so a school could not just teach
Chinese, for example.</div>
<a name="1002033000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the revised
secondary curriculum, schools no longer have to teach a working
language of the European Union before offering any other language.
Instead, their teaching of a modern foreign language may include major
European or world languages, such as Arabic, French, German, Italian,
Japanese, Mandarin and so on. The list is not closed, so schools may
make their choice on the basis of supply and demand in their area.
Importantly, the programme of study for modern foreign languages
contains requirements for inter-cultural understanding, which are met
by communicating in the target language with speakers of that language,
including native speakers where possible, and studying similarities and
contrasts between the cultures of different countries, including our
own. These requirements could not properly be covered if the language
taught&#151;Latin, for example&#151;was not spoken by a
contemporary
culture.</div><a name="1002033000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000842"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Is the Minister aware that in a remote part of
Albania there is a group of people who still speak a form of
Latin?</div>
<a name="1002033000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000843"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am delighted to hear that. I did not know, so I
thank the hon. Gentleman for that information. The key point is that
the languages taught in mainstream schools are ones that allow children
and young people to interact with different cultures, talk to people
and spend time in the relevant countries. However, there is nothing to
stop schools from teaching Latin or Greek, if they wish. I urge the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw  the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000844"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am glad I have taught the Minister something
about the fascinating group of people called the Vlachs. I do not want
to pursue the matter further, however, so I am happy to accept what she
said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000846"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Betts. I cannot
be the only Member to have noticed that we are on clause 11 of a Bill
that has 50 clauses, including many controversial clauses that people
outside this place will expect us to scrutinise properly. Have you had
any suggestions from the Government or the usual channels that there
should be some attempt to modify the programme order, so that the
Committee can discharge its
responsibilities?</div><a name="1002033000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000847"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have not had any representations, but my
understanding is that if the Committee was to have gone through the
procedure of modifying the motion passed in the House, it would have to
have done so before now. As things stand, we are bound by the decision
of the House that we have to finish at 5 pm on
Thursday.</div><a name="1002033000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000848"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Betts. Would it be possible for the Government to bring forward a
motion on the Floor of the House tomorrow to extend the period beyond 5
pm on
Thursday?</div><a name="1002033000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000849"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I understand that if the Government were to give
notice of that today, that could be done, but that is a matter for the
Government, not for
me.</div><a name="1002033000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000850"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Betts. This is
on another matter. I have put on the Table some examples of the report
card, which members of the Committee may wish to look at. That refers
to clause 20. It never occurred to me before that it would be useful to
do that, so I apologise for not doing so before. It does not make any
real difference, but people may find the examples
interesting.</div><a name="1002033000389"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000851"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000854"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Duly refreshed by supper, we are now dealing
with further parts of PSHE. These are probing amendments. We are trying
a slightly different tack here. We have bunged everything into them to
test the Government&#146;s determination and where they are going on
this. On the basis that the Government are clearly determined to keep
PSHE as a statutory subject in the Bill, the aim of the amendments is
to give schools, governors and heads of schools more discretion in how
they teach it; we are trying to be as unprescriptive as
possible.</div>
<a name="1002033000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 78
would therefore change &#147;shall&#148; to
&#147;may&#148;&#151;a favourite amendment of Public Bill
Committees. Basically, subsection (4) of clause 11 would state that
PSHE &#147;may comprise&#148; the seven categories that are listed.
It would be up to schools what emphasis they placed on certain criteria
in the list, what other aspects they thought should be included in
PSHE, and how best to teach the subject as an integrated part of any
new or existing subjects. The amendment is quite straightforward and
gives schools greater discretion to decide how they can most
effectively teach PSHE to their pupils, given that they will have to
teach
it.</div><a name="1002033000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second amendment&#151;amendment 57&#151;seeks clear clarification
from the Minister on why she thinks that proposed new subsection (2) is
necessary. This is one of those Henry VIII clauses that give enormous
powers to the Secretary of State. Whatever we decide in Committee,
whatever the eventual Act looks like, whichever parts of these
components end up in the legislation, the Secretary of State can change
it all. The Secretary of State, of whatever political persuasion, can
all of a sudden decide on a whim that education about alcohol, tobacco
and other drugs, and education about emotional health and well-being
should not be a requirement. Those provisions would then drop off, be
replaced with other things or be amended in another
way.</div><a name="1002033000685"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15
pm</div><a name="1002033000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
a lot of thought has gone into what the Government say that PSHE should
consist of, and the headings are quite broad, so the Government need to
justify the position whereby, on a whim, all of them could be wiped out
through secondary legislation. We would appreciate some examples of how
a future Secretary of State might seek to make such changes without
further proper reference to this
House.</div><a name="1002033000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latter part of subsection (4) is an absolute minefield. I am referring
to the terminology used in some of the provisions. For example,
proposed new section 85B(5) of the Education Act 2002, relating to the
three principles of teaching PSHE to which governors and heads need to
pay close regard, states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="1002033000651"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first principle is that information presented in the course of
providing PSHE should be accurate and
balanced.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
on earth does that mean? Who will judge whether information is
balanced, let alone accurate? These are not scientific subjects that
are being taught. Certainly, emotional health and sex and relationships
are highly complex subjects, and people have different views on how, to
what age groups and to what groups of children they should be taught.
How on earth can a governing body make a case that the way in which its
school is teaching such a subject is balanced, let alone 
accurate? Again, some guidance from the Minister 
would be
helpful.</div><a name="1002033000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
we have already heard from other members of the Committee about age
appropriateness. Clearly, different children grow up at different
speeds. Different children from different ethnic backgrounds will have
a different level of education on sex and relationship matters, and on
attitudes to drink and drugs. I am sure that the hon. Member for
Keighley will have some
comments&#151;</div><a name="1002033000404"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000856"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I thought that the hon. Lady would have some
comments on that subject, and I am happy to give
way.</div><a name="1002033000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000857"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> I was just going to say that there are very
different attitudes towards homosexuality, as to whether it should,
say, be punished or
treated.</div><a name="1002033000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000858"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Absolutely, so how on earth can we devise a
system of PSHE that can be gauged to be age appropriate, let alone
balanced, for a school in the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency, of which
we have heard a lot, where there may be a predominantly Muslim
population who have come from backgrounds and homes with parents who
have very strong views on drink, sexuality and other such matters? Such
a school may be very different from a school at the other end of the
country in my constituency or the constituency of my hon. Friend the
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, or from a school in a
neighbouring constituency with a very different constituency of pupils.
It will therefore be an enormous task to try to make meaningful
regulations out of these
provisions.</div><a name="1002033000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us go to the further provisions. Under proposed new section 85B(6)(b),
PSHE has to
reflect</div><a name="1002033000652"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
reasonable range of religious, cultural and other
perspectives.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reasonableness test is always a big hurdle in these Committees. How on
earth will a Minister define a reasonable range of religious, cultural
and other perspectives? Should that just be the mainstream religions?
Should it reflect the religions that are represented in a particular
school, even if they are not the mainstream religions that form the
majority of religions in the country? Again, it is a
minefield.</div><a name="1002033000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 85B(7)
states:</div><a name="1002033000653"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
third principle is that PSHE should be taught in a way
that&#151;</div><a name="1002033000654"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
endeavours to promote
equality&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
what on earth does that mean? If there is a phalanx of pupils who
clearly do not appreciate the merits of equality, but the school has
done its darnedest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>to teach them those merits, is that good enough, even though the school
has clearly failed and something is wrong with the
system?</div><a name="1002033000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second consideration in that principle is to encourage
&#147;acceptance of diversity&#148;. People in this Committee would
come up with many different definitions of diversity and different
ideas about how we could accept it. It is a sensitive area that is
fraught with all sorts of problems. Our constituencies are made up of
all sorts of different communities that have different perspectives.
One would hope that the majority of parents take a close interest in
what their children are being taught at school. That is particularly
true of children from close family backgrounds and certain religious
communities where they have a strict
upbringing.</div><a name="1002033000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will impose a lot of arbitrary and highly subjective judgments
on whether a school is promoting PSHE in the best way. We are removing
the rights of parents to withdraw their children from exposure to this
sort of PSHE to a certain degree, because it is becoming a statutory
curriculum subject. We will also greatly diminish parents&#146; right
to withdraw their children from sex and relationship education, which
we will come
to.</div><a name="1002033000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
discussing an earlier group of amendments, I stated the principle that
the choices of parents must feature more heavily than they appear to
feature in the Bill. I have always followed the philosophy, including
over the many years that I have been shadow Minister for Children, that
in the vast majority of cases, the people who know what is best for
children and what is in the interests of their welfare are their
parents. We are taking away some of the powers of parents to make
decisions about what is best for their children in an educational
context. In so doing, we must be assured that what we are putting in
place of that, and what we are subjecting children to with a degree of
compulsion, is absolutely in their best interests. That point goes back
to the paramountcy of the welfare of the child set out in the Children
Act
1989.</div><a name="1002033000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are doing must be clearly defined, so that the benefits are clear to
all. The clause is pretty mushy. It is full of subjective judgments
that have to be made and contains pretty subjective and undefined
language. That is why I would like to hear how the Minister intends the
law to work in practice. On paper, it may sound fair game, but in
practice it is a
minefield.</div><a name="1002033000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final amendment in the group, amendment 60, again refers to the powers
of the Secretary of State. I do not think that I have seen a clause
before quite like this one. It empowers the Secretary of State to issue
guidance, which is perfectly reasonable. The governors or the head
teacher will have to &#147;have regard to&#148; that guidance. We
could have a whole debate about what &#147;have regard to&#148;
means, and about how compulsory that is. However, they not only have to
have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State, whom we can hold
to account in this House, whoever he or she may be. The guidance could
also be issued
by</div><a name="1002033000655"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person nominated by the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
might not be able to hold that person to account. They might not appear
before parliamentary Committees, such as the Children, Schools and
Families Committee. They might not be beholden to the people in this
House, who make laws such as those that we are debating. It would be
useful if the Minister gave us some examples 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>of the sort of people she thinks will act in loco of the Secretary of
State, as they will be responsible for changing all sorts of guidance,
potentially relating to some sensitive subjects, for some vulnerable
young people and for many parents who will be concerned.</div>
<a name="1002033000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents have
written to us with their concerns about how their children might be
exposed to some of those changes. One parent who wrote to me
stated:</div>
<a name="1002033000656"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a school gains consent and cooperation from parents, it preserves the
community values, rather than imposing materials and topics with
ideological issues
attached.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
parent&#146;s view&#151;I have some sympathy with it&#151;is that
if we can gain consensus, we can encourage parents to feel part of what
their children are being taught in sensitive areas, without removing
their power to withdraw their children from certain aspects that they
do not like. If we consult fully with them, we are likely to get a much
more effective way of teaching the disciplines of PSHE to a much more
responsive audience, and so a much better-informed set of pupils will
have been exposed to it.</div>
<a name="1002033000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are our
probing amendments. There are many details missing to which the
Minister must now turn her attention. I worry greatly that the highly
subjective and rather mushy language used in the clause will not
survive being put into
practice.</div><a name="1002033000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000859"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> I will deal with amendments 249 to 251, which
relate to proposed new section 85B(5), (6) and (7), as set out in
clause 11(4). My first point is on the question of balance. I agree
with the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham on that matter. It
leaves so many openings for propagandising almost anything someone
might want to say.</div>
<a name="1002033000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (1)(a) to (g), which sets out what will be taught, includes
&#147;economic education&#148;. Some of us could do a splendid job
of saying how wonderful Keynes was, and no doubt others could put the
opposite point of view. That would be no more balanced than anything
else that could be thrown into an economics lecture. Economists, of
course, are known for saying, &#147;On the one hand this, and on the
one hand that&#148;, but I suspect that someone teaching that part of
the curriculum would be unlikely to have a detailed knowledge of
economics. That could get a little more serious in some schools,
particularly faith schools and academies that are run by people with
fundamentalist beliefs. They might want to teach intelligent design and
tell us that the world has existed only for 6,000 years and that all
that business about evolution is so much nonsense. That word
&#147;balanced&#148; gives the opportunity to bring in any crazy
notion that a teacher or  school might feel inclined to give
vent to, and that is extremely
concerning.</div><a name="1002033000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
paragraph would be made entirely acceptable by removing &#147;and
balanced&#148; and relying on the word &#147;accurate&#148;. I
believe that all of those subjects can be taught with accuracy,
particularly those relating to physiology and biology. Those are
matters of fact and not about balance. They are the things that make us
human and give us a common grounding. It seems  to me that
talking of balance in those circumstances is
nonsense.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 407</div><a name="1002033000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">Education about
personal finance is also listed, but again, what has balance got to do
with that? It is perfectly feasible to teach finance, physical activity
and sex and relationships education on the basis of evidence, accuracy
and facts. I will dwell no longer on that point. I think that the
clause would be improved enormously by the removal of the words
&#147;and
balanced&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000686"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30
pm</div><a name="1002033000425"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000860"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton:</b> I am following carefully what the hon. Gentleman is
saying. On financial education, does he agree with the fact that it
would be better for children to invest in shares than to put their
money in a building society&#151;a fact based on actuarial evidence?
Would he be happy with that sort of
fact?</div><a name="1002033000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000861"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> I would be entirely happy for a teacher to
explain the savings principle and the number of vehicles that a person
can use to save, explaining risks along the way in each of those
different saving opportunities. Provided that we are not on a mission,
it is perfectly easy to teach such matters in a factual and accurate
way by giving information that is already in textbooks and in the
public
domain.</div><a name="1002033000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for proposed new subsection (6), the second principle is that PSHE
should be taught in a way
that</div><a name="1002033000657"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
appropriate to the ages of the
pupils&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
should almost go without being written down. It beggars belief that
someone could not recognise a class of five-year-olds from a class of
17-year-olds. That provision is a bit unnecessary, but the rest of the
subsection is a travesty. As for &#147;religious and cultural
backgrounds&#148;, when it comes to economics, individual safety,
physiology and biology, that is a sop to those who have come to the
Government and said that they do not like it. It is the language of
obfuscation. It is along the lines of, &#147;Let&#146;s not really
talk about these things at all. It&#146;s not very nice, you
know.&#148;</div>
<a name="1002033000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have actually listened to the voices that have dominated not only
sexual education, but education for two centuries. It is now time to
recognise that there are some straightforward ways in which to do
things that will enlighten young people and allow them to live their
lives hopefully to the full extent, so on and so forth. The
provision</div><a name="1002033000658"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
reasonable range of religious, cultural and other
perspectives&#148;</div><a name="1002033000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
not at all necessary. What does it mean? Does it include scientology?
Can we call in Doris Day and Tom Cruise to give us a lecture? It is
absolute nonsense. I fail to recognise that when teaching basic biology
there is much of a cultural bias to be taken into account. For even a
semi-enlightened group of people, the provision will have to go. It is
an insult to modernity. It must go out of the
way.</div><a name="1002033000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause goes on to say
that</div><a name="1002033000659"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
third principle is that PSHE should be taught in a way
that...endeavours to promote
equality&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree, but &#147;should&#148; is simply not enough. There will be
schools, especially those owned by individuals who allegedly intended
to put up a couple of million quid, but the money never left their
backside pockets. They will have religious fundamentalism on the brain.
We even have the Pope now telling us that he does not like our
equality. What on earth does it have to do with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>Pope? Why is he not dealing with the spiritual for his flock and leaving
the rest of us to get on with our lives in an equal and proper way?
That is the sort of thing that we could expect unless we state that the
subject &#147;must&#148; be done. I checked, as I thought that
&#147;should&#148; would mean to most people that they ought to get
on and do it. According to the lawyers, it does not mean that. If we
have to have PSHE taught in that way, it &#147;must&#148; be
taught. With those few words, I endorse amendments 249 and
251.</div><a name="1002033000433"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000862"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> This group of amendments is dealing with the
content of statutory PSHE and the principles underpinning it. In
particular, amendment 57 would prevent the Secretary of State from
being able to amend the content of statutory PSHE in proposed new
section 85B by order. Amendment 60 would prevent the
Secretary of State from asking other organisations to issue guidance on
his
behalf.</div><a name="1002033000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
78 seeks to make the contents of the programme of PSHE optional. One
clear consequence would be that that would leave the content of PSHE
undetermined and would in fact permit the Secretary of State more
discretion, not less, in determining its actual content. It might also
be intended to give schools the right to determine for themselves what
should constitute PSHE, if taken with some of the other amendments
tabled by the same hon. Members. By extension, amendment 79 seeks to
prevent the Secretary of State from imposing any principles that
underpin and safeguard the teaching of all aspects of PSHE.</div>
<a name="1002033000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 57
would prevent the Secretary of State from using secondary legislation
to amend any definition of PSHE, so that any further change would
necessitate primary legislation. It is unfortunate that PSHE as a
subject has often been defined in the media solely in terms of the more
sensitive issues it explores, such as  sex and relationships,
drug use and misuse, and now debt. That may create the impression that
PSHE education is simply a patchwork quilt of disconnected topics, with
teaching focused solely on content and the transmission of information.
More broadly, it helps young people to understand themselves, their
relationships, the situations, opportunities, choices and experiences
that they are likely to encounter now and in the future so that they
can be safe, healthy and economically secure. However, its content may
well change over time, as the topics that are relevant to young people
change. For example, the economic element is new. A definition of PSHE
five years ago would not have mentioned that, whereas now it is
accepted by all sides that we were right to introduce it. Things will
change and the amendment would make it harder, rather than easier, to
reflect that reality.</div>
<a name="1002033000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond
directly to the point raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham, the power to amend the content of PSHE is an order-making
power, which is subject to an affirmative resolution procedure through
Parliament. Therefore, it could not be changed on a whim, and those
clauses are inserted into part 6 of the Education Act 2002. I hope that
that will provide some reassurance.</div>
<a name="1002033000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 78
would make the contents of PSHE more fluid and allow schools or, in
another interpretation, the Secretary of State greater discretion to
amend the constituent parts. We all appreciate that PSHE is a complex
area of learning. Unlike some of the more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>traditional curriculum subjects, its components are many and varied. It
is a fluid subject that needs to reflect and meet the expectations of
children and young people as they face the challenges of adult life.
Effective PSHE education equips children and young people with the core
knowledge, understanding, attitudes and practical skills to live
healthy, safe, productive and fulfilled lives. It is those that are
reflected in the Bill&#146;s provisions, which the amendment would
change. Therefore, we have concluded that it is essential for all
children and young people to have an entitlement to a common core of
knowledge, skills and understanding in PSHE education. The depth and
range of the learning experience should no longer be determined solely
by individual schools and teachers. I should, of course, make it clear
that having a definition of PSHE is quite different from telling
schools and teachers how the different components should be taught.
While we say that, for example, personal finance must be covered and
set out key elements of that in the more detailed programme of study,
it remains absolutely a matter for schools to determine detailed
content and teaching methods, so long as those are consistent with the
principles of balance set out in the Bill.</div>
<a name="1002033000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
address the group of amendments that deal specifically with the
principles governing the delivery of PSHE in the classroom, I would
like the opportunity to speak to amendment 60, which seeks to prevent
the Secretary of State from asking another organisation, or
individuals, to issue guidance on PSHE on his behalf, to which a local
authority governing body or head teacher must have regard. I accept
that for the most part, stakeholders will look to the Secretary of
State as the source of guidance. Indeed, such guidance already exists:
for example, we published updated guidance on sex and relationship
education last week.</div>
<a name="1002033000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
suppose for a moment that the Secretary of State might occasionally
take the view that guidance would best come from somewhere
else&#151;a panel of experts on personal finance, for example, or an
expert with views on drugs. The amendment would not permit that and it
would prevent organisations such as the Qualifications and Curriculum
Development Agency from issuing guidance on the Secretary of
State&#146;s behalf. It is surely right to think that that might
happen at  some
point.</div><a name="1002033000440"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000863"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> What confuses me is that neither the Minister
nor we expect the Secretary of State to come up with all the ideas
about what should be in the PSHE guidance; he or she will be advised by
experts. However, we do not expect the experts to be the final arbiters
and signers-off of the changes that will be imposed on schools. Surely
their advice must be given to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of
State should then issue guidance and be accountable for that decision
to the House, not to some anonymous bunch of
financiers.</div><a name="1002033000441"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000864"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I was using personal finance as a concrete
example of how expert advice and guidance might be useful. The
flexibility in the provisions will allow the Secretary of State to draw
from experience and knowledge in the widest possible sense. I also
referred to a panel of experts on drugs, who might bring with them the
respect of a community dealing with drugs when proposing what issues
need to be addressed in schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div><a name="1002033000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">To move on to
the group of amendments dealing specifically with the principles that
would govern the delivery of PSHE in the classroom, as the hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham said, the schools doing PSHE best at the
moment are already engaging with parents and explaining exactly what
will be taught. I know that some schools provide worksheets, especially
on sex and relationship issues, so work can be taken home at the end of
a PSHE lesson and parents can understand and engage fully with that
part of PSHE. Engaging with parents is absolutely the right thing to
do. Schools and parents should work in partnership to ensure that PSHE
is delivered in the best possible
way.</div><a name="1002033000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
79 would remove the principles underpinning the teaching of PSHE. It is
particularly important for statutory PSHE that we provide clear and
consistent messages, which need to be underpinned  by a clear
definition of both PSHE and how it can be taught. We consider it
important to embrace a number of key principles that we think should
underpin the teaching elements of statutory PSHE, all of which are
equally
valid.</div><a name="1002033000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
responses to our consultation on PSHE revealed concerns that some
protection was needed against inappropriate and unbalanced teaching,
particularly on some of the more emotive elements. It is vital that the
teaching be factually accurate, as the first principle requires, but at
the same time it is important that we recognise the particular
religious and cultural backgrounds of pupils and schools without
ignoring the wider religious and cultural make-up of the nation as a
whole. The principles strike that balance.</div>
<a name="1002033000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle
of requiring PSHE to be taught in a way that promotes

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000865"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> Will the Minister give me an example of balance?
Incidentally, on a point of order, Mr. Betts, I need the
microphones turned up. When the Minister speaks in that way, I can
scarcely hear what is being said. Is it possible to do that? I do not
think that I am the only 70-year-old in the room, but I need them
turned up a
bit.</div><a name="1002033000447"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000866"></a>The

up.</div><a name="1002033000448"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000867"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am sorry; it might be my voice. I have a bad
cold as
well.</div><a name="1002033000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example that I think it is useful to give involves marriage, civil
partnerships and how a faith school might teach about marriage. It
might say that marriage and bringing up a family is seen as important
in terms of the faith. However, to get balance, the school would also
have to talk about civil partnerships and recognise that in society, we
have civil partnerships and that there are legal protections for civil
partners. That is the kind of
perspective.</div><a name="1002033000687"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div>
<a name="1002033000450"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000868"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> That is not balance; it is simply stating that
there is more than one way for two people to enjoy their lives
together. What is the problem here? There is no balance in that. Are we
taking the view that marriage is much more important than a
partnership? I hope not, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>because if we are, we are probably offending other legislation that we
are trying to bring through this place right
now.</div><a name="1002033000451"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000869"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I was trying to give an example of where balance
could be given within PSHE. Faith schools have certain beliefs about
marriage and homosexuality, as we have already discussed in this
Committee. It is important that we recognise that balance is given when
we teach PSHE. Obviously, my hon. Friend will not agree with me on this
point. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I will try harder. The
principles require PSHE to be taught in a way that promotes equality,
encourages the acceptance of diversity and emphasises the importance of
both rights and responsibilities. We seek to strike an appropriate
balance. Removing them would remove some safeguards and assurances that
parents and pupils have on the teaching of the subject, which many
schools are already doing very well.</div>
<a name="1002033000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 249
would remove the requirement in the first principle for schools and
governing bodies to ensure that the information presented in the course
of providing PSHE is done so in a balanced way; we were just having
that discussion. I did not agree with the comments that my hon. Friend
the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East made earlier on. Balance is a
key element of the first principle, which has been designed to underpin
and safeguard teaching of all aspects of PSHE. It is vital that the
teaching is not only factually accurate but delivered in a balanced
way. The principle of requiring PSHE to be taught in a way that is not
only accurate but balanced will allow children and young people to
approach issues and topics in an objective way, thereby encouraging
them to consider not only their attitudes and values, but acknowledge
and reflect on those of others and the wider society. I am sure that my
hon. Friend will agree that children and young people need to be given
the opportunity to reflect on contrasting experiences, where they are
able to appreciate fully a more holistic and arguably more inclusive
view of the environment in which they live, which will help them
prepare for the challenges that they will inevitably face in their
later years. If schools were to present children and young people with
a myopic or distorted view of real life issues and topics&#151;such
as the realities of drug use and their implications&#151;we would be
depriving them of the wide range of skills and knowledge that will help
them to prepare for all the challenges, opportunities and
responsibilities that they are likely to face in later life.</div>
<a name="1002033000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 250
would remove the second principle, which states
that</div><a name="1002033000660"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;PSHE
should be taught in a way
that&#151;</div><a name="1002033000661"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000870"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> If we are going to apply it to reflect cultural and
religious backgrounds, I do not want to hear in any school in my
constituency the view that sharia law should apply to homosexuals and
people who are having same-sex relationships. I am dealing with that
sort of thing. Young homosexual men who have been forced into a
marriage come to me, and I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>having to deal with the consequences. I do not want to hear such views
being put out through the schools as well because it would start to
defeat
me.</div><a name="1002033000456"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000871"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I want to reassure my hon. Friend. If she looks
at the third principle set out in clause 11, it is clear
that</div><a name="1002033000663"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;PSHE
should be taught in a way
that&#151;</div><a name="1002033000664"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000872"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Surely it should also be talking about the context
of the law of this
country.</div><a name="1002033000458"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000873"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Of course. The law of this country is important.
I imagine that it would crop up in PSHE on a number of occasions; for
instance, there would be a full discussion about the law in drugs
education and about the age of consent and rape in sex and relationship
education. There are all sorts of ways that the law of the land would
be raised and discussed with young people.</div>
<a name="1002033000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">To carry on
with amendment 250, it is vital that we recognise that pupils come from
particular religious and cultural backgrounds, while not ignoring the
wider religious and cultural make-up of the nation as a whole. No one
would disagree that teaching needs to be appropriate to the age of the
child, but it must also reflect the range of values and beliefs of
pupils and expose them to the values and beliefs of others, not least
for the purpose of examining and exploring their own
views.</div><a name="1002033000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
today&#146;s society, children and young people are very interested
in the religious and cultural frameworks that bind them together, and
the benefits of that need to be reflected and reinforced in the
classroom. Pupils often welcome opportunities to talk about issues on
which people have strong views&#151;about religion, culture and other
perspectives&#151;free from the bias and prejudice that has afflicted
society negatively. It is important to remember that talking in a
balanced way about differences in opinion does not promote one set of
views over another, or mean that one agrees with a particular view.
Part of exploring and understanding cultural, religious and other views
is finding out that people can agree to disagree. That principle, in
particular, underpins and fills an absence in some schools where the
make-up has not reflected the community.</div>
<a name="1002033000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">PSHE education
covers a range of important issues and, in doing so, helps pupils to
prepare for the challenges of later life. Those issues are sometimes
sensitive, can provoke strong feelings and give rise to a range of
views. For PSHE education to be effective, it needs both parents and
pupils to be assured that it will not be delivered in a dogmatic,
unbalanced or inappropriate way, but in a way that respects and
reflects the range of views and beliefs that exist. We believe that
those principles, enshrined in legislation, provide an important
safeguard that will provide that confidence, while allowing pupils to
receive accurate information about important topics.</div>
<a name="1002033000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 251
would make teaching in accordance with the third principle mandatory.
It
states:</div><a name="1002033000667"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;PSHE
should be taught in a way that...endeavours to promote
equality,...encourages acceptance of diversity,
and...emphasises the importance of both rights and
responsibilities.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div><a name="1002033000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment suggested
by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East is
unnecessary. Although the principles underpinning the teaching of PSHE
are expressed as things that schools, governing bodies and head
teachers should do, that stems only from the fact that they are
expressed as principles. My hon. Friend will see that proposed new
subsection (4) imposes a duty on the governing body and head teacher to
secure that the principles are complied with. Therefore, there is
already an obligation at the level he
wants.</div>
<a name="1002033000464"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000874"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Is my hon. Friend sure that proposed new
subsection (6)(a) could not be used by a parent who was concerned that
gay or non-marital relationships were being talked about in class? It
states:</div><a name="1002033000668"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;PSHE
should be taught in a way that...is appropriate to their
religious...backgrounds.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could
parents use that subsection to say that their children should not be
taught something that is inappropriate to their religious background? I
fear that such phrases open up the possibility of schools being sued by
people with strong religious beliefs on the grounds that their children
are being taught about things that may be factual, but which they
consider inappropriate to their religious
background.</div>
<a name="1002033000466"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000875"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> My hon. Friend might be right if the subsection
was taken out of context, but it is the second of three principles. It
has to be seen alongside the first principle, about accuracy and
balance, and the third principle, which is about promoting equality,
encouraging acceptance of diversity and emphasising the importance of
both rights and responsibilities. Under the second
principle&#151;proposed new subsection (6) (b)&#151;PSHE must
reflect</div><a name="1002033000669"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
reasonable range of religious, cultural and other
perspectives.&#148;</div><a name="1002033000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that a school would not be able to say, for instance
on homosexuality, &#147;We are not going to discuss it, because our
religion does not accept that it exists, or we see it as absolutely
wrong&#148;.</div><a name="1002033000468"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000876"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point, but if
proposed new subsection 6(a) can be overridden by appealing to the
principle in clause 5 or proposed new subsection 6(b), what function
does it
serve?</div><a name="1002033000469"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000877"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Perhaps it would be helpful to say that it is not
what is taught but the way it is taught that can reflect cultural and
religious views. I do not know if that helps my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="1002033000470"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000878"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> That confused me even more. I wondered about the
way that something is taught. At a banal level, the way something is
taught is completely separate from what is taught. Surely, this can
only make sense if we are talking about what is being
taught.</div><a name="1002033000471"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000879"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> It might help my hon. Friend if I say that facts
can be taught as facts, but have to be clearly distinguished from
beliefs or doctrines of faith. They have to be taught separately. Facts
are taught as facts; beliefs and the views of the faith school would be
taught as, &#147;This is what the Church believes or what my
particular religion believes.&#148; I do not know if that helps.
Perhaps we can come back to that point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div><a name="1002033000472"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000880"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The Minister is confusing facts and opinions.
The proposed new subsection 6(a) principle is about being appropriate
to the age. A fact is a fact, whatever the age of the person. A fact to
do with sex and sexual encounters is a fact, whether one is six,
16  or 96. This is
rubbish.</div>
<a name="1002033000473"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000881"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I do not accept that it is rubbish. What one
teaches a five-year-old in a primary school about relationships is
different from what one would teach a 15-year-old in secondary school
about sex and relationships. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147; Facts!&#148;] I do not accept that. Hon. Members are
assuming that all facts are taught to all ages. There are facts taught
to five-year-olds, and  other facts taught to 15-year-olds. For
instance, one would not teach a five-year-old about
contraception&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> That is a
fact. One would teach that  at 15. Contraception
exists.</div><a name="1002033000474"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002033000882"></a><b class="B">Bill
Wiggin</b> (Leominster) (Con): One wouldn&#146;t lie about
it
either.</div><a name="1002033000475"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000883"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> No, of course not. We are getting rather hung up
on this. The idea is that whatever is appropriate for a particular age
group within the school, the facts are
relayed&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="1002033000476"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000884"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps we could have fewer sedentary
interventions.</div><a name="1002033000477"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000885"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Religious and cultural beliefs are part of that
context. Perhaps we need to come back to this, but to me it seems quite
clear.</div><a name="1002033000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I reiterate that the provision is about promoting equality,
inclusion and acceptance of diversity. PSHE should promote awareness,
respect and understanding for the wide range of practices and beliefs
that exist in our society. Personal identities and diversity are two of
the key concepts in the national curriculum programme study for PSHE
education&#151;personal well-being at key stage 3 and 4. PSHE should
support pupils to value differences between people, to challenge
stereotypes and to understand the world around them. The effect of all
the amendments would be to remove that protection, and would damage
rather than improve the confidence of parents that their children are
receiving effective and balanced PSHE education.</div>
<a name="1002033000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many elements
of PSHE raise contradictory views. However, these principles will
enshrine in legislation the need for teaching to be sensitive to those
views, but at the same time provide children with accurate information
in the context of a balanced view, as well as taking into account their
background and the wishes of their parents. I urge hon. Members not to
press the
amendments.</div><a name="1002033000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
final point in relation to faith schools: it has become obvious to me
in talking to teachers and parents, that although many faith schools
already deliver very good PSHE education, there are concerns that they
should be able to deliver it, particularly the sex and relationship
component, in a way that has regard to their religious character. I
will continue to give that particular issue my consideration.</div>
<a name="1002033000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
physical and biological facts about sex are taught as part of the
science curriculum, from which there is no right of withdrawal. PSHE
will be teaching the social and emotional aspect of sex and
relationships.</div>

Loughton:</b> The Minister made great play of needing to get
the confidence of parents that what their children are being taught is
right and appropriate, but she is seriously in danger of losing the
confidence of the Committee. She read out her brief perfectly
competently and
accurately.</div><a name="1002033000688"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000887"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> As I was saying, confusion reigns after our
short debate on these amendments. The Minister read out her brief
perfectly accurately and competently. However, accurately reading out
the recipe for apple pie, does not mean that it makes apple pie good
for you or that it will cook properly. The debate has shown that the
clause is pretty half baked. The fact that she had many legitimate
queries about the possible implications and legal challenges that could
face schools shows that the clauses have not been thought through
properly. I fear that she has been confusing facts with beliefs and
subjective notions, which is inevitable when we are dealing with this
sort of
subject.</div><a name="1002033000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East had a bit of a tirade against
the Pope. It was reminiscent of one of his predecessors in a
Wolverhampton constituency, Enoch Powell, who expressed some views
about the authority of the Pope back in 1982. But they are not facts.
He asked what the Equality Bill had to do with the Pope. I have some
sympathy with that opinion, but it does not make it a fact; it is an
opinion. The way that we deal with most of what we are discussing here
today is subjective, discretionary and subject to opinions and there
will be contrasting opinions within the same community, within the same
body of teachers and within the same body of parents.</div>
<a name="1002033000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that
the Minister said that at the moment sex education is only dealt with
on a compulsory basis through the science curriculum and is based
purely on facts suggests that everything else we will add to it will
not be facts. It is subjective stuff, particularly around
relationships. When is a relationship suitable or appropriate for a
14-year-old girl, for a 15-year-old Muslim girl, for a much more mature
12-year-old girl or whatever? That is all subjective; it is not a fact.
How an individual has developed physically might be a fact, but as to
what it is appropriate to teach that pupil about the sort of
relationship it will be right, proper, suitable or appropriate to
engage in is not a
fact.</div><a name="1002033000488"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000888"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I want to make it clear that what I said was that
the physical, biological facts are taught as part of the science
curriculum.</div><a name="1002033000489"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000889"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I was not disputing that.</div>
<a name="1002033000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Keighley made some pertinent points. There are some people
who will have strong views on what would be appropriate for their
children to be taught about sexuality, sexual relations, drinking,
drugs and everything. That is highly subjective and not factual. I
trust most schools already to teach the elements of PSHE sensitively
and appropriately for my children, which is why I choose the schools I
send them to and I can exercise that choice. It is up to the school to
devise the most appropriate method, and up to me to decide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>whether I think that is appropriate for my children. If it do not, I
will withdraw them, either from those lessons or from that
school.</div>
<a name="1002033000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will lose
that choice under these proposals and it changes the whole dynamic of
the relationship between the parent and the school. I am happy to trust
the school to do what is best for my children, knowing that I have the
power to do something about it if my views change. I have rather less
trust in the Secretary of State decreeing what the school should teach
my children when my power to exercise choice by opting to withdraw my
children from those lessons has been taken away. It changes the whole
dynamic.</div>
<a name="1002033000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we said
earlier, it is not really a problem now. Some 0.04 per cent. of parents
withdraw their children from sex and relationship
education&#151;around 3,000 children. There is no evidence that those
3,000 children are more likely to contract sexually transmitted
diseases or to end up as teenage pregnancy statistics. It may be the
case; it may not. There is no empirical evidence&#151;there are no
facts&#151;to suggest that those children who are being withdrawn
from that form of education in schools are any worse off for
it.</div>
<a name="1002033000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
those children would be better off having a decent sex and relationship
education, but that goes to the quality argument that I set out at the
beginning. None of the things that the Government are trying to do,
none of the things that are being imposed on schools and none of the
powers that are being taken away from parents will lead to any
improvement in what we are trying to achieve, which is a better
understanding of and sensitivity towards issues such as sex among our
children. That will not happen if, as the Youth Parliament revealed,
the quality of what is being taught to them is still poor, as it is in
too many cases because of the postcode lottery that we have
now.</div>
<a name="1002033000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">Key to all of
this discussion&#151;it would make this discussion
redundant&#151;would be improving the quality of sex education in
every school in this country. If that is not achieved, all the other
necessary elements of PSHE, which have been outlined here, albeit in a
very prescriptive way, could turn out to be
counter-productive.</div><a name="1002033000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
goes to the heart of what we are saying. I believe that the elements of
PSHE are very important. I believe that our children need to have a
grasp of those elements in a way that will benefit them most and that
will fire their desire to understand them and want to learn about them.
That will lead them to adopt healthier lifestyles, which we would
loosely agree is in their best interests.</div>
<a name="1002033000496"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000890"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I have listened carefully to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument and I wonder if he might explain his policy
further. What would he do to make PSHE much better? I ask that, because
I am failing to understand what he thinks he could do better that we
are not putting in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1002033000497"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000891"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I repeat, for the third or fourth time, that we
would improve the quality of how we teach
PSHE.</div><a name="1002033000498"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000892"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> How?</div>
<a name="1002033000499"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000893"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> By training teachers, or training experts who
are not teachers to go into schools, and by having a stronger
relationship with voluntary bodies that have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>expertise in this area, such as FPA, Life Education Centres, various
faith groups or whatever. In many cases, they can teach the subject
more imaginatively outside the classroom, in a mobile classroom or in a
different centre altogether. They can teach it in such a way that the
quality of the teaching is absolutely the identifying feature. None of
what is suggested in the  Bill guarantees, in any way, an
uplift in the quality of PSHE
teaching.</div>
<a name="1002033000500"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000894"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about using other organisations. Often, they bring something to
PSHE in their engagement with young people that teachers, who might be
doing other subjects or activities, such as marking homework or testing
for exams, might find more difficult.</div>
<a name="1002033000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am
not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. Is he suggesting
that we can just rely on that type of activity by the third sector
being provided in an ad hoc way outside of the school day and outside
of schools? I have not got anything against that idea, but it still
raises the question of the number of children who might miss out on
such teaching.</div>
<a name="1002033000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the town centre in Doncaster is not in my constituency. My constituency
is a community of mining villages and rural villages and to access
many  of services that the hon. Gentleman described, local
children have to go to Doncaster town centre. We have mobile units, but
they can still be hit and miss. At least within a school, regardless of
who is providing the teaching, we can be pretty sure that the children
are receiving the information, advice, support and facts that they
need.</div><a name="1002033000503"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000895"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Why is such provision hit and miss? The right
hon. Lady reveals that the biggest challenge that we will face if the
regulations come in is the people running the schools. Why would a
school not want to have the best quality PSHE, including sex education,
for its pupils? Surely it is in the best interests of all our pupils to
learn all the sort of things that we are trying to ensure they learn,
albeit in the rather haphazard manner set out in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1002033000504"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000896"></a>Caroline
Flint</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="1002033000599"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000897"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Hold on. Surely, the hallmark of a decent head
backed by decent governors is that they want to get the best for their
children in PSHE now, without the extra imposition that will be placed
on them. One of the reasons they do not get that is because the
curriculum is crammed full, and because of the lack of availability of
quality education in these matters. The Bill does not address that
quality deficiency.</div>
<a name="1002033000505"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000898"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I do not
suggest that the delivery of the legislation will cause an overnight
sensation. However, in its own way it can contribute to resolving one
of the problems with the current system. As far as I can see, the hon.
Gentleman seems to be arguing for the status quo. There is nothing
wrong with schools using voluntary organisations and other groups, but
evidence suggests that some of the better practice is not being
provided in a more mainstream way in our schools. Unfortunately,
schools and head 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>teachers do not have the support and resources. Making this subject
statutory will not solve all those issues, but it will go some way
towards encouraging the voluntary sector to get more involved and help
ensure that best practice is better spread and discussed. I have still
not heard from the hon. Gentleman what his alternative would be. He
seems to be arguing for the status quo.</div>
<a name="1002033000506"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000899"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am not arguing for the status quo. At the
start of the debate on the clause, I set out all the things that are
going wrong with sex education, in particular the lack of decent sex
and relationship education which one could say results in the outcomes
that we are getting in terms of teenage pregnancies, sexually
transmitted diseases and everything else. Absolutely fundamental to
that issue is the quality of what we teach, and the clause does not
address that.</div>
<a name="1002033000507"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000900"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be pleased
to hear that over the past five years, we have trained more than 2,000
teachers in the PSHE continuing professional development programme.
Through the initial teacher training opportunities, we are also looking
to train new specialist PSHE teachers to join the profession. That
would fit with the argument put forward by the hon. Gentleman about
improving quality&#151;we all want to do that, and we are starting to
do it.</div>
<a name="1002033000508"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000901"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> If those teachers inspire kids to learn this
stuff, that will be a contribution. However, that is all being done
without the Bill. The Minister has just admitted my point&#151;a real
result will be achieved by having people who know what they are doing
teaching our kids in a way that makes them want to learn. Given what
she has just said, we do not need this
provision.</div><a name="1002033000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seriously believe&#151;and the Minister&#146;s hon. Friends have
made this point to her&#151;that if we want to achieve better
learning in all those elements of PSHE about which we agree, the
clause&#146;s wording contains some potential minefields. For that
reason, the Minister should go away and think about better phrasing of
the clause, as it could turn out to be counter-productive. All sorts of
people and communities with particular agendas will start picking holes
in the Bill, and it will become a legal minefield.</div>
<a name="1002033000600"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">On
amendment 60, the Minister completely failed to address the genuine
concerns that I raised. The final line of clause 11 still allows an
expert&#151;she referred to financial experts&#151;anointed by the
Secretary of State to act in his place. That expert would be
unaccountable to any of us, could act without reference to the
Secretary of State, and would not need to have instructions, of which
schools must take regard, approved or directed through the office of
the Secretary of State. That has serious ramifications for the
accountability of the legislation. Are we to believe that a head or
governing body should take instructions from somebody such as Professor
Nutt, the adviser on the misuse of drugs? I would not want to accept
his views on drugs if I were a head or a governor. Are we to believe
that a head or a governing body should take advice on financial
education from the former chief executive of Northern Rock, rather than
the Secretary of State? I would have serious qualms about taking
instructions for my pupils from him in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>place of the Secretary of State, who can be held accountable in this
place. I see absolutely no basis for the final line of the clause,
certainly without a rider that everything has to be approved through
the Secretary of State, who is accountable to this
place.</div><a name="1002033000690"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<a name="1002033000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
gives an unelected individual huge powers to instruct schools in how to

that the Committee be invited to vote on amendment 60, when
appropriate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000917"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> On the principle that we have argued when
considering other provisions, and will continue to argue, that
academies should be exempted from the rather prescriptive regulations,
will the Minister justify both why the clause is in the Bill, given
that the Government and the Opposition are in favour of giving
academies greater autonomy and power to decide their own matters, and
why academies should not have the power to decide how they teach the
various aspects of PSHE that we have
debated?</div><a name="1002033000535"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000918"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Clause 12 provides that for the first time,
academies will be under a duty to offer the full national curriculum
programmes of study in PSHE at key stages 3 and 4. It applies the
programme of study and the principles by which it must be taught to
academies, so that the system applies to them, just as it does to
maintained schools. Academies must also have regard to any guidance
issued by the Secretary of State.</div>

school they attend. Academies already teach PSHE in imaginative ways,
but putting it on a more formal footing will ensure that all schools,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000921"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> These are three straightforward amendments
dealing with sex and relationships education proper&#151;we have been
skirting round the subject up until now. Amendment 197 would add a
requirement for governors to have a formal consultation with parents
about the content of sex and relationships education. We welcome the
renaming of sex education to sex and relationships education. As I
mentioned earlier, we also welcome the new guidance issued last week,
which places, in regulations, value on marriage and family. Those are
all positive things.</div>
<a name="1002033000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
know&#151;this came out in our earlier debates&#151;that the way we
teach sex and relationships education is a sensitive issue,
particularly for certain communities. If we take away parents&#146;
powers of choice, as later clauses do, it is even more imperative and
appropriate that there should be clear and meaningful consultation
between the school and the parents before they decide in what manner
they are going to teach sex and relationships education to their
pupils. Amendment 197 would state that when deciding how to teach sex
and relationships education, there must be a formal consultation
process with the parents of pupils at a school, or the parents of those
who are going to attend that
school.</div><a name="1002033000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
62 follows on from the short debate that we had on clause 12 on
exempting not just academies but the educational bodies set out in
proposed new subsection (1ZA)(b), (c) and (d), namely city technology
colleges, city colleges for the technology of the arts, and academies.
I think I know what the Minister&#146;s response will be: she can
read out the previous answer that she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>read out, with the addition of two other forms of educational
establishments. We can take that as read to get us moving
on.</div><a name="1002033000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
173 is a probing amendment, and was tabled for the purposes of gaining
information. We shall come on to the subject of home education in the
dim and distant future. I do not want to pre-empt the lively and
entertaining debate that I am sure we are destined to have at some
stage, but what is the position regarding sex and relationships
education for home educators? Is there no requirement to provide SRE on
home educators, as I suspect? In that case, are the Government happy,
effectively, to substitute the power of a parent to choose for their
child to opt out of SRE for a power for a child to come out of school
altogether and be home educated? Is that the other side of the equation
that the Government are putting forward? If it is, surely the net
result will be more children being home educated. Yet the Government
are bringing in additional regulations, which will make it harder to be
a freelance home educator. There is a bit of a dichotomy
there.</div><a name="1002033000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first amendment&#151;amendment 197&#151;would be a valuable
addition to the Bill, while the other two are probing amendments to
give the Government the opportunity to state their position for the
benefit of the
Committee.</div><a name="1002033000548"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000922"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> The amendments would introduce further conditions
on the provision of sex and relationships education&#151;conditions
that are not required. We do not wish to place additional burdens on
schools or to impose them unnecessarily in areas where good practice is
already in place. It is important for all schools to provide sex and
relationships education. Amendment 197 would require schools formally
to consult parents about the content of sex and relationships
education, the effect of which would be to place another statutory
burden on schools and parents that is neither necessary nor desirable.
I am certainly surprised that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman
wants to do
so.</div><a name="1002033000549"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000923"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I would like the Minister clearly to distinguish
what is important: is it the school working with parents throughout the
whole process, or a statutory
consultation?</div><a name="1002033000550"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000924"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Governing bodies already have a statutory
responsibility to ensure that schools have an SRE policy in place. Many
schools have clear, open channels of communication with parents, and
that helps them to understand what exactly is being taught in schools.
In existing SRE guidance to which schools, including academies, must
have regard, it is already best practice to discuss the SRE policy and
the content of sex education with parents, and it is clear that many
schools do
that.</div><a name="1002033000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is far better to encourage and reinforce the importance of regular and
open communication between schools and parents through clear guidance,
rather than through additional legislation. To that end, we are issuing
revised SRE guidance to schools in which we make clear our expectation
that schools should have an open, ongoing dialogue with parents on such
important issues, and that SRE policies in schools benefit from having
regard to parental views.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div><a name="1002033000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are clear
that SRE policies must be made available to parents for inspection, and
must be provided free of charge to any parent who asks for a copy. As a
minimum, we would expect the policy to set out the aims of SRE and how
they are consistent with the values and ethos of the school; what
pupils will learn at every key stage; how parents, carers and pupils
are consulted in developing and reviewing policy; how parents are
informed of their right of withdrawal from SRE; and how the school
supports them in fulfilling their responsibility to provide SRE at
home.</div><a name="1002033000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 62, we believe that it is important for all schools,
including academies, to follow the national curriculum in sex and
relationships education as part  of their full programme of
PSHE. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said in his
opening remarks, I refer him to the answer that I gave in debate on
clause
12.</div><a name="1002033000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
173 would ensure that neither the new primary curriculum nor the new
provisions relating to PSHE applied to children who are educated at
home. The provisions of clauses 10 to 13 make amendments to the
Education Act 1996 or to part 6 of the Education Act 2002. In relation
to clauses 10 and 11, part 6 of the Education Act 2002 applies only in
relation to the national curriculum as taught in maintained schools. It
has no application to home-educated pupils who are not taught in
maintained schools. Clause 12 applies to academy schools and their
pupils only, and amends part 7 of the Education Act 1996.
Clause 13 also amends the Education Act 1996, but again its provisions
extend only to maintained schools, academies and academy predecessor
schools, which is clear from the Bill. I therefore urge the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000555"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000925"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Predictably, the Minister answered the question
about home education as I thought she would&#151;and the point about
the academies and city technology colleges. I do not agree with her,
but I shall not push the argument. I was slightly surprised that, in
her answer on amendment 197, she accused us of wanting to place an
additional, undesirable statutory burden on schools by requiring them
to consult on their sex and relationships education, a particularly
sensitive and potential controversial area as we have said. Only a few
clauses ago, we were debating parent satisfaction surveys&#151;an
apparently undesirable statutory burden of her Government&#146;s,
which is to be placed on schools. I do not see why the two things
should be different, particularly when the measures are all about
trying to make sure that parents feel included in one particular aspect
of their children&#146;s education, given that they are losing powers
to withdraw elsewhere. If they are to be included, it is particularly
important that they be properly consulted at the outset. That is why we
feel that the amendment should be made to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1002033000691"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
pm</div><a name="1002033000556"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
as the Minister has admitted, there are various different ways that
schools may inform themselves of what their parents want. Some of them
may not want to consult parents; that would be a retrograde step, which
is why we tried to put a requirement to do so in the Bill. I thought
that would be a welcome addition that she might actually allow to be
included.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div><a name="1002033000557"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000926"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> It is important that there should be ongoing
dialogue between parents and schools about SRE policies. It should be
ongoing, not just a one-off consultation. That is the best way to make
sure that SRE is taught well in schools, and that parents are fully
engaged. Best practice shows that in the schools that do that, the SRE
is good.</div>
<a name="1002033000558"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000927"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Yes, I completely agree with that, other than
the fact that there is nothing in the Bill that requires schools to
have an ongoing discussion and debate with parents. Nor is the
consultation that we are proposing a one-off consultation. Clearly, it
would need to be ongoing as the new guidance comes in, so that we can
see how it beds down, and see whether it is proving appropriate for the
pupils at that school. There is nothing in our amendment that says that
we are talking about a one-off form of consultation that would exclude
all other dialogue. It is not helpful to try to dismiss the amendment
on those grounds. In the interests of trying to move the Committee
along, I point out that we have made all the points that we want to
make on the subject. The Minister is clearly not going to give in. I
should be happy to reconsider the issue at a later stage, but in the
meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1002033000559"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000930"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is me again, Mr. Betts, I am
afraid. Now we are getting to the really thorny area about exemptions
in sex and relationship education. One of the three principles that I
set out at the beginning of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>PSHE amendments concerned parental choice and parental powers. The
clause is clearly an attack on those powers and the exercise of choice
that parents currently enjoy but only a very small
proportion&#151;0.04 per cent. of them&#151;choose to actually
employ. My concern is that the principle is wrong. As I stated earlier,
ultimately, it is up to parents, in the vast majority of cases, to
decide what is best for their children. That includes how they are
educated as well. The clause will change the dynamics of the
relationship between parents and a school. It could have the
counter-productive effect of those parents not engaging properly,
willingly, freely and positively with the sex and relationship
education as it will  now be taught.</div>
<a name="1002033000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 63
and 65 are a sort of either/or option. We believe that the parental
right to exercise choice should remain. There should be no change to
the status quo. Indeed, that was the recommendation of Sir Alasdair
MacDonald&#146;s report in April 2009. He clearly states that the
existing rights&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> There is a
lot of chuntering on the Government side.</div>
<a name="1002033000572"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000931"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Perhaps I could just ask for clarification. The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the status quo, but will he be clear about the
age to which the right of withdrawal would therefore
extend?</div>
<a name="1002033000573"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000932"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The status quo at the moment is the age of 19.
That is why I have said that we propose an either/or. Clearly, the
Government believe that the age should be reduced and the power to
withdraw should  be abolished. We do not believe that that
power  should be abolished; hence, one of the amendments would
do away with consideration B, which relates to conditions of age.
However, if the clause is to contain a condition of age, as the
Government have decided, why should it be 15? Where did the figure 15
come from? What is the relevance of 15? Are children tougher and more
able to accept such education at the age of 15, rather than the age of
19, 13 or 17? What is the basis on which 15 was decided? The Liberal
Democrats want to make it even lower, and I will be interested to hear
their justification of why they think that all pupils from the age of
14 should compulsorily have sex and relationship education without
their parents having the power to withdraw
them.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>logic to it. Notwithstanding problems about the time of the year at
which pupils become 16 or 15, which is another minefield created by
having an age instituted in the Bill, there is some logic in 16,
because children currently need not be part of the compulsory education
system after that
age.</div><a name="1002033000578"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000937"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that there is a
logic in using the age of 16, which is not, as I understand it, the
position of his party. Has he actually decided whether he wants the age
to be 18 or
16?</div><a name="1002033000579"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000938"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I do not want any &#147;teen&#148;. I want
parents to be able to decide what is best for their children and have
the power to withdraw. At the moment, they can do so at the age 19,
when the vast majority of children are no longer children but adults,
who have the full powers of adults to take their life into their own
hands and are not beholden to their parents. That is why we want to
take out the age condition
altogether.</div><a name="1002033000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
option B, we have said that, if there must be an age, rather than
letting it stand at 15, for which we do not see the logic, 16 would be
better. However, that would still be worse than keeping the status quo,
as the Government&#146;s own report just nine months ago recommended.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Perhaps the Minister for Schools
and Learners wants to intervene now to say why, nine months after Sir
Alasdair MacDonald&#146;s report, the Government have changed their
mind. If the Minister wants to intervene, he can do so to answer that
specifically.</div>
<a name="1002033000581"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000939"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The moment has
passed.</div><a name="1002033000582"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000940"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am sorry; perhaps the Under-Secretary will say
in her response why the Government have  now reversed their
policy on the basis of the clear recommendation that was made in Sir
Alasdair MacDonald&#146;s report, which they accepted in
April  and which clearly stated that the existing right of
parents to withdraw their children up to the age of 19 from 
sex and relationship education should be fully retained. Why is Sir
Alasdair MacDonald now apparently  wrong? Amendment 64 is part
of the either/or option  of changing 15 to 16 if we must have
an age condition  at
all.</div><a name="1002033000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that amendment 195 attracts some support from the Liberal
Democrats, because it deals with something on which the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I have often agreed: having respect for
the voice of the child himself or herself. The amendment would add a
condition whereby a child could decide to absent himself or herself
from sex and relationship
education.</div><a name="1002033000584"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000941"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman say which other areas of the
national curriculum he would like parents and pupils to be allowed to
opt out
of?</div><a name="1002033000585"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000942"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> None. We are only dealing with PSHE and
specifically, in relation to the clause, sex and relationship
education, which has been the subject of opting out in the past. That
is why the right to opt out should be
retained.</div><a name="1002033000586"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000943"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that there should be
any opt-out on religious education?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div><a name="1002033000587"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000944"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> There are requirements on attending assemblies
at the moment and on religious education about which we could have an
interesting
debate.</div><a name="1002033000588"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000945"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Probably not
tonight.</div><a name="1002033000589"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000946"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I was rather looking forward to having an
interesting debate on that, particularly with the hon. Member for
Keighley.</div><a name="1002033000590"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
role does the Minister think the voice of children should play in
determining what happens to them regarding sex and relationship
education? Why is there nothing anywhere in this legislation on having
any regard for the wishes and feelings of the children? Perhaps the
Minister will answer that
question.</div><a name="1002033000591"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000947"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the idea behind
the amendment is in line with the thinking on parents who have
separated and are in dispute about whether their child should receive
sex and relationship 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>education in school? Under an application for a specific order, a court
would have to consider the wishes and feelings of the
child.</div><a name="1002033000592"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002033000948"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Indeed; the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole and I have supported such legislation in the past, but such
provision features nowhere in the Bill and none of the relevant clauses
mention the effect that it will have or the wishes and feelings of the
child. My hon. Friend makes a good
point.</div><a name="1002033000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister will justify where the age of 15 came from, why the good
Sir Alasdair Macdonald&#146;s report has become irrelevant within
nine months of its being published, why she thinks that there are
sufficient safeguards to cater for the withdrawal of powers for the
choice of parents and why children&#146;s wishes and feelings have no
bearing on this matter at
all.</div><a name="1002033000594"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered</i>,
That the debate be now adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Kerry
