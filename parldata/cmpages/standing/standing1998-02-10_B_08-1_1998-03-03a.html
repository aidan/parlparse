<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is confusing this Committee with the Northern Ireland Grand Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I think that the words ``Welcome back to the Chair,'' are most appropriate, Mr. Atkinson, irrespective of which Chair it is.
<P>
This morning I was winding up my remarks on this series of amendments. I wanted the Minister to answer the fundamental question why it is deemed in clause 17 that the Police Authority should take ownership of, and responsibility for, the annual policing plan, despite the fact that the Chief Constable submits a draft of the plan to the authority. My amendments to clause 16 are designed to achieve continuity of responsibility for the three to five-year strategic policing plan.
<P>
Under the Government's proposals, the Chief Constable might write up a three-year policing plan, included with which would be the policing plan for the next year. He would submit that annual plan to the Police Authority, which, according to clause 17, can change it. However, clause 16 does not say that the first year of the Chief Constable's strategic plan can be changed by the Police Authority. That might mean that the Chief Constable's strategic plan for the three to five-year period would be out in the public domain and--presumably--agreed to by the Secretary of State, but the Police Authority might not agree with it.
<P>
If, under clause 17, the authority were to consider the first year of that plan, it might decide to make some changes. The Police Authority might then produce a different policing plan in year one to the plan submitted by the Chief Constable under clause 16. Does the Minister accept that that is inconsistent and illogical? It makes no sense whatever.
<P>
The Minister could have everything that he wants. He could have the Chief Constable up front, designing and formulating the plan and bringing it to the attention of the Secretary of State and the Police Authority, but there must be consistency between clauses 16 and 17.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): I shall make another attempt to deal with this issue.
<P>
We spent part of this morning trying to convince the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) of the design merits of the three-legged stool. Since then he has tried to convince us of the design merits of the two-legged stool. A two-legged stool is fundamentally unsafe.
<P>
The Government have tried to achieve clarity of role, within the tripartite structure, for the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. We discussed the strategic plan in relation to clause 16, and that plan would be owned by the Chief Constable.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has forgotten about the status of the Chief Constable. Perhaps I forgot that too, when I referred to the Chief Constable, this morning as the chief executive of the organisation. He is much more than that. He is not subservient to a board. He is on his own, with a status upon which we all agree. The Chief Constable should have much greater control over the policing operation than would be the case in other situations. It is important that there should be no ``Political'' or ``political'' interference in policing. The Chief Constable should stand apart. The Bill gives him status by requiring him to produce a three-to-five-year strategic plan that is clearly his.
<P>
As I tried to explain this morning, agreement among the three relevant parties will lead to better policing. Agreement, after consultation, between the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable will lead to congruence between the three-to-five-year strategic plan and the Police Authority's yearly plan. However, it is important that each of the three parties plays a distinctive role so that responsibilities are clearly allocated.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire fails to appreciate that, by urging consistency, he would weld together the roles of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. That would be damaging. Their roles must be distinctive. Therefore, we cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
Question proposed, That the amendment be made:--

<P>
Amendment made: No. 79, in page 8, line 35, after `section', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) any objectives determined by the Police Authoirty under section 15; and
<P>
(d) any performance targets established by the Police Authority under that section.'.[Mr. Moss.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We shall continue to differ. I have listened to the argument three times. The Under-Secretary does not approach the subject from a different angle, he simply repeats that the three relevant parties should play distinctive roles. The clause requires the Chief Constable to issue a plan, and the Under-Secretary will not budge on the matter.
<P>
	However, the measure is inconsistent and illogical. The Under-Secretary said that the Government wanted to give the Chief Constable status. I thought that the partners in the tripartite structure or--three-legged stool--would be equal. I do not oppose the tripartite structure. I have already agreed that in devising a plan, the Chief Constable, or the Police Authority using the Chief Constable's draft, should take into account,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 14'' for which subsection (2)(a) provides.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State is heavily involved in setting the tone and theme of the plan. If the objectives are set by the Secretary of State they will have a crucial bearing on the outcome of the strategic plan. I do not want to elevate the Police Authority to a position outside the tripartite structure. I am simply pointing out that it appears to be perfectly acceptable to Ministers for the Chief Constable under clause 17, to draw up an annual policing plan and submit it to the Police Authority for amendment before it is submitted to the Secretary of State.
<P>
If that structure is good enough under clause 17, for year one, I fail to see what material difference prevents it from being used for the strategic plan for three to five years. It is the Chief Constable's plan and he is drafting it. However, the Police Authority has an important role to play. The Government accept that approach in clause 17, but for some reason are hooked on the idea of the Chief Constable's being responsible for the strategic plan under clause 16. The Committee voted on our amendment, but I feel strongly enough about the issue to return to the matter on Report. The Government's position is glaringly inconsistent and illogical, and we shall continue to present arguments to expose that fact.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Section 19 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (discrimination by public authorities) shall apply to members of the police force in the discharge of their functions as such.'.--[Mr. Ingram.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We had a long debate at the beginning of the Committee's proceedings about the role of the new Northern Ireland police service. Clause 18 is concerned with the duties of the police force, but its members would not be able to carry out many of those duties without the backing of a civilian work force who, in the terms set by the Government, are now to form part of the Northern Ireland police service. The question that I want to pose is about the reasons for using one term in preference to the other. It would be interesting to know whether the Government believe that the duties listed--to ``protect life and property'', to ``preserve order'' and to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prevent the commission of offences''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than being the sole preserve of police officers in the police force, are general duties of the whole police service, bringing together the three elements that we discussed on clause 2.
<P>
Similar provisions to those in clause 18 do not seem to be included for England and Wales in the 1996 Act; nor can I find any reference to them in the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. Why have those duties been included in clause 18? Where have they come from? I shall be interested in anything that the Minister of State can tell me about whether corresponding provisions can be found in any England and Wales legislation.
<P>
In its submission to the Government, the Committee on the Administration of Justice has raised the important issues of lack of human rights commitments. I do not want to debate that now, but the issue may gather pace before Report and Third Reading. Perhaps the Minister will, in discussions with the committee, tease out what form of reference to a commitment to human rights it would like the Bill to include.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> Clause 18 refers to the police force. The reason why it does not refer to the Northern Ireland police service is clear: it would not be appropriate for the typist in Newry to have a general duty to protect life and property, preserve order and prevent the commission of offences and so on. We are talking specifically about the duties of a constable and what is expected of all constables in the Province, not about the support mechanisms that run alongside.
<P>
The concept of police force is consistent in legislation: the word ``force'' appears throughout. In many respects, its removal would be a useful step forward. However, I am advised that removing it would involve many changes in a raft of primary legislation, which would not be a good thing. That was not the point about the word ``force'' that the hon. Gentleman made, but I hope that he agrees that many serving police officers like to regard themselves as providing a service to the community rather than being a force. The previous Government tried to introduce that ethos, and we are continuing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It probably applies more to clause 18(1)(d), where there is a duty
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where an offence has been committed, to take measures to bring the offender to justice.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I readily accept that the earlier duties are more specific to police constables than to the police force, but in taking measures to bring offenders to justice we get to the back-up administration--the paperwork, the typing of reports and liaison with the courts and the public prosecutor's office. That is where this other staff will come in as part of the police service. I was thinking more of changing the word in the first line of the clause but not subsequent lines, because these refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the powers and privileges of a constable'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which I do not want to change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman had an opportunity to amend the Bill and find an argument consistent with his proposed amendment. He is now trying to work out the amendment on his feet, which is not the best way to change legislation. He will have an opportunity on Report, if he wishes, to table a detailed amendment of that sort. Clause 18 specifies the functions of a constable.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about representations on human rights commitments from the Committee on the Administration of Justice. We shall of course consider those representations as well as the outcome of the meeting that will take place later in the month, to clarify what is being sought. It may relate to the concept of impartiality, which we discussed in earlier debates. Amendment No. 54 amended the clause to take account of that. We shall reconsider at a later stage other ways of writing that sort of principle into the Bill. That may be the point that the CAJ raised through the human rights concept, but we shall clarify it in further discussions with that Committee. I trust that with that explanation, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>General functions of Chief Constable</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 10, line 10, after `17', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall consult and seek approval from the Police Authority before deviating substantially from it.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers to the Chief Constable and the discharge of his functions, particularly in relation to the annual policing plan that we discussed under clause 17.
<P>
The issue relates to the phrase ``shall have regard to'', which refers to the annual policing plan. One wonders how different Chief Constables might interpret those words in the clause. It also relates to the way in which that interpretation will be perceived by the general public, which the Police Authority is supposed to represent.
<P>
The clause strikes at one of the key issues in the Bill because it relates to matters that deal with the Chief Constable's operational autonomy. Successive Chief Constables have been criticised by members of the public for actions that they have or have not taken in the historical past. In political terms, it is a key area. One side of the community would want some operational control introduced because it feels that, in the past, there has been a cop-out by Secretaries of State who say, ``This is an operational decision. There is no politics involved. Therefore, we leave it to the Chief Constable to decide what to do.''
<P>
That issue has been taken up by the CAJ. In its submission to the Committee, the CAJ pointed out the difficulties to which I have just alluded. It would not wish the control of the police to be subject to any partisan, political control. However, it feels that the wide-ranging powers in clause 19 give Chief Constables enormous power. The CAJ maintains that such power has been subject to abuse--that is its interpretation of actions by previous Chief Constables, but, nevertheless, it is a strongly-held view. In particular, the CAJ refers to marches and events such as those in Drumcree and, very recently, in Londonderry. Those issues were operational ones, which, in the CAJ's view, were open to some abuse in the past.
<P>
The Police Authority would like to make it clear to the public that it is in charge of the annual policing plan. Clause 17 makes it clear that it is responsible for issuing that plan. Although the Chief Constable submits a draft of that annual policing plan, the Police Authority can amend it. It does not have to return to the Chief Constable to approve such changes. If that policing plan has the ownership of the Police Authority and if the Chief Constable deviates from it in any way under the powers given to him under the clause he will be accountable to the Police Authority. That is exactly what the amendment seeks to achieve. If the Chief Constable deviates from the annual policing plan he should consult with and seek the approval of the Police Authority.
<P>
It may be argued that we need to be flexible and that we never know what is around the corner in Northern Ireland in terms of policing and the security situation. I fully accept that a plan must contain contingency sections. If there was a severe deterioration in security, the Chief Constable would obviously have to meet that challenge. I do not see any problem in writing that contingency option into the annual policing plan. I am sure that it will be because that is common sense. But deviations beyond that which are not within the contingency section are more important in this context.
<P>
It is right and proper that the Police Authority is seen to have full ownership of the annual policing plan. The amendment makes it clear that these deviations shall be discussed with the Police Authority and that its approval shall be sought for their implementation. If the Chief Constable is not accountable for the policing plan to the Police Authority, then to whom is he or she responsible? That is not clear in clause 19.
<P>
The accountability factor may be exercised in the reports that must be submitted under clause 47(2)(a) and clause 48(3). But one could wait weeks, if not months, for reports and we are talking about major deviations from the plan in the shorter term which need to be discussed with the Police Authority. It believes that the amendment would help it to exercise the responsibilities for which it is tasked in clause 17 with the annual policing plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): Clause 19 sets out the general functions of the Chief Constable and replaces section 6(2) of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. Subsection (1) simply and unambiguously provides that the police force shall be under the direction and control of the Chief Constable. Subsection (2), which contains the new provision that is not found in the 1970 Act, requires the Chief Constable to have regard to the annual policing plan issued under clause 17.
<P>
Amendment No. 81, as I see it, seeks to expand and clarify that requirement. Far from being inconsistent with the Government's intentions in the clause, it takes them a stage further. As my hon. Friend has pointed out, the amendment would impose on the Chief Constable the additional requirement that he is to consult with and seek the approval of the Police Authority if he wishes to depart substantially from the annual policing plan, the issuing of which is the subject of clause 17. It is an important part of the Bill and it will be an important part of the work of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in future.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is, arguably, an ingredient missing from clause 17 and the amendment would restore that deficiency. To illustrate my argument, clause 17(3) rightly requires the Chief Constable to submit a draft of the plan to the Police Authority. Subsection (4) allows the Police Authority either to adopt the draft plan that the Chief Constable submits or to amend it, having consulted the Chief Constable. Under clause 17 the plan is to cover policing priorities for the year, the financial resources expected to be available and any objectives and performance targets which have been established either by the Police Authority or by the Secretary of State. However, clause 17 does not specify any involvement on the part of the Police Authority if the Chief Constable, for operational reasons, wishes to depart substantially from the plan for the year. The amendment would rectify that omission.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that it was highly likely that an annual policing plan would contain contingency provisions to deal with circumstances such as variations in the levels of violence and the perceived threat to security. However, there are other reasons why the Chief Constable might wish dramatically to revise the plan or to depart from it that would have an impact on the performance targets and the priorities.
<P>
For example, at the moment, fortunately, the drug problem in Northern Ireland is not as great as in the rest of the United Kingdom; it is also appreciably less serious than in the Republic of Ireland. Perish the thought that it should happen, but if the drug situation in Northern Ireland suddenly deteriorated, the Chief Constable might wish to transfer substantial resources. That is one example in which the existing annual plan may not contain the necessary contingency provisions.
<P>
Another example is that of animal health. There may be a need to police much more effectively the movement of animals across the border with the Republic. At present, few police resources are devoted to that task.
<P>
I have given two instances in which the Chief Constable, for operational reasons, may wish suddenly to depart substantially from the annual plan.
<P>
The amendment would require the Chief Constable, in circumstances such as those that I have outlined, to consult the Police Authority and to seek its approval. It could be argued that that would happen in any event, and that the amendment is therefore unnecesary. On the contrary, the Bill explicitly covers many eventualities and circumstances requiring consultation. According to clause 19(2), the Chief Constable, rightly
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall have regard to the annual policing plan issued under section 17.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For the sake of completeness, he should also be required to consult, and to seek the approval of, the Police Authority if he intends to depart substantially from the plan.
<P>
It is all very well to say that in a nice cosy world disagreements and problems will not happen, but what would happen when there was disagreement? It would no longer be the case, under clause 19 (1), that the police force
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall be under the direction and control of the Chief Constable''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because he would have to seek the approval of the Police Authority, which could withhold it.
<P>
Fundamental principles are at stake here. A judgment in Regina v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner was made by Lord Denning. He said of that commissioner's duty:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have no hesitation, however, in holding that, like every constable in the land, he should be, and is, independent of the executive. He is not subject to the orders of the Secretary of State, save that under the Police Act 1964 the Secretary of State can call on him to give a report, or to retire in the interests of efficiency.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the judgment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No Minister of the Crown can tell him that he must, or must not, keep observation on this place or that; or that he must, or must not, prosecute this man or that one. Nor can any police authority tell him so. The responsibilty for law enforcement lies on him. He is answerable to the law and to the law alone.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would undermine that principle, and the wording would be:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable|shall consult and seek approval from the Police Authority before deviating substantially from it''--<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is a wholly bad amendment; it is ludicrous and dangerous both in principle and in concept. I have heard what hon Gentlemen have said in their attempts to justify it and I hope that they will now listen to our arguments.
<P>
The amendment would remove the Chief Constable's operational independence by subordinating his operational judgment to the opinion of the Police Authority. Clause 19(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The police force shall be under the direction and control of the Chief Constable''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
no dispute, I hope, about that. Clause 19 (2) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In discharging his functions, the Chief Constable shall have regard to the annual policing plan issued under section 17''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is unlikely that there would be disagreements between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable, but the amendment envisages circumstances in which they will arise. What hon. Members have not said is what will happen when the Police Authority and the Chief Constable do not agree. Will the Police Authority have the right to say to the Chief Constable, ``You are not allowed to move in your constables'' to deal with a problem? Is the Police Authority to have the right to question the efficacy of the Chief Constable's decision and fail to approve it?
<P>
That is, from the plan.
<P>
Let us consider the examples provided by the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter)--an upsurge in drug crime or in the movement of animals across the border. I am sure if those possibilities were not included in the policing plan, the Chief Constable would consult the Police Authority and advise it of new dimensions in the policing of the Province. However, he could not await the approval of the Police Authority before being able to act; that contrary to the hon. Member for Basingstoke's intent. I do not believe that hon. Members have properly understood their amendment. They may have read out their briefings precisely, but they have not understood the import for the amemdment, which I ask to withdraw.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We are told that this is a ludicrous amendment. I am happy to tell the Committee that it was suggested to the Opposition by the Police Authority. Far from reading the authority's brief, I read my own notes, which I made when considering how best to argue for the amendment. I am not using crib sheets; it is all my own work.
<P>
Clause 17(3) states that the Chief Constable should submit the annual policing plan, to which clause 19 refers, in draft form to the Police Authority to consider. The draft policing plan comes from the Chief Constable. Would the Chief Constable overlook the need to be prepared for an increase in drug-related activity? I should think not. Any Chief Constable worth his salt would pick up trends in that type of crime, and he would build into his policing plan effective measures to counter it.
<P>
Similarly, the Committee discussed movements of livestock across the border. That issue was, I think, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke. The draft policing plan submitted by the chief constable would surely include such matters.
<P>
Clause 17 goes on, in subsection (4), to state: ``The Police Authority may''--not shall--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``adopt an annual policing plan either--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) in the form of the draft submitted''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That means, No questions asked, we will take what is an offer, we will agree with it entirely, and we will take ownership of the Chief Constable's policing plan.'' Or the plan may be adopted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) with such amendments as the Authority may, after consultation with the Chief Constable, determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The subsection does not require the agreement of the Chief Constable--it says after consultation with him. In other words, the subsection gives considerable powers to the Police Authority to examine carefully the plan submitted to it by the Chief Constable. If it is not happy with the plan, it may change it in whatever way it wishes.
<P>
Clause 19 therefore seems to allow the Chief Constable to move away from the policing plan. The Police Authority will have determined it, with or without his agreement. The clause does not say that he has to agree, it simply states that he must be consulted if changes are to be made.
<P>
In one clause, therefore, considerable powers are given to the Police Authority, which will own the plan and be responsible for it. With regard to the operational aspect, clause 19 rightly states that the Chief Constable will deploy his forces and run his police forces as he sees fit. Subsection (2), however, states simply:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In discharging his functions, the Chief Constable shall have regard to the annual policing plan''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another inconsistency. What does ``have regard to'' mean? The phrase is a bit wishy-washy and weak. The clause does not state that the Chief Constable will implement the policing plan, only that he will ``have regard'' to it.
<P>
The amendment asks only for that to be tightened up, so that if the Chief Constable deviates from the plan--presumably he has to accept whatever plan is dished up--he will simply be complying with the requirements of an earlier clause. I fail to see why the amendment is ludicrous. The Opposition are not suggesting that day-to-day operational activities will be--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that ``have regard to'' means ``due regard'', but if the circumstances change, a Chief Constable must have flexibility? Therefore, if any change in his approach is in conflict with the plan because of circumstances that no one envisaged, he should not, in the words of the amendment, have to seek the Police Authority's approval before he can deploy his forces.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have already said that the Chief Constable must have operational flexibility. I do not rule that out in the annual policing plan; flexibility would have to be built into it. I do not disagree. But clause 17 says that the plan can be amended by the Police Authority, which has only to consult the Chief Constable, not to get his agreement. I know that under clause 17(5) the Secretary of State can come in and make changes to the annual policing plan. The Police Authority submits the plan and makes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such amendments to the plan as the Secretary of State . . . may require.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore the Police Authority is not simply doing its own thing here; the Secretary of State, as ever, is standing over it to make sure that political control and direction are exercised over the whole proceedings.
<P>
In essence, the batting order is that the Chief Constable prepares the draft plan, the Police Authority accepts, rejects or changes it, and finally the Secretary of State endorses the annual policing plan. That is the sequence of events. Yet clause 19 simply says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Chief Constable shall have regard''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to that policing plan.
<P>
To my mind, the plan should have general headings dealing with the main planks of police activity--the fight against crime, the security situation and so on--and surely it will build into the sections under those headings the Chief Constable's ability to react quickly to rapidly changing circumstances. That would not mean deviation from the plan. If the plan were to say that if there were a surge of criminal or terrorist activity, the Chief Constable would use every power at his disposal to counter it, that would be written into the plan. It would be an operational matter that had been changed from the norm, but not necessarily a deviation from the plan.
<P>
All we are saying is that if the plan is there and is important, the Police Authority should be consulted if there are major changes to it. Otherwise, what is the point of clause 17? There is no point in it at all. Why bother to put the Police Authority at the top of that clause? Why give it ownership of the plan? If the Chief Constable, when he is putting the plan into operation during the first year, decides for whatever reason not to go with it, nothing in the Bill says that he must be accountable to the Police Authority for any changes and deviations, or gives the Police Authority any comeback on the plan for which it is supposed to take responsibility.
<P>
If the Minister continues to say that clause 19(1) and (2) are inviolate and will not be changed, because all the time the Chief Constable must have operational independence and flexibility, forgive me for saying that clause 17 might as well be dumped in the waste paper basket, for all the power and influence it gives the Police Authority. The Police Authority sees things in that way, and I hope that in its discussions with the Minister and his officials it is expressing those views strongly. It is unhappy that the words ``have regard to'' in no way contribute to its perception of its role as set out in clause 17, or to the establishment of the annual policing plan.
<P>
I see no problem here for the Chief Constable in an operational matter. Again, I return to what the CAJ said to us. It has strong views about allowing Chief Constables, under the guise of operational autonomy, to do pretty well what they want. Some of the fears expressed by the CAJ may have related historically to the decisions over the contentious parades and Drumcrees of this world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is the second time that the hon. Gentleman has referred to Drumcree. Does he sign up to the allegation that has been made about the role of the RUC during those marches? Does he share the CAJ view and analysis of that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We discussed that at length when debating the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill. The point is that the RUC and the Chief Constable do not wish to be placed between a rock and a hard place. I thought that the aim of the legislation was to introduce a new way of looking at this issue so the Chief Constable was not just told to get on with it on his own on the basis of operational autonomy. I am sure that he welcomes that legislation because although he is involved, at least he and his officers are not in the front line in major disputes. The CAJ has an opinion which I am expressing to the Committee but I do not necessarily agree with everything that it says. I simply express its view which it will no doubt express to the Minister directly when it has the opportunity.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> To avoid any inadvertent misdirection of the Committee about the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act, would the hon. Gentleman accept that the Chief Constable has ultimate authority under that Act to take decisions on the day in relation to public order issues? Does he further accept that he has absolute power over the deployment of his police force on that day?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Yes, I do. That relates to earlier legislation. The powers given to the Chief Constable are not necessarily in that Act but are there already. We never sought to make changes to them. He must be able to move quickly if matters on a particular day get out of hand. That is not in dispute. But the decisions about which parades can go ahead have been taken out of his hands and placed with the Parades Commission and all that goes with it. I think he would welcome that.
<P>
Only time will tell whether that legislation is correct. It was never my intention to misdirect the Committee and I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to clarify what I meant. I did not imply that day-to-day operational power was not given to the Chief Constable in that context. The CAJ believes that international experience shows that legislation should define clearly what is intended and how widely the Chief Constable's powers should be interpreted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let us assume that on the day of a hotly contentious parade the Chief Constable decides to take actions that are not consistent with the plan that has been set out by the Police Authority. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that he should consult the Police Authority and seek its approval before deciding what actions to take? That is what the amendment says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not think that that is what it says. I have said several times that if the policing plan is to be meaningful it must allow the Chief Constable, in operational terms, to react quickly to changing circumstances. In a crisis I would not want the Chief Constable to have to go cap in hand to the Police Authority. It does not wish that.
<P>
The plan should set out areas of activity, including reacting to difficult parades and processions. There should be agreement between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority on that. If there is a problem with a procession and resulting public disorder, no Police Authority would tell the Chief Constable not to react to it. That would be ridiculous. We are talking about deviations from the plan. The plan can involve contingencies--that is not a problem.
<P>
The Minister is hooked on the idea that the Chief Constable must go cap in hand to the Police Authority for all these operational decisions. Presumably, they have to agree a plan, but it is the plan of the Police Authority, not of the Chief Constable. If there is deviation, the Chief Constable should consult the Police Authority and seek its approval. It is a reasonable request and does not cause problems for the Chief Constable in exercising his functions. The Minister obviously feels that it does. He is arguing that line because he has been told to dig in on it and he is not budging. However, out of courtesy and reasonableness the Police Authority should be consulted if there are to be major deviations from its plan.
<P>
I am astounded that a policing plan cannot contain the contingencies that arise all the time in Northern Ireland, particularly in relation to security. No police authority would want to tie the hands of a chief constable so that he could not react quickly and respond effectively to a problem or threat. That is not the issue. If the Minister is unhappy about the wording of the amendment, he can reword it to make it more acceptable. Consultation is important, otherwise one might as well forget clause 17.
<P>
The Police Authority sets up a policing plan, which everyone knows is its plan. However, during its currency, the Chief Constable says, ``I do not have to have regard to that in this instance because I must operate autonomously in such matters.'' Where does that leave the democratic accountability of the Police Authority to the public? There is none because the words ``have regard to'' mean that one can refuse to abide by the plan on operational grounds. That is not good enough and I am sure that the Police Authority does not think that it is good enough either.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran (Beverley and Holderness):</B> I had not intended to speak, but as I listen to the debate I become more concerned. I was greatly concerned when I heard the Minister say, ``I give up.'' My hon. Friends and I will not give up on this issue and no amount of joking between the Minister and his colleagues will change that. We shall have to revisit this territory.
<P>
I shall repeat little of what my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, but I simply fail to understand why clause 17 is in the Bill. The Minister would do us a service by explaining the point of the exercise, and there is no point in him saying that he gives up. He must keep trying. No amount of reading from his official briefs will change the fact that we and many other people cannot see the point of clause 17.
<P>
The Minister has got kittled up again. He accuses us of using crib sheets; I am using plenty of crib sheets and I do not mind who knows about it--I am perfectly happy to use them. At the first or second sitting of the Committee, I said that the Labour Party had been in opposition for a long time and had forgotten everything about it in a very short time. The Government know that our responsibility is to voice people's concerns, whether or not we agree with them, and ask Ministers about them in the hope of getting a reply. The Minister is not listening; he prefers private conversation, doubtless because he would like us to sit here and dutifully shut up about the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is no good. We cannot run a Committee in that way. If I had time, I would organise a seminar for Ministers on Committee members' responsibilities.
<P>
The Minister must explain the aim of clause 17. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. I had not previously considered the matter, but I listened to the arguments. My hon. Friend said that it was not outwith the bounds of possibility for the annual policing plan to be sufficiently flexible to take into account the necessity for the Chief Constable to operate with speed on some occasions and flexibility on others. Any idiot anywhere, apart from in the Committee Room, knows that plans are made every day, including in the company sphere that I come from. Annual plans are formed, but contingencies are taken into account. Plans are flexible and can sometimes be changed. They are not set in ferroconcrete. I am worried because the Minister implies that the plans that he foresees will be set in ferroconcrete. That is wrong. The Minister should deal with the matter elsewhere if not here.
<P>
Plans must be flexible, or they are no good. The Minister's constant references to the independence of the Chief Constable's operational requirements does not answer our question. The Opposition believe that the sort of plans that we propose can cater for operational independence. I wholly agree with my hon. Friend. Hon. Members who are reading their post would probably say that that was very predictable. However, I stress that I have listened to the debate.
<P>
I am sure that it does not matter to the Minister if I am worried, but my hon. Friend spent time explaining that others were also worried. The Under-Secretary thinks that that is a joke. My hon. Friend mentioned the submission from the Committee on the Administration of Justice and the Minister said that the submission arrived at the Northern Ireland Office only yesterday. Hon. Members have had the submission for some time and we could have passed it on to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It would help if the hon. Gentleman listened to earlier debates. I said that I had received the submission on 26th February. [Hon. Members: ``He was not here.''] He may not have been here, but some matters have been reported to him. As I say, I received the submission on 26th February. I have read it, and it is being considered by my officials who received it yesterday. A meeting will take place with the Committee on the Administration of Justice some time in March, when matters covered in the submission can be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> That is helpful. I hope that the Minister will become calm again. He was kittled up earlier. I am happy to accept what he said. I merely misheard him earlier, but we now know the truth. Has the Minister read the submission? My hon. Friend tried to establish whether the Minister had read it and there was much jockeying. The Minister said that he had read it, but had not taken in every point. He should have taken account of every point. Not many published submissions and representations have been made on the Bill, but that does not dilute the importance of those that have been made. I had hoped that the Minister would have an hour or two during the day to read those few submissions in more detail. [Interruption.] Labour Members are again becoming fractious. They would like us simply to make points and then sit down and listen to what they say, parrot fashion. We are supposed to accept it all and say, ``What wonderful arguments they deploy.''
<P>
The Government are beginning to understand that it is not quite like that--in this place or outside. The Opposition snap back, as do representative bodies, a few of whose views we have quoted--and I imagine that many more serious opinions are being expressed privately. The Government must listen to them. The Minister must become used to our sometimes having to repeat ourselves, simply because, as I said earlier, he is not predisposed to listen to us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I suppose that I could look back at some of the compliments paid to me and my colleague on the manner in which we have handled the Bill and earlier legislation on which we and the Opposition have crossed swords. We were complimented for absorbing arguments and amending provisions, so the hon. Gentleman's charge is without foundation. I accept his right to hold opinions but those were not based on fact.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am pleased that I allowed the Minister to get that off his chest because it will calm him a little further.
<P>
I was coming to the subject of the Chief Constable's operational independence. We have said we do not regard it as being infringed in any way, so it was rather pointless for the Minister to take up so much of the time of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire contending that it would be.
<P>
Bodies such as the Committee on the Administration of Justice, whose memorandum I need to be convinced the Minister has read in much detail--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> How does the document define the clauses in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I shall not go down that road, despite that clever ploy by the Minister. Opposition Members have to ensure that they do not run after red herrings, which the Minister is a rare character in deploying. If he will not accept our arguments, perhaps he will take account of the concern of bodies such as that committee about what it--this is not my opinion--regards as too much operational control. I may not take that view, because I know the problems under which the Chief Constable operates. But sometimes there is a problem of perception: other people in what, alas, is a divided community consider that too much power is exercised by the Chief Constable. The amendment would be an ideal way of showing the community that the Chief Constable is not his own master under every circumstance but that there is some measure of accountability. Those are the words of the CAJ's submission. If the Minister considered the matter from that viewpoint, perhaps he would get himself off a hook, and enable the CAJ to see how sensible his proposals are, rather than the opposite, because his problem is the preceptions of others.
<P>
I have been provoked this afternooon; I could have spoken for much longer but my hon. Friend set out the arguments and I need not repeat them. The Minister should respond to the matters that we have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone):</B> I apologise for missing this morning's sitting. I know that the Minister missed my presence and felt that perhaps more progress could have been made if I had been present. I will endeavour to make amends for my absence. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
I support the amendment that has been tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and his hon. Friends. What I concluded in the early part of the Committee proceedings is becoming more and more apparent. In the interim, the Minister has tried to be helpful. I spoke about the Bill being a treacherous piece of legislation and then I had second thoughts and wondered whether I was right. Having heard what was said in the past few minutes, I am returning to my original conclusion. It seems that everything in the Bill is designed to derogate from the responsibility that the Police Authority should have. Its authority is being reduced and its powers handed directly to the Secretary of State. The Bill changes the way in which most Opposition Members believe the Royal Ulster Constabulary should relate to the community: that is through a representative police authority. The Bill will force the RUC, through its own structure and up to the Chief Constable, to relate almost exclusively--certainly meaningfully--to the Secretary of State. Community participation is being replaced by political diktat.
<P>
I was surprised to hear the Minister allude to Drumcree, as though it was a justification for clause 19. I did not hear all that the Minister said, but I do not think that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire would have suggested that the Police Authority should enshrine in its policing plan detailed instructions or procedures relating to a specific parade such as Drumcree. To suggest that that might occur is to travel into the realms of fantasy. I am surprised that the Minister made that suggestion.
<P>
I hope that we are all agreed that, operationally, the Chief Constable has the power and authority that he should have. No one will try to impinge upon--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Let me finish my point and then I shall give way. No one will try to impinge on the operational responsibilities of the Chief Constable. However, that operational responsibility must be exercised within parameters that are set by agreement among the Secretary of State--whose position and authority I recognise--the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. Each of those should have a proper role to play, and there should not be derogation. I want to speak further on the matter, and if the Minister wants to develop the point, I hope that he will do so, and accept my word that Opposition Members wish that matters were as I have outlined, but do not believe it.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It may help the Committee and it will certainly help me if the hon. Gentleman will explain what he expects will be achieved by amending the clause to require prior Police Authority approval for an operational decision of the Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The amendment does not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That would be the impact of the amendment. To argue that the Police Authority should have a right of prior approval is to argue against what has been established with respect to the Chief Constable's operational independence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am really concerned about the Minister's being so devoid of understanding of the amendment's purpose. If that is evidence of the guidance that he is receiving from his advisers, he would do much better to go away and examine the process of policing in more detail. He could then return to the Committee with a clearer understanding. The amendment does not use the word ``operational''. Where does the Minister see it in the text?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman to read clause 19(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In discharging his functions''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, in carrying out his operational role--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Chief Constable shall have regard to the annual policing plan issued under section 17.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add to that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and shall consult and seek approval''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My point is that he would be seeking approval in the discharge of his functions. The hon. Gentleman is not listening and has not understood a word of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I think that if we had a more independent audience here, more of its members would agree with me on this matter than with the Minister. In Northern Ireland, where the Bill will have effect, the Minister would have difficulty with his approach. He suggests that the phrase ``discharging his functions'' refers to specific operational issues. An example, if we are to go by what the Minister has said, would be Drumcree. It does not mean that. It means that in general terms,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in discharging his functions, the Chief Constable shall have regard to the annual policing plan''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so this is about the policing plan--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issued under section 17.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add that he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall consult and seek approval from the Police Authority before deviating substantially from it''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the general policing plan.
<P>
The Minister had better not try to tell me that that alludes to specific operations on a specific day. I hope that he will reassure me that he does not believe that the amendment--or indeed his own Bill--has anything to do with specific operations at a specific time, because it most certainly does not. The Minister is trying to confuse the Opposition. [Hon. Members: ``He has not succeded''.] Indeed, and I shall not let him get away with it.
<P>
If one reads clauses 19 and 17 together, as one must, the meaning and purpose of clause 17 is undermined. Clause 17(4)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority may adopt an annual policing plan . . . with such amendments as the Authority may, after consultation with the Chief Constable, determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am delighted to see that the Minister is running to his advisers for help now. That provision is exactly right, and there is also provision for the Police Authority, when it agrees with the Chief Constable, to consult the Secretary of State to secure further agreement. If the Secretary of State does not agree with the policing plan arrived at by the Police Authority and the Chief Constable, under clause 17(5) she will have the right to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make such amendments . . . after consultation with the Authority''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but I fear that it will not work like that.
<P>
I know that the Secretary of State has many things on her mind. I am not attacking her in saying that; none the less she has had the opportunity to speak with the Police Authority on only one occasion since she came to Northern Ireland. Society must have confidence in the Secretary of State's and her Ministers' ability to consult the Police Authority more constructively.
<P>
To consult constructively, it is not enough for the Minister to meet the Police Authority and explain the situation to it. By and large, it is a competent and knowledgeable body concerned at heart about the police and society. Versed as its members are in the complexities of policing, they do not need others to explain circumstances to them. It is important to maintain a balance between the three elements--the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable.
<P>
The Government seem to be set against a straightforward and innocuous amendment. The police division is directing a concentrated effort, through Ministers, to ensure that no one can get to the Chief Constable and that the Chief Constable cannot be required to be wholeheartedly accountable to anyone other than the Secretary of State. That negates the whole purpose of the Police Authority.
<P>
Will the Minister address my concerns in his response? He can answer ``Of course'', only with reference to what he knows of the good and honourable intentions of the present Northern Ireland ministerial team. However, policing might well be dependent on the Bill for the next 15, 20 or 25 years--or who knows how long.
<P>
I have seen what has happened during my lifetime in Parliament. When I came into Parliament there were serried ranks of Tories sitting on the Government Benches. The Government should learn a lesson from that, and realise that things do not always stay the same.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Do you want them back?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall be perpetually in Opposition in this place. I want to see good government--government to which society can relate and in which it can have confidence. If the Minister really expected me to answer his question, that is my answer.
<P>
The Minister will create a hostage to fortune with the Bill, as far as the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Authority are concerned, because the Cheif Constable is being made more and more accountable to the political hierarchy. We have seen that in clause after clause. We know the difficulties that that would create in any society, but especially in a complex political society such as that of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Will the Minister give the Committee specific reassurances on those matters? Even at this stage, I plead with him to take the decision that I know that he would wish to take, and on this occasion to ignore the dubious advice that he has received--and, indeed, that his predecessor received--about the structure of the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State.
<P>
The future of the Police Authority and of policing in Northern Ireland are bound up in the Bill to such an extent that we cannot afford mistakes about the structure of policing in Northern Ireland. At least, they are mistakes on the Minister's part, although I am not sure that they are mistakes on other peoples part.
<P>
At present there is some dubious activity relating to the structure of policing. A very dangerous study--if I can call it that--is under way. The Minister looks puzzled, and others might not understand. I need allude only to visits to Harlem, of all places, and to conferences that take place in a hotel in County Antrim, where a totally unacceptable and treacherous form or policing is being discussed. That will not work and, to put it bluntly, those of us who have concern for the welfare of society in Northern Ireland and for the rule of law can never allow it to happen. We cannot have legislation passing through this House that so derogates from the Police Authority's powers that it may as well not exist. The Minister must seriously address that issue.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I had not intended to speak again, but I do so because in a first-class speech the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made several points that have been liberated in my mind. [Interruption.] The Minister seems to be implying that I should not be speaking at this point. I merely stood, and the Chair allowed me to speak. The Government are now trying to prevent Opposition Members from expressing their views, which is unheard-of in the Committee.
<P>
The Minister continues to misrepresent our position, which--I say this in the best possible sense--may simply be due to the fact that he is reliant on the advice he receives from his officials. They no doubt have a view, but it may not be correct. The hope of hon. Members on this side of the Committee is that the Minister will put a cold towel around his head tonight or tomorrow, or whenever it is convenient, and go though the arguments himself and reach his own conclusion about what we are trying to say. The Minister looks angry, but we, too, are rather pumped up about the issue, and we will not allow it to go away.
<P>
To go some way towards assuaging our fears, the Minister should meet the chairman or chief executive of the Police Authority because, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, the substance of the amendment emanates from the Police Authority. The Minister may find our views on the subject suspect. That is understandable, but it is not a view that I would have taken if I had been in his position--[Interruption.] I shall wait until the private conversation ends.
<P>
If the Minister were to agree to speak to those in the Police Authority who inspired the amendment, that would go some way to assuring me that he was listening completely to the argument and that if I were deficient in putting forward the strongly-held views of the Police Authority, it would be able to fill in what I had left out.
<P>
The fact that the amendment orginates from the Police Authority means that it must be taken seriously. We cannot just say, ``There is not much substance to this'' and fling it away. It has not come from some fly-by-night outfit. The Minister tried to say, in relation to finance, that the body we discussed this morning may not be in the best position to make judgments about policing.
<P>
He may well be correct, and I will not fence with him about that. However, he and I will not argue about the fact that the Police Authority is in pole position when it comes to having authoritative, well-judged views on policing in the Province and its administration and control. I did not think that the Minister would demur from that. I hope that he will give me some indication about that. His not taking the opportunity to agree with me is obviously a rather stunning statement about the Police Authority and its members, which I am sure he would not want left on the record.
<P>
All this originates from that authoritative body, which seems not to be prepared to lie down and accept what the Government say without demurring or making a fuss; it wants to press these issues. What might be on its members' minds--I cannot say with any authority that it is on their minds, but it might be--is the question of the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. Without doubt, that requires a delicate balance and depends on a number of factors, not least of which are personalities. Some personalities will make it work, others will not. That being so, there must be a framework within whatever system we are talking about. Conservative Members feel that the relationship between the two is important.
<P>
The Minister must convince us and the authority. It feels strongly about this, which is why we felt it necessary to table the amendment. We have gone to some lengths to table it as best we can. If the Minister cannot convince the Police Authority, but forces on it measures with which it does not agree and which it does not accept, he will start off on the worst possible footing. A priori, a dissatisfied police authority is not the best position from which to start. That is another problem that the Minister will have. If we do not obtain proper answers, we will have to push the matter elsewhere, perhaps more than once.
<P>
I am not sure that my next suggestion is feasible, but I think that it is. The views of the Chief Constable are clearly important, although we of course accept that he cannot speak publicly; he has a position to maintain. Nevertheless, he has views. If the Minister could send, by Privy Councillor means, the appropriate signal to the shadow Secretary of State from the Secretary of State to the effect that what we are saying is erroneous, that would go some way towards assuaging the situation.
<P>
Either way, the Minister has many questions to answer. If we are not satisfied with his answers, we shall have to ask those questions again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The word ``treachery'' was used by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) against myself by implication. If it was not against me, it was against officials; if not against officials, it was against the Chief Constable; and if not against the Chief Constable, who was it used against?
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman accusing of treachery those who are trying to bring about a different and, we would argue, better approach in terms of the tripartite arrangements between the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State?
<P>
The word has been bandied about. It is a heavily emotive one, but the hon. Gentleman is not precise about who he alleges is carrying out these acts of treachery, as he puts it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also said that the legislation was being driven through regardless of people's interests or views. He has only just come into the Committee and was not present to hear what was said this morning. I do not know where he was; that is a matter for him. If, he thinks that treachery is behind the Bill, I should have thought that he would be here for every second of our deliberations in case he missed a major piece of treachery about which he could have put us right. But he does not, of course--he drifts in and out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have never heard such patent nonsense; it is designed to make me as cross as the Minister seems to become with great ease. I am not the sort of person who can be wound up by a single implied insult. The hon. Gentleman will have to maintain his attack for some considerable time before he gets the same reaction from me. He says that I have implied treachery against the Chief Constable, against him and against someone else. He has seen what I have written--indeed, he has it in his possession. He knows where I consider the treachery exists, and he would be embarrassed if I elaborated further on that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have gone far enough down that road, and I hope that we can now return to order and the amendment before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) is grateful for your protection, Mr. Atkinson. I did not intend to proceed down this road, but a word was mentioned and I felt it important that it be referred to. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman was talking about, so I could not have responded to him anyway.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the Minister please heed the Chair and return to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Certainly, Mr. Atkinson--I was just about to do so.
<P>
We have heard references to clause 17 as part of the debate on the amendment. Opposition Members said that there was now no need to have clause 17 on the statute book because they had another look at the Bill and did not think that it was necessary. I look forward with great interest to seeing them vote against clause 17 on Report. Clause 17 does exactly the same as the provisions that apply in England and Wales. Clause 19 does the very same as the provisions that apply in England and Wales, which were introduced by the Conservative Government. Now Opposition Members are saying that they do not want clause 17 because it is redundant, and they do not believe that it gives any power to the Police Authority. They have not read clause 17--it does give new power and authority to the Police Authority, and gives it an important role within the tripartite structure. When Opposition Members hand out the insults, I am careful not to respond in insulting terms. However, it would be of benefit if they would only read the Bill and understand it.
<P>
Let us consider the need for consultation between the various strands of the tripartite structure. We all share that view. The Secretary of State has constructed objectives in consultation. The Police Authority has drawn up its objectives, again in consultation. The chief constable has drafted a plan; the Police Authority has approved that plan, the Secretary of State is considering it, and it will be published very shortly. This has been carried out in a process of consultation between the three legs of the tripartite structure. It shows that it works in practice in terms of the new powers vested in the various strands, or legs, of the tripartite structure. We have planned ahead, we have seen whether it can work, and it is now working in practice. I hope that when the plan is published it will be consistent with some of the views and objectives of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. But I know that he has not totally signed up to everything that we try to do in the governance of Northern Ireland, and he will probably find some basis upon which to object to it.
<P>
The amendment is the core of an important debate: it is about the operational independence of the Chief Constable. I suspect that I shall not be able to convince the hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness and for North-East Cambridgeshire. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone arrived late to the debate, I will refer him to the amendment, which says that there should be an obligation under clause 19(2) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consult and seek approval from the Policy Authority before deviating substantially from it''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, from the police plan.
<P>
We have considered issues that could represent a substantial deviation from the plan. Let us say that there was a major upsurge in drug activity in the Province, which was not accounted for in the plan. The Chief Constable might determine that he had to take action, but under the amendment, he would have to seek approval before doing so. I pose again the question that was never answered: what happens if approval is not given? The Chief Constable will be left with the wish to take action after he has consulted and sought approval.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Where stands the proper policing of Northern Ireland in those circumstances? The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not answer that question and I hesitate to ask the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to answer it. I am sure that he will have an answer, although I hope that he will answer the question that is posed to him. I see that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone wishes to speak again. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn and that clause 19 stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Like the Conservative spokesman, I did not intend to have a second bite at the cherry because I had discussed the points that I wanted to make at some length. I could not, however, deal with the matter through interventions.
<P>
There has been a concentrated attack on my presence or non-presence in the Committee. That is not insulting to me, but it is an insult to my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker). The Minister has been absent from the Committee, and his colleague has filled in adequately for him. In the light of his eight or nine months at the Northern Ireland Office, I should have thought that he would understand some of the difficulties besetting the talks process, direct rule and work in the House. I will say no more about that, except to answer the points that the Minister carefully ensured were on the record. My attendance and record in the Committee speak for themselves. I will not test your patience, Mr. Atkinson, by proceeding further along that line of argument.
<P>
The Minister does not answer the point that I regularly put to him. He is all over the place when he tries to respond. He says, ``Look at this particular little snippet of the Bill. It answers the question of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.'' I am sorry, but it does not.
<P>
Nobody is suggesting that clause 17 should not be part of the Bill. I listened to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire as well. If I understood him correctly--it is up to him to tell us if I did--he said that clause 17 might as well not be in the Bill because clause 19 negates it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Yes, that is exactly what I said. In the context of clause 19, clause 17 is a waste of space. I did not say that it should be taken out of the Bill; my point was that the two clauses do not go together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I hope that the Minister is equally grateful to me for clarifying the point for him. He would do well to listen to what we say. Irrespective of whether we disagree with the tenor of the Bill, he must recognise that we come here with years of experience of the difficulties of policing in Northern Ireland. The matter is not helped by legislation such as the Bill, which enshrines the diminution of one legitimate channel of communication that stretches from grass roots in the CPLCs up to the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am puzzled because although the amendment is about substantial deviation from the policing plan, neither the hon. Gentleman nor the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire have defined substantial deviation, or given examples of it. Will the hon. Gentleman give an example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am delighted by that helpful intervention. I said earlier that deviation from the policing plan does not happen at a specific time or place. I referred to Drumcree, as did the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman asked a question--I insist that he has his answer.
<P>
The Minister said that it could be Drumcree--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> A deviation could relate to a single set of events. The hon. Gentleman keeps bringing Drumcree into the debate, in relation to an example given by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. I was responding to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not mind who raised the issue of Drumcree. It was a single, specific incident. It is most unlikely that any policing plan would refer to a specific incident. A series of related incidents could occur--whether they involved dealing with parades, drugs or protests--that would be dealt with by a policing plan. The Chief Constable would make a substantial variation to deal with the whole problem, rather than with specific incidents.
<P>
If that happened, the trust and relationship between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable would be undermined, unless there was a mechanism and an obligation, as proposed by the amendment, for him to reconcile himself, to explain and to discuss with the Police Authority the reason for his deviation from the plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am listening with interest. The hon. Gentleman has not referred to a specific incident. He did say, if I remember correctly, that a series of related incidents might occur. Would the Chief Constable seek Police Authority approval before the first incident? When would he do so, if he did not know that the other incidents would occur?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In many ways that would depend. If the Chief Constable found himself with an operational hazard, he might have to make a change, but that may not indicate a deviation from the accepted policy that he would apply in dealing with a range of similar incidents. In that instance his operational independence would rightly be brought into effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Will the hon. gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I can see what the tactic is here and I shall give way, but not when I am in the middle of dealing with a specific issue.
<P>
If, on the other hand, the Chief Constable could foresee a problem, and perhaps a succession of similar problems, that required him to deviate from the policing plan, it would be incumbent on him to go to the Police Authority and say, ``What we agreed won't work. I must adopt a more draconian approach on this range of related issues. I want to devise with you a way to present this approach to the public so that they understand what we are doing.'' That is partnership. I am sure that the Minister will not tell me that he disagrees with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If the Chief Constable wishes, to use the hon Gentleman's terms, to bring in a more draconian set of measures--I do not quite know what he means by that--and the Police Authority says, ``No, we will not agree to that'', and the amendment says that he must seek prior approval, whose side would the Minister take, the Police Authority's or the Chief Constable's?
<P>
<B>Mr Maginnis:</B> Again it is the trick question, ``Have you stopped beating your wife?'' I reassure the Minister that I know the answer to that question. If he can cite an example of reasonableness on the part of both the Chief Constable and the Police Authority, and yet show that they have been unable to be reconciled over an issue, I shall deal with the hypothetical question; but at the end of the day both may have to go to the Secretary of State. One may say, ``This would be a disaster,'' and the other may say, ``This is essential if we are to maintain the rule of law'', the Secretary of State would have to decide.
<P>
That is why we have a Chief Constable and pay him a lot of money. We do not always succeed, but I believe that on this occasion we have succeeded in finding a Chief Constable like Jack Herman and Ken Newman, who had the competence to deal with such issues. I can think of another Chief Constable not too long departed from us who did not, but I shall not pursue that issue.
<P>
Ultimately there must be a responsibility on the Chief Constable, in those circumstances, to make the final decision. The amendment does not detract from that ultimate responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, it does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, I shall not give way at the moment. The Minister will have an opportunity to speak before I sit down. Ultimately--sorry, I did not mean ultimately--[Interruption.] I am sure that that is funny; I hope the Minister never says the wrong word when he is being harassed.
<P>
Normally, such matters are agreed if there is such a mechanism. The amendment ensures that the mechanism plus the obligation is there. The Minister did not know what I meant by the word draconian. I would not like to leave any issue unresolved for him. When I spoke of the Chief Constable having to take a decision that was perhaps draconian, I meant that the decision was something that he would not wish to take in more normal circumstances because of the way in which it might affect his relationship with the public. I know from personal experience that the Chief Constable and the RUC seek a relationship with the public based on co-operation, on trust and on what is best for society. We shall not get very far if we analyse every word that is common parlance so as to suggest that the argument itself is flawed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This is an important issue. The hon. Gentleman is associating himself with an amendment that states that the Chief Constable should go to the Police Authority before substantially deviating from the policing plan. He is unable to give an example of what that means, apart from one where the Chief Constable finds, after a series of incidents, that he is operating in a way that is different from the policing plan. If the amendment is passed, we must implement the measures in the amendment.
<P>
If I were Chief Constable, how would I know when to go to the Police Authority; and how could I be challenged, when the very example that the hon. Gentleman used would be apparent only after a series of incidents? This is not workable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister asks me how he would know, if he were the Chief Constable. I am reaching my response to his points. His understanding of practical policing shows that he would be a poor Chief Constable and probably would not know when to go to the Police Authority.
<P>
The Chief Constable is a consummate policeman and will know whether he is facing a situation in which he must make a decision and then discuss the matter with the Police Authority, or whether he intends to deviate substantially. To deviate substantially suggests that the Chief Constable is setting a new rule of thumb, in terms of dealing with a series of incidents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman give examples?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not intend to give the Minister more examples. That would probably apply only to parades, violent opposition to parades, demonstrations that were designed to undermine law and order, and methods of policing the funerals of terrorists who were killed while engaged in acts of terrorism. I hope that the last eventuality will not arise in future, because I should like to see an end to terrorism--but previous Chief Constables have had to deal with those practical issues. I know from experience that discussions had to be held between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.
<P>
Let us consider circumstances in which the drugs problem in Northern Ireland had been exacerbated by imports of huge quantitites of hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and the approach to drugs had previously been agreed in a policing plan. The Chief Constable might decide that his powers and the measures that he had taken were inadqueate, so he needed to deviate substantially from the plan that he had agreed with the Police Authority. If the amendment were accepted, the Chief Constable would have the opportunity to discuss that with the Police Authority before deviating from the plan. He should do that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The terms of the amendment are to ``seek approval from the Police Authority''.
What would happen if approval was not given?
Mr. Maginnis: The Minister asks a hypothetical question. When, in the Ministers experience, has approval not been given?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We do not seek to amend the Bill. The clause takes account of current circumstances and improves upon them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That is a miserable argument. The Minister asks a hypothetical question because he wants us to be nonplussed. The Minister agreed that there had not been a head-to-head confrontation between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority that could not be resolved. If that is the case, we cannot legislate for confrontations.
<P>
	I can remember matters that were agreed without the sort of consultation that the amendment might encourage. A previous Chief Constable surrendered the RUC's right to make intelligence assessments to guide Government, and ceded that responsibility to another security agency. I disapprove of that. Ministers know that I do not want to create tensions between two security agencies; those who collect and collate intelligence are often best placed to make assessments. I see you looking at me, Mr. Atkinson but I am not deviating--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Substantially.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am not deviating substantially or otherwise when I raise this issue. A series of incidents have not been foreseen by the agency that is now responsible for assessing intelligence. There should be better understanding, but perhaps it is a sensitive area that the Police Authority does not touch on. I can understand that up to a point, but it is wrong to have such a substantive change in the way in which we deal with that aspect of policing. I simply highlight it to illustrate what we are trying to achieve here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I will, but the Minister should not tempt me further. I do know the practical difficulties of policing on the ground and I have known them since 1958 when I first put on a police uniform. I ask him to remember that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The amendment aims to deviate substantially from the police plan. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he is not foreseeing circumstances where security policy would be referred by the Chief Constable to the Police Authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I know the point that the Minister is making. I have already conceded that there would be areas of national security with which the Police Authority would not concern itself. I pointed out the difference that was ceded in terms of intelligence assessment. I was merely using that as an example of where allowing a Chief Constable to operate independently and without giving an account was a fundamental mistake. The nation is paying for that mistake today.
<P>
The practical issues that the Police Authority would have to deal with are numerous. They cover the whole ambit of practical policing. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.
<P>
The CAJ is not a body with which I am normally at one. Those who sit in ivory towers have the best of intentions and can foresee a utopia that is not always possible in practical terms. Even those in the CAJ have concluded that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is the important issue of more democratic accountability both as regards any Policy Authority and for any eventual community level bodies established to advise on policing.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not have a clue what the community-level bodies are--unless they are community policing liaison committees, in which case, once again, I do not differ from the Committee on the Administration of Justice.
<P>
The Committee believes that it would be good practice to give the Police Authority substantial authority, and not treat it in an offhand manner, as the Bill does with such phrases as ``The Police Authority shall . . .'' or ``The Police Authority will . . .'', followed by a clawing back of authority under a provision that it may do something only if the Secretary of State agrees. These are not good legislative proposals, nor are they good practice for a police force such as the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which has to operate under extremely difficult circumstances.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I do not propose to repeat myself but, in the light of the Minister's speech, I must say something by way of a concession. The Minister and the Under-Secretary frequently threw at us the fact that the amendment could hamper the Chief Constable considerably in an emergency.
<P>
From where the Government stand, that is precisely the effect that they envisage. However, it would be clear to a blind man that the Police Authority does not want such a situation to occur. I have spoken to its members often enough to know that they also take that view. The Police Authority does not want to trammel the Chief Constable. The Government have not addressed the fact that the amendment was inspired by the Police Authority.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was immensely articulate in his request for examples. The great art of this business is that we are here to ask questions, and the Government are here to answer them. The Under-Secretary has done nothing other than read out the brief. I told him--it rattles me that he did not even refer to it--that I intended to go back to the Police Authority to find out much more of the detail of its objection. The Police Authority does not speak about the emergencies of which the Minister and his colleague spoke because, clearly, it cannot. I am not an expert in these matters so I have to rely on those who are. My feeling is that what might concern the Police Authority is a possible change in policing style, or something like it.
<P>
Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and I should visit the Police Authority to discover exactly what is causing concern, and Ministers should do the same. By this means we shall establish whether it is we, or the Government, who are talking tosh, and we may identify a genuine worry in the Police Authority. After all, it did not come to this problem yesterday. It has had considerable responsibilities and will have them when the Bill is enacted. For that reason we should listen to it. That is all I have to say to the Minister, who I hope will tell us that he will do the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have a simple question for the hon. Gentleman. He thinks that he has the right to ask questions and that we do not. I am trying to understand his logic. If I understood him correctly, he said that it did not matter what Ministers said because they would not always be Ministers--so assurances in Hansard are unimportant. He now tells the Committee that he went back to the Police Authority to find out what it had in mind. What about future police authorities? Should not legislation take account of all possible eventualities? Whatever assurances are given on this occasion cannot hold future police authorities on the same basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made that point, not me. Nevertheless, the point was made and it has to be answered. I am trying to be as reasonable as possible, but the Minister must recognise our concerns. We are not taking up the Committee's time for the sake of it: I would prefer to do other things and I do not like this sort of relationship. However, we remain concerned, and all that the Minister and the Government can do is to examine the Police Authority's concerns more carefully. They must ask its advice on this specific point. That would enable us to tie down who has it right and who has it wrong.
<P>
I repeat that the amendment was inspired by the Police Authority. Would it not make sense for us to ascertain its concerns in detail? I say we, but the Opposition cannot do much about it; we can only articulate those concerns. However, the Government are in a position to assuage the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I want to comment on the Minister's question. There is a major difference between future legislatures--I use the word advisedly because responsibility could move to a legislature in Northern Ireland--which devise policy and future police authorities which implement policy. The Police Authority does not create policy, so the Minister's question is largely irrelevant. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am not sure that I agree that the Police Authority does not create policy. I recall writing a paper at university in which I demonstrated that policy is made at all levels in the governmental machine, sometimes unintentionally. Irrespective of whether the Police Authority makes policy, any Government would be exceedingly wise in formulating policy to take into account the views of the Police Authority. I have repeatedly asked it but I want the Minister to respond--will he do what we would do and go back to the Police Authority to ascertain more facts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I tried to intervene earlier on that point. The hon. Gentleman has gone back to the Police Authority, which has given him words to say and thoughts to think, and he has relayed them to us. He is now saying that he will find out whether the Police Authority has the same views after our debate. If it changes its position, he will change his position. This is a politician arguing not from conviction but from diktat. I am trying to convince hon. Members, who will be voting on the amendment, of the merits of the argument.
<P>
The Government are always in consultation with the Police Authority and the issues will certainly be examined further. I assumed that and did not feel that it would be necessary to explain it time and again in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> That was a long and ungracious intervention. In a way I am sorry that I gave way to the Minister, for whom I had come to have considerable respect. He took my endless teasing with good grace, but his jibe was unnecessary. I am replying more in sorrow than in anger; the amendment's intention is not that the Police Authority should say what it originally meant, but that it should be asked for more information about its concerns. Even if I disagree with the Minister, we shall not push the amendments to a vote: I shall use the opportunity to ask him for more details to give to those who are concerned about the matter. I grow more, not less, concerned about the fact that the Minister seems unwilling to meet the Police Authority to chat over the issue, because his own Police Authority inspired the amendment.
<P>
I repeat, I will go to see the Police Authority to discover whether this long debate has been a waste of time or whether there has been some point to it.

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> But it is true. The proposal strikes at the heart of accountability. The Minister does not believe what is staring him in the face. A number of bodies, including the Police Authority, are asking how we can make the Chief Constable accountable to the public for his actions. This is not about operational autonomy or control of the police. In the end, if the Chief Constable makes a mistake or does something outside his normal parameters and functions, who will pick up the tab? Who will call him to account? That is what this is about. The proposal is fundamental; it is as important as anything in the Bill. That is why we have had such a long debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman give an example of a Chief Constable making a mistake for which he should be held to account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> For goodness' sake, we keep returning to examples of this, that and the other. Legislation is supposed to be drafted on the basis of what might happen, not what always has happened. Plenty of clauses refer to such matters, but we are talking about a situation that might happen--
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> You cannot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> What does the hon. Gentleman mean? There are situations in which a Chief Constable may take action. I do not know which Chief Constables, and what actions they may take which are not within the law or within the confines of their functions. We are discussing who is seen to be responsible. The Police Authority is supposed to be responsible for drawing up a policing plan. It is the Police Authority's plan, which the Chief Constable implements, but according to clause 19, he has only to ``have regard'' to it. Most of us know what deviation means; if the Chief Constable deviates from the plan and does not implement it, who calls him to account? That is a simple question.
<P>
It is no good the Minister saying, ``Well, the 1996 Act has been transposed to the Bill.'' That has been done in clause 19, but not in respect of the annual policing plan. The Minister cannot argue that the Bill should have a bit of this and a bit of that, because that would be inconsistent. Clause 17 requires the Police Authority to send the plan to the Secretary of State, who can amend it. The Secretary of State has no such requirements or powers under the 1996 Act. The Bill differs in terms of how the annual policing plan comes about. Section 8, subsection 8(5) of the Police Act 1996 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A Police Authority shall arrange for every local policing plan issued by it under this section to be published in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate, and shall send a copy of the plan to the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The authority sends only a copy of the plan.

<P>
On resuming--[Ms Ann Widdecombe in the Chair]
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I was coming to a conclusion of a kind.
<P>
<B>Shona McIsaac </B>(Cleethorpes): Ha, ha.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is kind of you to laugh at that. You are new to this sort of arrangement. I apologise for using the word ``you'', Miss Widdecombe. The hon. Lady will have to take note of how such matters are handled. There is not a statutory 45 minutes or one hour per clause, and I say to Labour Members that if there is an important matter, albeit a small but crucial amendment, we will speak to it until such time as we are satisfied with the counter-arguments that are being used. Even now, all we hear are declamatory statements: ``This is how it is--take it ot leave it.'' That is not the way forward. This issue is fundamemtal; it is possibly the most important issue in the Bill.
<P>
We have made no secret of the fact that the amendment was suggested to us by the Police Authority, but there has been no recognition of that, even though the authority sent its list of amendments and arguments to the Minister and his officials. The Police Authority is concerned about the issue.
<P>
It is no good the Minister telling us what the 1996 Act for England and Wales says. Clause 10, which relates to the general functions of Chief Constables, is pretty much transposed across from that Act, but the section that deals with local policing plans is quite different. The Government cannot argue that the Bill is the same as the Act in one context, but different from it in another. The Bill is different from the Act in clause 17, which will allow the Secretary of State, yet again, to move in and fundamentally change or even rewrite the whole policing plan, and nobody could do a thing about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in the end it matters not whether the Minister convinces him or me, or any Opposition Member, but that he convinces those such as the members of the Police Authority? Is it not disturbing that they are not convinced? Does he further agree that light would be shed on the matter if the Minister agreed to meet the Police Authority to discuss it in precisely the same manner as some Opposition Members have been prepared to do? One can only conclude that the Minister has been stunningly silent about a meeting with members of the Police Authority because he has already met them and has had no joy whatsoever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Yes, I agree. I think my hon. Friend meant that the Police Authority had had no joy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Not the Minister.
<P>
I do not know whether that issue was discussed, but it is fundamental. In clause 17, the Police Authority is apparently being set at the top of the annual policing plan, for which it is responsible. In terms of public perception, it is the body to which the public can and will turn if something goes wrong with the annual policing plan. Clause 19 states that the Chief Constable should have regard to the annual policing plan. As the Minister has admitted, however, the Chief Constable can do something that is not covered by the plan without being accountable to anyone, let alone to the Police Authority.
<P>
We discussed the fundamental review of policing at great length last week. It contains summary and key findings and was written, among others, by the Chief Constable. He talks about the way forward for policing, and chapter 4 is entitled ``Vision of Policing''. Chapter 4.1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In its work, the review accepted that the purpose of the police service is to uphold the law fairly and firmly; to prevent crime; to pursue and bring to justice those who break the law; to keep the peace; to protect, help and reassure the community; and to be seen to do this with integrity, common sense and sound judgement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Chapter 4.2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The review concluded that the achievement of those objectives required the police service to be responsive to the needs of the community at a local level.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before I go on with the key findings report, we should ask what those words actually mean. If they mean anything, it is that there has to be feedback up the chain of command from the public and communitities to the authorities--in this case, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. The only vehicle at hand to do that is the Police Authority. Its task is to take public opinion into account and to listen carefully to what the public wants. Its task under clause 17 is to publish the annual policing plan
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The law therefore says that the police authority ``shall''--not ``may''--issue a plan before the beginning of each financial year. We are told later that the Chief Constable prepares the draft of that plan, so he is fundamental to setting it up. He will tell the Police Authority exactly what he wants in the plan, not only for the next year, but, according to clause 16, for the three to five years of his strategic plan.
<P>
Either we have a good Chief Constable or we do not. We have an excellent Chief Constable at the moment; he is brilliant. He will not overlook the fact that he has to accommodate flexibility in his policing plans. He has to make sure that he can act at a moment's notice when he needs to; there is no question but that he will build that into his plan. I know that we should not personalise such matters; we are writing legislation for all sorts of future conditions and for different Chief Constables. We all accept that during consultation--the three-legged structure--any Chief Constable worth his or her salt will say, ``I need to build contingency provisions in. I need to make sure that I can react quickly and effectively in operational terms to any threat''.
<P>
The Government are prepared to include clause 17, which sets the Police Authority up as responsible for and vital to establishing the police plan. Conservative Members are saying very strongly that if the Government are prepared to do that, why deny the authority any powers later on to bring the Chief Constable to account if he or she departs fundamentally--I know that I am using different words, but I am not going to get hooked up on the words themselves--[Interruption.] It is all right to scoff, but the Minister has not answered the fundamental point.
<P>
How will members of the Police Authority stand up in the community when faced with criticism about a departure from a policing plan that was seemingly agreed by the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable and which the Government published and put in the public domain so that everyone knew what it was? If the public see a Chief Constable--not the present one--deviating fundamentally from what was agreed, to whom do they turn? To whom do they say, ``What are you doing about this? Why are you letting this Chief Constable get away with it? On whose behalf is he doing it?.
<P>
The Police Authority will simply point to clause 19 and say, ``Sorry. There is nothing we can do, because the law says that the Chief Constable shall simply have regard to what we agreed.'' We the public have no comeback. We cannot say to him or her, ``We agreed this policing plan. We allowed you contingencies. We gave you massive operational autonomy and yet you are doing things way outside the policing plan. Everyone knows it, but we cannot bring you to account.''
<P>
The Minister could say in the course of his arguments against the amendment that the Government understand the concerns of the Police Authority and the Opposition's arguments, but that the measure is about accountability and the public perception of who is in charge and who is responsible. He could argue that we had overlooked the fact that those matters are dealt with in a section or schedule and that the Government had anticipated and were dealing with the problem in that way. But he has not said any of that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 48. Will he explain how he views that clause relative to his argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the Minister was listening to me before we broke off for dinner, he would know that I talked about clauses 47 and 48. I flagged up the possibility that they were the relevant provisions, but he never picked up on that. He never said, ``Yes, you're right--they are the important provisions.'' I also made the point, strongly, that reports are fine, but they take weeks if not months to compile, edit and produce, by which time the Police Authority will have been pilloried in the press.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if there is a confrontation between the authority and the Chief Constable, reports will achieve the very thing that we have not had to date: an irreconcilable difference between the authority and the Chief Constable? We are trying to secure a method whereby there can be on-going reconciliation of any differences that may occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point extremely well and I agree with it. I heard the Minister mutter ``interference''. I do not understand how he can throw that accusation at Conservative Members with our record in Government, not only in Northern Ireland but in terms of the 1994 and 1996 police legislation in England and Wales. That is not our approach; we want chief constables to have the freedom and flexibility to get on with the job, but we also--[Interruption.] In that case the Minister should say, ``The words you have used in your amendment do not achieve what you want to achieve'', but he has not said that. He has not said that the problem can be dealt with in another way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> He called it ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Precisely--he called it ludicrous. He seems completely to ignore the feelings of the Police Authority, which is accountable to the public for the delivery of the policing plan. If the Chief Constable chooses to deviate substantially, whatever words are chosen to describe the matter, the Police Authority is accountable and will be subject to criticism.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to the fundamental review. Section 4.2 states that the ``responsiveness involved . . . a partnership''. I am quoting the words of the Chief Constable that the Minister seemed to describe last week as being carved in tablets of stone from Mount Sinai. I am mixing the Old Testament with the New Testament, but the Committee understands what I am getting at. The review states that the responsiveness involves
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a partnership to be forged between the public and its police service based upon a common understanding of the priorities and needs of the community''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The community may say clearly that it understands that the Police Authority is responsible for the annual policing plan, and that it agrees with it and understands it. If events then occur that are massively different from the policing plan, would not the community have every right--in terms of that one statement in the review--to ask what was going on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> On more than one occasion in the Committee, reference has been made to the fact that there may be conflict between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. Everybody wishes to ensure that such conflict does not occur--it would not be in the public interest in any way, shape or form.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Government do not address the issue, and that if the Minister simply retreats in the manner in which he has been retreating, exactly the thing that none of us wants will arise--conflict? There will be an impossible relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. If the Chief Constable does something that the Police Authority does not agree with, in the widest sense of the word, who will answer to the community? Does my hon Friend agree that the Minister will reinforce conflict and not reduce it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do indeed. The matter is at the heart of the debate, and yet the Minister seems either incapable of accepting that a principle is at stake--forget the wording of the amendment--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Come on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The meaning behind the amendment is important--it is about accountability--[Interruption.] What a facetious and ludicrous remark from a sedentary position--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendment attempts to convey meaning. The essential point is that the Police Authority wishes to have its role strengthened in relation to accountability. The Minister could have said hours ago that he recognised the principle that is involved. He could have acknowledged the need to give the Police Authority at least some help in facing the public with regard to the delivery of its policing plan so that if a Chief Constable steps out of line in future there is some means of bringing him to account. If he had done so, the Opposition would not have gone on as long as we have. [Laughter.] They scoff again--they cannot understand that some things are important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman now asks me to ignore the amendent. He has had an hour and half since we last discussed it, and he has not come up with any concept other than the underlying principle, which the Committee debated at considerable length. The Government set out the relative positions of the Police Authority, of the Chief Constable and of the Secretary of State in the tripartite structure, and the way in which the Bill adds to what the Police Authority is doing in preparing a policing plan instead of taking away from it. The Bill does not dilute its power; it increases it.
<P>
We have taken the argument on board. The hon. Gentleman clearly has not been listening and he has not made good use of the adjournment to think of something else. If we are asked to ignore the amendment, let us proceed through the rest of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am not sure that there was a question there and whether it was a worthy intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister may recall that I made precisely that point in my last speech, when I said that the Minister is driven to the conclusion that our amendment has the wrong effect. But I said to the Minister that the way to solve the problem was to ask the people who inspired the amendment, the Police Authority, so that we can get behind the argument. The Minister is looking wan, but does my hon. Friend not agree that that is the way to resolve this problem between the Opposition and the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In part I do, but we are not here just--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree, or does he not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I said ``in part'' I agree. I was going on to say that, fundamentally, we are not just the mouthpiece of the Police Authority. We are simply saying that it is still unhappy. The important thing is for the Minister and his team to talk to the Police Authority and square the matter with it. If that is what they are doing, fine, but I suspect that they are not. If the Police Authority is prepared, because of instructions, to say ``That amendment is not important any more'', fine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that the Police Authority is still unhappy. How does he know?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Among my papers is a letter that I received today from the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That was before the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It does not write to me every day on each amendment that is coming up, but it is still concerned about these issues of principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is saying that he received the letter before the debate. We have had a debate. How does he know that the Police Authority is still unhappy following the explanations that have been given during the debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Forgive me, but how does the Minister know that it is not? It is a matter of opinion. Does the Minister think that the answers that he has given to the questions and the arguments that we have posed have turned the Police Authority around full circle?
<P>
	We will clearly not make any progress. We are not here simply to prolong matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): The hon. Gentleman could have fooled me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Government have seen five clauses stand part without debate and no amendments. You may well get--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will not get anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg your pardon, Miss Widdecombe. The Whip's idea that every clause has a statutory 45 minutes' debate and then we move on is utter nonsense and strikes at the heart of the Committee's purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Less than 45 minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants less than 45 minutes--all right, 30 minutes or whatever it is. This is an important provision.
<P>
	The Government may make progress more easily after clause 19 because no amendments have been tabled, or those that have will be taken quite quickly. That is not the point. If Labour Members want to finish by a certain date, they must tell us what the date is and we will discuss it with them. We are not prolonging the debate for the sake of it. This is a vital provision, and the Government will not use arguments that reassure us that the principle is being accommodated and addressed elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Will my hon. Friend shed some light on this question, because we are not getting any light from the Minister and his colleagues? The Minister made great play tonight about the fact that he is meeting representatives of the Committee on the Administration of Justice on a certain date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister himself will not be meeting representatives, but his officials or somebody else will. Will he shed light on the differences between that committee and the Police Authority? Why cannot the Minister say that the Police Authority will be accorded exactly the same treatment as the CAJ?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is a question, posed through me to the Minister, and he must answer it in his own good time.
<P>
The theme is the same from both parties; the Police Authority and the CAJ are saying the same thing. The Minister claims that the arguments are irrelevant, but they are not. The issue goes to the heart of the Bill. We shall certainly revisit it later, because it is fundamental. I shall continue to quote the so-called summary of key findings:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``close co-operation between the police service and other agencies of Government, local government, business and voluntary sectors to address common problems; policing which is community based, able to recognise the individual issues facing specific communities; and a police service working with respective communities to tackle those issues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I rest my case.
<P>
If those words mean anything and if the line of communication through the Police Authority, which is responsible for that community interface, is cut off, how can people make their views known? On the one hand they see an agreed and published policing plan, but on the other they see a Chief Constable who is doing something completely different, outside the confines of that policing plan. How are those aspirations to be met if the Police Authority's importance is cut off in this context? There is no accountability in the Bill.
<P>
If there is accountability in the Bill, let the Minister explain where it occurs. It is no good saying that clauses 47 and 48 deal with the issue; we have already discussed the fact that the reports are issued subsequently. We are discussing something that happens within a day or a week. The community responds by asking the Police Authority, ``What are you doing about this? This is outside the confines of the policing plan.'' The Police Authority replies, ``Tough; there is nothing that we can do.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman deal with the specifics of the amendment, and the specific point that relates to the phrase ``seek approval''? I have asked him, and other hon. Gentlemen who have contributed today on the issue, what happens if there is no approval. Does that mean that the Chief Constable cannot act outwith the plan? Where is his operational independence then?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister keeps returning to this issue. We are discussing a policing plan that is flexible, and the common sense that will prevail between the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and, under clause 17, the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has an immense power to rewrite the whole thing. Unless the Secretary of State is blind to what is going on, his imprint will be on the plan.
<P>
A flexible policing plan will then be agreed. We have discussed this issue so many times. There will be contingencies, and flexibility from the Chief Constable. If the Chief Constable approaches the Police Authority and seeks approval, does the Minister believe that in an operational sense, which is critical to people's safety, it will withhold approval? The Police Authority is requesting only to be consulted on the issue. If one deviates from the plan, one must explain to the Police Authority. At the moment, the Chief Constable can do what he wants, of his own volition. The clause does not state that the Chief Constable must adhere to the policing plan that was agreed by the tripartite structure. It states that he must ``have regard to'' the plan. That formulation is loose--too loose if the Police Authority's public stance will have to be, ``We take ownership of this approach, but--forgive us--the Chief Constable has decided to go off on a tangent, and we can do nothing about that.''
<P>
I shall not press the matter to a vote; I shall withdraw the amendment. However, the issue is a key one and we shall return to it.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am sorry, Miss Widdecombe, that you were not here earlier to hear the Minister's contribution to the debate. I was prepared to listen to his point of view, but I have heard nothing constructive this evening. I have heard insult--both direct and by innuendo--and I have experienced evasion. I have seen a comic Fronts Bench duo playing to each other. However, nothing that I have heard has gone beyond such remarks as the suggestion to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that in articulating the Police Authority's view he was cribbing somebody else's ideas. That suggests to me that the Minister has not learned to listen to the people in Northern Ireland who are deeply concerned about and committed to the issue of policing. To refer repeatedly to cribs, when the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was trying to appeal to a significant body of opinion, strikes me as quite insulting.
<P>
I have not cited in my remarks the information that I have received from the Police Authority. I have been, perhaps, presumptuous enough to rely on my own experience over exactly 40 years in which I have been associated, directly and indirectly, with policing in Northern Ireland. One reaches a stage at which it is unacceptable to hear a Minister, of all people, saying that the Police Authority's right to play a meaningful role in policing is interference. That is not my word, but the Minister's. If that is the attitude of the Minister and the Northern Ireland Office to the Police Authority, I can understand why the Bill is drafted as it is. If the Northern Ireland Office views the Police Authority as a body that is superficial and extraneous to policing, I perfectly understand the Minister's arguments today and on previous occasions. Many people do not view the authority in that light.
<P>
Many people in my party have been accused of a lack of objectivity about the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Some people wrongly believe that the Ulster Unionist party accepts that nothing that the RUC does is ever to be questioned. That is not how we regard our police service in Northern Ireland. We regard it with much more affection and concern than that. Those elected to public life have a responsibility to make an input to the RUC responsibly and helpfully. That is exactly what we are trying to do, but the Minister and his colleagues are scathing of our crucial role.
<P>
I was so astonished earlier that I began to think that I was taking part in a comedy show rather than a serious debate. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was asked how he knew that a letter that he had received this morning from the Police Authority truly reflected its views. He was also asked whether the Police Authority might have changed its mind over the past few hours on the basis of the Minister's contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is exactly what happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> How on earth could the Police Authority in Northern Ireland--as we have not heard a convincing argument or seen the subject treated with the seriousness that it deserves--be reassured in the space of 12 hours by the attitude of Ministers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> May I put to my hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone the same question that I put to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire? The best way to test the difference between the Opposition and the Government is to ask the Minister why, since he and his officials are to meet the Committee on the Administration of Justice, he will not meet the Police Authority?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that it is hard for those on the Front Bench to avoid it, but the hon. Gentleman should not turn his back to the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I beg your pardon, Miss Widdecombe, I shall turn around and repeat everything that I said. I wanted to put the same question to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone that I put to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. In view of the Minister's intention and that of his officials to meet the Committee on the Administration of Justice, why will they not meet the Police Authority to settle the matter--tomorrow, next week or at some other time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman would not expect me to speak for the Committee on the Administration of Justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Of course not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I imagine that it will be more pliable. I shall move on from the Committee on the Administration of Justice because it is liberal to the point of ineffectiveness.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness that it is not good enough for the Minister to say that he is willing to talk to organisations without undertaking to talk with them. The Minister will talk to people; he is always willing to talk to people; and he has practised it here assiduously. His colleagues also talk to, not with, people. From a sedentary position a Labour Member made a comment more insulting than most of what has been said here. He looked across and said, in the past few minutes, ``Is it any wonder that the Unionists have no friends?''
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): No, just you personally, Ken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Oh, we are now descending into personal insults. I invite the hon. Gentleman to come to my constituency which I have held for 15 years, to ask those from both traditions whether their Member of Parliament serves them without fear or favour. Friends is a loose term. I have never sought friends in public life; I have sought those with whom I can work. I have sought loyalty from my immediate supporters and I have done for my constituency what I hope for the hon. Gentleman has done for his.
<P>
Let me leave the personal insults and reply more generally to the sedentary question. In the 15 years that I have been in the House, I have found that politics have had more to do with how one looks at the issues that directly concern one's constituents in general than with the individual cases that one handles on a day-to-day basis. The Government Whip has been here for somewhat fewer years than I: if he believes that politics is about friends he will suffer some great disappointments in life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Does not the fact that a Minister expresses, albeit from a sedentary position, the point of view that Unionists, not surprisingly, have no friends speak volumes for the Labour party's attitude towards the Union and the position that the Unionists are currently holding most responsibly in the talks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. These discusions about friends have nothing to do with the amendment. I ask hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to return to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall do that with pleasure, Miss Widdecombe. The attitude in Committee is more dangerous than any conflict that we have debated. I regret that and I hope that I have played no part in it. Our debate suggets without doubt that there is a conflict between the Northern Ireland Office and the Police Authority and that the Government feel that there is no place for a Police Authority for Northern Ireland.
<P>
I too have had correspondence and guidance from the Police Authority although I have not had cause to refer to it. Perhaps I should. The briefing that I have had from the Police Authority asks whether new legislation will reinforce many powers that are currently held by the Secretary of State and add to them many new powers. That is what the clause deals with.
<P>
The Government will be empowered to set objectives for the Chief Constable; to determine the size of the police grant; to issue a statement on policing principles; to issue codes of practice for the Police Authority--that independent body that existed prior to the Bill; to issue guidance to the Chief Constable; to require the police to use specified facilities, equipment or services. That will impinge on operational duties, and yet we have been chided all afternoon and told that this fairly innocuous amendment will enable the Police Authority to interfere with police operational powers and responsibilities. That is not the case.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill will empower the Secretary of State to conduct inquiries and research into policing. That should be within the ambit of the Police Authority, as should many of the other responsibilities relating to the Secretary of State's powers, to which I have alluded. The Bill will enable the Secretary of State to exert considerable influence not only over the police, but over the authority. The Committee must be concerned about that, and the Minister cannot leave this evening without recognising that concern.
<P>
I am disappointed that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, with his usual benevolence, is about to withdraw the amendment. I advise him that he should not do so, if only to demonstrate the difficulties that will be created by the Bill. It will withdraw powers from the Police Authority; for example, the power to set the establishment of the RUC. The Minister has not justified that. He says that it is right. I believe that it is wrong.
<P>
The Police Authority's power to settle civil claims will be withdrawn. The Chief Constable will not be required to seek the authority's approval for any major changes within the policing plan. The amendment addresses that matter. The Minister has continued to suggest that the amendment is not practical, but he knows in his heart of hearts that it is a necessary constraint upon the Chief Constable. In Northern Ireland, he is the most likely person, in policing terms, to come under the greatest, continuing attack. That attack will come from not just one tradition, but both traditions. The Chief Constable is vulnerable; the more he is set apart from the Police Authority, and the more he appears to be dependent upon and answerable to the Secretary of Sate and obedient to the Secretary of State on every issue, the more vulnerable he will become.
<P>
I cannot believe that a Minister in Her Majesty's Government, who is responsible for a matter that is at the heart of Northern Ireland, can walk away content tonight--[Hon. Members: ``Oh!'']--or tomorrow morning. I look forward with relish to extending the debate. I cannot believe that the Minister can walk away content, not because he has won the argument, or because he has justified the errors--or what he would view as the content--in the Bill, but because he is part of a Government who have such a majority that they can override the aspirations of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Police Authority for Northern Ireland and society. They have all weathered almost 30 years of dreadful violence. The Minister must do better.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I shall not make the mistake that I made earlier. This time I shall face the Chair.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend the Minister for Fermanagh and South Tyrone accept that the aim is to reduce the possibility of conflict between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority? If we do not resolve the matter, and the Police Authority is adamant that changes have to be made, but the Government are not rpepared to accept those changes, how would that affect the harmonious relationship that we all support between two legs of the three-legged stool about which the Minister is so fond of talking?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned ``conflict''--the word that I intended to use in my closing contribution. The hon. Gentleman implies that the Chief Constable wants the Police Authority's powers to be curtailed because he fears that conflict will erupt between him and the Police Authority. I know members of the Police Authority and the Chief Constable, and I do not believe that that is the case.
<P>
The Minister asks time and again what would happen in the case of irreconcilable differences between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. I hope that I have answered that question. I told the Minister that if there were irreconcilable differences about an operational policing issue, the Chief Constable would have to make a decision. That goes without saying. In the case of other differences, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable could approach the Secretary of State, and the three partners could resolve them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall, but it is interesting that the Minister interrupts me when I reach the nub of my argument.
<P>
The idea that conflict will occur is to me suggestive of the Government attempting to win their argument by espousing and promoting conflict. Since 1970, no Chief Constable and Police Authority--with one exception--have been in conflict. Our Police Authority has gone the extra mile to ensure that the Royal Ulster Constabulary receives services and support from society--indeed, receives everything required to enable it to do its job in difficult circumstances. I want that to continue, and I want to ensure that whichever Government are in power, however perverse or otherwise they may be and however influenced by peripheral issues, there will be at the core of our society a civil power that relates to society and has a viable Police Authority to help it to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I intimated earlier that I would withdraw the amendment, not from benevolence--
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> What a shame.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Tactics.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Not tactics either. The debate has gone on long because a fundamental principle is at stake, and there is no point in the Government denying that. If in the coming days or week the Police Authority writes to me saying, ``Thank you for your efforts. We have now changed our minds and, if we have to go along with what the Government want, that is fine,'' I shall be happy. But I suspect that it will not do that unless, on balance, it is given other concessions elsewhere in the Bill. The Minister will have to handle that. I know that he is adept at doing so and I wish him luck.
<P>
This issue is not about a mouthpiece for the Police Authority, it is about a fundamental principle that is different from what is in legislation for England and Wales. The Government have not merely transposed clauses en bloc from one to another. They have taken what they wanted to take, and changed what they wanted to change. They have put the Secretary of State in a massively powerful position. I suspect that the thread running through all this is the fact that the Government do not trust the Police Authority, either the authority composed last year, or the new composition of people appointed by the Secretary of State only a month or so ago.
<P>
What does that say to the Police Authority? Frankly, it is a kick in the teeth. Everything has been done with the Secretary of State's imprimatur. But we have been overruled because if, finally, the matters goes to a vote, we will be defeated not only here but on the Floor of the House. We are not arguing to prolong the proceedings, we are trying to put it on record--and make the Government understand--that fundamental issues are at stake; and although they will not believe it, we are trying to be helpful. The Government have not answered the fundamental points that we raised. Ministers have declaimed, sometimes from a sedentary position, but intellectually they have not answered the question.
<P>
The interesting question of what will happen if the Police Authority does not give approval for consultation was raised. But not only the Police Authority is involved. Clause 17 states that the Secretary of State has to agree the whole annual policing plan, and she can amend it from cover to cover. What will the Secretary of State do if the Chief Constable announces that he is deviating from the plan and the Police Authority decides not to approve it? She will wade in and do whatever she needs to do. Every clause gives the Secretary of State the power to do just that.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> May I pose the concept that a police authority sets the policing plan in consultation only with a chief constable? That is disputed as not being truly reflective of the needs and wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that the Secretary of State should have no role, and no accountability to the supreme Parliament of the United Kingdom in considering these matters? When does the Secretary of State become involved in determining such issues?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have dealt with this so many times. In the 1996 legislation, all that a police authority does is to send a copy of the policing plan to the Secretary of State. Clause 17(5) however states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before issuing an annual policing plan adopted by it under subsection (4), the Police Authority shall submit the plan to the Secretary of State and make such amendments to that plan as the Secretary of State, after consultation with the authority, may require.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
After consultation! If the Secretary of State says, ``Do this,'' the authority will jump. It will have to. That is not in the legislation for England and Wales; we would not put up with it. Why the heck should Northern Ireland put up with it? What justification is there for this change? The Minister has not begun to address the reasons why it is different. He has not even attempted to say why the clause should be so drafted. He is just told to dig in and hold out, because the Northern Ireland Office knows best. That is not the right approach. The matter is so fundamental that we must return to it, in spades! I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:--
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exercise of functions of Chief Constable in cases of absence, incapacity, etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 10, line 16, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `1(A) In the event of it being impossible or impractical for the Chief Constable to designate a senior officer under subsection (1) to exercise the functions of the Chief Constable or of his failure or refusal to do so to the Police Authority may make such designation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> By way of explanation, I begin by asking the Minister how it is possible for a Chief Constable under clause 20(1), after consulting the Police Authority to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``designate a senior officer to exercise all the functions of the Chief Constable'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when subsection 1(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``during any vacancy in the office of Chief Constable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If there is a vacancy, there is no Chief Constable. I would be more than happy to hear an explanation of how this wonderful juxtaposition has come about. I do not understand how a non-Chief Constable can give advice on a vacancy for his or her offices when it is not occupied at that time.
<P>
The clause should deal with all possible scenarios. The draftsmen no doubt sought to achieve that aim, but I am not sure that they have done so. If they do not cover all eventualities, it is more than probable that a vacuum will be created; the law does not actually state who should step in and take over in order that proper leadership will be available to the police service. Given the unique and special security situation in Northern Ireland, any such vacuum could be catastrophic.
<P>
I ask whether the Government and the Minister have actually thought through the clause's implications. Let us suppose that a stroke or a shooting incident places the Chief Constable on a life support system, which renders him or her incapable of designating anyone. How would the Chief Constable designate in that context?
<P>
Furthermore, a vacancy in the office of Chief Constable, to which clause 20(1)(b) relates, could arise on the death of the Chief Constable, either from natural causes or, God forbid, as the result of an act of violence by terrorists. In that event, it would be necessary for someone to step in and appoint a temporary replacement. As the Police Authority is responsible for appointing a new Chief Constable, it would seem sensible and logical for it to appoint a replacement senior officer on a temporary basis. Amendment No. 82 is an attempt to prescribe just that. We are merely saying that we do not think that the Bill covers every eventuality. The amendment is a practical means of ensuring that in the unlikely event
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of it being impossible or impractical for the Chief Constable to designate a senior officer under subsection (1) to exercise the functions of the Chief Constable or of his failure or refusal to do so to the Police Authority may make such designation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that there is a rank of deputy chief constable. I suppost that under normal circumstances, the deputy would step in and take over. I also understand that the Police Act 1996 did away with that rank in England and Wales. I would guess that the main aim of clause 20 is to put in place measures that will come into effect when there will be no rank of deputy chief constable in Northern Ireland. It would be helpful to known whether deputy chief constables will continue to be part of the RUC. There is talk of the post of DCC eventually being abolished. If it is not, the DCC would automatically take over in the situations that I outlined. It is not yet clear that all eventualities are covered, and the amendment would remedy that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> This should not take long. The amendment has been thought through, and I congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire in testing it out. We have, however, thought the matter through.
<P>
At the moment, as the hon. Gentleman said, there is no problem because there is a deputy chief constable, and there are no plans to replace that rank. From memory, the English Police Bill referred to special circumstances in Northern Ireland as a result of which there were no plans to change the rank. Were there not to be a deputy chief constable--I am entering deep into hypothesis--it would be the duty of the Chief Constable to specify a deputy to cover him. Following on logically, the amendment would apply if for some unhappy reason both the Chief Constable and his deputy were incapacitated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In the same car?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> That is possible. In a disciplined, ranked service, responsibility comes through first by rank and then by seniority. Thus, in that case the most senior assistant chief constable would take over. The situation that the hon. Gentleman's amendment propounds would bring about exactly the circumstances that he seeks to avoid--requiring a meeting of the Police Authority to designate a deputy would mean a hiatus. We would seek to avoid that if it was clear that the most senior assistant chief constable would step in when the Chief Constable and the deputy chief constable were incapacitated. If the Chief Constable were permanently incapacitated, the job of the Police Authority would obviously be to deal with the situation as quickly as possible so that a new Chief Constable could be appointed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I draw the Minster's attention to clause 20(3), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other statutory provision which makes provision for the exercise by any other person of functions of the Chief Constable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I did not try to clatch the Chairman's eye and speak to the amendment because I was not sure what those other statutory provisions were, and what their relevance was to the circumstances covered by amendment No. 82. Will the Minister say whether they would cover the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> In all honesty, I cannot answer that in detail. I expect that specialist functions--for example, forensic science functions--would be among the duties. In that case, someone with a particular skill would need to act on behalf of the Chief Constable. If it would assist the hon. Gentleman, I will ensure that he gets a full reply to his question, but I cannot trace the other duties in the Bill, just as he cannot. He has, however, raised a fair point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I apologise for the fact that matters beyond control in middle age required me to leave the Room. The Minister might already have answered my concerns about clause 20. I got the impression from what I heard towards the end of his remarks that he was talking about assistant chief constables in order of seniority. The issue is open at the moment. The second deputy chief constable has not been appointed because of structural changes that are being considered. Do I need to read into the clause the possibility that we will not have the rank of deputy chief constable or two deputy chief constables in future? I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that so that I could understand and deal with one or two other issues in the clause. I do not want to contribute a great deal, but it would be helpful if we had clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I dealt with the matter during the hon. Gentleman's absence. There are no plans to dispense with the rank of deputy chief constable in the RUC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful. That is what I understood the position to be. In the light of what I heard when I re-entered the Room, I thought that there had been a change.
<P>
That brings me to the issue of the Chief Constable's designating a senior officer to exercise all his functions after consulting the Police Authority. Will that decision be taken if the circumstances defined n clause 20(1)(a) and (b) arise? Would it be more sensible, and indeed the intention of the Bill, if the Chief Constable at the earliest possible moment discussed the matter and agreed with the Police Authority, which, in the circumstances outined in the clause, would assume command in his absence? That is how things would happen. If there is a deputy chief constable, there is no difficulty: the deputy chief constable would automatically be in control.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I recall a time when we had two deputy chief constables. Considerable difficulty arose because the Chief Constable left some responsibility in the hands of one of them, while delegating the other to carry out various duties. I am not supposed to notice officials, but I see an element of recognition in their expressions about the unfortunate situation that arose.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reassure us that this matter will not be decided in a moment of necessity but that, particularly is there are two deputy chief constables, a proper structure will be agreed. I need not elaborate. I see one of the Ministers indicating assent, and that is helpful. I am not sure that his colleague totally approves, but I hope that he does and that at least there is unanimity on the Government Front Bench.
<P>
We did not table an amendment on this point. If somebody is acting on behalf of the Chief Constable for a three-month period, which will normally be the maximum period, I should like the Police Authority to have a role in deciding with the Secretary of State whether extenuating circumstances necessitate an extension. It would be helpful if the Minister, without an amendment being tabled, would consider allowing the third leg of the stool to have some function in that respect. I look forward to examining that point again on Report.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Basingstoke, I do not understand clause 20(3) and I look forward, as no doubt he does, to an explanation of its meaning and extent. Otherwise, I have no great problem with clause 20 and would simply be satisfied with an explanation on some of the points that I have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am in the happy position of being able to give all the reassurances that have been sought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have been looking at the equivalent wording in the police Act 1996, which is simpler, more direct, and makes more sense. Section 12(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A chief constable shall, after consulting his police authority, designate a person holding the rank of assistant chief constable to exercise all the powers and duties of the chief constable''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of that section are virtually the same as those of the clause. If there is a rank of deputy chief constable, why does the Bill not say that the Chief Constable should designate such a deputy? Why a senior officer? Does the Bill bypass the deputy? There is no rank of deputy chief constable in England and Wales--there is in Northern Ireland. The Act states that the powers and duties will go to the next rank down, which is assistant chief constable. That makes sense. The Bill, however, does not state that. I do understand why the deputy is not nominated by the Bill, which just refers to a senior officer. I ask myself whether these matters are more sources of conflict. Deputies could be bypassed by a Chief Constable looking straight to an assistant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I take it that there is agreement that the Bill refers to the deputy chief constable. In circumstances that involve two deputy chief constables, one will have seniority over the other. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that reassuring the Committee of that would resolve the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am happy to accept that if the wording stated that the Chief Constable would, after consulting the Police Authority, designate a senior officer no lower than the rank of deputy chief constable, it would mean that at least one of the two deputies would get the nod. It does not say that, however. The deputy could be bypassed in favour of the assistant chief constable. I do not understand why that should be so. If, at the end of the day, the right people have been promoted to the rank of deputy chief constable, the delegation should be automatic. If, on the other hand, there is some problem with the appointment of deputy chief constables, the Committee should know about it, and know why there is the problem.
<P>
The matter is not clear. There is concern that the rank of deputy chief constable will go. If it does, where is the backstop in the wording? The matter should be looked at again, to ensure that the Government are confident that they have considered every possible scenario, albeit that some scenarios are highly improbable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> A dilemma is created by clause 20(3). The chief constable may designate a senior officer under subsection (1). Subsection (3) states that subsection (1)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is in addition to... the exercise by any other person of functions of the Chief Constable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to deal with that contradiction, which my hon. Friend suspects may exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That may be the case, but we do not know what subsection (3) really means. We received only a brief response from the Minister, who gave an assurance. I am not sure that that is good enough. It may well be that early legislation, perhaps in the 1964 Act or earlier,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``makes provision for the exercise by any other person of functions of the Chief Constable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know about such provision--the Committee should be told. Nobody seems to offer any advice about the matter. There is no official activity. The officials do not know about the matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot see anybody on this Bench apart from me. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall help the Minister. More of my benevolence will come to the fore. He will not get any steer from his officials.

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Wherever they are.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> This is a difficult subsection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> We must emphasise the extraordinary nature of the clause. Clause 20(1) states that the Chief Constable can designate a senior officer to exercise all the functions of the Chief Constable. Subsection (3) will allow someone else, in addition to that, to have the authority to exercise those functions. Two people, therefore, can be required by the Bill to exercise the functions of the Chief Constable, which is crazy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point. It is even more sinister that subsection (1) says that the senior officer can be designated to exercise
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all the functions of the Chief Constable'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but subsection (3) refers simply to the exercise ``of functions'', so could mean only some of the functions. We need clarification. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There must not be conversation between hon. Members and anybody else on this Bench who cannot be seen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I believe that if the matter is properly considered, the two subsections will cover all eventualities. It is important that we have an assurance in writing from the Minister in the next few days about how the possibilities that we have highlighted--remote as they may be--will be covered. He must assure us that every eventuality will be covered in this or other legislation. We do not know to what the subsection refers, although it obviously refers to other legislation.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister himself would like to be confident that every eventuality is covered by the legislation, and if that is the case, our amendment might be unnecessary. In the spirit of benevolence, we will withdraw the amendment and hope that he will write to us to assure us that all the matters that have been raised are covered one way or another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I will certainly write to the hon. Gentleman, but I can answer most, indeed perhaps all, his questions. The clause is cunningly worded to cover all eventualities, whether or not there is a deputy chief constable, or more than one deputy. There are no plans to replace the deputy chief constables. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred to the undesirability of having two deputy chief constables because it is never clear which of them is in charge.
<P>
The answer to the question about clause 20(3) is simpler than I thought. It would cover situations such as disciplinary tribunals in which an assistant chief constable stood in for the Chief Constable, who could not attend, and exercise the Chief Constable's duties and powers. I should be only too pleased to add further examples of circumstances in which the Chief Constable's powers would be devolved to others, but the reassurances I have given should suffice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
