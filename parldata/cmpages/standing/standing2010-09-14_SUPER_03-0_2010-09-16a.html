the end of debate on amendments, the question is put, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                           </div>That the clause do stand part of the Bill, as amended or not. You then
have an opportunity to have a tiny wrap-up debate. However, in a Bill
such as this, which is quite complex, it is often helpful to have a
broader debate at the start, on the first group of amendments. If the
right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood wishes to do that in
this case, with the agreement of the Minister, I am more than happy for
that to happen, on the clear understanding that there will not then be
a clause stand part
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000039">&#160;</a>

going on. The amendments are grouped in accordance with their legal and
position of influence in the Bill, so you might find amendments to
clause 2 that are in fact debated with clause 1, because they are
relevant to the same subject. Those will then be put to a

                           </strong> We had two excellent sittings earlier this week. I
welcome the spirit in which Government Members have approached the
close questioning and their clear desire to seek proper understanding
of the impact of the changes on the civil servants who stand to be so
substantially affected. As we consider improving the Bill, it is
important to remember that it is a time of considerable uncertainty and
anxiety for thousands of civil servants. The Bill is not simply a blunt
instrument 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 71<a class="bkMark" name="Column71">&#160;</a>
                           </div>for negotiating purposes. If it finds its way on to the statute book in
its present form—unamended—it could be vital to their
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
heard eloquent accounts from two civil servants about the impact of the
changes on them personally. Karen Bell, the Central Office of
Information civil servant, testified that she faces being made
redundant in November and will lose £17,000 if she is made
compulsorily redundant. The six to eight months that that would allow
her to find another job she considers difficult, given her age and
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also heard
from David Cowell, a member of the Government office network. He faces
a real threat of compulsory redundancy. In his written evidence, he
said that the passing of the Bill would mean
that<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“it

                        </p>
                        <p>Those
are two human examples of the hardship and the potential impact of the
changes on civil
servants.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government in our sittings and on Second Reading set great store by
their stated ambition of reaching a negotiated settlement. However, our
scrutiny in Committee and elsewhere must ensure that the legislation
that reaches the statute book is practical, fair and in the long-term
interests of the civil service work force and the country. The
Opposition’s argument is that the legislation, without
amendment, meets none of those
tests.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
Mr Dusty Amroliwala said in his evidence on Tuesday,
he<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“cannot
for the moment see circumstances in which, if we were not to reach an
agreement with the unions on a long-term deal, we would recommend to
Ministers that they should exercise the provisions of the sunset

                        </p>
                        <p>That
makes one thing clear—the Bill is designed to be used and will
set the terms under which thousands or, indeed, tens of thousands of
Karen Bells or David Cowells could be made redundant. For them, the
Bill represents whether they will keep their homes, help their children
through university or avert acute financial hardship while looking for
a new job. It is not simply a blunt instrument to be used in
negotiation.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition believe that the amendments would improve the Bill, to
strike a fair balance between the interests of the taxpayer and the
reasonable and, it is fair to say, established expectations of civil
servants. The existing caps set out in the Bill are unfair and
discriminate against those civil servants who have worked in public
service for many years. At a time when their jobs are being threatened
by substantial cuts to departmental budgets, low-paid and long-serving
civil servants could see their redundancy packages cut by up to two
thirds of what they would have received under the scheme put forward by
the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
argument, therefore, is that the February 2010 scheme should form the
basis of the reform that we all agree is needed. It meets the tests
against which reform should be judged, such as making a substantial
contribution to tackling the deficit—£500 million was the
accumulated saving under the 2010 package—while also ensuring
that the reasonable expectations of civil service staff, and the
lowest-paid in particular, are met. It was also important to address,
as we sought to do, the age-discriminatory aspects of the earlier
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000053">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Member for South Staffordshire ought to
know that I will address that point later in my remarks. I think that
what we heard from PCS was essentially a negotiating stance. Anyone who
has been involved in such negotiations would understand the difficulty
of being put on the spot and, as Mr Lewtas the senior official from the
PCS said, of revealing the negotiating hand when negotiations are being
actively
undertaken.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
Peter Boreham said in the evidence session, a two-year cap is not out
of line with the private sector, but in line with what some of
the—regarded as better—private sector organisations are
offering. The amendment would bring the maximum cap for redundancy in
line with other parts of the public sector, including local government,
education and the national health service. It is important to underline
that that emerged from an eight-month consultation between the
Government and the civil service unions, and that we, on the Opposition
side of the Committee, are confident that that would provide a fair
resolution of this issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All six of
the civil service trade unions have expressed their support for the use
of the principles underpinning the scheme as a basis for moving
forward. I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the
open-minded way in which the Minister approached questioning the trade
unions earlier this week. He showed himself to be genuinely engaged in
seeking to reach a negotiated agreement with the unions that is fair
and recognises the principles that we established. The response from
the PCS official on Tuesday should perhaps be seen in the context of
negotiation, rather than as a clear statement that shuts the door on
the possibility of reaching a negotiated settlement on the February
2010 provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would end the undesirable differential between compulsory and voluntary
redundancies. That is something that we need to address with some care.
Several witnesses commented on the fact that staff who volunteer for
redundancy are likely to be more highly skilled, better paid and with
the prospect of future employment. More attractive voluntary terms may,
therefore, result in the civil service losing some of its more talented
staff. The officials negotiating with the unions were particularly
exercised about that when we were in close discussion about the
February package. It is important, however the matter is resolved, that
there is not a perverse incentive in the provisions. In the evidence
session, David Wreford from Mercer stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000061">&#160;</a>

I would like to address a point she made earlier. She said that Mr

pay is not out of kilter with the private sector. I have being trying

said:<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000066">&#160;</a>

May I bring the right hon. Lady back to the point of the distinction
between voluntary and compulsory terms? There is an important
difference between our views on it. Does she recognise that the
ultimate decision on who stays and who goes rests with the manager?
There is a logic to increasing the incentives for voluntary exits in
order to increase the pool of options available to managers.
At the end of the day, it is managers who will decide, and that will
help mitigate the risk articulated by the right hon. Lady about
different incentives facilitating the exits of people whom
we might not want to lose.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The decision about who goes and who stays is, of
course, ultimately a decision for the authorised manager, because they
will have to sign off the terms of the deal. However, reflecting on my
own experiences as a former Minister for the Cabinet Office, there is
considerable concern that a voluntary scheme that is significantly more
generous than a compulsory one produces, and is at risk of producing, a
perverse effect: the numbers may go down and the savings may be
achieved, but we may end up losing some of the more talented staff, who
will be able to find positions
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the issues raised by the trade unions during discussions was the
importance of a proper human resources strategy for managing the
underperformance of staff who might otherwise be made compulsorily
redundant. It is very important that the way in which the provisions
are applied achieve the desired effect, which must be a civil service
that is capable and has the capacity and the skills to deliver the
intended policies of
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000074">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Ultimately, however, that is part of the
negotiation process. Ministers face having to manage an accelerated
reduction in the capacity of the civil service to deliver policy. Civil
service managers in all Departments will have to judge which staff have
the skills necessary to continue doing a good job of delivering policy.
We cannot have a situation whereby the people who leave are simply
those who want to leave. That would leave managers having to organise
and manage the remaining capacity, made up of the staff who wanted to
remain for whatever

                        <p class="tabbed">Much
of our discussion on Tuesday focused on the pay differential between
the public and private sectors. The Office for National Statistics
released a further report yesterday. I underline the point made by Mr
Carl Emerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies that public sector
workers tend to have higher levels of qualifications, skills and
experience.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Pay for
comparable jobs is not higher in the public sector than the private
sector, but the people doing them are likely to be better qualified.
Pay in the civil service is substantially lower than in the private
sector and other parts of the public sector. The median salary is about
£22,000 a year and 40% of civil servants are paid less than
£20,000 a year. Enhanced redundancy protection has formed part
of a compact that has built the commitment of such people to work in
the civil
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has said on a number of occasions that he wants to protect the
lowest-paid, and we agree with that aim. His colleagues have said that
they want to protect the lowest-paid, and Mr Dusty Amroliwala told us
that he wanted to do so. There is consensus across the House that that
is the right course of action. However, if we do not agree to the
amendments, we risk failing thousands of low-paid civil servants, whom
we have all said we want to protect.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000079">&#160;</a>

may provide a fair settlement for the low-paid, but that is not
guaranteed. Tens of thousands of people may be made redundant over the
next year and that may well be done under the terms of the Bill. Such
people will face the real life circumstances that two of our witnesses

                           </strong> Before we proceed, a few words of explanation may
be helpful, particularly for Members who arrived after the Committee
started. We have grouped three amendments. As always, only the lead
amendment will be decided on automatically and may be put to a vote if
the mover so chooses. The other amendments may be voted on, but only by
discussion with the Chair. Effectively, we are talking to the first
amendment, so Members should not expect the others necessarily to be
voted upon, although all Members may speak to any of the grouped
amendments. For those who arrived slightly later, I have said clearly
that the clause has a stand part debate, which is a debate on the
clause in principle, once it has been debated.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some Chairmen
take a view that that can only be done at the end. With a Bill such as
this, I have always taken the view that it is helpful sometimes to have
a broader debate, which is why the right hon. Lady has perfectly
properly, and in order, covered slightly wider ground than the actual
amendments. Any comments on the clause should relate to that clause.
This is not a further Second Reading debate on the whole Bill. The
formal procedure is that I shall call Back Benchers—or indeed
Front Benchers—from all parts of the Committee. The Minister
will hear what everybody has to say and will respond to the debate. Any
Member may, by catching the Chair’s eye, speak more than once.

                           </strong> I rise to oppose all the amendments to clause 1.
The first problem is that we need to focus on protecting staff working
in the civil service, many of whom do a good job. The best protection
is the flexibility to minimise redundancies. The Opposition propose, in
effect, to reimpose their previous scheme, most importantly without the
incentive of voluntary redundancy.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Allowing the
incentive for voluntary redundancy will make it possible to work with
the agreement of the work force in reducing numbers and, thereby,
minimise numbers of redundant people. The fact that those people who
will go for voluntary redundancy might be those more likely to get
another job—or be more confident of getting a job—is
valuable. In imposing the previous settlement, the Opposition are
effectively saying that negotiations have come to an end.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000086">&#160;</a>

Member for Birmingham, Erdington made a good point on Tuesday about
some exceptional cases where people have specifically gone through a
process— effectively creating a contract with the
Government—whereby they specifically and obviously agreed
something. That should form part of negotiations. The Opposition are
saying that negotiations come to an end at that point; we revert to
imposing the agreement that was in place earlier this year, we do not
encourage voluntary redundancies and flexibility and we do not try to
minimise redundancies. I cannot agree with

debate so far on the elements in the amendment, the most important
concern for all members of the Committee was to create an environment
in which negotiations could proceed constructively and come to a
conclusion, whereby the legislation virtually becomes irrelevant. All
the advice, from the unions and the CBI representatives, was that to
succeed at negotiations in a difficult climate requires time. I think
there was reticence to see the use of legislation, as it would impact
on those negotiations. Some of us have put it more
forcefully.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000088">&#160;</a>

principle, which was to achieve a negotiated settlement on a deal in
which the majority of the trade union members it affected would not see
a dramatic reduction of their accrued rights. That is where the deal
fell apart last time; it was challenged. Whatever we think about
individual trade unions, any union representative has to be able to
sell the deal to their members. If a trade union cannot take its
members with it, it cannot complete the

Part of his advice that was so robust to Ministers was suggesting that
the scheme would succeed in the courts. Therefore, I take with an
element of scepticism the effectiveness of his advice and its ability
to survive in the real world and sustain a proper agreement. I take
more realistically the advice given by people with experience of
negotiation; that came from both the CBI representatives and trade
union representatives. It was about giving time for negotiations to

within a union, what will hold with their members? The valid point made
by a number of the trade union representatives was to ask what deal
will hold and be sustainable in the courts if a legal challenge was
taken—not by a union, but by an individual union member. The
union representatives themselves made it very clear that they would be
vulnerable to legal challenge, as the Government were, if they did not

                           </strong> I fully agree. That is why I never supported
the legislation. I wanted to allow the negotiations to take place, have
the normal mechanisms to report to Parliament that a deal had been
signed, and then go forward. I do not want to go back to the principles
of the Bill, but the context is such that legislation undermines the
negotiations rather than assists
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
we are where we are. The legislation is before us, and through the
amendment we are trying to create a climate of opinion in the
negotiations that facilitates the making of a deal. As I said, I never
supported the original proposals as set out here when they were agreed
by the previous Government, and I do not think that they are the best.
However, adopting the amendment would send a signal to the negotiators
that there is a prospect of a deal, even if there are elements around
the final deal that have to be ironed out by the PCS, and certain minor
changes need to take place.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The role
undertaken by the Committee would be constructive. Putting that message
into negotiations would, in some ways, override some of the damage that
has been done by the introduction of the legislation. I support the
amendments on that
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
the Committee today, we could send a signal to the negotiators that we
have some parameters of a deal that would protect most of their members
from severe damage, under the Bill, to their accrued rights. That is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 78<a class="bkMark" name="Column78">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the reason to support the amendments. At this delicate stage in the
negotiations there is a responsibility on our shoulders to be realistic
about what sort of deal could emerge. If the approach is bloody-minded
and we say that the Bill will go through without amendments and that
these are not the sort of parameters that a negotiated settlement could
be formed around, we will provoke not just PCS members but members of
other unions who settled for the deal previously. The last thing that
we want in this period are forms of industrial conflict exacerbated by
a parliamentary
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Large
numbers of people will inevitably lose their jobs as a result of the
comprehensive spending review, and if they feel that they will not get
a just settlement they will take whatever action is available to them,
which will be either industrial action or legal action, as we have
already been told. Neither route will create the sort of industrial
relations climate that the country, let alone the Government, will need
to get through this
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
therefore urge Members to support the group of amendments because it
sends the appropriate signal to negotiators, and the Bill currently
does not. In that way, we could play a constructive role in the
negotiations, even though I never wanted to be in this position in the
first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000103">&#160;</a>

business trade. I know Plymouth well; I have been there 100 times. It
is a city with great naval traditions. It is the city of Drake and of
Devonport dockyard. It was bombed fiercely by Hitler’s bombers
during the war, but gave outstanding service to the Crown then and has
done ever since. Those who work in the Ministry of Defence regard
themselves very much to be servants of the Crown and the armed

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the debate on Tuesday, a Government Member referred to public
perceptions. The problem is that public perceptions, many of which are
myths, have been fed because of a lack of leadership by Government. It
is important, therefore, that the evidence before Committee is properly
assessed when we reach a decision. The notion that civil servants are
well paid, with gold-plated pensions, and in secure jobs is simply not
true.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Reference
was made on Second Reading and in the debate on Tuesday to public
sector comparisons. That is wrong, because the civil service is at the
lower end of the public sector. A crude, public-private comparison is
therefore not appropriate. There has also been a failure to understand
the nature of employment in the civil service. For example, there are
many more low-paid jobs in the private sector, and many of those at the
bottom end of the civil service have already been contracted
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000110">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I appreciate the various
comparisons about pay, which I am sure we will debate at great length
and for which there is information from both sides. I understand,
however, that the Bill considers only one matter, which is the maximum
redundancy pay for a civil servant.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Is there any
evidence other than that which has been presented by the Government?
That shows that cash payments within the narrower civil service are
generally approximately three years’ pay and can be up to six
years’ pay, whereas the statutory minimum for redundancy in the
private sector is for 30 weeks’ and, typically, the best
practice is for 12 months’. Ignoring the wider compensation
structure issues, which both sides would like to discuss, does the hon.
Gentleman agree that in the specific case of redundancy pay, which is
what the Bill addresses, there is a relatively large discrepancy in
favour of civil service sector
workers?<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady has drawn a misleading comparison,
because it is not right to focus on but one part of the total package
of terms and conditions of employment. That is why, on Second Reading,
I quoted an excellent senior army officer, who spoke to me when I first
dealt with the Ministry of Defence many years ago. He said that
although staff were paid little, at least they could look forward to a
decent pension and they would probably be supported if they were made
redundant. We must therefore consider the matter in the round. If the
hon. Lady wishes to draw comparisons, I, too, am happy to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the civil
service employment structure there are many more graduate
jobs—they comprise more than 20%, compared with 15% in the
private sector. Graduates who are working in the private sector get
3.4% more than those who are employed in the civil service. We heard on
Tuesday that workers in call centres in the private sector get 14.3%
more than people who are working in the civil service.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the debate
earlier this week there was a suggestion that the civil service has
been inured to these tough times, but nothing could be further from the
truth. On pay, the comparisons are clear. In the year to March 2010,
the Office for National Statistics Figures show a

sector. Predictably, there was a 5.2% increase in the finance sector.

will rise in the private

come straight to the amendment. I found the debate the other day
interesting, because, after Second Reading, I sensed that there was
genuine hope on both sides of the House that an agreement could be
reached at the next stages that would prevent the dangerous precedent
of unilaterally, by way of a statute of Parliament, altering the terms
and conditions of employment to their detriment. I hope that the
“blunt instrument”, in the unfortunate words of the
Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, will not be used
against civil servants during the next
stages.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
Government Members mean it, and if the Government mean it, we are on
test. I ask the Minister to facilitate negotiations in the way that the
amendment seeks to do, and then to put the unions on test in those
negotiations. My judgment, as somebody who handled such issues for many
years, is that if there is support on both sides of the House for a
move of that kind at this stage—putting the offer that was made
in February of this year back on the table—that would lead to a
quick negotiation, perhaps a reconfiguration of the package, because
the point has been fairly made about the interests of the lower-paid,
and a settlement then being reached. I ask the Minister, “Why
not?”<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need an act of good faith on behalf of the Government. A clear message
has been sent that change is necessary and that the current
arrangements need reform, which has been embraced on all sides. My
judgment is that all six unions would respond to an initiative of that
kind.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, it is a serious matter. The lasting damage that will be
done to the morale of the good men and women who serve the Crown, and
who are proud of the job that they do, should not be underestimated for
one moment. It will be a stain on Parliament if we do not take the
initiative now. I stress again: if there is a genuine view on both
sides that that package might form the basis of a settlement, let us
allow that to

has been stressed by both Ministers and Back Benchers. But given that
we all accept that the status quo is not sustainable, and given that
Labour Members in the previous Government were unfortunately unable to
arrive at a negotiated solution with the unions, it seems curious that,
as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley pointed out, the shadow
Minister wants to rule out negotiations by trying to achieve the same
result with an amendment to the Bill, which would produce exactly the
same position as the previous attempt at a Bill, which failed with the
result of a judicial review. The advice given to the Government is that
it would be much harder for a judicial review to be had if primary

                        <p>Those
two statements are completely incompatible. The deputy general
secretary says that the sticking point was that the lower-paid were not
adequately protected, but his colleague says that only some of the

that the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood and the
Minister gave the PCS representative two opportunities to state that
the union would effectively accept the negotiated deal that it had
turned down in February, and given that the judicial review still
applies, it will not be possible without the Bill to solve the problem
that all parties agree needs to be resolved. It is a blunt
instrument—that is absolutely correct—that is on the
table to oblige that trade union to see its way forward to a rational
result for the benefit of its members, especially the lower-paid, which
we all want to see. I will, therefore, not be voting for the

                           </span> I have two or three points to make. First, we have
often heard complaints from the other side of the debate about the
unions’ failure to say definitively whether they would accept
the February 2010 agreement, but we have heard nothing—it is
fair to make this comparison—from the Government on what they
are prepared to accept. It is unfair to expect the unions, outside of a
negotiation, to say what they would accept when we do not ask the same
question of the Government. The Government want to use the Bill, which
is a blunt instrument, to force the unions to the negotiating table,
but why is such emphasis placed on demanding that the unions explain
what they will accept, when we do not ask the same of the Government?
There is a case for considering that slightly
unfair.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the hon. Member for Gloucester, who was speaking for his side of the
debate, said that he wanted to put it on record that civil servants
make an invaluable contribution. The problem with his position is that
this blunt instrument, as it stands, seems to put a value on their
contribution, and that value is an extreme deterioration in their terms
and conditions. I gently say to the hon. Gentleman that the tax workers
in Cumbernauld in my 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 83<a class="bkMark" name="Column83">&#160;</a>
                           </div>constituency do see the Bill as an attack on them, and homilies on their
invaluable contribution are not likely to get very far with those
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
returning to the numbers involved, the matters under discussion are
really important for lower-paid civil servants. According to the Bill,
as I understand it, a civil servant earning £22,000—the
median earnings in the civil service—who is made compulsorily
redundant will receive £22,000. Under the February 2010
agreement, that civil servant would have received £60,000, which
is a profound difference and is a huge amount of money to such workers.
I do not know how long it has been since most Committee members have
earned such a sum, but £22,000 is not a lot of
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000138">&#160;</a>

want to provide a real-world context for this discussion. I submit that
many workers in the private sector earning approximately
£22,000, or less, would be delighted with a payout of
£66,000 and consider it to be extraordinary largesse. I
reiterate that this compensation package ought to be placed on a fair
footing, which, during the previous Administration, the right hon.
Member for Dulwich and West Norwood repeatedly and determinedly
attempted.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting to hear the stories of how much money individuals will
lose, but the fact remains that there is an enormous discrepancy
between this specific element of the compensation scheme and the
prevailing norms for millions of private sector
workers.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000144">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of fact, the sum would have been
£60,000, not £66,000. I understand that the compensation
was £60,000 or three years’ pay, whichever was the
lower.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am delighted—this will be final point—that the hon. Lady
has raised a comparison with the private sector, because she is
absolutely right. In the occupational classification produced by the
ONS, the bottom three categories make up 30% of the private sector.
Those categories make up only 10% of the public sector, which is why,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington pointed out, we
are comparing apples with
pears.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000146">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The example that Karen Bell of Prospect cited
would receive £51,000 under the current scheme, £42,500
under voluntary redundancy if the Bill went through, and £11,000
under statutory redundancy. The figure of £42,500 is much closer
to the current scheme than statutory redundancy, which many people in
the country face—not that I am arguing that we should level down
in any way.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000147">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I disagree
with my hon. Friend the Minister on one point, in that I do not see the
proposals in the Bill as being on the table. I understand that
negotiations are ongoing, and that in the Committee we should not aim
to put anything on the table, and we should not pressurise the trade
unions to say what their views on negotiations are. Dusty Amroliwala,
who will hopefully not be affected by the scheme but who is almost
certainly covered by it, has said that he would advise any Government
to use a legislative approach to remove the trade unions’ veto
on an agreement, which is what the proposals achieve. They achieve it
in a way that is not massively aggressive, as I have just cited in an
example.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not,
however, see this as being on the table; obviously, the Minister can
confirm whether that is the case. My understanding is that negotiations
are continuing—as they should—with the objective of
getting a flexible deal that would, hopefully, protect people from
redundancy with flexible approaches, such as moving towards part-time
working.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000149">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way, especially as I forgot to give way to him earlier. I absolutely
agree with what he is saying. We are not trying to put something on the
table; we are trying to have something on the table that would allow
the changes to the current status quo to happen if negotiations,
unfortunately, were to fail. I am absolutely convinced of the
Government’s good will in those negotiations and that we all
share the hon. Gentleman’s view on achieving a much better
result than the Bill provides for, especially for the lower-paid. But
the Bill needs to be there to ensure that the status quo is changed,
given the lack of results so far.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000150">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is a further point. I still do not see it
as being close to being on the table, but one issue has been raised
with me. If anyone were made redundant under the scheme and then the
scheme were to be improved through negotiation and a settlement, there
would be a question about what happens to those who were made redundant
under this scheme. We should be concerned about such people. My
personal priority is still to minimise redundancies. If we end up
losing better people who can get jobs in the private sector, but people
remain employed in the public sector, there will be less unemployment,
and I think less unemployment is a good thing to aim
for.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000151">&#160;</a>

Member for Hayes and Harlington, with characteristic candour, said he
wished we were not in the place that we are today. That is also the
Government’s view—he may not believe that, but it is the
truth. We are discussing amendments to clause 1, which introduces
austere caps on the level of payment possible to staff departing on
voluntary terms, who will receive payments calculated under the current
terms, but limited to a maximum of 15 months’ pay. For those
leaving on being formally dismissed, the limit will be 12
months’ pay.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to set the clause, and the Bill, briefly in context. The
first point of context is the urgent need to reduce public expenditure,
and I am not going to indulge in any partisan knockabout as to why we
are in that place. That would not be appropriate given the substance of
what we are now addressing. As the hon. Gentleman said, the human
consequence is that we are on the brink of an inevitable significant
reduction in head count within the civil service. That is an extremely
difficult and delicate process, which needs to be managed properly,
fairly and, we submit, within a framework of certainty to both those
given the difficult job of managing that process and those who have to
live with some of the consequences of those
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000154">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The second
point of context is that there is a clear need to reform the civil
service compensation scheme. One of the striking points of the debate
has been the cross-party and cross-Committee consensus on the need for
reform of a scheme that is unaffordable, inappropriate and—to
our way of thinking—out of kilter with the experience of so many

right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood was right to open her
remarks by setting an emotional framework for the Bill of tremendous
anxiety and insecurity. We believe it is time to deliver some
certainty, because uncertainty is one of the great fuellers of
insecurity. There has been uncertainty around this agenda of reform for
two, arguably three, years and it is time to bring that to a
close.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In making the
case for the amendments, I thought the right hon. Member for Dulwich
and West Norwood was suggesting that—based on our frank language
in calling the Bill a blunt instrument—our motive is to end this
process with the Bill. That could not be further from the truth,
however, and that phrase should not be taken at face value. The
Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr Maude), used an emotive
phrase—that the Bill is a blunt instrument—quite
deliberately, because it is a blunt instrument. It is designed to do
something simple, straightforward but controversial, which is to change
the pace and dynamic of the negotiations, which have dragged
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000157">&#160;</a>

knows that we are here because of the trigger of a court judgment which
crystallised the problem underlying this negotiation, which is that the
process of negotiation can be held to ransom by one union. The Bill, as
we have clearly stated, is not where we expect to end up. It represents
a de minimis position, from which we expect to move forward and which
we are now negotiating in very good
faith.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000158">&#160;</a>

                           </div>to send a signal to the negotiation process. Our view is that that is
not the appropriate way forward. We have been clear about
this—we are conducting a twin-track approach. The Bill sets out
a de minimis position and, in parallel, there is a serious negotiating
process under way. Those conducting the negotiations on behalf of the
union are aware of the Government’s position and where the
Government are flexible in relation to the Bill. Those negotiators need
no signal from the House in that respect; they are receiving those
signals on an almost daily basis in the meetings that are taking
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000160">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I ask what is perhaps a slightly difficult
question. It is possible that the Bill will come into force and people
will be made redundant before there is an agreement. In those
circumstances, would the Government consider, as part of that
agreement, a scheme whereby anyone who was made redundant under the
terms of the Bill gets the terms that may be agreed later? That is a
difficult question to answer without notice, but there are people who
are concerned that they may be made redundant under the Bill, while a
better settlement is reached later which they would miss out on. Would
the Government consider a measure to assist those
people?<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000161">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a reasonable question, but I will not be
drawn into a detailed answer, because that might be part of the
negotiation process. When that point has been raised before—not
least by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington—it was pointed
out that if the Bill is designed to be a catalyst for a faster, more
serious process of negotiation the onus is on concluding that
negotiation as quickly as possible, not least to mitigate the risk that
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley has mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments have been tabled with the most honourable of motives, by
someone who has probably more knowledge of the complexity underlying
the tortuous process than any other member of the Committee and to whom
my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster
General has paid warm tribute in the House for her work over a long
period of time in trying to reach an agreement. Effectively, her
amendments encourage us to go back to February 2010. My right hon.
Friend has already expressed the problem with that approach in evidence
to the Public Administration Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have a
number of objections, but the most important one is that no deal was
done on that basis, and no evidence suggests that a deal can be done on
that basis. We have discussed the response of the representative from
PCS to my direct question on 14 September. No deal was done on that
basis, however, and therefore no hard reason exists why we should
continue to proceed on the basis of that
package.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
my right hon. Friend has said, that was then; the new coalition
Government have stated their aim of bringing the scheme more into line
with schemes in the private sector. We have been honest in saying that
the February package does not meet that objective, so it fails the
affordability test.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moving in the
direction that the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood

                           </div>voluntary departures or for people to step forward and look at the
voluntary compensation packages. We have discussed that, and a
difference of view exists on its merits. We would like managers to have
more options that people can choose from, and we would like managers to
have more flexibility and the ability to tailor packages for
individuals in such difficult situations. For those reasons, we will
not support the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000166">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are dealing with two issues here. First, we
must consider the signals that the Bill and the amendment send to
negotiators. The Opposition argue that the signal that would be sent by
the amendment would create a climate that is more conducive to a
settlement, because PCS—whatever has been said
previously—has said that the principles in the amendment are the
basis for a negotiated settlement.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, we
must avoid tipping the balance that would provoke a union, but more
likely an individual, to take the Government to court over accrued
rights. Any individual who feels that they are losing so much of their
accrued rights has more incentive to resort to court action. I remind
the Committee of the comments of the hon. Member for Harwich and North
Essex (Mr Jenkin), who chairs the Public Administration
Committee, on Second Reading. He cautioned that a successful legal
challenge would cause the Government considerable difficulty because
they would be required to compensate large numbers of people who had
been made redundant under terms that were found to be illegal, which
would involve considerable cost. We need that balance in the settlement
not only regarding what union members will accept but what will least
provoke a legal action, as a result of which the Government would incur
significant costs over the long term.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000168">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman has
made, and I know that the amendment has been tabled with sincerity.
There is a balance to be struck here, but the Government have opted for
a bold approach to try and break a deadlock and reach a position of
certainty. This relies on a twin-track approach, which is why we do not
wish to be drawn into amending the Bill. The point of the Bill is to be
a catalyst or a blunt instrument to set out the Government’s
minimum position. We do not expect the process to end in this place.
There is a serious, almost daily process of negotiation in which, and
the representative of the PCS was keen to put this on record, the PCS
is actively involved. Those who are negotiating do not need a different
signal from this Bill. They know the Government’s position,
because they are negotiating it daily.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000169">&#160;</a>

wanted to say in response to what I believe is the core concern
underlying the amendments, which is the treatment of those people at
the bottom of the pay scale, of whom there are large numbers. The
answer is the same. However uncomfortable hon. Members are with the
process—I understand their frustration—there is a twin
track. There is the blunt instrument of a Bill which sets out a minimum
position and there is a separate negotiating process which I
understand—I should stress to the Committee that I am not
involved directly—is progressing in a serious and productive
way. As was made very clear by the Minister for the Cabinet Office, the
principle is that those negotiations will be conducted in private and
there is no greater supporter of that principle than the unions
negotiating on behalf of their members. It is not appropriate for me to
be drawn on the details of those negotiations or on what the Government
are prepared to accept.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood has served the Committee well
in throwing yet another spotlight on the core issue, which is that
whatever negotiated settlement emerges from this, it has to be judged
on the basis of how it treats those at the bottom of the pay scale. All
I will say to the right hon. Lady— and it is all I can say and I
know it will be frustrating—is that for the Government, that is
the test. The people who are absolutely at the top of the tree in terms
in our considerations are the lower-paid, and we are happy to be judged
on the basis of how they emerge from the negotiated settlement. I must
conclude by saying that we cannot support the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10091617000173">&#160;</a>

put back on the table as the framework for negotiation, given the
