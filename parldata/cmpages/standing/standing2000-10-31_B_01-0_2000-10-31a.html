<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have a couple of housekeeping announcements to make before we start. First, those Members who have not already presumed upon the concern of the Chair for their comfort may remove their jackets if they wish, and that can be taken as read while I am in the Chair. I cannot, however, speak for Mrs. Michie, who will make her own arrangements.
<P>
Secondly, those hon. Members who have served under my chairmanship before will know that it is my custom and practice to allow a stand part debate at the start of a group of amendments rather than at the end if it is appropriate to do so, as it often makes sense to discuss a clause or schedule in the round before discussing it in detail. That is, of course, on the understanding that there can be only one stand part debate, either at the beginning or at the end.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Insolvency Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Five Minutes to Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a great pleasure to introduce the Bill, especially as this is the first time that I have had the honour of serving on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I add my welcome to you, Mr. Gale. I am pleased that you will Chair at least part of our proceedings, because the Bill will need an experienced and knowledgeable Chairman. It became increasingly apparent on Second Reading that the Bill is complex, and the amendments that have already been tabled are indicative of the problems that the Committee must resolve.
<P>
From your vast experience, Mr. Gale, and from my year or two in the House, we both know that when the Opposition spokesman gets up and starts talking on the sittings motion, it is often the precursor of a time-wasting operation, because the Government have a proposal to which the Opposition object. However, I assure everybody right at the start that that is not my intention. We all want to put in place an arrangement that will help small businesses&#151;and big businesses, too, if some of the amendments that have already been tabled are accepted&#151;and give them a chance to survive when crises and problems arise.
<P>
I am extremely worried that the Bill, which has been floating around the Lords for months, has come to the Commons and the Committee only at this late stage in the game, during the spillover. That is to treat the Bill with a casualness and contempt that it does not deserve. It needs full and detailed scrutiny, and I am appalled that the spillover is being used for its consideration, especially as we all know that there will be some compression at the end of the process. It is rumoured that the Queen's Speech will be on 6  December, so timetable constraints are already being placed on us. The Minister appears to be surprised to hear that&#151;if I can help him with other information in the course of the debate, I am willing to do so.
<P>
I am worried that the whole Department of Trade and Industry legislative programme is going to pieces. In previous legislation, one can see the hallmarks of untidiness, sloppiness and ineffectiveness. I remind Committee members of the Utilities Act 2000: although it was intended to cover four utilities, a review of one of them was announced at the same time as the legislation was passing through the House. The same problem arises in connection with this Bill, in that the Government are currently reviewing the entire issue of insolvency.
<P>
The issue arose on Second Reading and I do not intend to press it today, but I want to put firmly on record the view of the official Opposition&#151;I cannot speak for the Liberal party, because I am not familiar with its current relationship with the Government. According to the previous leader of the Liberal party, the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), he wanted a pact, which turned into an affair&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even under the terms of a sittings motion, the hon. Gentleman is perilously close to being out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> You are absolutely right, Mr. Gale. I was merely pointing out that what was supposed to be an affair turned into a casual one-night whatever.
<P>
I shall draw my remarks to a close because we want to make progress, put the Bill on the statute book and help small businesses whenever possible. However, in supporting the sittings motion, I want to put on record my hope that we will indeed sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays and scrutinise the Bill properly in the given time frame.
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell </B>(Great Grimsby): I join the general chorus of pleasure at serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. It is the first time that I have done so, and, as an old shipmate of yours, I look forward to the experience. Given that yours will be a scrupulously fair chairmanship, I know that there will be no need for me to reveal stories of our sharing a hammock in the West Indies&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is no question of the hon. Gentleman revealing them, because he would immediately be ruled out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for pointing me in the right direction.
<P>
I shall not join in the chorus of complaint voiced by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr.  Page), which seems to prelude a querulous, rather than pointed, discussion. He says that the Bill needs full and detailed scrutiny, but the Opposition's capacity for that means that the debate is likely to be fairly short. I support my hon. Friend the Minister, because it is important that the Bill be enacted. It is right that the Bill is to be passed in the current Session: it will be beneficial, so we should use every opportunity to enact it as soon as possible.
<P>
I turn to the length and nature of our sittings. In his speech on Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Minister alluded to last-minute problems raised by the vested interests who will be affected by the Bill. According to an article in Accountancy Age&#151;the journal that used to be a critical voice in the profession, but which, to encourage advertising, especially from the big six, became the voice of the vested interests&#151;we are on course for an ``Insolvency Bill clash''. I had not realised that, but I am sure that, in his usual fashion of consulting all interested parties and taking decisions with due discretion, my hon. Friend the Minister will avoid such a clash.
<P>
The article states that there will be a clash
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>over amendments to the long-awaited Insolvency Bill,
<P>
</UL></FONT>which has raised ``serious concerns'' among ``Insolvency practitioners'', by which it presumably means larger practitioners. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Insolvency practitioners are concerned that they, rather than courts, will be burdened with decisions on granting...breathing spaces<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
necessary under the measure. An insolvency partner at Moon Beever said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The measures could open the way for actions by creditors against practitioners, if they feel voluntary arrangements were issued without adequate funds or care.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows a concern for the vested interests. The spokesman for an insolvency practitioners association now renamed R3&#151;I do not know what R2 was&#151;attacked the Government
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for not listening to informed comment but hoped that a ``more workable rescue mechanism'' would emerge.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such criticism is being made a late stage of our consideration of a properly formulated Bill that provides an effective means of widening the rescue provisions contained in previous legislation. The Government listened to the House of Lords, to the debate among members of the profession and to the criticisms voiced by hon. Members such as myself; then, they produced the Bill. Now, the vested interests are saying that they want a more workable rescue mechanism. That is ominous, as it means either that we must amend the Bill at this late stage, or that a change will be made later, in regulations over which the Committee will have no power. I do not want either to happen.
<P>
In view of the importance of the sittings motion in deciding the duration of the consideration that we give to the Bill, will my hon. Friend the Minister explain the effect on our deliberations of the vested interest opposition that has lately been expressed?
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Mr.  Gale, I have had the privilege of serving under your deft and subtle chairmanship on at least one previous occasion, so I welcome you to the Chair.
<P>
Reference has been made to the diaries of my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil. Some of us believe that he was, in some instances, on a frolic of his own. However, let me turn to the matters before us.
<P>
The Bill is not comprehensive and there is much to tease out of it. It is a small step in the right direction, because we in Britain have a notoriously creditor-friendly regime. Although part of the Bill is to be welcomed, it contains lacunae and raises issues that need further discussion. I hope that we shall have plenty of time in which to conduct such debate.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. This is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship and I hope that you will not take it amiss when I say that I hope that it is the last time I shall do so in the current Session.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, the Bill is highly complex. I hope, however, that my interventions will be brief and rare. I believe that the Government have got too much legislation in the parliamentary pipeline. Hon. Members returned to the House a fortnight late because we had no business to transact, yet the other place returned three weeks early to deal with the huge amount of legislation facing it. The new Parliament is usually expected to start in the first week of November&#151;we all remember Guy Fawkes&#151;but I understand that the commencement of the next Session is to be delayed by at least a month.
<P>
My point is simple. The Bill is complex: 17 clauses and five schedules are to be discussed; there are 41  amendments in 12 groups and the Government have tabled two new clauses. Therefore, the Committee will need a considerable time in which to consider the Bill, even after the Bill's long drawn out passage through the other place. Will the Minister assure the Committee that, if it agrees to the sittings motion, it will sit every Tuesday and Thursday, morning and afternoon, until it has completed its consideration of the Bill?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the debate. I am at a loss to understand why we are being pressed to hold off. For years, the Government have been urged to provide for a moratorium in the company voluntary arrangements procedure because that is what is needed to make the procedure more effective, yet as soon as we act to put the essential first building block in place, we find ourselves being urged not to act, but to delay. Why&#151;to allow time for further consultation? We have consulted widely.
<P>
I was glad to hear the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). Vested interests are making a last ditch stand to protect their interests. We consulted widely and took a strong interest in all the information put before us, so I hope that members of the Committee will not enter into frivolous delays. As the Minister responsible for the Bill's passage, I assure the Committee that I take all opinions seriously.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Insolvency Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Five Minutes to Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clause 2; Schedule 2; Clause 3; Schedule 3; Clauses 4 to 8; Schedule 4; Clauses 9 to 14; Schedule 5; Clauses 15 to 17; new Clauses; new Schedules.<P>

<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Moratorium where Directors Propose Voluntary Arrangement</center></H4>
Amendments of the Insolvency Act 1986
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 10, line 17, after `is' insert `or has been'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 14, in page 13, line 12, leave out `either of those meetings' and insert `the meeting of creditors'.
<P>
No. 54, in page 13, line 12, leave out `28' and insert `90'.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 39 and 41.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> New section 1A of the Insolvency Act 1986&#151;as inserted by paragraph 2 of schedule 1&#151;provides that new schedule A1 has effect where directors wish to obtain a moratorium for their company. New section 1A(2)(d) applies the provisions of schedule A1 to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the procedure applicable... in relation to the approval and implementation of a voluntary arrangement where... a moratorium is in force.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Because implementation of a voluntary arrangement must, by definition, take place once a moratorium has ended, the amendment is needed to make it clear that the procedure in schedule A1 also applies where a moratorium is no longer in force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendment is welcome, and it is nice to be able to set the Bill off on the right course by partially agreeing with the Government's intentions. I see the hon. Member for Great Grimsby straining at the leash&#151;he will, no doubt, make a detailed and erudite contribution that will make up for my shortcomings and failings in addressing the issues involved in the amendments.
<P>
Before speaking to amendment No. 14, I shall comment briefly on amendment No. 39, which has one worthwhile purpose&#151;it deals with the circumstances in which the nominee fails to summon either of the required meetings. If that happens, the moratorium should come to an end because it has been frustrated or blocked by the nominee, who will then be open to criticism from his professional body, the creditors and the company. However, the amendment does not deal with the specific point that amendment No. 14 highlights, namely, that a rescue can be frustrated by the failure or refusal of the company to meet for reasons other than the failure of the nominee to summon a meeting.
<P>
The Government amendment, which, as I have said, we broadly support, simply lengthens slightly the duration of the moratorium from 28 days after the filing of the required documents to 28 days after the date on which the meeting of the company should have taken place. Its shortcoming&#151;which I hope the Minister regards with the seriousness that it warrants&#151;is that it does not provide expressly for the primacy of the creditors' committee in circumstances in which the meeting is called by the nominee but does not properly take place, for example, if it has no quorum and has to be stopped because it has no validity.
<P>
If such a provision is extended by the reference to an extension of the moratorium under new schedule A1, paragraph 32, it should be expressly stated that if a creditors' meeting decides to extend the moratorium, but the meeting of the company does not take place&#151;because, for example, there is no quorum&#151;the moratorium would be extended. At present, it is not clear under paragraph 32 whether the decision by the creditors to extend the moratorium takes precedence over the provision made in the amendment for cases in which the company does not meet.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister explained that the rationale behind paragraph 36 of new schedule A1 was to prevent the loss of what might otherwise be a workable rescue, simply because shareholders could not or would not agree to all or part of it. However, if the company does not meet after the commencement of the moratorium, under paragraph 8(3) the moratorium automatically ends after 28 days. That would mean that, although the members of the company could not frustrate the wishes of the creditors without an order of the court provided they had met, they could do so simply by not meeting. That would be a perverse outcome, and it cannot be allowed to frustrate the purpose of the Government amendment, the intentions of which we support.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will clear up the inconsistency, either by accepting our amendment or by producing another amendment on Report. I recognise that my amendment might not display the skill and draftsmanship required by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, but I have no doubt that the Minister can take my point and craft the intention into reality on Report. The Bill should not be left with such an obvious inconsistency, however small. Our proposal would remedy that defect by affirming the primacy of the creditors' meeting over the meeting of the company. I hope that the Minister will accept our small but significant amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire should not be so diffident about or lack confidence in his ability to formulate finely crafted amendments. I take it that he is trying to strengthen the hand of the creditors&#151;in other words, he is speaking for the vested interests that, for so long, have had the power to liquidate and destroy viable companies because of the vulture culture that surrounds insolvency in this country, in which the main aim is to lay hands on assets and wind up the company, while caring nothing about the work force or any prospects of achieving viability. I cannot support the removal of one opportunity that the company has for delay&#151;albeit, perhaps, through subterfuge&#151;by not holding a quorate meeting. The Government's amendment is therefore the correct way forward.
<P>
Schedule 1, long and complex as it is, forms the guts of the Bill. Other schedules repeal previous legislation, but the essence of the new, enlarged freedom to seek voluntary arrangements is in schedule 1, so we are right to devote time and attention to it. The argument will be complex, but the basic principle is clear. It is asserted in my amendment No. 54, which simply lengthens the period for which a voluntary arrangement is possible&#151;I plucked 90 days out of the chapter 11 provisions in the United States. I think that that presents a sensible and viable way of giving companies a chance to reorganise. We should adopt it because of the vulture culture whereby creditors&#151;especially banks&#151;go in and grab assets, destroying companies in the process, even though loans are guaranteed, usually to 2,000 per cent., and they never have a problem recovering the money.
<P>
I think that it is clear from the restricted use in the past of voluntary arrangements that they are not attractive enough to companies. One reason is that they do not trust the insolvency practitioners; another is that not long enough is allowed. Reorganising the financial affairs of a company is a big, complex job, and a breathing space of only 28 days&#151;and I realise that it can be extended, but that is the basic provision&#151;is not adequate to enable a business to build up a new financial package, negotiate new orders, renegotiate leases, agree new contracts with suppliers and perhaps discuss new franchises and new copyright arrangements, especially when it is in the interest of banks to frustrate that process and to grab the assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am glad to see that my amendments are deemed to be finely crafted, as opposed to rough and crude guesses about what might be appropriate.
<P>
If parts of a schedule could be frustrated, in the hon. Gentleman's own words, by subterfuge, would not that give various people involved in the process an opportunity to present some sort of legal challenge and thereby put a stop to the possibility of an extended moratorium and a company's chance of survival? With his cavalier dismissal, is not the hon. Gentleman risking everything that he wants to achieve?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to talk of craft in relation to his amendments&#151;they are a crafty bunch of amendments. I accept his point about the way being opened for lawsuits, which was also made in the Accountancy Age article to which I referred. The Committee should, however, be trying to load the odds in favour of small businesses so as to provide them with a breathing space and a prospect of recovery.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is in the national interest to ensure that the country has viable small businesses. Of course they face occasional difficulties, but we should not encourage creditors&#151;especially banks&#151;to leap in and grab the assets.
<P>
We must consider the possibility of undesirable and unhealthy precedents in which liquidation is recommended by accountancy firms that have been commissioned by banks to report on companies. It is likely to be in the interests of one arm of a large accountancy house to make such recommendations, because they might be carried out by the insolvency arm of the same house. Such arrangements are monstrous, but are encouraged by the banks. Their caution and timidity, as well as the hastiness with which they foreclose on agreements and ask for debt to be redeemed in unpredictable and sometimes impossible circumstances, has produced among small businesses a festering mass of hostility to the current arrangements, which they feel, rightly, are loaded against them. The Government are trying to give small businesses a longer breathing space and a better prospect of coming through. It is right that we should accept my amendment, which extends that period.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that schedule 1 is the meat of the Bill. Does he agree that, in practice, banks and creditors like administrative receivership best of all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> There is truth in that statement. I accept the criticism, but we must bear in mind that the banks have firm guarantees on the return of their loans. They can also impose floating charges and often have a mortgage on the small business person's house, which enables them to threaten to evict him or her out from house and home. Those powers are insulting to small business. Such circumstances are rounded off with various difficulties, such as the complexity of working out which avenue is most profitable, but that is no argument against extending the voluntary arrangement to enable a small business person to make new financial arrangements and to take whatever other action is necessary to ensure viability.
<P>
It is a simple fact that a 90-day period is far more reasonable than a 28-day period. The latter time scale has not been successful under previous legislation and has not been used by many firms, and we must ask why that is the case. Part of the reason is that it is simply not long enough: it is a daunting prospect to have to get everything straight in 28 days when one is being hounded, especially by the banks. Paragraph 32(2) states that the period can be extended by a further two months, but such an extension might not be obtained. We need a guaranteed time that is long enough for a small business to reorganise.
<P>
A small business in distress needs time: 28 days is not enough for a small business man who faces difficulties and harassment by creditors, but who wants to maintain his business and is concerned about his employees' future. To a person struggling against such problems, the 28-day arrangement is too short, leading to hasty decisions, not to the considered, deliberate efforts that are required to secure viability. Why not guarantee the longer period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I agree that schedule 1 is the meat of the Bill. The comments of hon. Members have ranged widely on the amendment. Other amendments have also been mentioned&#151;especially amendment No. 54, about which the hon. Member for Great Grimsby spoke and with which I have some sympathy.
<P>
Will the Minister respond to two questions? First, when there is a conflict between members and creditors, I believe that is for the court to decide on the merits of a moratorium when members take one view and creditors take another. How long does the Minister expect it to take for the courts to resolve such conflicts?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman could not be present on Second Reading, so it might be helpful if I explained that if there were a clash of interest between the meeting of the creditors and the meeting of the shareholders and directors, the creditors' meeting would take precedence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I should have declared an interest; I am a lawyer. I was not present on Second Reading, although I have read the debate fairly quickly. I have also read some of the deliberations of the House of Lords on the matter. I have not practised as a lawyer for more than a year and my area of specialisation was taxation, which does not necessarily fit me as an expert in matters such as insolvency. I wonder whether the proposal does not undermine many of the good intentions behind moratoriums, and I should like to leave that matter for the Minister to consider.
<P>
My second question is also reasonably basic, and perhaps the Minister will intervene to give me an answer. In the documents securitising the loans&#151;in mortgages, floating charges and so on&#151;will it be open to creditors to contract out of moratorium provisions, or will they be lumbered with them? Alternatively, in the light of the Minister's previous intervention, will creditors not even bother because of the fact that they can thwart them in any event, under the powers that they will have in a creditors' meeting? The Minister has answered my first question and I would be grateful if he would answer that second point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank those hon. Members who have started this debate in so vigorous and interesting a manner. Some important points have been raised, including those of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. I have been told, Mr. Gale, that one is not supposed to pronounce the ``t'' in ``Hertfordshire''. I would appreciate some guidance on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> It is the aitches that we pronounce in Hertfordshire.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am still not clear as to whether the ``t'' should be there or not.
<P>
<B>The hon. Gentleman's point about amendment No. 14 is valid as far as it goes. However, the Government have tabled amendments Nos. 39 and 41&#151;with which I shall deal at a later stage&#151;to deal with this matter.</B><P>
<P>
The issue raised by the amendments has already been extensively debated in another place. For the benefit of those who have not had the opportunity to read Hansard, I shall tell the Committee that we agreed that, as drafted, the Bill could lead to a very curious outcome. However, the amendment does not go far enough. We consider it important that both the creditors and the members are offered the opportunity of meeting within the first 28-day period of the moratorium. If they are not, that moratorium should end at the end of the 28-day period.
<P>
The Opposition's amendment would not provide for that important safeguard to ensure that the members of the company would be able to have their say. To be fair to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, he did say that perhaps the drafting was not as polished as it could have been. However, I am trying to deal with the principle of the issue. In the other place, Lord McIntosh said that we would table amendments to deal with this issue. The hon. Gentleman will see that amendments Nos. 39 and 41 will do what we consider necessary to deal with the issue, and I would, therefore, urge him not to press his amendment to a vote.
<P>
On amendment No. 54, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby, I should say that I have always admired the consistency and tenacity with which he pursues his crusade against the activities of B6 and R3, and he does a superb job in articulating the concerns of many small businesses. However, where a voluntary arrangement is viable, why would the banks or any other creditors want to vote for liquidation, rather than a rescue? Rescue is likely to give them better returns than liquidation, as well as the possibility of further future custom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): One point that banks take into account is that, given their administrative procedures, it is easier to foreclose than to enter into lengthy discussions. When one is forced to deal with a large number of companies, one takes the easy option. That may not be the approved policy, but that is what happens in reality and, as a result, a number of businesses go under needlessly.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I agree entirely with that analysis, but the point is that we are trying to provide some form of breathing space. The activities of some creditors and banks should not be confused with the purpose of this Bill. We should remember that the main purpose of the moratorium is to give directors of a company that is in financial difficulty the time to put forward to the company and its creditors a proposal for a voluntary arrangement.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby said that we should look again at how much time should be allowed and, of course, in reaching that decision, a balance needs to be struck. Undeniably, we must allow enough time for the necessary meetings to be called and held&#151;which is not always easy&#151;but creditors' rights should not be stayed longer than is necessary. We have heard a great deal about the role of big banks as creditors, but you, Mr. Gale, and many Committee members will know that sometimes the creditors are small businesses. Their operations can be crushed and lives ruined through the activities of companies that have behaved nefariously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Minister is right to say that many creditors are small businesses. Does he accept that, invariably, they do not have the financial clout to enforce their rights?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The point of the Bill is to provide a mechanism through which those rights can be enforced. The Bill provides that, initially, the moratorium will be for a maximum of 28 days from the day on which it comes into force. To stay the rights of creditors for a period of 90 days, as my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby has proposed, seems oppressive and unnecessarily prejudicial to their interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I cannot go along with this tear-jerking picture of a mass of small business men having a great interest in foreclosing on other small businesses. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) said, the truth is that the real force is the bank. As creditors, small business men are comparatively impotent and disorganised. They do not know the procedures, although they certainly want the money. The Bill should be changing the odds in a system that for too long has been loaded in favour of creditors&#151;particularly the banks&#151;and closing down companies. Companies should be a given greater respite and a stronger basis on which to reorganise.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I probably worry a bit more about the creditors than my hon. Friend does. How long the moratorium should last is a matter of judgment, but I think that we have got it right. Decisions about extending the moratorium beyond the initial 28-day period should be taken by the company and its creditors and will have effect under paragraph 36. If they are not interested in agreeing a voluntary arrangement, the moratorium should end. For that reason, the moratorium will come to an end after the first meetings of the company and its creditors have been held&#151;unless a decision takes effect to extend it.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
When the moratorium is extended&#151;we propose that it can be extended by a maximum of two months&#151;it will end on the day to which it has been extended or further extended. We judged that if an acceptable proposal could not be worked out within three months, it was unlikely that agreement could be reached at all. In short, the initial period of a moratorium will be a maximum of 28 days, but it will be capable of extension for up to a further two months.
<P>
Turning to the point raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, in the event of a conflict, the decision taken by the meeting of creditors would prevail. However, members can apply to the court, which can order shareholders' decisions to prevail, or make any other order that it thinks fit. That provides a way out. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for making that point. That is what I thought. The attention of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby appears to be wandering&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The Liberals always have my attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful for that assurance from the hon. Gentleman. He, too, expressed an interest in this point. I thank the Minister for confirming that there is an opportunity for members to apply to the court to override the power of the creditors. If that were not so, the moratorium provisions would be absolute nonsense.
<P>
Will the Minister deal with my second question? In securitising their loans&#151;through mortgages, floating charges and so on&#151;can creditors can contract out of the moratorium provisions?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is an important point, which we shall cover in detail when we reach another part of the Bill, but I stress that the moratorium ties in all parties once it has been agreed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Can we return to amendment No. 14? Contrary to the beliefs of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, it is designed to assist the rescue of a company, not frustrate it. I should like to put that clearly on the record, because the hon. Gentleman gave the impression that he was approaching the matter from a different angle from us. Perhaps the amendment is not as carefully and finely crafted as he said. Amendment No. 14 is intended to address the possibility that a rescue can be frustrated by a failure of the company to meet other than the failure of the nominee to summon a meeting. Should I take the Minister's comments to mean that the amendment is unnecessary because the Government amendments deal with the matter? If so, I shall be happy not to press it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is an opportune moment for me to explain amendments Nos. 39 and 41 to the hon. Gentleman, as that might calm his concerns.
<P>
Paragraph 8 of new schedule A1 could have the effect that members of the company could bring the moratorium to an end even if the creditors' meeting had met to resolve to extend it. That could occur if the members failed to meet&#151;for example, because of apathy&#151;when summoned to do so by the nominee; the same point was raised in the debate in the other place. That could happen because paragraph 8(3) provides that if the meeting either of the company or of its creditors has not occurred during the initial moratorium period, the moratorium will come to an end at the end of the 28th day. Therefore, if the creditors' meeting met and decided to extend the moratorium and the company meeting also met but decided not to extend it, the result&#151;under paragraph 36 of new schedule Al&#151;would be that the decision of the creditors' meeting would prevail and the moratorium would be extended. That would be against the express wishes of the shareholders, unless the court ordered otherwise under paragraph 36. That is what we intend.
<P>
However, if the company meeting had not met, the result would be that the moratorium would come to an end under the provisions of paragraph 8(3). In other words, the creditors would not have their wish, even when nobody could be bothered to turn up for the company meeting. Therefore, somewhat perversely, the creditors would get their way when the company meeting was held and they objected to what the creditors decided; but the creditors would not get their way when the shareholders simply did not meet.
<P>
Amendment No. 39 will ensure that the creditors will have their wish even when the company fails to meet in that initial 28-day period, because the amended paragraph 8, when taken together with paragraph 36(2), will mean that the moratorium will be extended only if the creditors so decide. The result will be that the perverse outcome currently possible under paragraph 8 will be removed from the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we move on to the next group of amendments, I shall clarify the manner in which amendments are moved and put before the Committee. The grouping of amendments is to enable amendments with related substance to be debated together. Only the lead amendment is moved at that time. Government amendments are subsequently called formally; others may be called formally, but only at the discretion of the Chairman, if hon. Members indicate to the Chairman in advance&#151;before they are reached&#151;that they would like them to be called. In other words, if hon. Members want their amendments called, they should tell me first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 11, line 1, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if it meets the requirements of paragraph 3'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 10, in page 11, line 16, leave out paragraph 3.
<P>
No. 53, in page 11, line 23, leave out from `requirements' to `and' in line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`below, namely&#151;
<P>
(i) turnover of not more than &#163;8.4 million
<P>
(ii) balance sheet total of not more than &#163;4.2 million
<P>
(iii) no more than 150 employees,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 arise directly from questions that I asked on Second Reading about eligibility for moratorium provisions. Similar points were made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, who has tabled an amendment that is slightly more limited in scope than mine, but designed for the same purpose. He might have felt inhibited about signing an amendment that I had tabled, but I hope that he will not be similarly inhibited in giving his support it if a satisfactory explanation is not forthcoming from the Minister.
<P>
It is worth reminding the Committee of some of the history. The proposals were first put forward by the insolvency commission in 1993 and were put out for consultation. In 1995, the Insolvency Service produced more detailed proposals as a result of that consultation. The 1995 proposals
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>stated that the new procedure would not be restricted by statute to smaller companies, although accepting that it had been designed with smaller companies in mind, particularly in terms of the timescales laid down.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there seems to be no reason why larger companies should be prohibited from filing for a moratorium if they are able to comply with the requirements of the procedure.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 24 of a report issued by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> There is a general acceptance that SMEs are indeed the target, in terms of their expected pattern of financing as well as the greater likelihood of being taken unawares by financial difficulties. The basic structure is however quite capable of bearing the eligibility of larger companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, the evidence of the Institute of Directors, on page 50 of the report, states, at paragraph 2, headed, ``Company voluntary arrangements'':
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> It is not clear why moratoria should be limited to small companies. It can be just as valuable, if not more so, to creditors and employees to save larger businesses. The reasons for the restriction to smaller companies should be set out in a public consultation document so that they can be debated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A very small number of companies is concerned&#151;those that are not currently included in the moratorium provisions, but which are larger and together employ about half of the company employees in this country. A significant group of employees and a significant part of business turnover is potentially affected. If, as I suspect, the Minister intends to say that the Bill has not been drafted to cope with the inclusion of those larger companies, he will have to say why new schedule A1(5) provides that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Secretary of State may by regulations modify the qualifications for eligibility of a company for a moratorium.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Bill is not drafted to cope with larger companies, what is the reason for creating a power to enable their inclusion at a later stage through regulation, with a minimum of debate? Why cannot all companies be included in the Bill now? The Minister could reserve the power to reduce the size of eligible companies using the power under new schedule A1(5).
<P>
It is important for us to be given a clear exposition of the Minister's thinking on this issue. Sadly, despite the fact that at least one and a half hours were left for the debate on Second Reading, the Minister did not feel able to respond to the points that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby and I made.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I apologise if I did not; I thought that I had responded. However, I shall give the hon. Gentleman the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman think that it would have been a good idea for Maxwell, Polly Peck and BCCI to be included in the provision, and thus to have been allowed a moratorium in which to sort things out? Companies of that size present much greater problems for creditors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> It is horses for courses. It is not for me to say whether the procedure would have been applied in those cases. The Minister implies that if the procedure encompassed larger companies, it would automatically be utilised, but it is not suggested that it will be automatically used for smaller companies&#151;just that it will be available for use in certain cases. My argument, in which I am supported by the original views expressed by the Insolvency Service and the Institute of Directors, is that the ability to use the procedure should be available to both large and small companies. Whether it is used in any given set of circumstances will depend on whether the other conditions are met. The Minister's examples entail circumstances that, even if they had involved small companies, would not have fulfilled the necessary preliminary conditions.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why large companies should not be eligible to use the procedure. Such an outline of the Government's thinking would be a benchmark against which we could judge any future move by the Secretary of State to introduce regulations to change the qualifications.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) accuses me of moderation. He is obviously anxious to ensure my promotion. I am an inveterate moderate in all matters, and I have emerged over the years as the extremist wing of the Labour party only because it has turned to jelly behind me. Moderation is the aim of amendment No. 53.
<P>
I did not go to same lengths as the hon. Gentleman, but the formula in the Bill was arrived at some time ago and it is legitimate to update it and to increase the sums and employee numbers involved. The Bill as it stands deals only with the beginning in terms of company size; I thought that we should prise the opening that the Government are giving us a little wider, to include more companies. It is important to rebalance the odds in favour of survival. The vulture culture that prevailed to an overwhelming extent when the Conservatives were in power must be turned back: it provided fodder for the vulture on an enormous scale through the liquidation of companies, the creation of small businesses out of large businesses&#151;a practice that was recognised at the time&#151;and the incompetent way in which the economy was run. My amendment is designed to modify and reduce that culture by shifting the odds&#151;I have taken the moderate path.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister pointed out that different problems arise in respect of companies on the scale of those owned by Maxwell. However, Maxwell had his own defences and could manoeuvre in the most amazing fashion against critics and to avoid the insolvency that should have hit him earlier, while the City of London, sheeplike, poured in more and more money. One always asks on where the auditors were on these occasions: the answer is usually, nowhere to be found.
<P>
That question has arisen now in relation to Tomkins. One finds that the auditors in that case often colluded with the chief executive because they were selling an increasing number of services to the company: it is interesting to note that the sale of non-auditing services and advice to the company had escalated from slightly more than &#163;1 million five years ago to about &#163;9 million when all the perks were being given to the chief executive. I am not saying that there was a process of softening up the auditors by giving them other business, but such practices must have produced a degree of collusion between them and the chief executive.
<P>
The amendment does not go into the problems of large companies, where one would expect auditors to serve as an adequate control. I merely thought that the Bill provided a small beginning and that the opportunity should be enlarged, so I worked on the simple principle of trebling the sums involved. If the general approach is successful&#151;I hope that it will be&#151;why not provide to more businesses the opportunities that it involves by trebling the scale?
<P>
Such arrangements would affect many of the cases about which I have corresponded with my hon. Friend the Minister and many of his predecessors. I must be the bane of his existence in many ways, but my points are legitimate. One of the classic cases is that of J.S. Bass in Manchester, a company that would not fit within the scale proposed in the Bill, but would have been eligible under a wider provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have some sympathy with amendment No. 53, but are tests one and two conjunctive or disjunctive? In other words, are we talking about turnover of not more than &#163;8.4 million, a balance sheet total of not more than &#163;4.2 million or both?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> As a lawyer, the hon. Gentleman will have to advise me which it should be. Although I am always anxious to co-operate with the Liberals, I find that their good will is not a cheque that can be converted into actual support in moments of difficulty. If the hon. Gentleman will give me free advice, I shall say that I am choosing the maximum option. I hope that that makes matters absolutely clear.
<P>
J.S. Bass was closed down by Barclays bank, which asked Ernst and Whinney&#151;which is now Ernst and Young&#151;to produce a report on the company. The report recommended liquidation, which was dealt with by the insolvency arm of Ernst and Whinney in a botched and questionable fashion. Creditors totalled &#163;1,300,000, fees amounted to &#163;500,000, and the sale of assets&#151;which were mostly sold to friends at knock-down prices&#151;produced more than &#163;2.7 million. That was monstrous, and I have raised the issue frequently.
<P>
The firms involved have been very litigious. Professor Christer, a friend of mine from Salford university, raised the case of a company that should be admitted through these enlarged portals&#151;I see that you are watching me with an eagle eye, Mr. Gale&#151;and questioned the behaviour of the bank and the accountancy firm. He even intended to discuss the matter in his inaugural lecture at Salford university, until he was presented with a writ precluding him from talking about any relevant issue. That must have been a nice beginning to his inaugural lecture and professorial career. Had the case been eligible for the procedure that I am trying to introduce, it would have been saved.
<P>
We are trying to strengthen the position of small businesses to give them the opportunity to reorganise and survive. That is a good thing, and my question is simple: why not widen that opportunity to include larger businesses, with a view eventually to widening it further still? Why not bring the figures up to date and offer this opportunity to more companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> As I have said, I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's amendment and I shall shortly tell the Committee why. We all agree that the UK business culture provides creditors with huge powers and, in a modest way, the Bill will redress that power. However, will the holder of a floating charge&#151; I am happy to take an intervention from the Minister&#151;be able to crystallise it during a moratorium?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I picked that up a minute or two earlier, but I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that important information.
<P>
I sympathise with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby&#151;and with that amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson)&#151;because, in my experience, there is a substantial difference between large companies and small and medium-sized companies. The difference can be summarised in the word ``risk''. Smaller and medium-sized companies&#151;owner-managed companies, many of which I have had the privilege of acting for&#151;had at risk every single thing that they owned. When, for example, the banks signed those involved up to collateral mortgages, not only majority shareholder risk was involved, but risk to members of the owner's family in the form of cross-guarantees. Such people are the engine of our economy and as they put so much of their personal assets at risk, it is time to redress that risk.
<P>
The existing definition of a small company includes a turnover of not more than &#163;2.8 million, a balance sheet total of not more than &#163;1.5 million and employees numbering not more than 50. Perhaps the third component of the definition is in order, but the Government should consider increasing the turnover and balance sheet limits in accordance with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. Any small step towards helping the position of people whom I have seen suffer dramatically as a result of arbitrary action by moneylenders and the like should be welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Simpson (Nottingham, South):</B> I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider sympathetically the points that have just been made, even if he has difficulty with the specific figures in the amendment.
<P>
A relevant case arose recently in my constituency: the unexpected collapse of Sturmey Archer, which fell outside the current definitional boundaries that allow for an application for a moratorium for rescue purposes. At the beginning of the summer, Sturmey Archer was trading in profit with a small trading surplus. It was cynically thrown into insolvency by the holding company, to which it was sold for &#163;30. The efforts of those who depended on the company&#151;its employees, creditors and suppliers&#151;were frustrated by their not having sufficient scope for a rescue period. That would have ensured that a company that was viable at the start of the summer was able to remain in business at the end of it.
<P>
Although the Minister may not wish to sign up to the figures in the amendment, an important principle is at stake as to how the Government put in place measures that will allow decent businesses to stay in business. I hope that he can assure me that he will consider the matter sympathetically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Gentleman used two important words in relation to businesses&#151;``viable'' and ``decent''. We are not seeking to save businesses that are hopeless. The amendment would give slightly larger businesses that are viable and worthwhile an opportunity to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simpson:</B> That is precisely the point that I was making. Although Sturmey Archer did not have a large trading surplus, it was in surplus and had a full order book. It fell victim to some fairly unscrupulous predatory activities at the beginning of the summer, throwing everyone into complete chaos. Its employees, many of whom had worked there for 30 years, had an excellent record, turning what had been a loss-making company into one that made a small trading profit with a full order book. They then found themselves skewered, in that they were unable, under existing legislation, to find the time or space to mount the rescue operation that would have kept a viable company in business.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch has highlighted the yawning gap that exists in the Bill. This is a part-measure, introduced because the Government did not introduce a review of insolvency right at the start in 1997.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment highlights the situation that allows the Minister&#151;through a mere one and a half lines in paragraph 5&#151;to propose changes to legislation at any time through his diktat, avoiding the House and the process of parliamentary democracy. It is yet another example of the contempt that the Government have for the House of Commons that, under paragraph 5, we shall be signing away the right to examine legislation that is introduced at a later date. This is creeping, back-door legislation, and my hon. Friend is to be congratulated for highlighting that.
<P>
My heart is with my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch's amendment, but we may be forced into supporting the Minister's rejection of it because of the incompetence of the Government in drawing up a Bill that can handle issues such as this. The problem is that this is a part-written Bill, written purely for smaller business, and we have no idea of the effect that it would have if it were extended to include larger businesses.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am intrigued by my hon. Friend's comment that we might be forced into supporting the Minister. Will he explain why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Yes, I was going to deal with that point in a short time. However, if my hon. Friend wants a longer explanation, it is quite simple.
<P>
It became very obvious on Second Reading that the Bill covered only part of the whole business process. The Bill has been deliberately crafted to exclude large areas of business of which it would be reasonable to ask, ``Should they be given the advantages of a moratorium to work things out?'' I do not know what business experience the hon. Member for Great Grimsby has. However, I have a reasonable amount and I know a number of businesses that would have welcomed a 28-day breathing space in which to sort themselves out but for the temptation for the creditors to go in and take the assets.
<P>
I know of cases in which business men and women have been in difficulty and gone to their bank to explain their difficulty but the bank, instead of helping them, has immediately put the creditors in. That puts a culture into the minds of business men and women that the last thing that they should do is talk to their bank about the problem, because the bank could pull the plug on them.
<P>
I return to the subject of my hon. Friend's amendment and to the fact that the Bill has been crafted only for smaller businesses. On Second Reading, the Minister made an allusion to the problems that might come from larger companies using overseas methods of avoiding certain taxation requirements. No doubt the Minister will, in the fullness of time, explain how those concerns have been resolved and will not affect the provisions in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that companies larger than those specified in amendment No. 53 usually have the benefit of pretty good independent advisers, whereas that is not always the case in companies below that level?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I will go part of the way down that path with the hon. Gentleman, in that I believe that the turnovers are remarkably low and that they could be extended. To what extent they could be increased before the structure of the Bill became unworkable or dangerous is another matter. Because the provision has not been properly crafted and because a review is still taking place and we are still awaiting a report, I express natural caution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's speech is puzzling. At times&#151;for example, when he was making his attack on the banks&#151;I felt like shouting, ``Right on, you've got it, boy. Go for it!'' However, the speech began elliptically and it is ending in equivocation. The hon. Gentleman has asked specifically whether we should extend to a larger number of companies the opportunity presented by the Bill to survive by means of a moratorium. He was asked by his hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch whether it should be extended to even bigger companies. He has not given an answer. Does he want a general right? He accuses the Government of not introducing a fundamental reform that his party did not introduce during 18 years in power. Does he think that, in principle, the privilege should be extended to all companies, to bigger companies, to the companies nominated in his hon. Friend's amendment or to those specified in my amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This seems to be an appropriate moment to remind the Committee that interventions should be exactly that, and not speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for that&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I need many things in life, but protection from the hon. Member for Great Grimsby is needed only to save the rest of the Committee from being sent to sleep while he is talking. It is to be welcomed if interventions are made short and sharp, rather than rambling. The hon. Gentleman has prevented me from responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, who has tabled a pertinent amendment&#151;although, as I have explained, I have difficulty in supporting it.
<P>
Of course I should like to extend the provision over the whole relevant area, but we are where we are. If the Government would agree to reconsider the Bill, to work on extending it and to ensure that all the relevant matters hang together in a legal fashion, I would support the Government in withdrawing the Bill. However, that will not happen. We must try to pass a Bill that will work. Perhaps it will not be extended as we should like, but nevertheless we want what is passed to work. The Opposition do not want a faulty Bill that will be open to various challenges. We want to act with maturity and responsibility, which accords with my cautious nature.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch has done the Committee an immense service, because he has shown how badly drafted the Bill is with respect to tackling the problems of business. As I know from my business experience, the turnovers in question are remarkably small. Even businesses with much greater turnovers do not have access to the relevant independent advice. There comes a point, of course, at which businesses gain such access, but it does not take much for businesses that are, in operational terms, relatively small&#151;particularly those dealing in large-volume and large-expense items&#151;to begin rattling through turnovers in tens of millions of pounds.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment shows that the benefits of a moratorium would apply not only to small companies, but to public limited companies. I agree with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby on this issue, because my constituency contains a large number of Maxwell pensioners. I saw the way in which they were imposed upon and the way in which their pensions were stripped away from them. It took a great battle, in which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;who has now fallen from grace in the Labour party&#151;and I worked very hard, to obtain a lifebelt for those pensioners until their money was returned. That illustrates one of our concerns.
<P>
I support the Minister on the issue of the danger of agency capture. That is the danger of a large company getting hold of the accountant, or the advisers, and getting them to do what it wants. That ends up being detrimental to the creditors and to the shareholders. One reason why I cannot support the amendment is that it does not cover that risk factor. The Minister is trying to have it both ways, and I do not blame him for that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> So is the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> That is why there are Ministers, and why they have advisers. Paragraph 5 says, ``Hey, lads, we can extend this any time we like'', but one cannot do so because of the problems one might incur with the Polly Pecks and the Maxwells of this world. I understand that and that is one of the reasons why I cannot support the amendment. Perhaps I speak also for my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr.  Gray), who is to be congratulated as he has just joined the shadow Whips' Office. I wish him a long and distinguished career as he climbs the greasy pole on which we are all sliding&#151;in my case, downwards, but in others, upwards.
<P>
I should like to raise a further point that the Minister will have to address at some time. It might be more convenient to discuss it at a later stage, but I hope that he will give one or two indications as to the nature of the nominee or supervisor who would be the authorised person. There is extreme concern in relation to an amendment such as this about a company putting a rescue plan into operation&#151;it could be a limited company&#151;with an authorised person in position. We need to know exactly what kind of animal this authorised person will be. Will he or she have to pass a test or an examination, gain a qualification or undergo a training period?
<P>
We must remember, back in 1986, the introduction of the profession of licensed insolvency practitioners. I know that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby foams at the mouth at the very mention of those words. I have constituents' cases, as do other hon. Members, in which the actions in certain insolvencies have made me very angry at the callous disregard shown for those involved. It is interesting that the full new name of the insolvency practitioners, R3&#151;the Association of Business Recovery Professionals&#151;includes the word ``recovery''. That shows a change in emphasis, and I hope that it will lead to a change in practice, in which insolvency practitioners will examine whether a company can be rescued rather than closed down.
<P>
Anyone who has started a business knows that the first year is a time of immense difficulty in which one tries desperately to ensure that one's plans are correct and one's marketing is right, and in which one manages to struggle through in the hope that the finances hold in place. The following year, one hopes to break even while building up one's customer base. Thereafter, one embarks on the normal slog over piles of Government regulation and, occasionally, at about five past five, one might see a customer or two in order to make some money to keep the company going for the week. But closing the company down can happen at the flick of a finger. It is so quick and easy to close a company down that any mechanism for reviewing it to see whether it can survive is to be welcomed.
<P>
However, any company that is in trouble may be tempted to start grasping at straws; that can apply as much to small companies as to larger ones. If people choose to view the company's prospects through rose-tinted spectacles and believe that it can be kept going, they will find an authorised person who will tick the box and say, ``Yes, we can get a moratorium''. The company will limp on for another month or so, when it will apply other techniques and get another month on top of that. Meanwhile, the company will face all the associated difficulties of continuing to trade, such as getting money.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would require that people who recommend moratoriums are qualified and trained people, and not merely people who are easily tempted by self-interest into supporting a moratorium.
<P>
I have been taken round the park a little by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. That is not something that I would normally want to do, but I felt that it was right to answer his questions.
<P>
In tabling his amendments, my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch has revealed some of the yawning gaps in the Bill. However, I regret that because I want a Bill that works&#151;insufficient and poor though it may be&#151;I will not be able to support him.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I join with the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire in asking the Minister to clarify the qualifications of authorised persons.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats deprecate paragraph 5 of schedule A1. That matter should be for Parliament to decide. Will the Minister tell us more about the consultations that the Government will undertake before any such regulations are made?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We have had an interesting debate on this key issue.
<P>
I can give Committee members some comfort. Yesterday, I saw the new, updated version of the British Bankers Association's statement of principles. It says that the association will lend its support to a rescue proposition if it believes that it will succeed. That is an interesting statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to answer this question, because it is rather esoteric. A number of farmers who are in real difficulty at the moment have mortgages through the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. Is that organisation connected to the spirit of goodwill to which he referred?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am afraid that I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman whether the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation is a member of the British Bankers Association. I shall try to find out for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I mentioned it because the AMC is a subsidiary of Lloyds TSB, yet the banking ombudsman does not have jurisdiction over the AMC.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This matter does not fall within the ambit of our discussions. The Minister may, if he chooses, write to the hon. Gentleman about it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Thank you for that helpful ruling, Mr. Gale. I shall do so.
<P>
I return to the initial points raised by the hon. Member for Christchurch, which were, as usual, well thought through. The small companies definition will be automatically updated when the Companies Act 1985 definition is updated because the Bill draws on that definition by way of cross-reference. Many companies are caught by this definition.
<P>
Exact figures are not available, but the latest figures for 1997-98, which are held at Companies House, show that 38 per cent. of all registered companies file the abbreviated accounts of a small company. However, although a small company may file abbreviated accounts with a registrar of companies, it is still obliged to file full accounts with its shareholders, so it may choose to produce just one set of accounts for all purposes. Therefore, it seems likely that more than 38 per cent. of all companies are small companies; a very large number.
<P>
I return to a helpful point that was made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, although I am not sure what happened to his speech after that. He put his finger on the question of risk, about which I feel strongly. My intervention to ask the hon. Member for Christchurch about those companies was not frivolous. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said, the larger the company, the greater the risk. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot continue to have sedentary interventions.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> During extensive consultations&#151;I am sure that the hon. Member for Christchurch is glad that we held them&#151;that widely held worry emerged time and again, and I shall try to deal with it now. My hon. Friends the Members for Great Grimsby and for Nottingham, South made the same point.
<P>
The amendments seek to remove or alter the criteria that companies must satisfy to be eligible to obtain a moratorium. Indeed, amendments Nos. 9 and 10 would enable companies of all sizes to be eligible for a moratorium, provided that they were not otherwise excluded from eligibility by paragraph 2 of schedule A1. Amendment No. 53 would allow larger, but not all, companies to be eligible, again provided that they were not otherwise ineligible.
<P>
We wish to restrict eligibility for a moratorium to small companies&#151;although Committee members will have noted that, in this context, the word ``small'' does not mean particularly small&#151;because that is where we see the need. The amendments would enable larger companies to use the moratorium, but we should bear in mind that larger companies can use the administration order procedure in the Insolvency Act 1986 to obtain a moratorium and put a voluntary arrangement proposal to their creditors.
<P>
We have heard a great deal about the difficulties experienced by some companies and what happened when they took that route. Of course, there have been some successes as well as some spectacular failures, but I take the point that was made. We believe that route to be more appropriate for the often rather different circumstances of the larger company; the cost, increased complexities and consequences associated with that route will, in general, make it rather unsatisfactory for the small company.
<P>
Furthermore, when the Insolvency Service consulted on making available a moratorium in conjunction with the company voluntary arrangement procedure, concerns were expressed that it might be available to larger companies because, importantly, the directors would remain in full control of the company and its business during the moratorium. That is not the case during the period of an administration order, when a court-appointed administrator takes charge.
<P>
Committee members will appreciate that there is a balance to be struck between the general recognition that directors should be given space to put a rescue plan to creditors, and creditors' concern about the risks associated with leaving directors in charge of larger companies when a stay or sist on creditors' rights is in place. It is important for the success of this procedure that there is confidence in it. We must recognise the genuine concerns that have been expressed, which is why we have sought to restrict eligibility to small companies. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire for his points about that important issue.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Christchurch will see that there is a degree of flexibility and leeway, although we have heard cries of outrage about the way in which we intend to provide that. In due course, experience may lead us to revise our views on eligibility. I have already told the hon. Gentleman that the definition of small companies could be modified or updated in line with the Companies Act, with which the provisions cross-refer. If we do revise our views, the power provided in paragraph 5 of schedule A1 will allow the Secretary of State to make the necessary adjustments. The amendments are therefore unnecessary. We will monitor the success of the arrangements and consider raising levels by means of regulations, which will be subject to affirmative resolution in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I have two questions. First, will the revision of the Companies Act limits be in line with inflation, the retail prices index, national earnings&#151;pensioners know about that&#151;or an average of the company size? Secondly, what considerations will be in the Secretary of State's mind when he makes adjustments? A fuller explanation from the Minister will help us in deciding whether to return to the issue on Report. Will changes be made to maintain the limits for the trial period and to enlarge them if they are successful? What considerations will apply in the revision?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I had not quite finished because I meant to answer another question asked by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about the definition of nominees. Like Charles Darwin, I shall come to a precise definition later in our proceedings.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby asked about the nature of the revision of the limits that will occur in respect of the Companies Act. Any judgment will have to encompass all of the points made by my hon. Friend, who mentioned several of the more obvious criteria and variables that would apply in the overall equation. I do not want to provide an exhaustive list of such factors now. There is general agreement that the criteria provided in the Companies Act 1985 have been successful and have worked rather well. They will undoubtedly need updating, as they are now 15 years old and time has moved on. I am confident, however, that the solidity of the Companies Act definition will also be present in the revised one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the Government's thinking. He says that changes to the Companies Acts definitions of small companies would immediately feed into the regulations, without any need for the Government to use the separate regulatory power provided in paragraph 5 of new schedule A1. He has also helped the Committee by describing some of the criteria that might apply if the scope for eligibility were modified. However, he has left me slightly puzzled about why paragraph 5 of schedule A1 is so broadly worded. He argues about the range of small and medium-sized companies&#151;perhaps following the argument so ably advanced by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby&#151;but does not say that the legislation is suitable for application to the very largest companies. Will the Minister submit to a voluntary restriction upon the operation of the power provided in paragraph 5? He seeks a blank cheque in the extension of eligibility to every single company in the land, yet he has explained that he does not think that that would be right. If he is to be consistent, the Bill should include an upper limit, so that the Government would have the power, by regulation, to raise the criteria as far as that limit but to exceed it. Will the Minister return on Report with something along those lines?
<P>
I have been persuaded that to apply the measure without restriction to all large companies might cause problems, but I do not agree with all the examples that have been given. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said, large companies must have good advisers: the most recent relevant example in our mind and that of the public is the New Millennium Experience Company.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, however good advisers are, they do not necessarily compensate for poor management?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. However, the debate about the NMEC centres on whether it was trading at the time that it was insolvent and on whether the initial advice regarding the business plan was ever coherent and worthy of acceptance. The fact that a company is large and has almost unlimited access to funds does not mean that it will, in practice, behave any differently from a small company. If NMEC had been other than a company limited by guarantee, many people might have gone down with it. Small creditors still have not had their bills paid. The Government, as sole shareholder of that company limited by guarantee, are saying, without the benefit of any outside advice, ``Let's keep the company going because that is the best way of ensuring that the bills are paid.''
<P>
I am not convinced that all companies with large turnovers should be ineligible. However, I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the thinking behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, which he describes as more moderate than my amendments&#151;it is certainly less simple. The Government should take on board his point that the range of companies within the eligibility criteria is too restricted. There is much to be said for raising the limit a little.
<P>
The Minister said that 38 per cent. of all companies might be included. Why can we not increase that proportion to 50 per cent.? There is not much difference between companies that employ 100, 150 or 200 people; the big difference comes with companies that employ more than 500 people, have a much greater turnover and can afford more advisers. Those advisers may come from Ernst and Young, the firm for which I was privileged to work and to which the hon. Member for Great Grimsby has been a persistent sore for many years. I did not work on the insolvency side at Ernst and Young, although I know that many partners were grateful for the profits that were made there, which cross-subsidised some of the leaner work on the accountancy side.
<P>
Although I shall not pursue the amendment, I hope that the Minister will table a Government amendment on Report that meets the anxieties expressed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 12, line 39, leave out `has a' and insert `is'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 31, in page 12, line 40, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`prospect of being approved and implemented'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendments are designed to enable the Minister to flesh out the meaning of the phrasing used in paragraph 7. It might appear obvious that there us a reasonable prospect of proposed voluntary arrangements being approved and implemented, but such criteria could be wrongly used or misinterpreted and bring into disrepute the rescue culture that we want to instil.
<P>
Some Committee members laughed on hearing the British Bankers Association's remark that it would support moratoriums that would succeed. That is playing safe&#151;wanting to play in the team, as long as it always wins. [Interruption.] I hope, Mr. Gale, that I shall get some brownie points for not taking up that sedentary intervention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It will be good if you do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> As I was saying, the BBA's attitude seems to be one of always wanting to be on the winning side and to bet in the knowledge that the horse will win. On Second Reading, the Opposition suggested that some people&#151;perhaps including those nebulous persons in authority&#151;might be persuaded to advocate moratoriums; they might do so through self interest. We do not know about their training, skills and so on, although the Minister will flesh the matter out in the fullness of time, so that the phrase ``authorised person'' can become a living and understood entity. I am concerned that the provision leaves wide open to the culture of ``It seemed a good idea at the time.'' The question why a moratorium was introduced might receive the following answer: because it had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented.
<P>
</UL></FONT>My amendments would contract the provision to one short, sharp sentence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the proposed voluntary arrangement is reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that will focus the minds of some of those who will be responsible for whether a moratorium should be granted. It should encourage them to move slightly nearer to the banks' view that the moratorium must stand a good chance of succeeding, instead of thinking ``Oh well, we'll just give it a try. If it works, fine, but if it doesn't, what harm is done?'' In so doing, I hope to deal with the harm that could be done during consideration of the next group of amendments.
<P>
We want to ensure that moratoriums are successful and that they embody, imbue and increase the rescue culture. We do not want to damage them or to make them likely to fall into disrepute, which might mean eventually that they are not advocated or used. Some hon. Members might say, ``If it's in the law, it can be used'', but during our debate on a later group of amendments, I hope to explain how the lending culture could be altered if moratoriums are abused. My amendments are simple and I hope that the Minister will spend a little time expanding his definition of the word ``reasonable''.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments would mean that the nominee's statement, which must be filed in court to enable a company to obtain a moratorium, would have to say only that the voluntary arrangement proposal was reasonable, rather than that it had a reasonable prospect of being approved and implemented. The current wording of paragraph 7, part of which the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire would remove, provides an important hurdle that directors must clear to benefit from the moratorium.
<P>
If amended, the paragraph would differ significantly from the old version in terms of what is required of a nominee. A nominee might consider a particular proposal reasonable, but he might also consider that the creditors might not find it reasonable. In such a case, he could make the required statement and the company could obtain a moratorium, but it is more than likely that proposal would not be agreed at meetings held under paragraph 29, especially creditors' meetings. To avoid such circumstances, it is therefore important to require the nominee to say whether, in his opinion, there is a reasonable prospect that a proposal will be approved and implemented. For that reason, I invite the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> An important point that has been made by both the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and myself is that the paragraph sets out some important powers and discretions for nominees or administrators. Therefore, it is important that the Minister, at this stage, tackle the question of such people's qualification to act.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall not deal with that question now because we shall be devoting considerable time to it soon. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am not sure that I follow the argument. By limiting the requirement to what is ``reasonable'', the amendments are themselves more reasonable than the existing requirement for the nominee to state that the arrangement is likely to be ``approved and implemented''. Such an assertion is much more difficult for the nominee to make. Surely, the main judgment of the court should be whether the proposal has a reasonable chance of success, rather than imponderables such as whether one group of creditors will differ from another, whether the banks will have a bigger say than the rest, or whether the company will be able to rally a meeting? The simple test of reasonableness is much more straightforward, and enlarges the prospect of obtaining the moratorium, unlike the more stringent test that is implied by wording that the amendments would remove.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> What is required is the nominee's considered opinion on whether the proposal is likely to be accepted. That is the rock that is threatening to hole this particular boat. If a proposal seems workable and offers better returns than the creditors might otherwise get, it is reasonable to assume that they would want to accept it. Nominees are not being asked to predict accurately whether creditors will accept the proposal, but nominees are familiar with the world of insolvency and have great experience of what creditors are likely to accept or reject, so they should be able to satisfy that requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> This is one of life's great mysteries, with which Standing Committees periodically have to deal. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby thinks that my amendments would lower the hurdles, yet the Minister thinks that they would raise them. I am somewhat confused and feel myself to be under a degree of pressure from those two great pillars of parliamentary experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> What does the hon. Gentleman think?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will hold his horses, I shall come to what I think.
<P>
I did not spend long introducing the amendments because I was hoping that the Minister would grasp the bit between his teeth and charge forward with a little more in the way of thinking. He is worried that the amendments would prove a rock on which the frail barque of the company could founder, but I wonder whether that is true. In the Minister's own words, a nominee can just go to the court and say, ``I think that this is reasonable, and that's that.'' Everything flows from there. However, the nominee who goes to court could be an authorised person&#151;that vague, nebulous creature on whose bones I hope some flesh will, at some point, be put. We do not know the extent to which the nominee will need to be qualified to go to court to make that judgment. Once more, I am agreeing with the Minister&#151;this is becoming embarrassing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am sorry to hear that.
<P>
If the nominee is a person of experience and qualification, who knows the world of business, his assurance that the plan is reasonable will carry weight and should be the main determining factor. The imponderables of whether he can prophesy with respect to this or that group are not the issue; it is simply a matter of whether the plan is reasonable and will succeed. If the nominee is a person of judgment, that should be the test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The hon. Gentleman has immediately loaded the argument by using the word ``experience''. I see no requirement in the Bill for the nominee to be experienced. Although he will not believe me when I say this, I want the moratoriums to succeed. What I do not want is failures after courts have given approval to claims, as that would rightly lead to clamour from creditors who complaining that moratoriums were not working and were being misused while perfectly genuine claims by creditors were ignored and pushed to one side. That is why I tabled the amendments.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will add a little bite to the proposals, to ensure that applications will be likely to succeed and will not be a case of ``It seemed a good idea at the time.'' I am disappointed that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to flesh the proposals out more fully, but, despite his reluctance to do so, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendments, to use an equine term, gallop over a fair bit of country. They fall, in my mind, into two sets. I see that mine are almost the majority of those that have been tabled, but I have the privilege of having tabled the first in the group. I shall speak first to amendments Nos. 15 to 17 and deal later with amendment No. 19.
<P>
I mentioned earlier that I want the moratoriums to succeed. My worry is that if they do not&#151;if they are abused or wrongly applied&#151;people who lend money will change the terms on which they lend. The Bill might, on the face of it, be doing a good thing for the smaller business sector, but that could turn out to be a disservice in the long term. My amendments are designed to ensure that the existing bargains are not unilaterally rewritten, to ensure the availability of funding for new and existing businesses that want to develop, and to assist the Government to promote the rescue culture.
<P>
As I have already pointed out, I have a degree of experience in running businesses, especially small ones, and I know the difficulty of the problems that face businesses trying to make their way in the competitive environment in which we live. I would be delighted if the Minister were not only to reassure me, but to contradict me. I believe that the Bill will adversely affect the rights of existing debenture holders, principally at clearing banks, in a dramatic fashion. Lending decisions have been made on the basis of full enforceable security. Retrospectively, that basis could be destroyed. Removing a debenture holder's rights to appoint an administrative receiver and crystallise the floating charge during a moratorium is a rewriting of the bargain that has been freely entered into. We have to recognise that that will be the effect of the moratorium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Gentleman might recall that I asked the Minister earlier to let us know whether the holder of a floating charge could crystallise it during the moratorium. His reply was no. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the power to appoint an administrative receiver during a moratorium would drive a coach and horses through the concept?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I can only agree; the Minister has made the situation regarding floating charges clear. I fully accept that it would make the Bill defunct if such a person could be appointed in the middle of a moratorium. I was outlining the present situation and what will happen. We ought to be clear about what we are endeavouring to achieve. We want a successful Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I feel that the amendments cut across the tenor of most of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, which have supported the rescue culture and small business. However, the amendments surely load the odds even further in favour of banks. They are already in a powerful position, especially over very small businesses, which usually have a mortgage charge on domestic property and floating charges. When banks have taken all the steps that they can to ensure their own position, why load the odds in favour of them further?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> All roads lead to Rome. Simply because the hon. Gentleman is galloping down one road, it does not mean that we all have to troop after him. I believe that it is necessary that the feelings of the people and organisations involved be clearly understood. Also, we must understand what their future reactions to the Bill might be as it proceeds on to the statute book. The purpose of the amendments is simple. All members of the Committee know what the other side of the coin could be.
<P>
I mentioned the rewriting of the bargain. The moratorium already mirrors parts of the Insolvency Act 1986 with one significant difference, which is that there is a penalty upon the debenture holders if a company goes into administration. Therefore, the Act provides that a company petition for administration must give notice to the debenture holder who then has the right to appoint an administrative receiver if he so wishes. If he does, the administration cannot proceed. There will not be that protection in this Bill.
<P>
Another aspect that the Committee should take into account is the walking asset, with which insolvency practitioners have had to deal over a number of years. In the period immediately prior to the appointment of an administrative receiver and the period between the moment of appointment and the moment he arrives on the company premises, assets have a tendency to walk. A later amendment will examine the limit whereby action may or not be taken. Again, it is human nature. The directors are under stress; they would not be in that position if the company did not have financial difficulties. As they see their jobs disappear, they sometimes make stupid decisions. Sometimes the decisions are more than stupid and are culpable.
<P>
During the moratorium, which could last for three months, the debenture holders' right to take control of those walking assets is suspended, threatening the viability of the company's business and the preservation of jobs. If the debenture holders know that their security can be rendered unenforceable for up to three months, what will their future lending criteria be? Will they carry on as before or will they be even more careful? I strongly believe that they will not lend the same proportion of the lending value of a company's assets, as they would have done without that three-month risk. That will have a severe impact on the viability of the company, on the availability for new funding and its ability to develop its activities or engage in new projects. It will have adverse effects on employment and the economy of the country in general.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> One of the considerations that companies will have in putting that debenture forward is the viability of the company. If the moratorium is to ensure that the viability of the company continues, would that not be a positive contribution and would there not be more generous lending conditions rather than the less generous ones that the hon. Gentleman suggests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I should love to think that the hon. Gentleman has correctly assessed the situation. I strongly suspect that the impact on the creditors in general during a moratorium will be greater than would have been the case. A number of companies will be rescued but if we want those companies to get financial support for the future, we must ensure that assets do not walk and that creditors do not suffer more heavily by allowing the moratorium to continue.
<P>
I cannot discuss the previous group of amendments, but I wanted to see the hurdle for a moratorium to be such that we have a greater percentage of success, so that the rescue culture is embedded rather than everyone demanding a moratorium. There is a high rate of failure and creditors lose more money. As soon as people stop being generous&#151;if that is the right word&#151;and lending money under the existing criteria, they will start to change the criteria. [Interruption.] I did not catch what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am sorry to interject from a sedentary position, Mr. Gale, but what is being said is incredible. When were the banks ever that generous? Can the hon. Gentleman give me some examples of the overflowing generosity shown by banks that supported companies beyond the point at which it was necessary?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The point that I am making is that the banks will become even tighter and meaner. The only example I can give of a company benefiting from a bank is when, instead of the company banking with the bank, the bank banks with the company; when the amounts are so huge that the bank has to keep the company going to get its money back. That can only happen if the assets and potential exist to support a rescue culture with a proper administrator going in, such as occurred at Rolls Royce.
<P>
The moratorium is one of the main planks of the rescue culture and we all want to see it succeed. However, if a company is to continue trading during that period, it must have funding and support; no bank or debenture holder will continue the overdraft facility if its rights are taken away. I flag that up merely as a warning, so that the whole Committee may consider it and bear it in mind. It is an essential part of the Bill that the company in difficulty should be assisted by the Bill's provision; the assistance that the Bill gives in one part should not be undermined by another part.
<P>
For example, paragraph 14 undermines the prospect of a company being rescued by a moratorium while offering creditors an unnecessary and excessive degree of protection. Almost inevitably, a company under a moratorium will need to locate a source of finance; that is obvious common sense. One cannot run a company when there is a moratorium in place unless one has a recognised source of funding, because the company will simply implode under its lack of resource to continue. Therefore, in practice, locating such funding is often an essential step in any rescue procedure, and I hope that the courts take that into account when they consider the reasonable prospect of a procedure being approved and implemented. I hope that they look and see that in the moratorium provision, there is a requirement of future funding. The Minister may have to return to that difficulty because to deprive a company of an ability to grant good security&#151;precisely what paragraph 14 does&#151;is not a smart move.
<P>
The legislation fails in another couple of ways. First, it requires the lender to investigate the affairs of a company, which is commercially unrealistic&#151;especially when finances are likely to be arranged under time pressure. Secondly, it unnecessarily affords protection of a company, even after it has traded out of its difficulty and exited the moratorium process. It seems bizarre that a company, many years after the event, should be entitled to avoid security that was freely and honestly given for good value. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that, because I think that it is absolutely vital that we understand and register what the effect could be if we did not make sensible provision for the creditors as they are currently operating. We do not want them to become even meaner and tighter in their financing, simply to avoid being put into a difficult position when a moratorium is granted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will concede my point that the amendment drives a coach and horses through the moratorium provisions of the Bill, which we all support. However, he made a good point about what he described as walking assets. When I mentioned the powers of debenture holders during a moratorium, the Minister confirmed that during the moratorium period, the holder of a floating charge cannot crystallise it. I do not believe that anyone would challenge the statement that banks are not philanthropic organisations. The core of the point made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire is that banks do not like to lend money unless they have people trussed up like a turkey just before it goes into an Aga.
<P>
I wonder whether the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will agree that the banks will have had significant notice of a moratorium before it happens. Therefore, I should have thought that, in practice, they would be able to crystallise their floating charges in any event. Nevertheless, he makes a good point. Perhaps the Government should consider the ability of banks to crystallise floating charges during the moratorium period. The Minister might deal with that point when he responds to the debate.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 40 and 46 to 48, which relate to leasehold property, seem to make sense. It is no good introducing a moratorium period if the business has no premises on which to function during that time. However, the amendments beg certain questions. Will the provisions affect existing leases? Will landlords be able to contract out of the provisions in leases or in addenda to leases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I rise to provide a note of sense in the extraordinary spectacle that we are now witnessing. The Conservative party seems, in its usual sycophantic fashion, to be deferring to the banks; a habit that it gained during its 18 years in power, in which matters were all run in favour of the banks. The Liberal Democrats, having originally taken a clear position on the banks, are now equivocating, saying that there may be some substance to the Bill and that it might frighten the banks off, and that the last thing we want to do is to frighten the banks off.
<P>
I shall speak only briefly, because the position is clear. My new clause 6 is a straightforward bash at the banks, which is something that the Committee has the power to do and should do. Banks are interested in their own self-preservation and their own money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> As usual, the hon. Gentleman uses the blunderbuss approach. Does he not concede that the point is valid and subtle? Furthermore, does he accept that it is in the interests of small business to be able to obtain money by borrowing? That is why the issue of finance for small business has been referred to the Competition Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Of course I concede that point. It is so obvious that it is surprising that it is not Liberal party policy. My point is that the banks already have so much power that it is unreasonable to argue that they should be given an additional protective power because they might be frightened off from lending more money. Banks will always take steps to insure themselves and to impose as many charges as they can on a business to ensure that funds are forthcoming.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that it is unreasonable to allow a floating charge to be crystallised during the moratorium period? If he does, will he explain why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The Minister has given us his position on the matter. It is exactly right and I have no intention of arguing with it. My amendment seeks merely to load the odds a little further against the banks by restricting them from taking any pre-emptive action that will affect the fate of a small business that has adopted the procedures in the Bill. The enormous power of the banks and their usual role as the force for closure means that it unreasonable to give them any substantial power. I am trying merely to restrict the banks' power and to prevent them from undercutting the Bill's protective arrangements for small business. That is my simple intention. I might listen to arguments about whether my amendment is practicable, but not about whether it is right to reduce the banks' power, which has been used with overweening brutality, in order to protect the small businesses that we are trying to guarantee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This debate has taken me rather by surprise, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I should like to put the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire right on one point. I may have misunderstood, but I sensed that he had the impression that the court decides on the voluntary agreement. It does not. Decisions made in the meetings of the company and its creditors determine whether such an agreement will be made, under paragraph 36 of the schedule. The moratorium is obtained when the necessary documents are filed in court, but the court does not grant the moratorium, which is decided at the meeting.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about assets going astray during a moratorium. If directors intended to spirit away their assets, would they first obtain a moratorium where their activities will be scrutinised by a nominee? I do not think so. Of course, they will be subject to a range of offences for the spiriting away of assets during a moratorium. If that is what directors want to do, surely they will do it outside rather than inside a moratorium. He also spoke about the removal of funding. Before a company can obtain a moratorium, the nominee must be satisfied that it will have funding. If the bank is antagonised, the nominee will surely take that into account when formulating his or her opinion.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked whether the provisions would affect existing leases. Yes, but we have provided a safeguard for landlords who apply to the court for relief. He also asked whether landlords and tenants could contract out of the provisions in leases. The answer is no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I want to comment on some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. Amendments are not always tabled in the confident belief that they will be accepted, with any likelihood of their acceptance or even with any desire for the Committee's agreement. Many amendments, to use the time-old expression, are probing amendments. I wish only that the Minister could have spent a little longer doing his probing in response to my remarks. I fully accept his comments about the documents being filed at court. If I gave any impression that the court made the decision, I wish to withdraw it, as that is erroneous.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
