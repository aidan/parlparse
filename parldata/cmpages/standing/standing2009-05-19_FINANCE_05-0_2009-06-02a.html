Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Atkinson. Will it be convenient to discuss schedule 5 at
the same time as clause
17?</div><a name="09060252000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000362"></a>The
Chairman:</b> No, we were going to debate schedule
5 separately. However, if it would assist the Committee, I propose to
employ considerable latitude and allow mention of schedule 5 on the
basis that we do not have an extended stand part debate on it. Is that
acceptable?</div><a name="09060252000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000363"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank you for that guidance, Mr.
Atkinson. That is most acceptable, and I will refer to schedule 5 in
the course of my remarks on clause
17.</div><a name="09060252000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have given us quite the runaround on air passenger duty. At
the beginning of last year, they appeared to agree with the Opposition
that taxing on a per-plane basis would be a better option than the
existing tax on a per-passenger basis&#151;in the name of penalising
flights that run near empty. In fact, they proposed to go further than
some were suggesting at the time and extend their new per-plane tax to
freight and non-commercial civil flights. Then they got into problems
of their own making on questions of definition and administration.
Finally, they gave up altogether and decided to stick with the current
tax on passengers, which is generally paid, as we know, at the point of
ticket purchase.</div>
<a name="09060252000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the 2008
pre-Budget report ran up the white flag, but with some diversionary
reforms that will hit existing passengers quite hard. Here we see a
story that is similar and familiar to other aspects of the Budget and
Finance Bill: a number of elements that the Government tried to
introduce, to increase predictability and durability in the tax system,
have been completely blown out of the water.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div><a name="09060252000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, two
levels of APD are applied, according to the distance flown. Roughly
speaking, there is one rate for flying to an EU destination and another
rate for flying elsewhere. The pre-Budget report proposed replacing
those two rates with four rates, making all flights more expensive, but
with big duty increases especially on long-haul flights. Despite
protests from the industry, this time the Government have not changed
their mind and clause 17 and schedule 5 aim to put the pre-Budget
report plans into effect.</div>
<a name="09060252000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
taking a moment to examine the scale of the changes. The existing
two-band regime, as I said, becomes a four-band version as laid out in
schedule 5, with all rates significantly higher than those at present.
The two existing bands are, first, the UK-EU and other qualifying
territories such as Switzerland and Turkey, and, secondly, everywhere
else. That is the status quo. At present, the first band duty is
&#163;10 per passenger for economy and &#163;20 for all other
classes; the long-haul band is &#163;40 and &#163;80 respectively.
That is fairly straightforward at the
moment.</div><a name="09060252000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the four new bands, which will come into effect from November 2009,
start again with a similar band. Part 1 in schedule 5 is very similar
to the present short-haul band, but with the rates charged going up by
10 per cent. to &#163;11 and &#163;22. It now includes the Maghreb
countries and Russia west of the Ural mountains. The new part 2
territory, as outlined in schedule 5, includes North America, Egypt,
the middle east, eastern Russia and Pakistan. Duty rates from November
will be &#163;45 for economy and &#163;90 for other
classes, which represents a 12.5 per cent. rise.</div>
<a name="09060252000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 3 is
banded at &#163;50 for economy and &#163;100 for all premium
classes. That includes India, China, Japan and much of Latin America
and is a 25 per cent. rise. What I shall call part 4, but which is
defined legally as all those territories which are not in parts 1 to 3,
comprises Australasia and various parts of Latin America, including
Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru and some other smaller South American
countries and the Falkland Islands. Duty will be &#163;55 and
&#163;110 pounds, which represents a huge 37.5 per cent. increase on
the status
quo.</div><a name="09060252000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is more, the Government are programming big rises again in 2010, far
bigger than the rises I have just mentioned which come in this
November. Part 1 charges will rise to &#163;12 and &#163;24. In
each of these figures, the first is for economy and the second for
premium classes. Part 2 will be &#163;60 and &#163;120;
part 3 will be &#163;75 and &#163;150 and part 4 will be &#163;85
and &#163;170. These are huge increases. Those in the second wave
were a little bit hidden in those figures, but by combining the
November 2009 and November 2010 increases, we see the full magnitude of
what is proposed. Looking at economy class passengers only, those
flying to popular destinations such as France or Spain will face a 20
per cent. tax hike in the next 18 months. Those flying to
Florida and all other destinations in the States will face a 50 per
cent. hike. Those flying to India will face a huge 88 per cent.
increase in the tax element of their ticket and those flying to
Australia and New Zealand will face a whopping 113 per cent.
tax
hike.</div><a name="09060252000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a few questions on the methodology used in schedule 5A, which sets
up the four new bands. First, all territories not named in the schedule
are assumed to be in with Australasia and most of South America. As we
know, the world has seen significant changes in
boundaries 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>since 1989, perhaps bigger than any seen since 1919. We
cannot rule out future boundary changes and, indeed, the creation of
new states. Yet it would appear that any new state would be
thrown automatically into the band that does not include parts 1 to 3,
in other words the Australasia band. For example, Kosovo is listed
under part 1, but if a new county were to be set
up&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="09060252000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
heard the hon. Member for Taunton say &#147;Scotland&#148;. So let
us take the uncontroversial example of Scotland, which would be thrown
in with Australasia. Someone flying from London to Edinburgh would
suddenly be charged not &#163;12 in APD, but &#163;85, which is a
sevenfold increase. I note the absence of the hon. Member for Dundee,
East. He might be rather interested in this. It would appear that the
listings could be amended by statutory instrument. I suspect that they
would be. But this appears to be a cumbersome way overall of defining
these distances. What started out with an idea of relative
simplicity&#151;all territories with capital cities
within 2,000 miles of London would be included in part
1&#151;has become needlessly complicated as a result of the
Government&#146;s
approach.</div><a name="09060252000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
briefly touched on Russian geography in our debates on tobacco duty. I
should be interested to know how the Government define &#147;west of
the Urals&#148;. There are currently no direct flights from the UK to
Ekaterinburg, which is a sizeable city in the Urals. Five other EU
airlines fly there so it is not impossible that this could be a future
destination. Is the city in band 1 or band 2? The Government say that
they are splitting Russia&#151;the only country that is
split&#151;because</div><a name="09060252000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is administratively simple to do so&#148;.</div>
<a name="09060252000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not so sure. The Russians themselves
do not have a ready definition of the location of the Urals&#151;a
mountain chain that begins about 400 miles north of the Caspian sea. So
precisely how would one define the cities there that could be
destinations? I have given the example of Ekaterinburg, which is quite
a likely future destination.</div>
<a name="09060252000033"></a>
        <div class="hs_Para">So if it is administratively simple to split Russia, 
          which I doubt, why is it not administratively simple to split the United 
          States, for example, where the Government are basically throwing into 
          the same band cities such as Boston on the one hand and Honolulu and 
          Anchorage on the other?</div>
<a name="09060252000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">These points
might seem trivial, but elsewhere there could be political
repercussions, for example by charging flights to Pakistan 25 per cent.
less tax than flights to India. That would of course be drawn from the
Government&#146;s schedule according to distance from London, but the
way it has been simplified into bands could cause political problems.
For example, how exactly will a chartered flight to Kashmir be defined?
The airline operator would basically have to decide which bits of
Kashmir were properly covered in schedule 3 as being part of India and
which bits belong to Pakistan and are therefore in part 2. I raise
those points because someone has designed the system with little
thought for some of the considerations
involved.</div>
<a name="09060252000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000364"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): My hon.
Friend has made an excellent point and raises a few things that I had
not considered but which the Minister and the Department clearly should
have considered  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>in more detail. Will he be pressing for a simple map of the world
outlining, pictorially and geographically rather than in words,
precisely what is and is not
covered?</div><a name="09060252000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000365"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> That would certainly be helpful, because it would
start to focus minds on some of the difficulties caused by simply
drawing up a list of existing countries and pretending that there are
no political ramifications in doing
so.</div><a name="09060252000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
people are concerned that the Caribbean, which is most dependent on
tourism, will be included in the part 3 territories. A family of four
will pay &#163;300 in APD from November 2010 for a return flight to
the Caribbean, which is a lot of money for a family holiday. Caribbean
Governments have reacted furiously to that proposal&#151;I happen to
know that because some of their high commissions are located in my
constituency and around 10 per cent. of my constituents are of
Caribbean origin. Under the bands, Florida would be in part 2, but the
whole of the Caribbean would be in part 3. I have read in the <i class="I">Travel
Trade Gazette</i> that the Governments of those countries have drawn up
lists of UK parliamentary constituencies where their voices can make a
big difference. The Jamaican tourism Minister, Ed Bartlett, speaking at
a reception here in the Palace of Westminster in April
said:</div><a name="09060252000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Caribbean communities in the UK are beginning to understand this will
hurt
them.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
away from some of the geographical problems to which the schedule will
give rise, the Government&#146;s change in policy has consequences,
and there is a need to examine in some detail the case for their
180-degree U-turn since they first set out their intention to move to a
per-plane tax in January 2008. When they originally launched their
consultation in that month, the intention to move to a per-plane tax
was absolutely clear. The Government
would</div><a name="09060252000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;replace
air passenger duty with a duty payable per plane rather than per
passenger.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
case of doubt, the consultation document was
unambiguous:</div><a name="09060252000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
reform will take place on 1 November 2009, and has the objective of
sending a better environmental signal, and ensuring that aviation makes
a greater contribution to covering its environmental
costs&#148;</div><a name="09060252000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">while
ensuring that a fair level of revenue continues to be raised from the
sector in order</div>
<a name="09060252000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to support
public services.&#148;</div>
<a name="09060252000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The document describes
as a principle the need to provide incentives for the more efficient
use of planes by taxing similarly sized aircraft the same, no matter
how full the plane. There we have it: in January 2008 they set out a
clear intention, with the reasons stated, to move to a per-plane tax
rather than a per-passenger tax.</div>
<a name="09060252000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
year&#146;s Finance Act provided for certain powers to proceed in
that direction, and Ministers again committed to a per-plane tax this
time a year ago, with only the final scope and mechanism open to
change, and yet six months later the change was absolutely
total.</div><a name="09060252000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000366"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): If I remember correctly, and
I may not, the original tax was introduced by Lord Lamont in the early
1990s. Will the hon. Gentleman speculate as to why the noble Lord
decided then not to go ahead with a plane tax and preferred a passenger
tax instead?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000367"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am not entirely sure of the background. I thought
that it was introduced in 1996, in which case it would have been under
the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr.
Clarke). Either way, I am not sure of the reasons or the arguments used
at the time. Maybe the Minister can help

Either way, I am unable to reflect on the precise reasoning used at the

<a name="09060252000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s U-turn is set out in &#147;Aviation duty:
response to consultation&#148;, which was published alongside the
pre-Budget report last November. It makes for interesting reading and
includes sorry excuses, where they are provided at all. We can agree
that the member states&#146; decision in October to include aviation
in the EU emissions trading scheme was a significant development, but
the Government acknowledge the ongoing case for a UK tax alongside the
EU emissions trading scheme. The response claimed that the U-turn
was:</div><a name="09060252000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Consistent
with the Government&#146;s objectives to provide additional support
to businesses and individuals in the short-term and maintain action on
climate
change&#148;.</div><a name="09060252000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it was not consistent with their previous environmental analysis. One
might infer from the talk of supporting business that the U-turn was
welcome to the industry&#151;one struggles to see how. The industry
has reacted furiously to the huge hikes, which are outlined in the
clause and the schedule. Hikes of anything up to 113 per cent. are
projected over the next 18 months on air passenger duty. That figure
obviously relates to Australasia and parts of South America, but these
are big, across-the-board increases. British Airways
said:</div><a name="09060252000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;APD
was doubled two years ago, making air travel from the UK the most
heavily taxed in the world...The Government&#146;s own figures
show that British airlines already meet their environmental costs, so
there can be no &#145;green&#146; justification for these
additional
taxes.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000370"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I would be grateful to know the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s thoughts on whether this is more likely to make
aviation from Britain uncompetitive. I have heard arguments that some
people may choose a short-haul flight to a hub in the Netherlands or
France and a longer haul flight from there. Is that likely to have
consequences or will a wider EU application avoid that
hazard?</div>
<a name="09060252000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000371"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and
will explore that issue, but, at this point, we simply do not know. If
we put air passenger duty up by these three-figure percentage rates, we
cannot exclude the possibility that it will become economic to fly to
Amsterdam, for example, buy an additional ticket starting
there&#151;luggage would have to be checked in there&#151;board a
connecting flight to Bangkok, for example, and end up saving money. At
the moment, it is difficult to speculate. I think that the Minister
feels that she has  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>speculated on it and wants to intervene. If we put up APD to such a
level, that kind of transaction starts to appear
economic.</div><a name="09060252000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000372"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman gets too carried away
with his argument, I want to point out that 70 per cent. of passengers
travel from the UK to band A destinations. The figures that he has
quoted demonstrate that APD for band A will go up by &#163;1 in
November and then by a further &#163;1 the following November; for
business class travel it goes up by &#163;2 and then &#163;4. He
should bear that in mind before he develops his argument too much,
instead of getting carried away with the larger increases for longer
haul
flights.</div><a name="09060252000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000373"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> First, the increases that the Minister quotes are
only the November 2009 increases and do not include the further
increases in November 2010. Secondly, one must look at the long-haul
flights. If one were to fly from London to Bangkok, which is the
example that I gave, it could well become more economical simply to buy
a flight for the London to Amsterdam leg. I believe that the
Netherlands has abolished air passenger duty, so there would then be no
tax on the ensuing flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok, if it was bought
as an entirely separate ticket. That is the point that I am trying to
make&#151;it relates not to the 75 per cent. of people who fly to
Europe but to the 25 per cent. of people who fly further
afield.</div><a name="09060252000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000374"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): Of course, if the tax increase
for flying to Amsterdam or Paris is lower but the long-haul flight
increases are higher&#151;in other word, the increases for flights to
Australasia&#151;there is then an incentive to hop over the channel
to take a long-haul flight, because we are talking about an awful lot
of money. Therefore, there is a differential pricing arrangement here,
which may have a long-term impact on our airline
industry.</div>
<a name="09060252000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000375"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is why I
was looking at some of the increases. For example, the 113 per cent.
increase on the tax element of an economy flight to Australia, compared
to the 10 per cent. rise on the tax element of an economy
flight to Amsterdam, could well make the type of  ticket
shopping that I have described much more
prevalent.</div><a name="09060252000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to return to the reactions given by the industry to some of these
changes. I mentioned British Airways and easyJet. If the Minister is
right, virtually all of easyJet&#146;s flights would be affected. It
operates flights to a couple of places in Egypt, but virtually all of
its flights are to part 1 territories. If the Minister is right, one
would have thought that, because 75 per cent. of people go to part 1
territories, those airlines should not be too fussed about this change.
easyJet would be an obvious company that would not be too bothered, if
the Minister is right. However, the opposite is the case. easyJet says
this:</div>
<a name="09060252000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Chancellor of the Exchequer has missed the opportunity to give air
passengers a much-deserved shot in the arm by refusing to ditch his
planned &#163;1bn raid on the airline industry over the next two
years...In today's Budget he should have waived the planned
increases&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09060252000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
air passenger duty&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div><a name="09060252000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in order to help
an industry which will be at the forefront of dragging the economy out
of recession&#148;.</div>
<a name="09060252000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, far from the
Minister&#146;s response that those flying to the 75 per cent. of
areas that will be unaffected simply will not be that troubled by this
change, the example of easyJet says precisely the
opposite.</div>
<a name="09060252000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000376"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
thank my hon. Friend for giving way. I am a great supporter of easyJet
and I use it. However, I think that it is a pretty contentious
statement to suggest that somehow the airline industry will be the
industry that will be &#147;dragging&#148; this country &#147;out
of recession&#148;. It is an important industry, but there are a
considerable number of other industries that will also be
important.</div><a name="09060252000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to ask my hon. Friend a question on this issue. Does he share my
overriding concern that there will inevitably be perverse incentives as
a result of this change? He has touched on some of them that were
rather ignored by the Minister. There will be some very perverse
incentives, along the lines that he has set out, that are likely to be
fairly catastrophic, both in financial terms and, probably more
important, in relation to the environmental targets of both this
Government and hopefully a future Conservative
Administration.</div>
<a name="09060252000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000377"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
will respond to the two specific points that he made. By quoting
easyJet, I was not necessarily endorsing its point of view. I was
actually answering the point that the Government made earlier; there
were a number of interventions and perhaps we lost the thread of the
argument a little bit. However, the Government said that their
justification for continuing with the status quo on APD was to provide
additional support to businesses. I was merely pointing out that a lot
of these businesses obviously thought that the opposite was the
case.</div>
<a name="09060252000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend is absolutely right, however, on some of the perverse
incentives. We have already talked about one of them, which is the
possibility of passengers buying two separate tickets to reach a
long-haul destination. There is also nothing in this proposal that ends
the perverse incentive for airlines to fly empty airliners around. We
had thought, and in fact the Government told us, that that was one of
the reasons why we wanted to move to a plane tax in the first place. So
he is quite right about the perverse incentives that exist.</div>
<a name="09060252000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will just
finish on the airlines with a brief word from the travel agents, who
are also important in the current economic environment. The Association
of British Travel Agents has also raised concerns about the impact that
APD will have on regional passengers who are forced to fly via London
and have to pay the tax twice when they travel with two different
airlines. Again, that is another perverse incentive and it is
significant for the viability of some of our regional airports. If, as
the Government say, the industry welcomes their proposals, the industry
has done an excellent job in suppressing its enthusiasm for the huge
tax rises.</div>
<a name="09060252000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
will also have a negative impact on Britain&#146;s competitiveness as
a tourist destination if passengers are forced to pay APD on their
return journey. I would appreciate clarification on whether APD can be
levied on transfer passengers or not. The Royal Aeronautical Society
tells me&#151;I have not had a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>chance to obtain independent verification of this, but I have no reason
to disbelieve it&#151;that some US interests are taking their
Government to court for charging APD on some transfers, even though the
passengers and their luggage stay air side at all times. I believe that
other countries are also questioning such an approach. Will the
Minister inform us of the latest developments in those important court
cases, and what is the Government&#146;s current position on transfer
passengers?</div><a name="09060252000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reaction from environmental groups has been mixed. Many welcomed the
headline rises, but, like us, decried the abandoned attempt to find a
per-plane methodology. Friends of the Earth
responded:</div><a name="09060252000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
rises in APD are welcome, but should be seen in the context of the
abandoning of per-plane aviation
duty.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Greenpeace
stated:</div><a name="09060252000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Plans
to tax flights instead of people would have encouraged the industry to
fill their planes instead of flying half-empty airliners around the
world. Once again the aviation industry has been given a free pass at a
time when its contribution to climate change is
rising.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the National Society for Clean Air
noted:</div><a name="09060252000067"></a><div class="hs_brev" style="text-align: justify;">&#147;Air
Passenger Duty is set to be doubled. However, in light of the
significant expansion in UK aviation announced in 2003&#146;s
Aviation White Paper these changes are unlikely to have significant
impacts on overall emissions from aircraft.&#148;</div>
<a name="09060252000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Charter
airlines are another group affected by the measure. The APD tax
structure pays no heed to a class called premium economy; it simply
lumps it together with business and first class, which is hard to
justify to those who simply need a small increase in leg room. We have
to understand how premium economy class works on charter flights.
Essentially, as I understand it, there is no difference in the seat;
premium economy class merely adds a small amount of leg room. The class
is particularly popular with families with young children who like to
move around on planes, especially on seven-hour charter flights to
somewhere like Florida or the Caribbean. It is very difficult to keep
children under control or entertained without a little bit of leg room
that allows them to move around. Premium economy class seats are
therefore very popular with families and, as I understand it, do not
cost an awful lot
more.</div><a name="09060252000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
those travelling in premium economy class will now have to pay double
the APD of the regular economy class passenger. That will be especially
true for long-haul charter flights to Florida, for example, when a
family of four travels in premium economy class on a charter plane. I
am not talking about business passengers flying hurriedly from London
to a meeting in New York; I am talking about families on quite
reasonable charter package holidays to somewhere like Florida or the
Caribbean.</div><a name="09060252000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000378"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I anticipate getting letters on the issue
from two other groups in my constituency. The first is people with
disabilities that require them to move more than they might be able to
in a restricted space. The other&#151;this may sound vaguely amusing,
but it is not meant to be&#151;is tall people who quite often take
opportunities such as that under discussion and may feel unfairly
treated as a result of the
measure.</div><a name="09060252000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000379"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am not sure which tax regime applies to those
with disabilities, so I would be grateful if the Minister would explain
what kind of special rules, if  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>any, relate to them on flights. The issue of tall people was raised by
my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough during last year&#146;s
Finance Bill debate. He referred to my hon. Friend the Member for
Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), who was not a member of the
Committee, as an example of somebody who would need additional leg
room. The hon. Member for Taunton therefore makes a valid point.
However, for a family of four travelling premium economy in a chartered
plane, this will mean &#163;600 in air passenger duty from November
2010, compared to &#163;160 today. That is more or less a
quadrupling, an extra &#163;440 on a family holiday to a state such
as
Florida.</div><a name="09060252000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09060252000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the present economic circumstances, the Government have baulked at
introducing a per-plane tax on the scale that they originally intended,
encompassing freight aircraft and other sectors. They have been forced
to try to recoup some of the revenue lost by not introducing the
per-plane tax from the existing per-passenger APD structure. That is
why the hikes are so steep and potentially punitive for air passengers.
The Government also began in the wrong place, not least when selecting
a yardstick for emissions when they began their consultation.
Conservative Members do not accept that a per-plane tax is unworkable.
On that, we are, I believe, of one mind with the Liberal Democrats, so
I look forward hearing what the hon. Member for Taunton has to say. I
am not sure whether I have surprised him by suggesting that I expect
him to say something on this subject, but I very much hope that he
will.</div> <a name="09060252000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
certainly difficulties in drawing up an all-encompassing system and, to
be fair, in launching the consultation the Government were aware of at
least a few of them; however, they have backed down through a
combination of a lack of will and poor starting points. As my
predecessor in this role, my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine
Greening), pointed out in last year&#146;s Finance Bill debate, the
Government&#146;s lead options going into the consultation were far
from ideal.</div>
<a name="09060252000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">To save the
Minister from later explanations, I point out that the obvious course
of taxing an aircraft&#146;s emissions appears to be impermissible
under international agreements, such as the Chicago convention. Putting
tax on aviation fuel, even indirectly, is against the terms of that
convention. We welcome the Government&#146;s attempts to get other
countries and international bodies to look again at the international
framework. However, under that framework, a per-plane tax, if it is to
be within the rules, has to find a proxy for emissions. That is where
the difficulties
start.</div><a name="09060252000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government hit upon the manufacturers&#146; declaration of an
aircraft&#146;s maximum take-off weight&#151;MTOW&#151;as its
emissions yardstick. My hon. Friend the Member for Putney is something
of an expert on the aviation sector&#151;a number of Members who have
constituencies around Heathrow airport have inevitably had to learn a
lot about emissions, noise and other environmental impacts from
aircraft. She warned Ministers last
year:</div><a name="09060252000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Emissions
depend not just on take-off weight, but also on the speed of flight and
the design of the plane.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Finance Public Bill Committee, </i>12 June 2008; c.
714.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="09060252000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an obvious but
important point. Maximum take-off weight makes no distinction between
newer, cleaner aircraft and older, less efficient models, so no
incentive to upgrade fleets is provided. Nor do aircraft always operate
at their maximum take-off weight&#151;in fact they rarely do. The
weight depends on how an aircraft is fitted out and how much fuel it
needs for a particular
journey.</div><a name="09060252000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation mentioned some alternatives, which would account for
certain emissions in a flight&#146;s landing and take-off cycle, but
the problem with those schemes was clear from the outset. Paragraph 3.7
of the Government&#146;s response briefly lists some of the
alternatives that the industry suggested. Many of them appear to be
viable and to offer a more direct correlation with CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">
</span>emissions, but, unfortunately, the Government provide no analysis
of those options. They are left there, hinting at what might have been
explored had the Government not begun the process with their flawed
fixation on maximum take-off
weight.</div><a name="09060252000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation also toyed with having airports collect the per-plane tax,
which immediately raised the prospect of commercial airlines having to
pay administration fees on top. Indeed, a per-plane regime would
probably entail a whole new administrative set-up run by the airport
operators. Trying to bring non-commercial flights, such as private
business trips, within the scope of the tax&#151;a laudable
objective, we would all say&#151;while maintaining a
one-size-fits-all collection method always made such problems likely. I
shall not offer an extensive account of the plans that have now been
abandoned. The important point is that from, arguably, trying to go too
far, too quickly the Government have now retreated too far and have
taken harsh steps to compensate for their abandonment of their very
good intent to move to a per-plane taxation system.</div>
<a name="09060252000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">One is left
with the obvious question: if the Government did not want to extend
taxation to other parts of the industry, such as freight operators, at
this time, why did they not introduce a per-plane tax for commercial
passenger aircraft only, which would only affect flights that already
pay APD? The commercial aviation sector favoured the existing
operator-HMRC collection model. The move would have solved the
administrative problem as well. Most of all, it would have introduced a
disincentive to fly empty planes, which everyone regards as sensible
and which will still be lacking now that APD is to be reformed and not
replaced.</div><a name="09060252000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have read the Treasury&#146;s November response carefully, but I
cannot see any compelling reason why the Government could not have
considered some of the alternatives to maximum take-off weight in more
detail. Now, we all have to pay the costs of the consequences. Instead
of taxing non-passenger commercial aircraft and taxing freight and
private jets and so on, there will be huge hikes in air passenger duty,
which will be felt by ordinary Britons, due to the Government&#146;s
backing down and their lack of courage and persistence in looking for a
new regime. However, we are where we are following the
U-turn.</div>
<a name="09060252000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to go back for a moment to the Government&#146;s original plans. The
Government added to their choice of maximum take-off weight as a proxy
for emissions another element: distance. The take-off weight was
intended, however crudely, to signify how dirty an aircraft was and
applying a distance measure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>would then approximate emissions over the duration of a flight. They
consulted on two options. The first was the actual distance flown in
terms of great circle distance or GCD&#151;the shortest distance
between point A and point B, after the earth&#146;s curvature is
factored
in.</div><a name="09060252000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was a student in the last year of O-level maths before studying great
circles was removed from the curriculum. I wondered at the time whether
I would ever find a use for that knowledge of great circles due to the
curvature of the earth. I have finally found it, some 28 years after
sitting my maths O-level. I do not want to digress too far, but I was
talking to a constituent who is a
teacher&#151;</div><a name="09060252000083"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000380"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman is talking about his
maths O-level. Is he absolutely sure that it was 28 years ago? I think
he is the same age as me and O-levels were less than 28 years
ago.</div><a name="09060252000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000381"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I have to inform the hon. Gentleman that I am
somewhat older than him. I think he was born in 1970. I shall not say
precisely how old I am, but I sat my maths O-level in 1981. I would
have been a Ruth-Lawrence-style child prodigy had I been the same age
as the hon. Gentleman and sitting my maths O-level aged 11. The head of
maths at the London Oratory school told me that one of the questions in
the maths GCSE was to draw a line 7 cm long, which is more of an
instruction than a question. I think we should go back to the days when
we studied great circles rather than having to draw lines 7 cm
long&#151;but that is enough on maths
exams.</div><a name="09060252000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first option used great circles. The second used banding as a proxy for
distance, based on global geography which, as we know, has been
something which the Government have more or less amended and kept with
us. The link to the proposals before us today jumps out. The
consultation only proposed three bands. However, this is how the
response was recorded in the Government&#146;s own document in
November:</div>
<a name="09060252000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
was a great deal of concern that both a banding system or the use of
GCD could create a strong incentive for passengers and freight with
long-haul destinations to hub outside the
UK&#148;.</div><a name="09060252000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London
and Westminster and by the hon. Member for Taunton about the incentive
that passengers will now potentially have to transfer in places such as
Amsterdam, that danger was acknowledged by the Government in their
original consultation. Put simply, the more costs that are loaded on to
distance, the greater the incentive there is for people to jump on a
short-haul flight over the channel to complete their journey from
there, so that they can profit from a lower tax regime operating in
some of our rival aviation hubs. The Government noted the risk of
having three bands, only to exacerbate that risk by having a fourth
band.</div>
<a name="09060252000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
assessment, published alongside the Budget, included this summary of
the problem:</div>
<a name="09060252000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently
some passengers may take commercial decisions which reduce their APD
liability by buying separate (i.e. non-connecting) air tickets, where
this is possible. This will remain an option under the APD
changes.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
having highlighted that risk of that practice occurring, however, the
impact assessment then dismisses the possibility of its occurring on a
wider scale. It says:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div><a name="09060252000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in these cases,
there can be significant time penalties involved, since passengers not
on connecting tickets must retrieve their luggage and re-check in at
the European hub. There could also be higher airport charges and other
costs. The added time and inconvenience will significantly limit the
extent to which people choose to buy separate air tickets to avoid
paying a modest
increase&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09060252000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
stress those words, &#147;a modest
increase&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09060252000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
APD on longer distance
flights.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed increases are not a &#147;modest increase&#148; at all.
They reduce the competitiveness of airlines operating out of the UK and
may well cause a significant loss of business to airlines operating out
of cities such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris. Ironically, the
effect would also be, of course, to increase emissions. Not only will
we have people avoiding the tax regime, but there will be an increase
in emissions due to all of the additional flights required to cover a
route that could be covered directly by one plane.</div>
<a name="09060252000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s document, &#147;Aviation duty: response to
consultation&#148;, listed the other problems with banding. It
noted:</div><a name="09060252000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many
respondents agreed that banding was a simple system but there was
concern that such a system would not reflect the true environmental
cost of emissions and environmental
impact.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is precisely the point that we are making, and it was made in the
document in the context of banding for a per-plane tax. It applies all
the more strongly to APD, which is levied on passengers.</div>
<a name="09060252000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s document also brought out the other major flaw, by
highlighting the concern
that</div><a name="09060252000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
system based on capital cities could be blunt, placing all of the US
and all of Russia within one band despite the great distances between
their capital cities and the farthest destinations in each of these
countries.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already looked at Russia. It has been split into
bands&#151;rather imperfectly, if I may say so, but the point about
dividing it up remains good none the less. Within the US, of course,
the distances are massive, but the US is far easier to define in terms
of where in the US one could be based&#151;for example, in any of the
50 states. It is much easier to define than Russia, which is one
continuous country. Although Russia is a federation, most of the
component parts are very small republics. However, a flight from London
to Boston will attract the same APD as one to Honolulu, despite
covering less than half the distance. Can it be right that a flight
from London to Honolulu, which might be competing with the flights to
the Caribbean that I talked about earlier, will be subject to
significantly less APD than a flight to Jamaica? I think that the
schedule is somewhat flawed in that regard.</div>
<a name="09060252000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Government maintain that using actual distances would have too many
disadvantages, but I fail to see why they make that argument. Anybody
who flies often and is a member of a frequent flier club will know that
the airline tells them instantly how miles they have flown. I do not
know whether that is on a great circle basis or an &#147;as the crow
flies&#148; basis, but it seems to be incredibly easy to calculate
the distance. The Government claim that that would have too many
disadvantages, so perhaps the Minister could explain why they believe
that using the actual distance would somehow be too difficult or
disadvantageous, despite the fact that great circle distance was widely
favoured among the 170 responses they received in the
consultation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="09060252000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09060252000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">However
one accounts for distance, the avoidance problem will increase the
higher the charges applied. The Government&#146;s U-turn has left
them exposed to a revenue shortfall&#151;because they wanted to
extend aviation duty beyond the commercial passenger sector, they
pencilled in the extra revenue that would raise. Even with the
increases before us, the Red Book shows that the Government will be
down &#163;70 million on its projection this financial year, and
&#163;190 million next year, because of their failed attempt to
introduce the reforms they had flagged so widely. That is why the
increases in APD are so steep: they have to be steep to offset some of
the cost of the U-turn, never mind that it is passengers who will
suffer under an already discredited system.</div>
<a name="09060252000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">A per-plane
tax makes sense, but a per-passenger tax does not. The purpose of the
tax, we are told, is to tackle emissions, but it is not the passengers
who are making the emissions, but the planes. Even if it were limited
to commercial passenger airline flights, a per-plane tax would
represent a fundamental improvement on the measures before us. It could
still be done, but the present Government have exhausted their ability
to manoeuvre.</div>
<a name="09060252000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, in the 2007 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor announced a
new per-plane duty. In the 2008 pre-Budget report, he withdrew it. At
the end of this debate, the Minister will no doubt say that the huge
new tax increases of up to 113 per cent. are a model of good sense, but
the Opposition beg to
differ.</div><a name="09060252000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000382"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on a
characteristically rigorous speech.</div>
<a name="09060252000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000383"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Syms</b>: And
brief.</div><a name="09060252000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000384"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I certainly do not wish to speak so briefly on so
important an issue. The only issue the hon. Gentleman did not cover was
the classification of newly formed volcanic islands for the purposes of
the clause. I now regret having been born only in 1970 and not having
the advantage of studying great circles in my maths O-level. I was in
the penultimate year for O-levels and do not recall having had any
questions that required me to draw a straight line of a certain
distance, but I would clearly have benefited from more study of great
circles. It was an excellent speech, and had the exciting proposals put
forward by the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)
for free votes in Committees applied today, I would hope that many
Labour Members, having heard the speech, would be tempted to vote
against the
Government.</div><a name="09060252000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting
back to the nub of the matter, it was helpful to have it clarified that
it was in the early 1990s, the last time the public finances were in a
ruinous state, that a Chancellor of the Exchequer initially introduced
this form of
taxation.</div><a name="09060252000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000385"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s logic, but it
is not fair to compare the condition of the public finances in the
early 1990s with their current condition. The maximum budget deficit
then was around 7 per cent., but I believe that the current figure is
north of 13 per cent. It is not quite the same
scenario&#151;there is a quantitative
difference.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="09060252000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000386"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I do not wish to go too far off the beaten track,
but I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The public finances are
in a more ruinous state now than they were in the 1990s, and certainly
the budget deficit, as a percentage of GDP, is higher now than it was
then. Nevertheless, there was a significant revenue shortfall, and
although we were coming out of recession by that period, the Government
needed to plug the gap. I remember that at the time the Government were
keen to sell the initiative as being environmental, but there was a
revenue-raising motivation, as I am sure there is now. I also remember
critics of the measure saying that it was a tax on holidays and that,
just when one was fed up with every aspect of life under the Government
in 1994, they were charging to escape from it. However, we have gone
full circle and it is now part of the tax regime, which I
welcome.</div>
<a name="09060252000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
environmental rationale for taxing air flight. After all, if one has to
tax something, the intellectual rationale for taxing air flights is
probably stronger than the rationale for taxing work. Work seems to be
the sort of activity we should be seeking to incentivise, yet we have a
large amount of revenue raised through income tax. If we are to have a
component of revenue-raising that seeks to effect a degree of
behavioural change, but which also brings in necessary money to the
Treasury, a tax on flying seems to have some
merit.</div><a name="09060252000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000387"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Although I do not disagree broadly with what the
hon. Gentleman has to say, does he recognise that there is a question
of certainty? One reason why there is an increasing move towards ever
higher property taxes&#151;and taxes on work, as he puts it&#151;is
that they at least provide a degree of certainty. One of the
difficulties of trying to encourage or discourage particular behaviour
is, of course, that the tax base dissipates&#151;which is in some
cases the very aim of bringing in the tax in the first
place.</div><a name="09060252000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000388"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Indeed, and we have had some
interesting discussions about tobacco duty and fuel duty with regard to
predictability of elasticity when it comes to
revenue raising, as opposed to
disincentivising behaviour.</div>
<a name="09060252000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative spokesman anticipated that the effect on behaviour would
be marginal to non-existent. On that basis, I suppose that there would
be a degree of certainty, although the environmental benefits would not
then accrue. However, the point I was making is that tax has to come
from somewhere, and taxes that have an environmental component in the
motivation for levying them seem to be sensible. Although total
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from aircraft constitute a fairly small
percentage in the grand scheme of things, that percentage is
increasing. One does not need to have a particularly fantastical
imagination to see that that increase will get bigger and bigger and
will account for a larger proportion of our country&#146;s
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions.</div>
<a name="09060252000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
much bigger global aspect. At present, the vast majority of the people
in the world cannot afford to fly. Although increased prosperity in
countries such as China and India is very welcome, it threatens
potentially grave environmental consequences. To have an environmental
component to taxation, and to make the effort to tax flying, seems to
be a sensible measure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="09060252000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is our
starting point: we are not hostile to the concept. However, I am very
pleased that the Conservative party has seen the wisdom of the Liberal
Democrats&#146; proposals to levy such taxes on aircraft, rather than
on passengers. Levying a tax on passengers is a rather blunt and crude
instrument. For a start, it gives airlines no tax incentive, beyond
their commercial incentive, to run planes at full capacity. A further
tax incentive to do so would clearly be beneficial to the environment.
We even have the situation, which has been reported in the media, where
so-called phantom planes fly around to make sure that the airlines have
their planes in the right places for all of their flights. There is no
incentive, apart from the obvious commercial incentive, to put
passengers on those flights. Given the environmental impact of flying,
it seems sensible to my party to incentivise airlines to carry
passengers. That would be more easily achieved by taxing the flights
themselves, rather than the passengers who are travelling on those
flights.</div><a name="09060252000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final point I wish to raise&#151;a lot of the ground was
comprehensively and skilfully covered by the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham&#151;relates to extra incentives given to
introduce new aircraft. That point was touched on by the hon. Gentleman
and it is not directly relevant to the clause, so I will only touch on
it as well. One of the great benefits of new technology, whether in the
making of cars or in the creation of aeroplanes, is that it increases
fuel efficiency. The Government&#146;s measure is rather crude,
because is does not differentiate between people who travel on
fuel-inefficient aircraft and those who travel on newer, more
fuel-efficient
aircraft.</div><a name="09060252000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Airliners
have an incentive to reduce costs and there is a big up-front capital
cost in buying an aircraft, but there are potential benefits in terms
of fuel savings once that aircraft has been purchased. Much more could
be done, however, to allow airliners to make claims against the
depreciation of new aircraft to incentivise them further to buy such
aircraft where possible. That could be skewed towards certain types of
flights or aircraft if they are thought to be environmentally
beneficial.</div><a name="09060252000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
view is that the motivation behind this form of taxation is broadly
laudable. However, the Government&#146;s approach is ill advised: a
system based on aircraft rather than on passengers would be
better.</div><a name="09060252000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000389"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> This is the first speech I have made on the Finance
Bill; it may not be the last. I declare an interest, as outlined in the
Register of Members&#146; Interests, as a director of a building and
property company. I hope that having that on record will be sufficient
for the Bill&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="09060252000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hate to disagree with my Front Bench colleague, but the original
proposal, as crafted by the Government, to tax per plane, was barking.
The impact that the proposal would have had on the aviation industry
meant that it was not very sensible. It is good that the Government
changed their minds, because we would have been in a worse situation
had they not stuck with
APD.</div><a name="09060252000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will give a few examples. Our aviation industry is very
successful&#151;the second largest in the world, I think. That
requires us to have competitive airlines operating from our airports.
Furthermore, the number of jobs generated by successful airports at
both the main hubs and the regional airports, which are terribly
important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>to our economy, means that it is important that the airline industry
remains competitive for the sake of a successful economy. We have also
seen the successful growth of the freight industry in the UK. East
Midlands airport and many other regional airports are examples of the
creation of freight transport. The per-plane proposals would have given
a major disadvantage to our air freight industry, which would have
found itself undermined by its European
competitors.</div><a name="09060252000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bournemouth
international airport, near my constituency, provides aircraft repairs.
A Boeing, for example, can fly in and the engineering services at the
airport, which is situated in Hurn, will repair it. Inevitably, planes
fly in empty because they are being repaired, but, if there was a tax
per plane, they could well be charged &#163;8,000 or &#163;9,000
just to fly into Hurn for repairs. Those are perverse incentives, and
the proposal as originally crafted by the Government would not have
done the
job.</div><a name="09060252000118"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000390"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point; he is making a well argued case. However, people in my
constituency tell me that it is perverse of supermarkets to fly in food
from the other side of the world out of season, and that local food
should be more widely available instead. Do not all tax regimes have a
potential behavioural effect that disadvantages one form of production
or activity while advantaging another? Is that always a bad
thing?</div><a name="09060252000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000391"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Imported
fruit from Chile clearly comes in on an aircraft and the effects are
perverse. Our responsibility as politicians, however, is not to
disadvantage UK businesses against their competitors. We all
occasionally go through Charles de Gaulle or Schiphol airport. Our
European competitors want to take business away from Britain, and we
know the jobs that that business generates. We need a sensible airport
policy and we need to nurture our airline industry, which is going
through difficult
times.</div><a name="09060252000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can strip out all the excuses for APD; the basic rationale is money.
That was the rationale of the Conservative Government in 1994, who
needed to raise a lot of money quickly, and it is the rationale of the
current Government. They are trying to raise a lot of money quickly due
to the state of the public finances. I agree with my hon. Friend the
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, there is a danger that the different
banding and areas will lead people to use European hubs, which will be
a disadvantage, particularly for Heathrow. I hope that the Government
are alive to
that.</div><a name="09060252000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
number of passengers is the money that the Government expect to raise
predicated on? Passenger numbers have declined by about 20 per cent.
according to the last figures that I saw, so the measure may not raise
the money that the Government think it will. I am interested to know
how much the Government think that it will
raise.</div>
<a name="09060252000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09060252000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to put certain concerns on the record. The proposal could
give passengers an incentive to transfer to rival European hubs and put
UK domestic connecting schedules at risk, thereby reducing frequency.
We have heard about the rate of increase for long-haul flights, but do
not forget that airlines invest a lot of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>money when they set up a new destination or route and it sometimes takes
a while to get the passenger levels and the business. This measure will
hit airlines, and it may be a disincentive for them to develop new
long-haul routes. The additional distance bands will discourage
high-value long-haul flying from the UK, which could damage the economy
without any environmental benefit, because if passengers go elsewhere
to fly they will still create environmental damage. There are concerns
that the Treasury proposals may be inconsistent with the Stern review
and with the Government&#146;s policy of developing Heathrow. I know
that there are differences across the Committee over that
proposal.</div>
<a name="09060252000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to hear from the Minister about the EU, which will bring in an ETS tax
in 2012. Will this passenger duty cease when the EU has an
environmental tax? If not, our airlines may find that they are subject
to European and domestic taxation, which will be a double disadvantage.
Will the Minister flesh that out? The increase in APD could have the
perverse effect of delaying fleet replacement plans. As I understand
it, British Airways could replace half its fleet over eight years with
the money generated by the tax, so it is not small bucks. It is a lot
of money.</div>
<a name="09060252000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I never speak
for too long having made my point, Mr. Atkinson, so, in
conclusion, I had concerns about the Government&#146;s per-plane
proposals. There may be a better solution, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Fareham will no doubt look at it sensibly when he is a
Minister. The Government&#146;s proposals would not have worked, and
we have come back to per-passenger duty. It is basically about raising
money quickly, and, unfortunately, Governments have to find money
somewhere. It is presumably better to take it from people or businesses
that travel than from those at the lower end of the tax
band.</div><a name="09060252000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in the latest calculations of what the tax would raise.
We need to hear more about what happens when the EU starts an ETS and
how that will interact and dovetail with APD. As we have heard, APD has
been hiked on several occasions. It will be helpful to have a
commitment that it will stay at this level for some time, so that
businesses, which are very important for our economy, can plan for the
future. Will the Government be back for a further bite of the cherry
come next year&#146;s Budget in March or this autumn&#146;s
pre-Budget report? This is a successful industry, which generates
thousands of jobs and is very competitive, so we, as politicians,
should be careful not to kill the golden
goose.</div>
<a name="09060252000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000392"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> We have had a characteristically thorough debate
about clause 17 and have also looked at schedule 5, which
includes the banding. We have had maths and geography lessons in the
debate today, perhaps even geopolitical lessons about the creation of
new
states.</div><a name="09060252000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will do my best to answer the questions that have been put. As
Opposition Members have said, the Government consulted on proposals to
replace air passenger duty with a per-plane tax. Both Conservative and
Liberal Democrat members tabled amendments to replace APD with a
per-plane tax&#151;their position&#151;but they were not selected
today.</div><a name="09060252000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
listened to respondents in our consultation process. As has been said,
we announced in the pre-Budget report 2008 that we would reform the
existing system 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>and replace the two-destination band structure with a four-band
structure. We had hoped to proceed with the per-plane tax, but we
decided against it for a fair number of reasons. The Government
proposed the per-plane tax in a different economic climate to the
current one, and the decision not to proceed recognised the need to
ensure at least some greater stability in tax policy at a time of
economic uncertainty. It was not thought to be the best time to shift
from one tax to a completely redesigned one, given the uncertainty in
the economy. We were also trying to maintain environmental objectives
by extending the distance banding, and we hope that we have managed to
avoid at least the disruption and costs associated with the transition
to a new tax.</div>
<a name="09060252000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000393"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09060252000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000394"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has not
even let me get going, but I am happy to let him
in.</div><a name="09060252000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000395"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister really cannot have it that returning
to APD somehow increases certainty in tax policy. It was not just a
consultation, it was a clear statement of intent to move to a per-plane
duty. Having once made the change and now changing back again, there is
no way that anybody could argue that two 180-degree reversals in 18
months is creating stability in the tax
system.</div><a name="09060252000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000396"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> We will not go into 180 degrees and 360 degrees
because that is maths again. All I was trying to say was that we wanted
to avoid the disruption and costs associated with a transition to a new
tax right in the middle of a period of economic uncertainty that did
not exist when the original change was announced. In retaining APD, the
Government recognise that the system could improve the environmental
signals, and hence the change to four bands and the reforms in schedule
5, referred to in clause
17.</div><a name="09060252000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bands will be set at 2,000 mile intervals, and inclusion in each band
will be based on the distance of a country&#146;s capital city from
London. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham asked a fair number
of questions about some of the detail of that, which I want to deal
with. Firstly, he talked about the methodology in schedule 5, and about
new states that might come into existence. He asked whether they would
end up in the Australasia band. We even got to talking about Scotland
as a potential new state. I will not impinge on any of those highly
controversial potential parallel futures, but I want to assure him
that, as with the current air passenger duty, we have powers in
secondary legislation to react to any changes in states or territories.
The primary legislation gives us a power to vary by statutory
instrument, so the creation of a new country could be absorbed into the
system by use of secondary powers to allocate that country to a
particular band. We do not have the absurdity that he was hinting
at&#151;that everything new ends up in
Australasia.</div><a name="09060252000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000397"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> I can see the practicalities
of designating the capital city as the relevant consideration. In some
states, however, where the capital city is much smaller than many of
the other cities in that country, is it such a sensible way to make the
calculation?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div><a name="09060252000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000398"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> There is a detailed way of making these
calculations by measuring absolute distances to each destination.
Alternatively, there is a simpler banding structure, where one uses
assumptions. That structure makes the system quicker, easier and less
complicated to administer.</div>
<a name="09060252000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000399"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09060252000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000400"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will give way when I have finished this point.
That banding structure simply makes the system easier to administer for
all concerned, including those airlines that have to calculate and pay
the tax. That does not mean to say that anomalies do not arise from a
rough-and-ready rather than an absolute approach. We have gone for the
rough-and-ready approach. I understand the points that are being made
about some of the anomalies with capital cities, particularly
Washington in relation to destinations in other US states and in
Caribbean countries. However, I suppose that a rough-and-ready
calculation is precisely that, and one can always find
anomalies.</div>

Hands:</b> I genuinely fail to understand how it can be
simpler to go for this banding structure than for a structure based on
the absolute distances. It is quite clear; these distances do not
change. The distance from London to Boston, for example, or from London
to Honolulu, is not subject to change. Well, I suppose it could be if a
new airport was built, but that is a very obscure example of how it
could change.</div>
<a name="09060252000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just cannot
understand what is complicated about using the actual distance. It is
what airlines use all the time, for calculating the amount of fuel that
they put in aircraft, or for calculating frequent flier programmes.
Everything is calculated on an actual distance basis and not on a
banding basis. So how can a banding basis be
simpler?</div><a name="09060252000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000402"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that this system
is administratively simpler for those who have to put it into effect,
and calculate and levy the tax on flights. If absolutely every last
mile of distance has to be calculated, that leads to a different
structure for the tax. That would be a different way of doing it and it
would not be rough and ready. I assure him, however, that it would be
more complex in its administration.</div>
<a name="09060252000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000403"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I can understand the Minister&#146;s view that a
level of certainty is promoted by what the Government are proposing.
However, we are living in an internet world&#151;a Googled
world&#151;where it is not difficult to get hold of this type of
information. It may well have been the case 10 or 15 years ago that it
was difficult to work out exactly how far each and every last far-flung
city in China, Pakistan or India was from London. Now, however, that is
information that literally everybody can get hold of at their
fingertips.</div>
<a name="09060252000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it is
nonsense now for the Minister to try to defend this system. As I say, I
can see that there is a level of certainty in talking about a single
city in one of the 190 or so states within the United Nations. However,
the reality is that this information&#151;accurate information, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>along the lines that my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham has explained&#151;is very easy to
obtain.</div>
<a name="09060252000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000404"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am not saying that the information is not easy to
obtain. I am saying that it is administratively simpler to use it in
four bands that are approximate; that is the only assertion that I am
making. I am not trying to say that somehow it is impossible for us to
work out how many miles an aeroplane travels from this country to any
destination in the world. Of course, it is a matter of fact that we can
work that information out. However, I am saying that it is
administratively simpler to have four basic bands than to test every
flight, and I hope that Opposition Members will accept that. It would
be a different approach to base the system on actual miles travelled,
and it would make the administration much more complex. It would be
possible to base the system on actual miles travelled if that was the
policy decision that was taken, but it certainly would not be
simple.</div>
<a name="09060252000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
definition of &#147;west

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000405"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09060252000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000406"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I was going to move on to the definition of
&#147;west of the Urals&#148;. It is based on an existing split
that is used by the industry and it follows advice from the industry on
the best way to categorise a country that is, geographically speaking,
as long and thin as Russia is, if I can put it that way.</div>
<a name="09060252000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
legislation that we published before publication of the Finance Bill
contained that split. It was announced in the pre-Budget report and it
was published prior to the Budget statement. The industry is content
with it, and there has been no adverse reaction to it. The system is
one that the industry itself uses at the moment.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Well, there has been plenty of
time for a worry about the definition of &#147;west of the
Urals&#148; in this context to have surfaced. It has not. Everybody
understands what it means, even if it might be a bit difficult to look
at geographically. Obviously, the hon. Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham has a particular interest in eastern European Russian states and
appears to have visited quite a few of them. I understand that his
geographical assessment of the Urals is accurate, but in this context
&#147;west of the Urals&#148; has a meaning that is broadly
understood by the aviation industry and it has not raised any practical
points that cause us to
worry.</div><a name="09060252000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09060252000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000407"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister is being very generous in giving way.
My question is not so much about the Urals here. My question is why
split Russia but not Canada or the US? Russia covers 11 time zones,
Canada six and the US seven. Surely it would be possible to do some
kind of split in those two countries, given that a flight from London
to Honolulu is more than twice the distance of a flight from London to
Boston.</div><a name="09060252000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000408"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Well, clearly the US is a slightly different issue
as its main land mass is much shorter than Russia&#146;s. If one
includes Honolulu, it gets slightly longer. When we were sorting out
the bands the view was taken that the anomalies, although obvious, did
not justify a split 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>in the country down the middle in the same way as we have done for the
Russian Federation. If one did it on a line between Boston and Honolulu
the split would be somewhere in the middle of the Ocean. It is not a
land mass in quite the same way if one looks at some of the states
involved. I admit that it is rough and ready. There are anomalies.
Hawaii is a rather obvious example, but it happens to be a state of the
US. If it were not a state of the US it clearly would not be in its
current band in this
system.</div><a name="09060252000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked whether there is a map that demonstrates the
banding system on a global basis. There is and I am quite happy to give
him a copy. He mentioned Caribbean communities. We are aware of their
circumstances and we are listening to their representations. Clearly,
it mainly involves the anomaly of Hawaii. One can either shift the
bands around and have large numbers of bands to incorporate a whole
range of issues, such as countries that are close to the edge of bands
or countries that are far away, or one can say, &#147;This is the
system and we have to live with it and the way in which it
works.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned the issue of transfer passengers and said
he was aware of some kind of action in the courts about APD applying to
them. APD does not apply to transfer passengers, and we are not aware
of any activity in the courts relating to that, coming from America or
elsewhere. If he has some information to impart that we are not aware
of and wants to have a discussion with me outside the Committee, I will
be happy to discuss it, but I admit that I was a puzzled by his comment
on that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000409"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> That point was raised with me by the Royal
Aeronautical Society, which I will refer to the Minister. That is
probably the easiest way to resolve the
issue.</div><a name="09060252000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000410"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I look forward with interest to any correspondence
I might get from the Royal Aeronautical Society as a result of that
exchange.</div>
<a name="09060252000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have discussed the shift from per-plane taxes back to APD. During that
process we listened carefully to the responses to our announcements in
PBR 2008. We were particularly struck by the difficulties of developing
a per-plane tax, not least because of its effect on freight and the
great practical difficulties in trying to incorporate freight into the
system. Although I am not allowed to look at the papers of previous
Administrations, I suspect that that was why freight was not included
in earlier stages when the tax was originally developed. It is
difficult to include freight.</div>
<a name="09060252000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Poole made an interesting contribution, particularly with
regard to per-plane taxes and the difficulties they would have caused
for the airports near or in his constituency. We were particularly
worried about the regional impact when we had a closer look at that
following representations from the freight industry and airlines,
particularly regional airlines, and not only in the south of the
country, but in other areas where we were worried about the potential
effect on employment. It is difficult to develop a policy for an
industry that is relatively untaxed, as we know, because of the Chicago
convention and the way in which the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>airline industry has developed, and actually it is very mobile by
definition. Therefore, there always has to be a balance between trying
to have a tax system that is legal&#151;because of the issues
relating to the Chicago convention, to which the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham was absolutely right to refer&#151;and trying
to have one that does not cause perverse incentives or have the
unintended effect of driving business
offshore.</div><a name="09060252000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000411"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Clearly, the best environmental approach is to
develop many of the regional airports, and of course freight is
important, as I mentioned earlier. If someone who lives in Bristol uses
Bristol airport and someone who lives in Bournemouth uses Bournemouth
airport, they will not have to drive on the M25 and clog up the roads
at Heathrow or Gatwick, and that is a rather good thing. It still is
the case that more pollution is generated by road traffic around
Heathrow than by the aircraft. One has to have a balanced approach to
that, and there is actually a good argument for developing regional
airports sensibly, because they have great environmental
benefits.</div><a name="09060252000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000412"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Obviously, I agree that we should definitely look
at the development of regional airports as a powerful economic driver
in the regions, not only because of local employment and other issues,
but because we need to remember that air travel is currently relatively
untaxed. That relates not only to emissions, but to noise pollution and
other kinds of disruption that merit tax. We must try to get the
balance right. The hon. Member for Poole has used the right word:
balance, which it is important to consider when developing tax policy
in those areas.</div>
<a name="09060252000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the European Commission&#146;s decision finally to include aviation
in the EU emissions trading scheme from 2012 was welcome. That deals,
partially at least, with some of the issues of pollution on a
supranational basis, as the only way those issues can be resolved
sensibly is by international agreement that allows tax to be levied
appropriately without causing some of the perverse incentives that all
Members have mentioned in their
contributions.</div><a name="09060252000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000413"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Clearly, we have APD, which generates a lot of
money. Then there is the emissions trading system across Europe, of
which there will be a cost. There is a danger that our airlines,
vis- -vis the US and some of the other non-European airlines,
may be disadvantaged. Is that something that the Treasury is looking at
and modelling? One cannot pretend that we are just going to carry on as
we were when there is a new pan-European trading tax
system.</div><a name="09060252000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000414"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Yes, and we will watch that as it develops. It does
not come in until 2012. Some 15 per cent. of auction rights, the rest
of the trading permits, will be given away at least up until 2020. So
we do not have 100 per cent. auctioning, which will limit
the amount of money that can be raised by having a limit on emissions
at EU level, but it is progress. I anticipate that further progress
will be made internationally as well with other, similar trading
systems. It is impossible to know, from here in 2009, exactly and
precisely how that will develop, but it is certainly an issue that HM
Treasury keeps a very close eye on. It will obviously have an effect on
future taxation policy and has to be taken into account.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div><a name="09060252000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Taunton, apart from making me feel rather old&#151;I am
not going to tell anyone when I was born, much less talk about the sort
of mathematics I studied for my O-level and whether it involved great
circles or any other such
calculations&#151;</div><a name="09060252000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000415"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I rise, being gallant, to point out that, like the
Minister, when I started school we did have 240 pence in the
pound.</div><a name="09060252000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000416"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman has obviously looked up when I
was born. I remember decimalisation&#151;as I am sure the hon. Member
for Taunton does not. I suspect that that is his privilege and my
burden, rather than the other way
round.</div><a name="09060252000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clearly true that taxes have to come from somewhere. I thank him for
making that observation; it is very wise. As Exchequer Secretary, it is
one that I wish larger numbers of people would admit to when they come
to see me. It is clear that we should try to tax bads rather than
goods, but we should also remember that part of the use of APD is
clearly in raising revenue, as well as attaching an environmental cost
to
flight.</div><a name="09060252000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000417"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am still struggling. I will go back a little bit,
as I thought the hon. Lady was going to explore that in more detail. I
am struggling with her rejections of a move to a per-plane basis. I
think her conclusion was that it would be too difficult with freight.
Nevertheless, the point I raised was that we can still introduce a
per-plane basis for commercial passenger aircraft. Freight does not
necessarily need to be touched. Has she has explored that?</div>
<a name="09060252000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On another
point, the hon. Lady seems to be saying that the EU ETS, and pulling
aviation into it, has somehow prevented a need to look at a per-plane
basis. I am not sure whether I understood that correctly. Will she also
tell us something about the relevance of the ETS to the consideration
of whether we go to a per-plane or per-passenger
basis?</div><a name="09060252000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000418"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The relevance of the EU ETS is as a background to
that. Aviation, being international, has been untaxed, not only because
of the Chicago convention, but because it is quite difficult to levy a
tax nationally on something that is international and can move very
quickly. Therefore, the answer is to have a series of international
agreements to levy taxation on, for example, fuel and a range of
things, ideally going into the future. The EU ETS, and
aviation&#146;s inclusion in it, is the first example of a
supranational structure that will enable us to put at least some of the
cost and the environmental cost of their industry&#146;s carbon
emissions on to aviation operators. That is its relevance to our debate
today.</div>
<a name="09060252000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000419"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My first point was that, if there is a problem with
freight, which the hon. Lady has talked about, it does not prevent
introducing a per-plane system for commercial passenger aircraft on a
stand-alone
basis.</div><a name="09060252000317"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09060252000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000420"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Given the economic situation that developed between
PBR 2008 and 2009, the timing was not correct for the disruption that
would be caused by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>moving to a completely new tax in that area. We were worried about some
of the issues with hubbing, too. The hon. Gentleman has talked about
how preserving an air passenger duty would cause some difficulties with
hubbing, particularly on long-haul flights, but a per-plane tax would
make the situation more difficult. Overall, it is best to stick with
the existing system and to implement the reforms in clause
17.</div><a name="09060252000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000421"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> To answer my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention, a
lot of freight is carried in the hold in passenger aircraft&#151;once
the bags have been balanced up, the freight is put in&#151;so if
aircraft that only carry freight were to be excluded while aircraft
that carry passengers were to be taxed, some freight would be taxed and
some freight would not. There would therefore be a perverse incentive
between, on the one hand, British Airways carrying medical equipment
and other bits and pieces across the Atlantic and, on the other hand, a
National Express-type aircraft that is dedicated purely to freight or
purely to parcels. It is therefore difficult to
differentiate.</div><a name="09060252000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000422"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct; passenger planes
carry freight, so if we excluded freight-only aircraft, they would have
a tax advantage over other forms of freight-carrying. Such
complications and practical difficulties were certainly highlighted by
the consultation. It is possible either to dismiss that
consultation&#146;s findings and plough on regardless, or look at
them and think about the changed economic circumstances, and we have
decided that, in the current circumstances, to cause disruption by
moving to a completely new basis for the tax might not be the right
thing to
do.</div><a name="09060252000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham might have
decided differently, but in politics it is never easy to make an
announcement and then say that now is perhaps not the best time to
implement it, because one gets jibes about 180 turns and
U-turns. The consultation process was genuine and we modelled a range
of other potential ways of levying the per-plane tax. We looked at some
of the complications, not least that which the hon. Member for Poole
has mentioned on exempting freight; it is not easy to exempt freight in
the current circumstances. Our decision is reflected in clause 17 and
schedule

Bill.</div><a name="09060252000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000447"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause relates to landfill tax. We do not
propose to divide on it, but we need to examine a little the
substantial increases in landfill tax. On 1 April 2009 the rate
increased from &#163;40 to &#163;48 a tonne. I understand that that
will be followed by four further &#163;8 increases, which
is a doubling of landfill tax in five years. Looking broadly at the
change in landfill tax, there are clearly benefits and
costs.</div><a name="09060252000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
benefit of such a steep doubling of the tax will be that more recycling
treatments will be economically viable for many more types of waste,
not merely municipal. The landfill tax was introduced on 1 October
1996&#151;that is what threw me off earlier into wrongly saying that
air passenger duty was introduced in 1996&#151;and since 1997, the
proportion of waste sent to landfill has declined by 32 per cent.,
according to the Government&#146;s consultation document issued at
the same time as this year&#146;s Budget. That decline has not all
been due to landfill tax, but at least a significant part of the
progress in reducing the amount of waste that we send to landfill has
been partly driven by the tax
treatment.</div><a name="09060252000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to costs, however, first there is potentially a big increase in costs
for some of our engineering and manufacturing companies at a time when
they are generally struggling, and we might drive away some of those
businesses when we need to be boosting British manufacturing. The other
drawback is a likely increase in fly-tipping. We need to ask the
Minister whether any of the new revenues from the doubling of landfill
tax will be given to the local authorities that will have to deal with
the consequences of the increase in the tax and the likely increase in
fly-tipping. Those same local authorities will themselves have to pay a
greatly increased rate of landfill duty. The question must be whether
the net effect will simply be larger council tax bills, on top of the
already more than doubling of council tax under this
Government.</div><a name="09060252000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
would be an increased incentive for the development of alternative
forms of disposal, but alternatives take time to come on stream and are
not cheap. They remain welcome, however, and we recognise that a robust
and predictable landfill tax regime is a prerequisite for the viability
and coming on stream in the coming years of some of those alternative
waste treatment techniques. Some of the developments appear to hold a
great deal of promise, particularly those that would produce usable
biomass from general waste. However, it would help if the Minister
indicated the Government&#146;s view of the pace required to keep
such developments in the pipeline while avoiding placing too great a
strain on those disposing of waste. In other words, is the 20 per cent.
or &#163;8 per annum increase for the next five years a reasonable
and sustainable rate for the waste disposal
industry?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div><a name="09060252000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation document that the Government produced at the same time as
the Budget bears the title, &#147;Modernising Landfill Tax
Legislation&#148; but is mostly about countering the effects of the
Waste Recycling Group court case last year, in which the Court of
Appeal ruled against Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and
placed a significant amount of waste outside the scope of the tax. The
Government admit in the impact assessment that the present legislative
approach</div><a name="09060252000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
make landfill tax legislation as a whole more complex and less
coherent.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Broadly
speaking, it seems sensible to restore the scope of landfill tax to
what was originally intended, while simplifying the structure. We need
to examine the proposals further before reaching a judgment on the
particular remedy suggested. It will provide welcome context if the
Minister explains how much revenue she believes has been lost since the
ruling in 2008 and whether landfill operators are altering their
procedures to take advantage of the loopholes
opened.</div><a name="09060252000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the Government&#146;s suggestions may dramatically increase the
tax on waste that currently qualifies for the lower rate. The
document&#146;s lead option for that category would restrict the
lower rate to waste that is classified as &#147;inert&#148; under
the EU landfill directive. It is not clear whether the Government
regard that change as a requirement of the directive or regard
harmonisation with the criteria in the directive and other parts of the
European framework as desirable in itself. The Government&#146;s
references to falling behind recent developments in
&#147;thinking&#148; rather suggest the latter&#151;that it is in
keeping with the framework rather than a positive requirement of the
directive.</div>
<a name="09060252000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
clear what the precise implications of the change will be; perhaps the
Minister could set out the Treasury&#146;s view. Up to &#163;160
million of additional revenue is identified in the impact assessment,
but the fact that the consultation explicitly asks the industry the
questions:</div>
<a name="09060252000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Are
you aware of any other wastes which would cease to be lower rated under
the
proposal?&#148;</div><a name="09060252000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="09060252000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Are
you aware of any wastes which would be brought into the lower rate of
tax under the
proposal?&#148;</div><a name="09060252000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">suggests
that the Treasury and HMRC are not completely certain of the effects of
their lead option. It would be unfortunate if a consultation that began
with the fallout from one court case ended up triggering many others.
The consultation even asks
for</div><a name="09060252000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information
on the extent to which the wastes listed in paragraph 3.8
are still produced in the
UK&#148;,</div><a name="09060252000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
surely ought to be known already, since the reason given for listing
them is that they are currently taxed at the lower rate. It is rather
odd if the Government are taxing wastes that they are not even sure
still exist. Perhaps I have interpreted their question uncharitably and
it means &#147;produced as a product&#148; not, as it says,
&#147;produced as a waste&#148;. Some reassurance on that and the
other points I have raised would be
helpful.</div><a name="09060252000215"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000448"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I shall make a brief contribution in which
I will shamelessly refer to my constituency, but it is of wider
interest because Somerset has the highest rate of recycling in the
country&#151;a fact of which we are proud, because it represents the
strong attachment that people who live in the county have to good
environmental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>practice. We are keen to do better. On Friday last week, I was fortunate
enough to be accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) when visiting the Priorswood
recycling centre on the edge of Taunton. He was able to see what I have
seen on many occasions since I opened it in 2005, which is the wide
range of facilities it has to process plastic, different forms of
glass, paper and metal. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I hear,
out of the corner of my ear, an unnecessary political intervention. It
must also be said that I noticed a very large number of Conservative
election leaflets being pulped. It did not look as though they had even
been read, which was a cause of distress to me, because I always think
that the greater the number of people who read Conservative leaflets in
my constituency, the better the Liberal Democrats will do. However,
people seem to have discarded those leaflets without even taking that
precaution.</div>
<a name="09060252000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09060252000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000449"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman share my horror at what I
understand to be a Liberal Democrat leaflet put out in Cornwall that
attacks a Mebyon Kernow councillor for the state of his
hair?</div><a name="09060252000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000450"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I think that we are even stevens on that
point.</div>
<a name="09060252000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000451"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> Thank you for your guidance,
Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09060252000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not
thinking about Cornish nationalism when I was at the Priorswood
recycling centre, because I was so full of admiration for the
facilities there. I was being shown around the facilities with the
leader of my party. Quite a few of the people who work there and who
were giving us the tour stressed the benefits, as they saw them, of the
landfill tax in terms of incentivising local authorities and other
organisations to recycle more.</div>
<a name="09060252000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
resting on our laurels. Of course, we in Somerset have the very good
fortune of having a county council that is run by the Liberal
Democrats, which means that environmental consciousness is right at the
forefront of all its deliberations. We also have the good fortune of
having the Liberal Democrats as the largest party on Taunton Dean
borough council. As a resident of Taunton, I am very pleased to see the
benefits of much more recycling being done at doorstep level.</div>
<a name="09060252000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have read a
lot in the national newspapers on the controversy about less frequent
waste collection. However, landfill taxes and other incentives that are
being put into practice by local authorities are having a dramatic
impact on levels of recycling. Certainly I hear very few complaints in
my area that the rubbish is only collected fortnightly, just as long as
there is plenty of opportunity for collection of recyclable items. For
example, newspapers and bottles are collected weekly from households in
my constituency, and now plastic items, including those big, unwieldy
milk containers that sometimes carry up to six pints and large
containers of orange squash, are being collected from doorsteps along
with cardboard. When people buy a new implement or appliance, for
example, and they do not wish to throw the cardboard box away but
regard it as unnecessarily burdensome to take it to the Priorswood
recycling centre or to the other recycling centre in my constituency,
which is in Poole, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>just outside Wellington, they find it frustrating if it is not
collected. Even right down to cereal boxes, for example, people are
having the opportunity to recycle those types of daily household
items.</div>
<a name="09060252000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, it is worth saying that it is rare indeed to find people
who are keen to speak out in favour of higher taxation, particularly
when the burden may fall on them, but what is quite interesting is that
both the population and the people who are responsible for waste
management and disposal in my constituency see the merit in having a
landfill tax incentive to increase recycling. I invite everybody on the
Committee who has not seen the future, in terms of recycling in our
country and in terms of just how progressive and enlightened that we
can be as a population, to visit Taunton Dean and Somerset, where we
are rightly proud of our good record in that regard. No doubt we will
do better still after we get beyond Thursday and we can come up with
further imaginative schemes to improve the environment in my
area.</div>
<a name="09060252000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000452"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I think that there is now cross-party agreement
that increasing recycling, including putting in the infrastructure that
is needed to do that, and thereby landfilling less waste, is a wholly
good thing. Clearly, the landfill tax is one of the ways in which we
have begun to make real progress; it is an important part of the
Government&#146;s efforts to reduce the amount of waste going to
landfill. There are obviously, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham hinted, overarching EU directives in this area, and we have
signed up to targets that we wish to reach. He is also right to say
that having a landfill tax helps to drive investment in alternative
greener technologies, which further reduce methane emissions from
landfill waste. As I am sure the Committee knows, methane is a far more
potent greenhouse gas than CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, and it is really important
that we reduce those
emissions.</div><a name="09060252000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence
shows, I am happy to say, that the tax has been successful in reducing
the amount of waste going to landfill. Figures show that between 1997
and 2008, the volume of waste disposed to landfill fell by 32 per
cent., delivering carbon savings of 700,000 tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
emissions by 2010. In Budget 2007 the Chancellor announced that the
standard rate, which applies to active waste sent to landfill, would
increase by &#163;8 per year until 2010-11. Clause 18 gives effect to
the 2007 announcement by increasing the standard rate of landfill tax
to &#163;48 per tonne, with effect from 1 April 2010.</div>
<a name="09060252000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The increase
is part of the Government&#146;s effort to reduce the volume of waste
sent to landfill, and is complemented by public spending on sustainable
waste management. For example, we announced &#163;10 million of new
grants for businesses in 2009-10 to provide capacity to divert more
than 300,000 tonnes of waste from landfill and reduce waste disposal
costs through, for example, anaerobic digestion. At the Budget this
year, we announced that the standard rate for landfill tax would
continue to increase by &#163;8 per tonne for a further three years,
from 2011 to 2013. That is designed to encourage investment in
alternatives to landfill. We will legislate for those increases in
future Finance Bills, as we have done for all previous landfill tax
increases.</div>
<a name="09060252000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000453"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> First, I should correct something I said. I think I
said that the first &#163;8 increase was coming in in 2009. It is
actually in 2010, followed by the three &#163;8 increases.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>Nevertheless, what consideration has been given to the fairly steep
trajectory of the increases? It is not quite a doubling, but it is an
80 per cent. rise in the next five years. Does she think that is
sustainable and that the industry can absorb
it?</div><a name="09060252000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000454"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> We would not have suggested it had we thought it
unsustainable. It clearly has a policy lever which, as the hon.
Gentleman himself said, is to drive investment in future waste
infrastructure and to do even better on recycling than we have done to
date. The increases will help to drive a low carbon and resource
efficient economy, which will encourage waste producers and the waste
management industry to switch away from landfill towards sustainable
alternative technologies, such as anaerobic digestion, recycling and
mechanical biological treatment.</div>
<a name="09060252000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000455"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Lady is being very generous in giving way.
I still want to explore the rate of increase. Presumably some thinking
went into choosing &#163;8 rather than, for the sake of argument,
&#163;10 or &#163;15. Presumably if the rate of landfill tax is
increased too sharply or over too sustained a period, people will avoid
it by fly-tipping. How did the Government arrive at the &#163;8
level? Some work must have been done to discover that optimal
level.</div><a name="09060252000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000456"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Of course we model the behavioural effects of tax
increases. We think the levels are sustainable. The Government
recognise that fly-tipping is a significant antisocial problem
affecting communities, landowners and regulators. We have been working
via the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with the
Environment Agency. In 2007-08, fly-tipping on public land fell by 7.5
per cent., which I hope the Committee will welcome. As well as a
decrease in fly-tipping overall, enforcement action and successful
prosecutions have increased by 26 per cent. on previous years. We are
beginning to get to a stage where we are dealing with the problem of
fly-tipping, as well as making the case, as the hon. Member for Taunton
did so eloquently, about new waste infrastructure that can help to give
us the capacity to recycle substantial amounts of
waste.</div><a name="09060252000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000457"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> All of us feel that the landfill option is not
sustainable in the longer term, so we understand the importance of the
tax. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith
and Fulham about the risk of fly-tipping. Presumably the figure of
&#163;40 has not always been set in stone, so what is the evidence,
from perhaps the past five years, from the increases that have led us
to &#163;40? Has there been any Government thinking about the plus
and minus sides of particular increases in the past and the impact that
they might have had on fly-tipping, and about other externalities that
might not have been foreseen at the
outset?</div><a name="09060252000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000458"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I have just given the Committee some positive
figures about fly-tipping. In 2007-08 we saw not only a decrease in
fly-tipping, which I hope will be sustained, but a large increase in
successful prosecutions. There are also plans in place to introduce
secondary legislation in the autumn, which will provide local
authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>and the Environment Agency with stronger powers to seize vehicles
suspected of involvement in fly-tipping. There will be a continuous
attempt to crack down on that kind of activity, recognising that if the
landfill tax continues to rise, we have to ensure that a huge increase
in fly-tipping is not an unintended consequence. The evidence that I
have just quoted gives us cause for optimism in that
respect.</div><a name="09060252000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000459"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> One hopes that an element of that precipitative
reduction in fly-tipping is due to people who are averse to antisocial
behaviour, but there is an argument that landfill tax should have gone
up slightly more, so that more resources could go into new technology.
I am trying to get a feel for whether, over the past five years, there
has been evidence that perhaps we have not been investing enough in new
technology, because we have taken relatively small steps upwards in the
landfill tax, rather than larger steps, which might be the right way
forward.</div><a name="09060252000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000460"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> There is a balance to be struck, but there is also
a sequencing argument, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman accepts, in a
switch from being a country that not that long ago landfilled large
amounts of its waste to one that is driven to reach demanding EU
targets in a few years&#146; time. Local authorities diverting
increasing amounts of waste from landfill require a period of
adjustment, and part of that is about putting in place the
infrastructure needed to handle waste. We have announced plans to
commit more than &#163;2 billion to investment in waste
infrastructure through the private finance initiative, and the Greater
Manchester waste disposal authority&#146;s energy from waste product
project, which has just been given the go-ahead with extra help from
the Treasury&#146;s finance unit, will alone handle 5 per cent. of
the UK's total municipal waste and lead to the diversion of more than
700,000 tonnes of waste from landfill. There is significant investment
in big kit, ratcheting up our efforts in this area. The increases in
the landfill tax are a balancing part of that entire
approach.</div><a name="09060252000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman should look at how integrated the approach is. One
cannot run before one can walk in these areas, and we need a time
sequence so that we have the infrastructure in place before we can
perhaps further increase the costs of diverting waste to landfill. The
alternatives have to be in place and up and working, so that we can
think about how we can discourage future landfilling. There is a
hierarchy of waste, and there is important work to be done in ensuring
that waste and packaging are not created in the first place, and that
when they are created, they can be disposed of in the appropriate way,
according to that
hierarchy.</div><a name="09060252000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000461"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Lady mentioned modelling on landfill tax.
Could she tell us which variables are involved in the model, other than
the rate of landfill
tax?</div><a name="09060252000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09060252000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000462"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not have them in front of me, and there are
many Treasury models on all those taxes. I want to reassure the hon.
Gentleman that we do not just pluck a figure out of the air and apply
it without trying to analyse what the consequences and behavioural
effects will be. I will be happy to write to him if he wants 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>more detail on models, but I do not have the details on the
Treasury&#146;s landfill tax modelling in front of me at this moment,
so I cannot give the detail that he has obviously decided he wishes to
see. If he will be patient, I will be happy to write to him about
it.</div><a name="09060252000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000463"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am sorry, but it really is not on that the hon.
Lady is unable to tell us even what the variables are. I appreciate
that she is not in a position to give us the entire model, but surely
she could give us just the basic variables involved. For example, is
the level of fly-tipping and the cost of cleaning it up one of the
variables in the model? It seems to me that it should
be.</div><a name="09060252000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000464"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> These matters are all balanced, and it is clear
that other areas need to be thought about as well; in fact the hon.
Gentleman mentioned one of them in his original remarks when he talked
about the cost to local authorities, a point that I was going to deal
with. Obviously, the Government will take account of costs faced by
local government when determining the appropriate settlement for local
government in the next comprehensive spending review. I mentioned
earlier that we have announced an extra &#163;10 million in capital
grants to deliver anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting
infrastructure, which will remove over 300,000 tonnes of
biodegradable waste each year from landfill, reducing business and
local government costs and methane
emissions.</div><a name="09060252000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about consultation and referred to the Waste
Recycling Group case. The effect of that, as he knows, was essentially
to take waste that is used on landfill sites out of tax. The change we
propose in the consultation document will bring users of waste back
into tax where those uses look like disposal and have the environmental
impact associated with disposal, and that change will also protect
revenue, which is an entirely legitimate reason for acting and changing
our approach in that area. We will have the chance to debate those
changes when we discuss clause
118.</div><a name="09060252000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000465"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> What impact does the hon. Lady assess there might
be on the export of waste? There have been terrible and tragic stories
in the newspapers this year about how an awful lot of waste generated
in the UK is showing up in developing countries such as Nigeria, Ghana
and Ivory Coast. Is one of the variables in her model the impact of the
export of such waste, presumably by people trying to avoid paying UK
landfill
tax?</div><a name="09060252000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000466"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Other aspects of that issue are covered by other
parts of international law, not least the Basel convention on the
export of hazardous waste, to which the UK is a signatory. I doubt that
the landfill tax really is the driver for the export of particular
sorts of waste in some of those circumstances. If the hon. Gentleman is
worried about particular instances, perhaps he will let me have a look
at
them.</div><a name="09060252000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked how much revenue was lost as a result of the Waste
Recycling Group case. We think that the repayments are likely to be
around &#163;150 million. We are obviously consulting to
ensure that the tax is robust and will continue to contribute to our
environmental objectives. He asked why we are having the consultation.
The answer is that landfill tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>has been in place for more than a decade now, and in line with the
principles of continuous improvement, it is good practice to review the
arrangements underpinning the tax, which is why this consultation has
been issued. A review is particularly important at the current time
because of changes in environmental protection regulation and waste
management industry practices over the past few years. The consultation
is aimed at ensuring the continued soundness of the administrative and
legislative arrangements on which the tax is based.</div>
<a name="09060252000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will deal
quickly with the questions raised by the hon. Member for Hammersmith
and Fulham regarding inert waste. He is right to point out that we are
proposing to change the way that inert materials are currently
classified, which will result in the Treasury gaining
&#163;160 million of additional revenue.</div>
<a name="09060252000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
understanding of the impact of particular waste, and in what
circumstances waste can be considered inert, has&#151;believe it or
not&#151;moved on considerably in recent years. In particular, the
issue has been considered at length, resulting in European legislation
and the putting in place of a sophisticated waste testing regime.
Subject to the outcome of that consultation, the Government are
proposing to follow the European legislation and testing regime in
order to determine, for tax purposes, which wastes are inert. That will
mean that we have greater certainty that lower rated wastes are
properly inert, in line with up-to-date thinking. That may mean that
certain waste, which was previously lower rated, may become standard
rated. But this is the right outcome in environmental terms if the
wastes in question are not, in fact, really inert. So we are bringing
the entire structure up to date.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000467"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I just have a couple of points to raise on the
clause.</div>
<a name="09060252000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The threshold
increases, as outlined in clause 19, are in line with inflation; we
have no particular issue with them. However, I would briefly like to
raise with the Minister the relationship between gaming duty and remote
gaming duty. In a written parliamentary answer, she told the hon.
Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) that</div>
<a name="09060252000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMRC
are not currently able to publish a breakdown of remote gaming duty
while maintaining taxpayer
confidentiality.&#148;</div><a name="09060252000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now
that strikes me as a very curious answer. Real casinos cannot move
offshore, but online casinos can. Is it really the case that the
Government are raising so little revenue from the internet form of
gaming duty that saying how much they are getting would compromise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>individual operators? I would appreciate an answer to that question, but
other than that I have no comments to make on clause
19.</div>
<a name="09060252000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000468"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Clearly some of the international, Gibraltar-based
type organisations that have been raising internet gambling have been
hit on by the American taxman. One presumes that there might be an
issue if we have what is, essentially, a British company being hit by
other tax authorities. Why would we not want to say what we are
actually raising? It is an interesting area to explore&#151;if one
can possibly explore it, since tracking people down on the internet is
not a terribly easy
area.</div><a name="09060252000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000469"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> We could have long and interesting discussions
about the effect of the world wide web and offshoring on all sorts of
tax regimes. It is something that all tax jurisdictions have to think
about and develop policy approaches to in the future as the capacity
for giving those services offshore, in areas that are not in the
current definitions of tax areas, expands and the potential for doing
that in many other areas increases. Gaming is one such area.</div>
<a name="09060252000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham asked about taxpayer
confidentiality in remote gaming duty. The fact is that one large
taxpayer accounts for a huge share of total remote gaming duty
revenues, and to provide those figures would effectively expose to
public view the tax liability of an easily identifiable taxpayer, which
is why I could not answer the
question.</div><a name="09060252000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000470"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> What information sharing is there between Treasuries
in the European Union on the issue? If one major player is generating
tax revenue, other tax authorities might have agreements over what they
do with those who are domestically based and bet. Do we all do our own
thing, or is there some kind of discussion about whether the figures
received from a particular company are accurate? I understand the
Minister&#146;s problem if there is only one company writing a large
cheque every three months or so to cover an agreed tax liability that
has no doubt been negotiated under certain
conditions.</div><a name="09060252000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000471"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Because only one large taxpayer accounts for the
bulk of the revenue in total remote gaming duty revenues, answering the
question would have disclosed its tax affairs, and we are not entitled
to do that.</div>
<a name="09060252000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060252000472"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Is it not the case that the
amount of tax that that taxpayer pays is disclosed in its accounts, and
that the information is available in that way? That would get around
the issue of taxpayer
confidentiality.</div><a name="09060252000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000473"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It may well be, and we may want to talk about
taxpayer confidentiality in all sorts of ways, but the current rules
state that, as a Treasury Minister, I cannot disclose to the public, in
answer to a parliamentary question, something that effectively
identifies the tax liabilities of an obviously identifiable company,
which in UK law is a person and which is entitled to confidentiality in
its tax returns. That is the current law. As legislators, we might want
to think about how the law could be represented in the future; current
circumstances, however, mean that I cannot answer the question that was
put.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000474"></a>Mr.

differently?</div><a name="09060252000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000475"></a>Angela

not going to suggest questions for me to answer. I am not quite that
devious, even though I am getting on in years. I look forward to what
comes my way as a result of these quick words, because the hon.

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
21</h4><a name="09060252000008"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Amounts

licences</div><a name="09060252000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09060252000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000476"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Clause 21 is closely related to clause 22 and
raises the amusement machine licence duty, or AMLD, rates payable on
gaming machines. The clause is notable for the level of the duty
increases within the various categories under consideration. The
increases are not entirely uniform, but they are all significantly
above the rate of inflation. The Government have yet to explain their
reasoning for those increases, and the Red Book fails to mention the
issue at all, beyond noting the additional &#163;20 million in
revenue that will be
raised.</div><a name="09060252000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, page 175 of the Red Book lists AMLD among those duties rising by
this year&#146;s third-quarter RPI, which is clearly wrong. The rises
are about 9 per cent. on last year&#146;s Budget, and that figure is
certainly nowhere near any RPI figure that I have seen for a number of
years. For example, a 12-month category A licence rises from
&#163;5,160 to &#163;5,625, which seems to be a lot more than 3 per
cent. and more like 9 per cent. A six-month category C license rises
from &#163;400 to &#163;435. Those are rises of 9 per cent. and
8.75 per cent. respectively. We were told in the Red Book that the
rises were at the rate of third-quarter RPI. They are nowhere close
to
that.</div><a name="09060252000320"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09060252000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amount of licence duty payable is determined, at present, by the period
covered&#151;one to 12 months&#151;and the number and category of
machines. Machines can have very different maximum prize values and
minimum stakes, and it is right that duty reflects that. The Opposition
have repeatedly drawn attention to the lack of sense in taxing highly
addictive machines, such as the B2 fixed odds betting terminals found
in bookmakers, at the same rate as the B3 machines, which are the
softer form of gaming machines found in bingo halls and gaming centres.
We have great concerns about the growth in the popularity of fixed odds
betting terminals, which appears to be aiding migration away from
arcades.</div><a name="09060252000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a 2007 prevalence study, problem gambling associated with FOBTs was the
second highest form of problem gambling, with a problem gambling rate
of 11.2 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine
Greening) raised those concerns at length last year, so I will not
repeat them this year, but the minor recalibration of the duty bandings
in this year&#146;s Budget has not addressed the problem. The Budget
announced an imminent consultation on switching amusement machine
licence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>duty to a gross profits basis rather than a licence charge, but further
detail is yet to be forthcoming. It would be helpful if the Minister
said when the consultation will be launched and what options are being
considered to reflect the different machines, and their different level
of addictiveness, covered by AMLD at present. I would particularly
appreciate an explanation of why she is maintaining that the figures on
page 175 of the Red Book, which state that the rises are way in excess
of RPI, are based on this year&#146;s third-quarter RPI.</div>
<a name="09060252000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="09060252000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000477"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Thank you for calling me, Mr.
Atkinson. I know that it is not traditional for a Whip to speak, but I
represent Southend and this measure is very relevant. There was lots of
amusement in Southend over the weekend but there was certainly no
amusement over clauses 21 and 22. I would like to probe the Minister
for more detail on the reasons for the larger than inflation increases
and to look at whether there can be flexibility on the periods for
which the machines are
licensed.</div><a name="09060252000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Southend some arcades are closed during the off season but still pay a
significant amount for licences. In 2003 there was a big review of such
machines. It was decided to leave all alone and that no further
progress should be made given the difficult underlying market
conditions and the real concern about the industry as a whole. We are
looking at the changes in difficult economic times, at the height of
recession, when people are less prepared to spend money either at home
or visiting areas of entertainment and pleasure, such as Southend
seafront where there are a lot of amusement
arcades.</div><a name="09060252000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like the Minister to look at not only the amount, but the
location of machines. I have entered into extensive correspondence with
Bunter&#146;s Caf(c) of 68 Sutton road&#151;I do
not expect the Minister to know the exact case. It may sound parochial,
but sometimes looking at a specific issue shows how foolish legislation
is. Bunter&#146;s Caf(c) has always had a little machine that
you could put money in and gamble, which was licensed via Southend
council. Under the Gambling Act 2005 it will not be allowed to have
that machine, but if it sold alcohol, it would be allowed to have it
with no other changes and, presumably, would pay the increased machine
licence duty. That makes no sense to me. If it is unsafe to have a
machine in a caf(c), because of the type of people that will be
there, surely it is more unsafe, in terms of being addictive, if people
can have it in licensed premises. It does not seem to make sense, even
if there is an argument for children in fish and chip shops paying over
money, that there cannot be a licensed machine in a caf(c) but
there can be one in a family room in a licensed pub. There seems to be
an awful lot of inconsistency.</div>
<a name="09060252000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to go
back to the rates. The British Amusement Catering Trade Association,
which is an excellent organisation, has questioned whether this is the
right time to be making these changes. Revenues in amusement arcades
have collapsed by 21 per cent. and I wonder whether the Minister has a
grip on the impact on the industry. I say that because on 19 May 2008
my hon. Friend the Member for Putney asked a series of questions,
requesting estimates of the number of those machines in amusement
arcades, both historically and the predicted levels in the future. The
Minister replied that there was no breakdown of the numbers of
amusement machines 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>in arcades or of amusement machine licence duty that is collected
specifically in arcades. If the Department does not have an awareness
of those numbers, how can it possibly assess the impact of these
changes? I can tell the Minister that there is quite a severe impact.
Amusement arcades are closing and that will mean a loss to the
Exchequer overall.</div>
<a name="09060252000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, as more
legislation is imposed on these smaller arcades, a flood of them are
turning into bigger arcades, with heavier gambling. So, some of the
things that the Government are doing in this sector are
counter-productive, both in terms of increasing revenue and of
minimising the possibility of people becoming addicted to
gambling.</div>
<a name="09060252000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060252000478"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The clause will increase all amounts of amusement
machine licence duty from 4pm on 22 April 2009 and the new amounts are
set out in the clause. The net increase in effective tax rate on
machines as a result of the clause will be about 1 per cent. Therefore,
the effective tax rate on machines will remain broadly consistent with
the effective tax rates on bingo, casinos and the national
lottery.</div>
<a name="09060252000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">These changes
will ensure that gaming machines make a contribution to the
consolidation of the public finances. They also have to be seen in the
context of the regulatory changes led by the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport, which allow business to benefit from higher stake and
prize limits. Therefore, these machines will effectively be more
profitable, as it is anticipated that more people will use
them.</div>
<a name="09060252000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">We increased
these rates for the reasons that I was talking about earlier with
respect to consolidation of the public finances. The hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham asked about page 175 of the Red Book. That page
sets out the assumptions for the baseline against which the scorecard
costings are calculated; it is not actually the calculation itself. So
that is a definition of how the scoring is done. That was done with a
forecast of RPI in September 2009, which is the usual way that these
things are done. I hope that that answers his question.</div>
<a name="09060252000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also asked
about the consultation. No decisions have been taken yet, but officials
have already had pre-meetings with BACTA, the organisation that has
already been mentioned by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend,
East. We hope to launch the consultation on a potential move to a gross
profits tax soon. I cannot give him any more details at the moment, but
the process has begun with initial discussions.</div>
<a name="09060252000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also mentioned off-season closures. Anyone who knows seaside
resorts, as I do, will know that there is an on and an off season.
Seasonal licences are permitted for small prize machines. Those
licences basically give an eight-month licence for a six-month duty
rate. If there was a move to gross profits tax, we would also want to
take account of seasonality in the way that we levied that tax for
small machines. So that is an issue that the operators in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency, either in the Billy Bunter caf(c)
or elsewhere, can make representations about, either directly or via
BACTA. We look forward to having a productive discussion with him about
that.</div><a name="09060252000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Hands:</b> Despite the fact that clause 22 is a page in
length, I only have to say that, as I understand it, it is a technical
provision that aims to align the definition of the AMLD bandings with
those used by the DCMS, as well as raising the limits. We have no
