afternoon.</div>

lunch, I was going through the last of my amendments&#151;No.
50&#151;in which we ask the Minister for an indication of what she
regards as proportionate. What proportion do the Government have in
mind? Who decides what it will be? Where is the definition? If a
service is withdrawn as a result of a quality contracts tendering
process, people will lose out, so I want the Government to tell us
exactly how they will measure what appears to be a potential financial
loss on one side and a lifestyle benefit on the
other.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab):
On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s theme of how he will
kill off quality contracts before they begin, let me take up the point
that the hon. Member for Lewes was trying to make before lunch.
Amendment No. 50 removes proportionality and instead uses the
words</div>
					<a name="08043035000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there are shown
to be no adverse effects of the proposed scheme on operators or on
persons living or working in the
area&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043035000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">That must mean
that if any person or operator experiences an adverse effect, it will
rule out a quality contract and any of the benefits to any other person
or operator&#151;one adverse effect experienced by one person or
operator would rule out the whole scheme.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I do not know what proportionate means. If it
means what the hon. Gentleman suggests, then yes, but someone must tell
me what it means. We phrased the amendment as we did so that we could
ask the Minister exactly why her initial criteria are phrased in such a
way.</div>
					<a name="08043035000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to my
starting point, the five criteria set out in my amendments explore and
define the quality contracts criteria. On that basis, I look forward to
the Minister&#146;s response.</div>

							<b class="B">Norman
Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): Good afternoon,
Mr. Taylor. I shall try to be brief, given the time that we
took this morning. It is unfair of the Government Whip to accuse Labour
Back Benchers of filibustering&#151;they raised some serious points
this morning, and it is only right to pay due tribute to them for doing
so.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000460"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I do not blame the hon. Member
for Wimbledon for tabling his amendments, in the sense that it is
perfectly proper to test the wording of the clause. If they were
implemented, however, the amendments would wreck the quality contracts
system, intentionally or otherwise. The word
&#147;substantially&#148; in amendment No. 49 suggests that the
hurdle would be set at 10 per cent., which would be a very high hurdle
indeed. Similarly, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe said a
second ago, and as I said before lunch, amendment No. 50 would
give operators a veto, allowing any scheme to be ruled out if there
were any adverse effects whatever. That is the absolute definition of a
wrecking amendment, and I cannot believe that it is what the hon.
Member for Wimbledon wanted&#151;but perhaps it was.</div>
					<a name="08043035000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning, the hon.
Gentleman criticised the use of the words</div>
					<a name="08043035000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any adverse effects of the
proposed scheme&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
clause 19(2)(e). He went on to ask how the Government would define
adverse effects, but he uses the same words in his amendment. If he
wanted to demonstrate that there would be no adverse effects, he would
presumably have to define the phrase as used in his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08043035000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, the amendments do not stack up, other than as a means of
wrecking the quality contracts scheme in
total.</div>

					<a name="08043035000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000461"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> Good afternoon, Mr. Taylor. It is
nice to see you back in
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08043035000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members have spotted, the amendments raise hurdles that local
authorities would have to get over before they could introduce a
quality contracts scheme. They would increase the burden of proof to
such an extent that it would be practically impossible to meet. I shall
say a few words about how the Bill amends the requirements of proof
that local authorities have to meet before taking forward a quality
contracts
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08043035000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, there are circumstances when the public interest may be best
served by a quality contracts scheme; for example, partnership may be
failing to deliver the improvements needed, or local authorities may
want to be able to guarantee a particular set of improvements to the
bus network. The Government&#146;s objective in the Bill is to make
quality contracts schemes a more realistic option for local
authorities, where they believe it the right thing to do in their area.
We have listened to concerns that the existing legislation is too
restrictive. The Bill will put that
right.</div>
					<a name="08043035000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Wimbledon, however,
would be to raise the burden of proof that the local authority has to
meet to such an extent as to make it almost impossible to meet. The
amendment proposing that there must be no adverse effects at all on any
bus operators or any person living or working within the area of the
scheme is particularly
unrealistic.</div>
					<a name="08043035000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to address the issue of proportionality, which we introduced
following representations made by local authorities and others over the
draft Bill. They preferred the criterion introduced to be a
proportionality test, rather than a competition test. Local authorities
are experienced at that, particularly in the context of other transport
schemes&#151;getting the balance right between what the financial
benefits and costs of a scheme would be, and the lifestyle gain. Local
authorities are used to assessing through proportionality the eventual
benefits of a
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08043035000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that in many cases quality contracts schemes may not be the
answer to everyone&#146;s problems, but as a Government we believe
that they should be a realistic option for communities that want them.
The amendments would take that option further away from local
authorities and, for that reason, we cannot accept
them.</div>
					<a name="08043035000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000462"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am disappointed in the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
					<a name="08043035000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in the right hon. Lady&#146;s argument on proportionality.
Will she be helpful and send us some correspondence that defines
exactly what it is? She says that local authorities are well versed in
proportionality, but some examples of where it has been used before, or
what the Government guidelines to local authorities are, would be
helpful. Can the Minister help us on that
point?</div>
					<a name="08043035000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000463"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> We have said that we want to
respond positively to the points made to us by local authorities. One
of the suggestions of the Passenger Transport Executive Group, for
example, was for the competition test to be made a more general
proportionality test, as part of the proposed public interest test.
Under that test, the quality contracts scheme promoter would be
required to demonstrate that the effect on bus operators 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>was justified by the public interest legitimate purpose in introducing a
quality partnership scheme&#151;a fair, balanced test. That would
assist in demonstrating compliance with human rights legislation and is
what we responded to. Of course, any guidance we issue will address and
build on the work that local authorities already undertake when they
draw up particular transport schemes. We will look at proportionality
testing then. I hope it reassures the hon. Gentleman when I say that,
through guidance, we will assist local authorities with bringing about
that
test.</div>
					<a name="08043035000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000464"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments.
I shall look closely at the guidance on proportionality. Obviously, she
has told us what PTEG would prefer. I have been trying to obtain a
definition of what proportional is and although we do not have it yet,
I am happy to accept that the Minister says there will be guidance on
it. I do not, therefore, intend to press amendment No. 50 to a vote, as
I indicated that I might wish to do.</div>
					<a name="08043035000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to my point, we are
in favour of voluntary or statutory quality partnerships, but it must
be shown that a quality contract provides a substantially greater
benefit than could have been achieved under a quality partnership, so I
would like to test the will of the Committee on amendments Nos. 47 and
48.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 155, in
clause 19, page 18, line 2, after
&#145;efficient&#146;, insert &#145;, environmentally
sustainable&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08043035000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall truncate my comments to be helpful to the Committee&#151;not
because I feel that this is not an important amendment, but because we
have already had a similar argument on an earlier amendment. Clause
19(2)(d) sets criteria that have to be met, and refers to the three
E&#146;s: economic, efficient and effective. It does not mention the
fourth E, which relates to the environment. My amendment would add the
words &#147;environmentally sustainable&#148; to the requirement
placed upon local transport authorities that are drawing up quality
contracts schemes. With the Climate Change Bill going through
Parliament and when tackling climate change is one of the greatest
priorities, it is bizarre&#151;to say the least&#151;that the
environment is not even mentioned in the key criteria that are to be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="08043035000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope and
anticipate that when the Bill is enacted, local authorities and others
will seek to use powers under it relatively soon, and that they will
take decisions, for example, to source particular vehicles. If they are
not guided toward making sound environmental choices at an early stage,
there is a real danger that the wrong choice will be made at an early
stage, and we could end up with less sustainable vehicles and other
environmental downsides. The amendment would prevent
that.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): I can see the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but does he accept to some extent the
criticism that the amendment would be otiose, and that no vehicle
manufacturer in the world is making new vehicles that are more
polluting than a previous generation of vehicles? Every vehicle
manufacturer is reducing pollution. It could be argued that if the
amendment were accepted, any vehicle could be seen as environmentally
unsustainable. He could be lifting the hurdle that he accused my hon.
Friend the Member for Wimbledon of lifting when we debated a previous
group of amendments.</div>

							<a name="08043035000497"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> That is a novel argument. Of course modern vehicles
are less polluting&#151;that is a good direction of travel&#151;but
some vehicles are less polluting than others. For example, electric
vehicles operate in some places. I went to see some extremely efficient
and good public service vehicles being produced by a company called
Modec. There is a difference between vehicles that are less polluting
and vehicles that are still less polluting. I wish to encourage the
latter. It is not only about vehicles. It might also be about
information points at bus stops, for example, which could be powered by
solar cells. Other aspects of environmental performance could be
affected by how local authorities address their duties under the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08043035000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed
the approvals board this morning and what power it might have to
overturn decisions by local transport executives&#151;ITAs, councils
or whatever they are called in the circumstances. If a duty is not
written in to the Bill to deal seriously with the environment, what is
to stop an approvals board saying, &#147;You are wrong to put all
these conditions about the environment into a plan; they are not in the
criteria in the Act, and we therefore think that they are not in the
public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>interest&#148;? If the approvals board interprets local
councils&#146; plans, we ought to ensure that local councils have
protection in the Bill. It would be sensible and far-sighted to include
some reference to the environment in the key criteria in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08043035000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000498"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concern and his desire to ensure that the Bill is environmentally
sustainable. I wholeheartedly agree that that should be a key objective
of local authorities&#146; policy and plans. He has probably
anticipated my remarks, but for two reasons I do not think that adding
his words to the criteria that must be satisfied before making the
quality contracts scheme would be the best way of achieving that
objective.</div>
					<a name="08043035000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, as
we have discussed, the Bill includes general provisions to ensure that
environmental issues are high on the agenda of local transport
authorities. As I said when we discussed amendments to clause 8, we
place certain duties on local transport authorities when developing and
implementing transport policies, which include taking into account
Government policies and guidance on the protection or improvement of
the environment. An authority seeking to make a quality contracts
scheme must, among other things, show that the scheme will contribute
to the implementation of its transport policies in a way that is
economic, efficient and effective. An authority working up proposals
for a scheme would need to do so in such a way as to ensure that the
scheme was consistent with those policies. It will be under a duty with
regard to environmental issues in developing the policies, so such
issues will be an important consideration in the development of the
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08043035000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
specific consideration of the environmental impact of quality contracts
schemes should be included in supporting guidance, rather than in the
Bill. I give an assurance that that will be the case. Environmental
sustainability is a complex subject and the guidance provides a better
vehicle, if I may use that phrase, for a more detailed discussion of
the issues that authorities might need to
consider.</div>
					<a name="08043035000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
draft version of the quality contracts guidance, which is before the
Committee, was issued in December. That draft already says that the
scheme should take account of wider impacts on the environment.
Environmental benefits such as reductions in carbon emissions and noise
can be quantified as part of the economic appraisal required for a
quality contracts
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08043035000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, we will publish revised guidance for consultation later
this year, alongside draft regulations setting out the new procedures
for quality contracts schemes. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will
consider in that context what more we can say regarding consideration
of the environment when developing quality contracts schemes. I hope
that that reassures him and that he will therefore withdraw the
amendment.</div>

one to be accepted&#151;this is a very good one, as a matter of fact.
I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments as far as they go. I
appreciate that she recognises the importance of the environment. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>difference between us is that I regard it as a first-tier responsibility
that should rank alongside &#147;economic, efficient and
effective&#148;, rather than a second-tier responsibility that is
subject to guidance, which is how I perceive it to be classed. However,
I made my point under a previous amendment on clause 8 and I divided
the Committee then. I do not feel the need to do so again, although my
reasons have not changed, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="08043035000515"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I want to discuss amendments Nos. 53 and 54. The
clause deals with the consultation document to be issued by the local
authority that wants to implement a quality contracts scheme.
Previously, as governed by the Transport Act 2000, such local
authorities were required to issue a notice of the proposed scheme in
at least one newspaper in the relevant area. The notice would describe
the proposed scheme, state where a copy of it may be inspected and the
reasons for wishing to make it. The authorities were then required to
consult various people.</div>
					<a name="08043035000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Local
Transport Bill slightly amends such requirements inasmuch as it states
that the authority must now supply a consultation document to the same
list of people as mentioned in the relevant section of the 2000 Act.
That will have the effect of making the process in some ways more
formal and defined, and certain things must therefore be included in
the consultation document. My amendments would address those small, yet
important, points in relation to the consultation
process.</div>
					<a name="08043035000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
authority is required to publish the consultation
document</div>
					<a name="08043035000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in such a
matter as they think fit&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>
					<a name="08043035000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 53 would remove those words,
which I believe are unnecessary. The word &#147;publish&#148; is
hardly open to misinterpretation, and surely it must mean to produce
such information in either printed or electronic form. Given that the
following subsections under the clause prescribe quite tightly what
must be included in the consultation document, it is unlikely that an
authority would be in a position to get it wrong or, indeed, to do
anything other than in the manner that is prescribed, not</div>
					<a name="08043035000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in such a manner as they think
fit&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043035000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
really a tidying up proposal, and is saying that, given the high level
of prescription and that we know the meaning of
&#147;publish&#148;, the phrase to which I have referred is
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08043035000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 54 is important and says that the 2000 Act already sets out a list
of those who need to be consulted as a result of the documentation
being produced, which includes operators, other local authorities that
might be affected, the traffic commissioner, the chief of police and,
of course, includes the ubiquitous phrase &#147;think fit&#148;,
which relates to other persons. The amendment is simple. Given that
those people are prescribed, it would be important to prescribe in the
Bill several others who must have the document. The chief fire officer,
the head of the local ambulance service and people who live within 150
m of the relevant route as well as representatives of local groups for
the disabled are all people who, for the sake of completeness, should
be included in the consultation procedure. We have gone through the
argument several times about such persons as an authority sees fit, but
it is always more helpful to describe such people in the Bill. I hope
that the Minister will accept amendments Nos. 53 and 54, which are
minor
proposals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000516"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I am sympathetic to the amendments. If we are to
have a list that specifies several individuals, including the chief of
police, it seems odd that others are not included. I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s argument that it is up to local authorities or others
to judge who they think fit, but once we have started devising a list,
it is difficult to argue that some people should be on it, while others
should not. I see no reason why the chief of police should be on the
list, but not
others.</div>
					<a name="08043035000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 146 draws attention to the failure to mention those responsible for
rail services in the area. We are creating integrated transport
authorities and it seems bizarre to have an integrated transport
authority without a requirement to consider the railways as part of the
quality contracts process. The amendment would tidy up such matters.
Consulting rail operators would ensure that rail capacity development,
delivery of timetables and so on, would be taken into account when
designing a quality contracts scheme. That is important because if, for
example, Network Rail or a train operating company has plans to
significantly enhance a service, that is a relevant factor when
deciding whether a quality contracts scheme should be pursued in the
way that it was originally designed. Similarly, if there are plans to
withdraw services, that may drive up the need for a quality contracts
scheme. What the rail industry does is important and significant when
deciding what should be in the quality contracts
scheme.</div>

					<a name="08043035000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other
benefits. Discussions may take place as to how buses and trains should
integrate, and that should be part of a quality contracts scheme. Once
discussions in the rail industry have taken place, a quality contracts
scheme may have a different content from what would otherwise have been
the case. It is not efficient to say that a good ITA will automatically
talk to the rail industry, because it may not.</div>
					<a name="08043035000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are only 15 council areas
in England and Wales without a railway station, so it is virtually
certain that we will need to ensure integration between rail and bus.
It is sensible to send a clear message to those responsible for
consultation requirements to ensure that the rail industry is properly
consulted. The Minister may say that it would be odd if they were not
consulted, but it is not in the Bill. It would be odd if the chief of
police were not consulted&#151;although not quite so odd as the rail
industry&#151;but the chief of police is in the Bill, so why should
not the rail industry be there?</div>

							<a name="08043035000517"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> If I may say so, I think that my hon. Friend the
Member for Wimbledon did his argument a disservice by saying that this
is a minor matter. I do not think that it is necessarily so. My remarks
relate to amendment No. 53 because I am concerned with the wording that
the Minister invites the Committee to embrace that
says,</div>
					<a name="08043035000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) publish, in
such a manner as they see fit, a consultation
document.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">That could
lead to publishing occurring only on the internet, thereby
disfranchising all those who do not, or cannot, use IT equipment. I am
concerned about that.</div>
					<a name="08043035000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other week I had a case in
one of my advice surgeries where a person who has been transporting
animals for over 20 years has been told that he must take a test to
continue doing so. He was told that he must take that test on a
computer. He does not own a computer, he is not computer-literate and
he does not want to buy a computer for the purpose of taking the test.
There is a movement, not only in private companies, but also in some
arms of the Government, to try to force people to use the internet
when, on some occasions, they do not wish to do so.</div>
					<a name="08043035000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty to publish in the
traditional way ought to remain, as this measure could disfranchise
those members of a community at the poorer end of the scale who cannot
afford to purchase a computer, or those who are elderly and feel that
they cannot get to grips with the new technology. I realise that the
clause goes on to say that notice must be given in at least one local
newspaper, but that does not necessarily guarantee that details of the
scheme will get across to those who might need to know. Last week in my
constituency, I went into my local newsagent to buy a local newspaper
and it had sold out. I represent a tourist area, where the population
doubles when the weather is fine. No newsagent can budget for the
demand produced by an influx of tourists.</div>
					<a name="08043035000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a case for requiring
publishing to take place in the traditional way of being printed on to
paper and made available, so that people can see the full scope of what
is proposed. I hope that the Minister will take the matter seriously. I
am concerned that, if this wording 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>remains, some persons may deem it appropriate to put it only on the
website and leave it up to the public to go to the site to look at it.
That is not good enough.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000518"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As has been said, the
amendments would expand the range of statutory stakeholders to be
consulted on proposed new quality contracts schemes or proposals to
continue existing ones. The Government recognise the importance of
consulting a wide range of stakeholders. Provisions in the Transport
Act 2000 already set out who must be consulted on proposals to make or
continue a quality contracts scheme and those provisions are not
changed by the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08043035000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing provisions require
local authorities to consult a wide range of interested parties,
including all operators of local bus services in the affected area,
other public service vehicle licence holders or holders of community
transport permits who might be affected by the scheme; representatives
of passengers, the local traffic commissioner and the chief police
officer. The hon. Member for Lewes asked why the chief police officer
is consulted, and not the chief fire or ambulance officer. The police
have a direct responsibility for traffic management and enforcement,
and that is why they have been named as a statutory consultee. However,
we would expect the police service to take into account the
requirements of other emergency services in their role as statutory
consultee.</div>
					<a name="08043035000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point made by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire. It is right
that people who do not have access to the internet, for one reason or
another, are not disempowered by any of the consultation processes. To
come back to consulting rail bodies, it may well be that in areas where
there is a quality contracts scheme that does not have any rail
connections, such consultation might not be appropriate. I undertake to
look into the issue that where rail is an integral part of the area
there should be consultation with relevant rail operators and that when
consulting, it is important for local authorities to remember and take
account of the fact that not everybody has access to the
internet.</div>
					<a name="08043035000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress that
there is an obligation on the local authority to consult such other
persons as the authority or authorities think fit. As I said, in terms
of particular schemes and depending on local circumstances, that may
well include some or all of those listed in the amendment, but dealing
with that issue through guidance is a better approach than the
ever-expanding shopping list that we might otherwise get on the face of
the Bill. Local authorities are best placed to determine who has a
legitimate interest in their areas.</div>

consultation for making regulations.</div>
					<a name="08043035000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also include local groups representing disabled persons
among the list of those to be consulted. Again, I completely understand
the spirit of the proposal, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>but I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that an
amendment made to the Bill in another place that we have already
discussed will broaden the obligations on local authorities to have
regard to the needs of disabled persons when developing and
implementing local transport policies. I would expect representative
groups to be consulted about proposed schemes. Again, we can cover the
matter more fully in
guidance.</div>

the circumstances of consultation of disabled people and people with
disabled interests in Salford. I am happy that it can be dealt with in
guidance, as there is good practice out there that goes some way
further than what is intended in the Bill. In Salford, Mr.
Jim Wheelton of Salford Disabled Motorists and other community members
with an interest in organisations for the disabled do not just
scrutinise what the planning committee is doing; they take part in site
visits with councillors. They can be seen regularly around Eccles

					<a name="08043035000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair
that people asked to respond to the consultation document should have

Rather than having local authorities state subjective positions,
consultation procedures should be open, fair and evidence-based. I
therefore propose that the word &#147;reasons&#148; be replaced by
the word &#147;evidence&#148;. The effect would be that the
consultation document issued by the local authority would give a clear
basis for how the decision was reached rather than simply stating what
that decision was. Consultation can be effective only if it is based on
facts and if people read those facts to make their decision. My
amendment would therefore require local

							<a name="08043035000531"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Once again, these amendments illustrate the
basic hostility of Conservative Front Benchers to the quality contracts
schemes. The aim of these amendments is substantially to raise the
burden of proof placed on local authorities to justify the reasons for
proposing a quality contracts scheme in their consultation document.
Government policy is to ensure that quality contracts schemes are a
realistic option, and we agree that it is important to ensure that
local authorities can justify the proposals to those directly affected
by them and to their local communities. That is why the Bill requires
an authority that proposes to make a quality contracts scheme to
publish a consultation document.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>
					<a name="08043035000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consultation document must
describe the proposed scheme and the local authority must justify the
proposals. In particular, the authority must explain why it is
satisfied that the public interest criteria will be satisfied by the
scheme. These amendments would raise that hurdle to an unacceptable
level.</div>
					<a name="08043035000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the Bill is to increase the range of options available to
authorities to improve bus services in their area, but these amendments
would increase the burden of proof in such a way as to make quality
contracts an unattractive option for an authority to pursue. That would
completely negate the improvements that we believe the Bill will make
to the quality contracts scheme
system.</div>
					<a name="08043035000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
show that Conservative Front-Bench Members do not believe that quality
contracts should be introduced. They have said already that they would

introduce.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I rise to speak on clause stand part because I
want to question the Minister on a number of issues that we were not
able to tackle in our extensive discussions on the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08043035000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Included
in the consultation document will be a declaration by the local
authority finance officer on the financing of the quality contracts.
The Government say that the chief finance officer must declare the
costs of the scheme and say that those costs can be covered under the
authority&#146;s budget. That is a sensible and important provision,
particularly as the likelihood is that the costs will not be
insignificant. I think everyone accepts that, in a number of areas,
budgets will be tight.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>
					<a name="08043035000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph (e) of proposed new
subsection 1A says that the chief finance officer, in making a
declaration on funding, must take account of estimated fare income and
of grants to be received. I understand the point about future income,
but I want to tease out some of the Minister&#146;s thoughts on
future expenditure, because such schemes have the potential to incur
expenditure.</div>
					<a name="08043035000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the costs of implementing the scheme, as we heard this
morning, many people believe that there is a threat of legal action by
operators that find themselves losing out in the process. This morning,
I cited an article on the subject by a leading lawyer. Local
authorities are already aware of the risk that operators may launch
legal challenges. Indeed, Metro, West Yorkshire&#146;s passenger
transport authority, is already planning to test its powers under the
Bill. Under the draft guidance on the quality contracts, it believes
that if it were to try an incremental approach it would be less likely
to prompt the introduction of a challenge to quality contracts under
human rights
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08043035000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s thinking is unclear. Comments in various articles
say that under human rights legislation there is the potential for
court challenges to be made to quality contracts. The courts will need
to examine the substance of the schemes and any legal advice given on
them. The documentation says that the chief finance officer must take
account of finances. Does the Minister expect the chief financial
officer to take account of other specified matters, such as associated
potential liabilities?</div>
					<a name="08043035000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say that because this morning
a number of hon. Members said that they would want such cases to be
subject to judicial review. We have to accept that possibility. It will
be a lengthy process, and the costs and awards could be large. I do not
advocate any one side; I genuinely want to find out whether the
Minister will say in guidance that when finance officers talk about
future income and future costs they must have regard to potential
litigation. If so, do those future costs have to include the costs of
litigation and the sums that might be awarded to
operators?</div>
					<a name="08043035000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, an hon. Member&#151;I forget who&#151;pointed out that
they believe some bus companies are greedy and will consider
challenging the legislation on the basis of the restriction of trade,
as well as considering the possibility of challenge under the Human
Rights Act 1998. That is a real possibility. Sir David Rowlands said to
the Public Accounts Committee:</div>
					<a name="08043035000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under the Human Rights
Act any legal entity is entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their own
property and you may only override that in the public
interest&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043035000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed
the public interest this morning. He went on to say
that</div>
					<a name="08043035000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;therefore to move
to quality contracts requires a strong public interest reason; it
cannot be done simply because somebody would like to have quality
contracts.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to clause stand part, I want the Minister to say what the
Government&#146;s position is. They appear to be saying that there is
no liability in relation to compensation because, as a result of
quality contracts, the bus operators will retain their assets. Is that
genuinely the Government line? If it is, it seems to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>ignore two things that may be relevant: the issue of economic rent,
which is the difference between the value of an asset being used for
the purpose for which it was started and the value for the second best
use of that asset, and the fact that there is good will associated with
the operation of that asset, which the Government must recognise is
also an asset that could be rendered
valueless.</div>
					<a name="08043035000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am asking
the Minister to tell us these things. First, as she knows, the Bill
states that the chief financial officer will have to make a statement
of future income. Will he also have to make comments about future
expenditure, and will he have to qualify or at least attempt to qualify
what liability there is? Is it the Government&#146;s position that
compensation is not an issue for operators and that it is unlikely to
be given? I hope that the Minister can give the Committee some guidance
on that practice.</div>

							<a name="08043035000549"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that there
is the risk of judicial review in certain circumstances. As he said, he
read some legal advice that set out instances in which that might
happen. That goes back to this morning&#146;s discussion. We want an
approvals board procedure and the ability to appeal to a transport
tribunal, because that minimises the risk of judicial review.
Therefore, the measures in the Bill mean that if a transport authority
has properly followed the process of either making or continuing a
scheme and the necessary criteria have been satisfied, we will not get
into a situation in which there will be further litigation.</div>
					<a name="08043035000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, on the specific issue
raised by the hon. Gentleman&#151;whether the financial assessment of
the scheme will include funding for litigation&#151;it is probably
true to say that a prudent authority will set aside some contingency
funding for litigation, which might arise for a number of reasons.
However, it is not reasonable to expect them deliberately to budget on
the basis that they will be taken to court. It would be quite difficult
to calculate the costs, and if the authority won a case it might
recover all the
costs.</div>
					<a name="08043035000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
circumstances, I am not sure that it would be helpful to pluck a figure
out of the air and wave it in front of the public. Authorities have to
take such risks in relation to litigation in many areas in which they
work, but it is not necessarily appropriate for that to be put in the
financial assessment of a scheme such as
this.</div>
					<a name="08043035000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000550"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am not suggesting that the chief financial
officer of any particular area should stand up and say what he expects
the cost of litigation to be, but in a number of areas there is a
general health warning attached to a statement. I want to understand
whether there will be in the statement a general warning that there is
the potential for litigation and compensation. That is what I am trying
to find out from the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08043035000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="08043035000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000551"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I think that authorities are aware of where
there is potential for litigation. One of the difficulties with the
current situation is that local authorities are worried about
litigation and, as a result, feel that it is difficult for them to
bring in quality 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>contracts schemes. That is why we are trying to change the system to
give greater protection to authorities in how they can make schemes, so
that the risk is
minimised.</div>
					<a name="08043035000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, I am sure that prudent authorities, when considering
undertaking projects where there is any risk of litigation, will take
that into account. That, frankly, is up to them. Part of how local
authorities decide whether to press ahead with a scheme will be
weighing up all the risks that they are likely to incur when doing so.
I know that that is the process that many&#151;or some&#151;local
authorities have gone through when looking at the issues around making
quality contracts at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08043035000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about compensation for bus operators. We do not think
that the issue is one where there should be compensation for bus
operators. They will not be deprived of their assets. They will be free
to deploy them elsewhere if, for example, they do not wish to tender
for quality contracts or fail to win any tenders. Again, the public
interest criteria that the local authority must satisfy include a
proportionality test, so they will want to look at any adverse
effects&#151;for example, on local authorities&#151;and satisfy
themselves that that is proportionate to the improvements for people
living and working in the area and to the achievement of the scheme
objectives.</div>
					<a name="08043035000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
assure the hon. Gentleman that we will issue guidance to local
authorities on applying that test. All the measures, taken together,
will ensure that all operators have a fair opportunity to compete for
the right to operate services in an area where a quality contracts
scheme is set up. I hope that that explains the
situation.</div>
					<a name="08043035000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000552"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I want to pursue a couple of points. That aspect of
the Bill is important if local authorities are to have
confidence&#151;which many of us want them to have&#151;in the Act
that finally
emerges.</div>
					<a name="08043035000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the compensation point raised by the Minister, the hon. Member for
Wimbledon rightly referred to good will, which is an important issue to
take into account. Historically, the Government have approached it in
different ways. For example, under the Hunting Bill&#151;if I dare
mention it&#151;no compensation was provided, because people still
had their horses, stables and so on. On the other hand, when fur
farming was made illegal, compensation was provided because the fur
farmers lost their livelihood. Two different approaches have been
adopted by the Government in recent
times.</div>
					<a name="08043035000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000553"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> It was
proportionate.</div>
					<a name="08043035000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000554"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> That is the
answer.</div>
					<a name="08043035000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be perfectly possible for bus operators to feel aggrieved if they
have built up a route through their own marketing and
efforts&#151;attracted passengers whom they did not have
before&#151;only for it to be taken away from them because of how the
quality contracts work out. That is unlikely, however, because any
sensible local authority will want to build it into any system.
Nevertheless, the hypothetical possibility exists of someone losing
what they have built up, and they will not get compensation. Still
having their buses and garage will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>be of little consequence to them if they have lost their route and,
perhaps, their livelihood. That might be the only route they operate,
for example, which is an
issue.</div>
					<a name="08043035000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must first
address the natural justice aspect&#151;I would like to hear the
Minister&#146;s comments on that&#151;but we must also address the
local authorities&#146; point of view and give them confidence that
if action is taken, a robust legal defence will be available to them
that they can be confident will work in the courts.</div>
					<a name="08043035000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pursuant to
that, I am interested to know&#151;not expressly today, but in broad
terms&#151;what guidance the Department for Transport intends to
provide to local authorities on dealing with potential legal issues. I
am not entirely happy with the Minister&#146;s statement that it is
up to them. If local authorities or ITAs pursue quality contracts in a
way that is consistent with the Government&#146;s intentions in the
Bill, it will be wrong and unfair if they end up considerably out of
pocket as a consequence of legal action. In such circumstances, will
the Department for Transport feel obliged to support local authorities
financially? That is an important point of principle&#151;not just in
terms of natural justice, but in giving local authorities some
confidence and clarity on how the legislation will
unfold.</div>
					<a name="08043035000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000555"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The point of this morning&#146;s discussion
on the approvals board and transport tribunals was that we want to set
up a system that provides local authorities with greater certainty
without huge cost. We want local authorities to be able to go through a
process that will effectively agree that the public interest criteria
and proportionality have been
met.</div>
					<a name="08043035000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman chose a particular instance involving an operator running
down a perfectly well-running route that makes a profit and has lots of
passengers. I believe that local authorities will take a sensible
approach in such scenarios. That is why we have public interest
criteria to ensure that schemes bring benefits to passengers and offer
good value for money. If a local authority simply removes a
well-running route, depriving passengers of buses and the scheme of
that income, that, in a sense, would not satisfy the public interest
criteria. It is about getting the balance right between the
two.</div>
					<a name="08043035000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the Department stumping up all the
money for judicial review challenges, it is the role of the Government
and the Department to set up a system that works well for local
authorities, but it is then for the authorities to decide whether they
wish to go down that route. As I said, it is quite difficult for local
authorities. We know that judicial review can be expensive. That is
part of the risk that they must take into account. I am sure that it is
an incentive to ensure that schemes are
robust.</div>
					<a name="08043035000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
local authority will want to introduce a challengeable scheme that
might cost it a lot of money. It will also not be appropriate for the
Department to stand back and say, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, if it all
goes wrong we&#146;ll pay all the costs.&#148; That would be
ridiculous, so I cannot give the hon. Gentleman any comfort there.
However, the aim of the Bill is to minimise the possibility of judicial
review and to ensure that schemes are good value for money and fair to
all
concerned.</div>

						</b> The good news is that although
there are 13 amendments in the group, 12 are consequential, so I shall
not delay the Committee for long. Today and previously, we have had
extensive discussions about the approvals board. I expected much
discussion to take place when we debated clauses 21 and 22, but a lot
of it happened this morning.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>
					<a name="08043035000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister regards the board as so important, why does it apply to
England only? Why will quality contracts in England be passed on to an
approvals board when those in Wales will be examined by Welsh
Ministers? Is it entirely because of the status of devolved
legislation, or is there some other explanation? The Minister and the
Government have reassured us that the process of appeal through an
approvals board will limit judicial review, so it has the chance to
become an effective and independent body. It will be well suited to
decide the suitability of quality contracts, and I am not sure that the
Committee would wish to deny such a body to Wales, unless there was
good reason to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08043035000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000559"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I certainly take on board what the hon.
Gentleman has said about this being a probing amendment. It would
extend the approvals board model to Wales and take away the existing
role of Welsh Ministers. The Government consulted the Welsh Assembly
Government on how the provisions will apply in Wales, and the Bill is
consistent with their preferences, which is to say that the existing
approval role will be retained by Welsh Ministers for schemes in Wales,
and there will not be a move to independent
approval.</div>
					<a name="08043035000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">In both
cases, the approval process will be at arm&#146;s length from the
local authority or authorities that will approve schemes&#151;that is
a key feature of both models. However, in England, the Government see
the value of having an approval process at arm&#146;s length from the
Secretary of State. As we have discussed, under the current
arrangements, the Secretary of State has a quasi-judicial approval role
at the end of the local authority process of scheme development. That
makes it more difficult for Ministers or officials to engage with local
authorities as they develop proposals for quality contracts schemes. We
believe that we will work together more effectively if the Secretary of
State is removed from the quasi-judicial approval
process.</div>
					<a name="08043035000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
Welsh Ministers take a different view, and many comments have been made
on the reasons for that. There are those who have said that in Wales
there is perhaps not quite the extensive demand for quality contracts
schemes as there has been in England. However, it is important that it
is up to the Welsh Assembly Government to ask for the process to be
different if they so wish. With that explanation, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not press the amendment to a
Division.</div>

Baker:
						</b> We are back on the accountability or otherwise of
the approvals board, and I make no apology for raising the concept of
accountability yet again. The Government propose to set up a very
powerful triumvirate, which in my view will be able to thwart the views
of elected local councillors and the ITA. Incidentally, that situation
will be remedied in a helpful manner if new clause 5, which we shall
discuss shortly, is accepted, but as the Bill is currently set out,
what I have described will be possible. In those circumstances, we
should consider the membership of the approvals board more
closely.</div>
					<a name="08043035000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
concept of experts being able to examine some of the proposals to see
whether they are robust and make sense, and to give advice. There seems
to be nothing whatever wrong with that; in fact, it seems a sensible
idea. The idea is that there should be a traffic commissioner, an
expert in transport economics and an expert in transport planning. That
seems to be a sensible mix of people who should be asked to offer
views. However, it is not a complete mix of the people who should be
asked to offer views. Noticeably missing from that list is anyone who
might actually travel on a bus. There is no guarantee that transport
economists or transport planners will travel on buses, but someone from
Passenger Focus or another passenger group, whom I am suggesting should
be incorporated into the membership of the approvals board, certainly
would travel on a
bus.</div>
					<a name="08043035000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that it
is a worst-case scenario, but let me explain the danger we face. An ITA
of elected people carefully considers and consults and comes up with
proposals, which then go before the approvals board, whose members may
be unaware, even if they should not be, of the particular local
circumstances. They may not have travelled on a bus for quite some time
and they might be unsympathetic to what the local authority or the ITA
is trying to do. In those circumstances, having someone on the
approvals board who has experience of riding a bus would be quite a
good idea. If the Minister says that is not quite the right idea and a
better way of doing it is A, B and C, that is fine, but the concept of
expanding the approvals board to have wider expertise is clearly
right.</div>

						</b> It is unusual in British administrative law to
put people whose role is normally quasi-judicial into positions of
policy making. When the Select Committee considered those matters, we
thought that it was inappropriate for a traffic commissioner to be part
of the process, if indeed the process will exist. On that basis, will
the hon. Gentleman reconsider his remarks or address that
issue?</div>

						</b> I suppose that I am addressing the issue of the
approvals board as I wish to see it, which is as a statutory consultee,
as would be the case with the Environment Agency. That is the role that
I would like the approvals board to have. If the approvals board
carries on with its present powers, the hon. Gentleman makes quite a
good case for looking again at the membership and whether the traffic
commissioner would be double-hatted in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="08043035000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
comment briefly on the Conservative amendment No. 62. No doubt the hon.
Member for Wimbledon will address it himself, but I have some sympathy
with the point that he is trying to make. He seems to be addressing the
same point as me, but by different means. The fact that we have come
from different directions to the same conclusion should weigh heavily
with the
Minister.</div>

							<a name="08043035000566"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am pleased that we have reached the same
conclusion. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley made a very good
point. Should someone with a policy-making role have a quasi-judicial
role? Would that person be capable of separating those two roles when
asked to do so? That is a decent issue that must be addressed, because
it is a concern. My amendment is similar and I have a great deal of
sympathy with the hon. Member for Lewes. At present, paragraph 2 of
proposed new clause 126A of the Transport Act 2000 states that in
addition to the traffic commissioner, there should be two other members
sitting on the approvals board, and that they will be selected from a
panel appointed by the Secretary of State. Clause 22 contains no
further detail about the panel, which seems a significant omission. The
four further paragraphs proposed by the amendment are designed to put
some detail on who would be on the panel and how it would be
selected.</div>
					<a name="08043035000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">A panel
needs a number of people from which it can select, so a panel of 15
people would provide an appropriate number from whom an approvals board
can be selected. That number should ensure that there are always two
members with the requisite regional familiarity, wherever the quality
contracts scheme is being proposed. The panel needs to be large enough
to ensure availability in all sorts of cases.</div>
					<a name="08043035000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
should also have relevant experience, which is why I have sympathy with
what the hon. Member for Lewes was saying. The Secretary of State will
presumably be able to judge what is relevant, but it should entail
experience of the bus industry, passenger groups or local transport
governance. The Bill would be substantially enhanced if it required the
panel to include such people, as that relevant experience is extremely
important. When appointing the two members of the panel to the
approvals board, the Secretary of State should look at the
qualifications and experience that render them most suitable, in much
the same way as the senior traffic commissioner appoints the most
appropriate traffic commissioner&#151;we went through that argument
last week. The Secretary of State ought to be looking to appoint the
most appropriate persons from the pool available.</div>
					<a name="08043035000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taken together, the paragraphs
should ensure that those charged with deciding whether a quality
contract should occur are appropriately qualified to make that
decision. They should be aware of passengers, the local bus industry
and what might happen to the local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>authority. They should be able to judge in an impartial manner a
consultation document produced by the local authority and make a
judgment on the representations. The amendment is inspired by the fact
that although the Bill goes into some detail about the traffic
commissioner on the approvals board, and how they might be appointed,
there is a noticeable absence about how the other two members will be
appointed. This is an extremely important part of the legislation and
it would be wrong to leave it vague and imprecise. I hope that the
Minister will accept that there is a gap in the legislation that needs
filling.</div>

							<a name="08043035000567"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As has been said, the Bill provides that an
approvals board for England will consist of a traffic
commissioner&#151;the chair&#151;and</div>
					<a name="08043035000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;... two persons drawn from a
panel of persons appointed by the Secretary of State for the purposes
of this
section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
156 would provide that one of the members of the panel should always be
a representative of bus passengers. A lot of this goes back to our
discussion earlier today about defining the remit of the approvals
board.</div>
					<a name="08043035000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
key issues when determining who should be on the approvals board for
the role that we envisage. First, the board should have appropriate
expertise and, secondly, the decision-making process should be fair,
open and impartial. The board will be chaired by an independent traffic
commissioner. We proposed in the draft Bill that it should be the
senior traffic commissioner, but following the recommendation from the
Transport Committee we changed it so that an approvals board would
normally be chaired by the commissioner with the most appropriate
knowledge of the area in question.</div>
					<a name="08043035000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
proposed that the traffic commissioner would be supported by two
experts, most likely in transport planning and transport economics. We
believe that the combination of the three would ensure that the board
would be well equipped to do the job required of it and that it would
be, and be seen to be,
impartial.</div>
					<a name="08043035000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the views of passengers are important and we expect local
authorities to take proper account of them, both in developing their
general transport policies and in drawing up detailed proposals for a
quality contracts scheme. I am not convinced, however, that there would
be a role for a passenger representative on the approvals board itself.
That is because the board&#146;s job would be to consider a local
authority&#146;s application to make a scheme and to reach a decision
on the approval of it. In reaching that decision, the board would need
to consider whether the authority had observed due process, to ensure
that the consultation exercise had been carried out properly and that
proper account had been taken of the views of consultees. Within that
process I would of course include passengers.</div>
					<a name="08043035000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board
would also need to reach a judgment as to whether the scheme as
proposed by the authority would indeed satisfy the public interest
criteria prescribed in the legislation. That would be likely to require
analysis of the case put forward by the authority and we believe that
to do that well, the traffic commissioner should be supported by
appropriate experts. I am not convinced that a passenger representative
would necessarily have the appropriate expertise to assist the board in
the particular job that we have defined for it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>
					<a name="08043035000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case put
forward by the authority is obviously likely to contain a detailed
economic analysis, hence the need for an economist. The proposals are
also likely to contain projections as to potential passenger growth and
forward transport planning. That could and probably would be for a
period of up to 10 years, which is why we think a transport planner
would be an appropriate member. We do not, however, expect the experts
on the board to undertake a separate, almost rival analysis to the
local authority&#146;s, rather their role would be to confirm that
the authority&#146;s overall analysis was credible and based on
sensible assumptions. The job we want the approvals board to do is very
detailed and
specific.</div>

							<a name="08043035000568"></a>Ian
Stewart:
						</b> I wish to express a small
amount of concern about the presumption that members of user groups may
not have the skills to sit on such a board. I have to tell the Minister
that the Friends of Irlam station, the Friends of Eccles
station&#151;known as Freccles&#151;and the transport users group
in Swinton and Pendlebury include people who are eminent in their
fields, whether that be health, economics or transport. That should be
considered before assuming that people on transport user groups or from
the community do not have the skills to sit on such a
board.</div>

							<a name="08043035000569"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I hope I can reassure my hon. Friend, because
that point brings us to the panel of experts that the Secretary of
State would appoint for people to be drawn from. It may well be that
somebody involved in passenger user groups would also have the other
areas of expertise that my hon. Friend has talked about. However, that
goes back to the question of the approvals board having a specific
task.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08043035000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be difficult for local passenger representatives, who may have
been involved in consultation on the scheme&#151;we hope that would
be the case&#151;to fulfil the objective and impartial role that we
want the approvals board to have. We have made it clear, as I said,
that we want the scheme to be credible, and we do not necessarily want
someone who might have been consulted on the original proposals as
drawn up by the local authority. Indeed, to take that view might in a
sense change the work of the approvals board, almost widening it beyond
what we want to see. That is why, in response to the Transport
Committee, we made provision for a traffic commissioner other than the
commissioner for the local traffic area to chair the board, as the
local commissioner might consider that his ability to act and to be
impartial was
impaired.</div>
					<a name="08043035000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Member for Lewes understands why we cannot accept the
amendment. As I said, I hope that the Committee accepts that it is not
because we do not value the views of the passengers. We certainly want
them to contribute to consultations on the drawing up of the scheme,
but not in the position that the hon. Gentleman outlined.</div>
					<a name="08043035000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Committee to reject amendment No. 62, which seeks a panel of 15
members. It is not appropriate to include that level of detail in
primary legislation in case we need to change it. It could be difficult
to predict how many applications to make schemes will be received. We
might need to change the size of the panel, depending on its work load,
and including it in primary legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>would restrict our ability to do so. However, I assure the Committee
that we will be consulting on the detailed implementation of these
matters later in the year, including on the draft guidance and the
drafts of any necessary secondary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08043035000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that explanation, I hope

guidance put out in December to coincide with debates in the other
place. It includes a section on quality contracts schemes, and it
refers to some of the role of the approvals board. However, as I said
earlier, we will be able to specify other matters in more detail, such
as when the board might start considering
appeals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000572"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I raised that point in response because it is
important. The Minister puts a lot of stress and weight on what the
approvals board will do. As we continue in Committee, it seems that
more and more will rest on its shoulders.</div>
					<a name="08043035000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The success or otherwise of
what the Government want to do will be determined by how the approvals
board is asked to work and works. If the Minister is right, the board
will clearly provide a bulwark and a way to facilitate and reinforce
transport authorities. If those of us who have concerns are right, it
will act as a blockage; it will be an unhelpful part of the process.
Either way, when we are putting so much stress on the approvals board,
it is difficult not having the draft guidance. It is disappointing
because the Bill has been through the other place and it is now most of
its way through the
Commons.</div>
					<a name="08043035000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
did not deal with a point that I made in my opening remarks, which was
that not only would none of the persons on the approvals board be
elected&#151;we have been around that subject already&#151;but none
of them might even have relevant bus experience or use a bus. I am sure
that it was not her intention, but a transport planner could be someone
who sits and designs the trunk road network. Someone specialising in
transport economics could be a person who carries out a cost-benefit
analysis of the rail network. There is no guarantee that the persons
appointed will have the necessary knowledge of, or sympathy with, what
the ITA is trying to
do.</div>
					<a name="08043035000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the
Minister intends to appoint people with relevant expertise and who
would facilitate the passage of the legislation, but let us suppose
that a future Government, perhaps of a different complexion, were
unsympathetic to the idea of quality contracts and wanted to thwart
them or see them wither on the vine. I do not want to give them ideas,
but it would be easy to put people on the approvals board who would not
facilitate what local authorities wanted, but who received different
guidance from the Secretary of
State.</div>

the Conservatives but, as a matter of principle, it is a sound approach
to legislation to assume that the worst can happen whether it is
thought that the worst is a Conservative Government or a Labour
Government&#151;indeed, some may even think it would be a Liberal
Democrat Government, but how they could reach such a conclusion, I do
not know. However, we must always base the premise on ensuring that
processes cannot be manipulated by the Government of the day to thwart
the idea set out in the Bill when it was first designed. I want to
establish that point of
principle.</div>

					<a name="08043035000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the approvals board is so important, the lack of guidance or of a
definition of that guidance in the Bill is a glaring omission, and it
will be a considerable weakness unless we do something about it in

issue.</div>

he thinks. We certainly agree on that point. It would be helpful if the
Minister could publish more detailed draft guidance before we discuss
the Bill on Report. I do not know whether that is possible, but it
would be certainly be useful for the House to have
it.</div>
					<a name="08043035000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the
arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Wimbledon, the Minister said
that local authorities will take account of passenger views. They will
indeed do that, but there is no guarantee that the approvals board
will. However, the local authorities would have the final say under my
amendment and that would cover the point adequately. It would not be
covered if we left the final decision to the approvals
board.</div>
					<a name="08043035000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">We ought to
pick up the points made by the hon. Member Freccles about user group
skills. He is right that members of Passenger Focus and other user
groups have considerable skills and that we should not undermine them
or regard them as a second tier. If the Minister is insistent on going
down the road of appointing people herself, I hope that she will take
into account the sensible points that have been made and ensure that we
have a mixture of people with experience of user groups. If she is not
able to accept the amendment, I hope that she will be sympathetic to
the idea that one of the three people will at least have user group
experience, passenger experience or bus experience and thus know what
they are talking
about.</div>

							<a name="08043035000577"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I just want to put it briefly on the record
that obviously approvals boards could call other witnesses if they
considered that not enough particular expertise was available to them.
I assure the Committee that we want people who are expert in both
transport 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>economics and transport planning. It is difficult to prejudge every
member of the panel, but of course we want them to have some expertise
in the area. There is no Government desire to appoint people who do not
know one end of a bus from another&#151;that would be
ridiculous.</div>
					<a name="08043035000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole point of what the
Government are trying to do is to make it easier for authorities to
introduce quality contracts schemes. We would gain nothing by
appointing people who are inherently hostile to them. The process is to
ensure that authorities that want to go down that route will find it
easier to do so. The proposals in the Bill, and the possibility of
appeal to a Transport Tribunal, would give an authority the possibility
of making an appeal if it felt that it had been unfairly dealt with, or
that its points had not been taken into

out subsection
(8).</div>
					<a name="08043035000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
22 inserts a new section into the Transport Act 2000. We are going
through the composition of the approvals board and, clearly, it is
vital to ensure that the right people are on it. Subsection (2) states
that a traffic commissioner will sit on the board and subsection (3)
states that the commissioner will chair it. Subsections (4) to (7)
state that the senior traffic commissioner will be charged with
appointing the commissioner as chair of the approvals board and other
such duties. All of that is fine and I have no issue with it.</div>
					<a name="08043035000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing amendment,
but I want to understand why subsection (8) is necessary. It states
that if the senior commissioner is unable to appoint a traffic
commissioner to chair the approvals board, the Secretary of State will
appoint one. Given that those duties cannot be arduous, I would be
interested to hear from the Minister in what circumstances she
envisages such a measure would be necessary. Why would the Secretary of
State be involved only in that particular duty and not in others? When
we talked about the roles and duties of the senior traffic
commissioner, there was no discussion about the Secretary of State
being involved if and when required.</div>
					<a name="08043035000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole
thing is slightly tautologous. The senior traffic commissioner is
required to consult the Secretary of State in all that he or she does.
Furthermore, the Secretary of State is able to give guidance to the
senior traffic commissioner, and the commissioner is required to have
regard to that guidance. The Secretary of State will be involved in
that work, so subsection (8) seems completely unnecessary. Will the
Minister give us some explanation and examples of why she regards it as
necessary?</div>

						</b> The amendment would mean
that, in the absence of the senior traffic commissioner, the Secretary
of State would no longer be able to determine the most appropriate
traffic commissioner to chair an approvals board. The Bill provides for
the senior traffic commissioner to decide which traffic commissioner
should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>chair each board, and that would normally be the one with the most local
knowledge of the area in question. As we have just discussed, it also
provides for the commissioner to be joined by two other members drawn
from a panel appointed by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08043035000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier, the draft Bill proposed that the approvals board would
normally be chaired by the senior traffic commissioner. Having
considered responses to the consultation, particularly from the
Transport Committee, it is now proposed that the board is chaired by
the traffic commissioner who has the most appropriate local knowledge,
with flexibility for another traffic commissioner to chair it if, for
any reason, the local traffic commissioner is unable to do
so.</div>

intention is that the two independent experts who sit alongside the
traffic commissioner should have expertise in transport economics and
transport planning to provide the right balance. The Bill will remove
the Secretary of State&#146;s role in approving applications for a
quality contracts scheme, as we said earlier, but the amendment would
remove the provision allowing the Secretary of State to nominate a
traffic commissioner to head a particular board, which is purely a
backstop provision. It exists to cover eventualities, such as the
senior traffic commissioner being absent or incapacitated. If that
happens, the Secretary of State rather than the senior traffic
commissioner will be able to appoint a traffic commissioner.</div>

reform process being undertaken by the Ministry of Justice, the Council

							<a name="08043035000587"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The origin of amendment No. 65
is my concern that the Secretary of State is being given powers to
interfere in the affairs of the approvals board that are neither
appropriate nor required. The Minister has said several times that she
believes that the approvals board should be impartial, and has
discussed the fact that it should consist of one traffic commissioner
and two appropriately qualified and independent persons selected from a
panel. That independence should not be compromised by unnecessary
interference by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08043035000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 23
introduces further sections to the 2000 Act, one of which will empower
the Secretary of State to make rules governing practice and procedure
to be followed by the approvals board. It also empowers her to make
rules</div>
					<a name="08043035000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;generally for the
carrying into effect of the powers and duties of any such
board.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such rules might
include the procedure for making applications to the board and for the
acknowledgement of such applications, the procedure for notifying the
relevant parties that an application has been lodged, and the time
scales within which such parties might make representations to the
board.</div>
					<a name="08043035000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State may also prescribe the deadline for the board to reach its
decision. However, if the board consists of people who are seen to be
qualified and experienced, it should not require such instructions from
the Secretary of State. The senior traffic commissioner appoints the
traffic commissioner to chair the board and the role of the chair is to
guide the board through matters of procedure. He or she would not and
should not need the Secretary of State to assume that role and
interfere with the
board.</div>
					<a name="08043035000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the phraseology used implies not only that this is general guidance,
but that there is the possibility that it might be specific. If the
Secretary of State was seen to tell the board what to do and when to do
it, that would reflect badly on the perceived independence of the
board, particularly in individual cases. The board should define its
own procedures, and the independence of board should mean that the
Secretary of State is not required to do so. Subsections (2) and (3)
are necessary for the efficient running of the approvals board, but I
contest whether it is the role of the Secretary of State to make such
measures.</div>
					<a name="08043035000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 70 also deals with the independence of the approvals board and with
ensuring that it is not impacted by interference from the Secretary of
State. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>Subsections (7) and (8) go even further and state not only that the
Secretary of State can get involved in the procedural matters of the
approvals, but that they can issue
guidance</div>
					<a name="08043035000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;concerning
the carrying out by a board of its functions under this Part in
relation to quality contracts
schemes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the
board must have regard to such guidance, but there is the possibility
that a wholly inappropriate intervention or interference could come
from the Secretary of State. That seems to defeat any object of having
an independent
board.</div>
					<a name="08043035000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be
listening carefully to what the Minister says about the independence of
the approvals board and the reassurances she can give on whether there
will be interference from the Secretary of State in general and
particular
cases.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000588"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> That is quite a helpful
explanation of where the hon. Gentleman is going with the amendments.
We were slightly puzzled because they seemed to be designed to
eliminate the Secretary of State&#146;s role in regulating or guiding
the approvals board, which would make it entirely self-regulatory.
There do not seem to be other amendments that specifically would give
the approvals board a power to make regulations. All references to
regulations in this part of the Bill are to regulations made by the
Secretary of State by statutory instrument. We also retain the power
for the Secretary of State to make procedural
rules.</div>
					<a name="08043035000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are, no
doubt, precedents for self-regulation, which is generally for judicial
bodies. However, that is not appropriate for a body of this nature. The
board will be chaired not by a judge, but by a traffic commissioner,
who will have been appointed for a somewhat different set of skills
from those of a
judge.</div>
					<a name="08043035000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The board will
not be a permanent body of persons; different traffic commissioners
will chair different boards and may select different board members from
the panel appointed by the Secretary of State to support them. To get
consistency of practice, we will depend on the Secretary of State
setting out the rules and regulations that apply to the approvals
board, and the Bill provides for that.</div>
					<a name="08043035000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 65 would remove
the flexibility in clause 23. Its purpose seems to be to ensure that
provisions that might be included in procedural rules under proposed
new section 126B(2) are included. Provisions in clause 23 will enable
the Secretary of State to make rules on the practice and procedure to
be followed by the approvals board and on the general exercise of the
powers and duties of the board.</div>
					<a name="08043035000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legislation highlights four
procedural matters that may be included. That is not an exhaustive list
and it does not exclude rules being made about other, related matters
should they prove necessary, nor will it be obligatory to make rules on
the specified matters if, in the light of consultation, we conclude
that they are unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08043035000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short, the provision in the
clause gives a strong indication of how we might wish to use the
rule-making power, but there is a degree of flexibility, which would
not be the case if amendment No. 65 were accepted.</div>
					<a name="08043035000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 70 would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to
issue guidance to the approvals board. That is intended to ensure
consistency of approach 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>between the variously constituted boards. The Department will consult on
the guidance&#151;it will not be imposed unilaterally&#151;but
placing the entire decision-making process in the hands of an as yet
untried board would be an extremely great risk. It is not how we
envisage the relationship between the Secretary of State and the
approvals board. The measure is about not the Secretary of State
dictating on individual cases, but setting general rules and guidance
if necessary.</div>

						</b> I am listening carefully to my right hon.
Friend. Would she care to expand on that so that I understand better

					<a name="08043035000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provision about
applications for approval to such a board...provision for an
acknowledgement of the receipt of any such application to be issued by
such person, and within such time as may be prescribed in the

consulted under section 125(3) that an application for approval has
been received&#148;</div>

as to the time within which any such person may make representations to
the board about the
application&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08043035000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense,
it is about the administration of the applications, but we feel that it
is important to address some issues that were raised on the timing of
the approvals boards and how long they might go on. It is important for
the Secretary of State to be able to issue guidance and regulations,
rather than leaving it to the board, as I
explained.</div>

power?</div>

							<a name="08043035000593"></a>Ms

						</b> I do not think that would be
an appropriate mechanism for the approvals board. The idea of the
approvals board is to have the ability to go through the processes I
stated. It would not seem appropriate in that situation for there to be
cost implications. That would occur in more of a legal
situation.</div>

					<a name="08043035000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the Minister has

that it would allow the Secretary of State to interfere in individual
cases. That is what the wording currently implies. The Minister said
that she would do something more on the procedures through the
guidance, but I look to her to write into the guidance that there is no
way that the Secretary of State can interfere in individual cases. I
will be looking for that in the guidance, and ensuring that it is
there.</div>

Baker:
						</b> The debate is mainly about new
clause 5, with the other amendments largely being consequential upon
it, as are amendment No. 194, to which I referred on our debate on
clause 19, and amendment No. 172 on clause 25, which only makes sense
if read in conjunction with this string&#151;otherwise it looks as
though I am disempowering local authorities. It makes sense with this
group of amendments. I give notice that, when we come to clause 25, I
will not move amendment No. 172, because I am dealing with it here as
part of this string&#151;in my own mind at least. I also give notice
that I would like to have a vote on new clause 5 in due course, which I
assume will be at the end of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08043035000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will briefly rehearse the reasons for tabling the amendments and new
clause, before going on to what new clause 5 will do. The Minister and
the Committee will know my concerns about the accountability of the
traffic commissioners and the role that they have been given in the
Bill. We still do not know how they are to be properly appointed or who
they are to be&#151;the guidance has not yet been produced. There is
a question in my mind as to whether a body with that level of
accountability should single-handedly make decisions about whether
quality contracts schemes should go ahead. On balance, we need to try
to enhance local democracy and accountability, rather than stymie it,
as I fear the present Bill does. The Minister and I want to reach the
same destination, but I am concerned that the system she is adopting is
less democratic and, as I shall explain, too onerous to achieve the
ends she wants.</div>
					<a name="08043035000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second issue of concern is that the approvals board is being asked to
undertake functions for which it is not properly qualified. I mentioned
in earlier amendments, last week, that I am not convinced that the
traffic commissioners have sufficient experience of the day-to-day bus
matters that passengers expect&#151;whether buses are overladen and
so on&#151;which is their traditional role. The hon. Member for
Manchester, Blackley raised an important point about double-hattedness
in an intervention earlier.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>
					<a name="08043035000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expressed concerns about what
relevant experience might be applicable in the two experts whom the
Minister wishes to put on the approvals board. I ask her to envisage,
as we always should, what a hostile Minister could do with his or her
powers if such a person came into office and could manipulate the
system. The system that the Minister is creating will leave local
elected bodies open to an unwelcome pincer movement from centralisation
by the Secretary of State on one hand and an unsympathetic approvals
board on the other. I do not think that is her intention, but the Bill
in its present form creates that
possibility.</div>
					<a name="08043035000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a related issue of whether it is appropriate in any circumstances
for the approvals board to thwart what might be the democratic views of
the elected ETA, ITA or whatever it will be called. We have discussed
that, so I shall not rehearse the argument, but a parallel arose in my
mind with the situation when the Governor-General of Australia sacked
the elected Australian Prime Minister in the
1970s.</div>
					<a name="08043035000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000598"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Is that a
parallel?</div>
					<a name="08043035000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000599"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> It is, because there was an
elected body that answered to the public at large and was mostly in
line with the public, as a local council or an ITA would be, and an
unelected person who nevertheless had authority over that body and
exercised theoretical powers that were entirely inappropriate. That is
the
parallel.</div>
					<a name="08043035000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has constructed a rather Heath Robinson approach of hurdles
and safeguards, for reasons that we know very well&#151;to provide
legal protection to local councils, ensure that they can carry through
their intentions in terms of quality contracts and minimise the risk of
successful legal action. However, her proposals are flawed in this
respect: bus companies that are threatened with a significant loss of
revenue but have plenty of money to use at present will not hesitate to
use every possible avenue to protect their position. It does not matter
how many safeguards the Minister includes; they will still take that
approach if they can.</div>
					<a name="08043035000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
for the bus companies it need not be a matter of winning but of holding
up progress, using every legal opportunity to thwart the introduction
of quality contracts and making more money in the period before the
quality contract is finally approved by judicial review or other
process. I appreciate the Minister&#146;s intention of limiting that
period, as she mentioned, but nevertheless I think that will be the
intention of some bus companies&#151;not all by any means, but one or
two. Whatever she does, she will not achieve the end that she
seeks.</div>
					<a name="08043035000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversely,
new clause 5 would not weaken the position. It would maintain the best
of what the Minister is proposing in the legislation while enhancing
local democracy, which many people in this room want to enhance through
the introduction of better arrangements, particularly for quality
contracts. The ITA will pass on to the approvals board its
deliberations, which the approvals board will then have the right to
thwart if it chooses. I appreciate that it might not do so, of course;
it might act within the narrow confines that the Minister seeks to set.
It might be entirely harmonious with the ITA, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>but nevertheless it can thwart the ITA if it chooses. It can interpret
the public interest in a way that the elected representatives for that
area do not. It may have a different view of the public interest, and
it is therefore a challenge to the democratic local body. It might not
take account of issues that are not written in, such as the environment
and so on.</div>
					<a name="08043035000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that the approvals board should be set up and that the expertise that
the Minister wants to pull in should be enjoined and used productively.
She spoke of the approvals board engaging in discussions with the
ITA&#151;that is right; it should be a harmonious exchange of
views&#151;but under her proposals, if a local authority proposes a
scheme that the approvals board rejects either wholly or in part, the
ITA might feel that it must exercise its powers of appeal and move to
the next stage. That is written into the Bill in clause 22, I believe.
</div>
					<a name="08043035000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under my suggestion,
the approvals board would be an important statutory consultee. It would
deliberate on the same basis as the Minister seeks to do, and would
return its thoughts to the ITA, which would have the final decision.
The parallel that I made on Second Reading, which the hon. Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe made again today, is with the Environment
Agency. The Environment Agency is an important statutory consultee on
planning matters. It makes recommendations to planning authorities and
regional flood committees. They do not have to adhere to the
recommendations; they almost always do, but if members of those
authorities identify an overriding public interest issue, which they
feel that as elected people they must pursue, because that is what they
were elected on or for whatever reason, they have the right to override
the Environment Agency&#151;perhaps not in total, but in a particular
respect that they regard as important. That option of overriding in one
particular respect is not available under the Minister&#146;s scheme;
her option is an appeal to the Transport Tribunal.</div>
					<a name="08043035000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any ITA seeking to exercise the
power would have to think very carefully indeed. It would have to think
about the legal risk arising from not adhering to the approvals board,
and the financial consequences that might flow from that. It would have
to consider whether the Transport Tribunal, which would still exist
under the proposed system, will take the view that the ITA has been
irresponsible in not following the approvals board advice. It would
have to take into account whether there would be a problem further down
the line if the matter went to the courts. As an elected local body,
however, it would still have the right to say that its judgment was
different to the approvals board, which had in this case got it wrong.
Its members could say, &#147;We must have the right as elected local
people to take the decision, whatever the risks.&#148; They would
bear the risks if they got it wrong, but it is better that they get it
right, than that they do not and can be effectively controlled, if it
comes to it, by the decision of the approvals board. That is the
suggestion that I am putting to the Minister.</div>
					<a name="08043035000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would retain the expertise that the Minister wants for the approvals
board. It would make the approvals board important in terms of the
advice it gives to ITAs or councils when undertaking quality contracts;
it would retain the Transport Tribunal option, which is the independent
appeals process that the Minister rightly said has to exist; and it
ultimately would retain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>the High Court and judicial review process, should somebody wish to go
down that road. It would also remove one of the hurdles that I fear
will make quality contracts unattractive to local authorities, which
neither the Minister nor I want. It would legitimise the process by
having the decision taken at a democratic level by an elected body,
rather than by an unelected approvals board. With all due modesty, I
suggest that my proposal is the best of both worlds and I hope that she
will give it serious consideration.</div>
					<a name="08043035000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister recognises that
there are rules for local authorities, for example on road charging,
which we shall no doubt come to later in the Bill. The onus on local
authorities with regard to road charging is rather less than what they
can do with quality contracts. They have more freedom to act on road
charging, and it might be argued that it is rather odd to tie them down
on quality contracts, while allowing flexibility on road charging.
Personally, I would allow flexibility on both. That is a particular
view, but there is inconsistency on that issue in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08043035000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said earlier that the approvals board will be able to make
modifications and she used that as a justification for her scheme.
Under my proposal, the ability of the approvals board to make
modifications would be enhanced because it would report back to the
elected body, which might say that its suggestion was sensible and
would take it on board right away. As the Bill stands, the approvals
board may feel reluctant to impose its will on local authorities
because it is not elected. If it could refer back to the ITA or the
local authority with one or two suggestions, it might feel easier about
making modifications and improvements to the scheme, and the ITA might
feel easier about accepting
them.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08043035000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have made the case for my alternative suggestions. I am not being
difficult, but the Minister will recognise that keen voices on the
Labour Benches are questioning this part of the Bill and the approvals
procedure. I am keen to find a solution that maintains the integrity of
what she wants, but provides extra democratic legitimacy, and, with
respect, new clause 5 would achieve both those ends. I hope that she
will consider it sympathetically, if not today, on Report when she
could, if she does not want my new clause, introduce a similar
provision.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000600"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I will try not to repeat any of the arguments
made this morning, and will be as brief as possible because time is
moving
on.</div>
					<a name="08043035000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first point concerns the role of traffic commissioners on what would be
an advisory body under the amendment, and an appeals body under the
Bill. When the Select Committee considered the role of traffic
commissioners in this area, it listened carefully to the senior traffic
commissioner and the traffic commissioner for the north-west of England
who appeared before the Committee. They were primarily concerned with
the burden on the senior traffic commissioner and said that it should
be spread on the basis of time and local knowledge. That was the reason
for the recommendation, and in that context it was a good one because
it would improve existing provision.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>
					<a name="08043035000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
thought about the matter and read more as the debate has continued, it
seems that the logic, from the point of view of the Minister and of the
hon. Member for Lewes in the amendment, is that the traffic
commissioners look increasingly odd in the role. Their normal job is to
adjudicate on whether a registered bus service complies with its
registration or whether the operators are doing something that they
should not be doing. They have in effect a quasi-judicial role, and
putting them in the position of transport experts and allowing them to
decide whether a scheme is in the public interest is stretching the
definition. The hon. Gentleman would say that that is making them wear
two hats&#151;and some barristers would say that it is forcing them
to sit on two stools&#151;but in simple language they may experience
a conflict of interest. My conclusion is that whatever the scheme, they
are probably not the right people to be there. That is the specific
point I wished to
make.</div>
					<a name="08043035000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
point made by the hon. Gentleman has weight, as I said this morning. If
we want to ensure that the people making decisions on what will improve
public transport are elected local people, and give the electorate the
opportunity to say what they want and to say in elections which schemes
they want, there are three, not two, alternatives. There is the
alternative of no appeals body, with the local authority&#146;s
integrated transport authority getting it right or not getting it
right, with aggressive pressure from the bus companies operating as a
force to ensure proper compliance with both procedure and the law.
There are the alternatives of narrowing the appeals body down to
dealing just with procedure, and the proposals of the hon. Member for
Lewes.</div>
					<a name="08043035000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will listen carefully to
the arguments on those three points, and consider introducing proposals
on Report to enhance the role of elected councillors by leaving the
initial decision on whether to go for the scheme and the final decision
on what scheme to choose up to them. That is pretty fundamental
politics. In looking at the details, and not just the role of the
traffic commissioner, I have thought carefully about the membership of
the committee and what it really means. Who are the experts? Are they
professors of transport? If one goes to any conference on transport
matters, there is not one view from the experts. Professors of
transport vary in their views as we vary in our views round this room.
The most free-market professor of transport is from Oxford and he would
say, as would the hon. Member for Wimbledon, &#147;This is a load of
nonsense. Leave it up to the market completely.&#148; Professors from
University college London and Edinburgh would say, &#147;This does
not go far enough. There must be more regulation and
restriction.&#148; The same is true of traffic planners and others,
so how will the experts be
chosen?</div>
					<a name="08043035000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes
to looking at what is in the public interest, the professor from Oxford
would say, &#147;None of this is in the public interest. Leave it to
the market.&#148; Other professors will say X or Y. My point is
simply that it is impossible to find a professor who does not have a
value-laden background that he will bring to the
party.</div>
					<a name="08043035000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000601"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> But surely, in the scenario that the hon.
Gentleman is painting, the free market professor, who wants nothing to
do with this system, would refuse to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>serve. In practice, only those who believe in the integrity of the
process will allow their names to be put
forward.</div>
					<a name="08043035000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000602"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> That may or may not be true.
If it is, it makes the point that we will not find an expert from
outside, but only somebody who agrees with the values in the scheme. On
looking at the detail of the proposal in that way, one can see that it
argues that elected members should take that responsibility. The same
thing is driving this Government as drove the previous Government.
There are lots of failures in local government and possibly even more
in central Government. Governments, under whichever political party,
have the drive that says, &#147;If we have the right experts or the
right quangos, they will advise us correctly and we will not make the
mistakes that are usually made in central Government and local
government.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08043035000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
looked at how quangos operate, I must say that they come and they go.
The Learning and Skills Council has been and gone. It was introduced to
replace central Government and local authorities in funding further
education, but now it has gone. I think that the same applies here and
that argues very strongly that we should find a way through. I appeal
to my right hon. Friend the Minister to find a way through that will
give primacy to local democracy, whichever of the three paths we go
down. We could go down some variation on one of those or down a fourth
way, if she can think of one. That would make a lot of hon. Members of
all parties happy, including some from the Conservative party who have
a genuine belief in local
democracy.</div>
					<a name="08043035000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000603"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As my hon. Friend the Member
for Manchester, Blackley and the hon. Member for Lewes have said, the
amendments relate to the discussion that we had earlier. I assure the
Committee that I have listened very carefully to the points that have
been made on this issue. I hope that there is recognition that in the
Bill we are trying to create greater flexibility for local authorities
to introduce quality contracts if they wish. The Secretary of State can
be removed from the quasi-judicial role occupied at the moment, which
means that there is very little ability for the Department to give
advice, if required, on the issues about quality contracts. There is a
real risk of judicial review, and the hon. Member for Lewes set that
out very clearly. It is therefore incumbent on us to try to find a way
of protecting local authorities from the possibility of judicial
review, to give them certainty to go forward with schemes if they wish
to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08043035000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000604"></a>Ian
Stewart:
						</b> Am I hearing right? Does that mean that there is
further scope for discussions with local authorities and transport
authorities on some of these
issues?</div>
					<a name="08043035000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000605"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I have outlined the principles. In Committee,
we have been able to say that there is agreement on the various issues
that I have just talked about. However, I will come back to the point
that I believe that the process that we have outlined in the Bill is
the right one to give the greatest legal certainty to local authorities
and the greatest protection about judicial review. I hope that what I
have been able to do today, particularly outlining some of the narrow
areas that we expect to be covered, is helpful.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>
					<a name="08043035000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will just make one further comment before I conclude because, as I
said, I do not particularly want to rehearse all the arguments that we
had earlier. The proposition by the hon. Member for
Lewes&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I might have got that
one wrong; he has gone all red. His proposal was for the approvals
board. My observation&#151;and I think that he touched on this issue
himself&#151;is that if the members of the approvals board decided
that they were going to say, in the way that he set out, &#147;This
scheme is totally wrong, we do not agree with it and it should not even
be considered&#148;, and the local authority decided to go ahead with
the scheme, the problem for the local authority would almost be
enhanced in terms of judicial review. That is one of the difficulties
with the scheme that the hon. Gentleman
outlined.</div>
					<a name="08043035000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have, of
course, listened very carefully to a lot of the points that have been
made today and I would not in any sense wish to indicate that I would
not take them away and consider them; that is the point of the
Committee stage. The discussions that we have had today have emphasised
to me the fact that we need to have that certainty. These are not easy
issues; it is not easy to find a way to give local authorities that
kind of legal certainty and protection, which is important. That is why
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08043035000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000606"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> The new clause is the issue in
which I am interested and I have already indicated that I wish to push
it to a vote at the appropriate stage in proceedings. I am sorry to say
that nothing the Minister has said has dissuaded me from that course.
This is quite an important matter; in fact, it goes to the heart of how
the Bill works. Without rehearsing all the arguments, let me just pick
up on one or two of the points that the Minister has
made.</div>
					<a name="08043035000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08043035000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says that she wants to build in legal certainty for local authorities.
First, there is no legal certainty. As other hon. Members and I have
said, the bus companies may choose to take legal action in any event.
The Minister may minimise the risk of a successful legal action, but I
do not think that she will minimise the risk of legal action and she
certainly will not build in legal certainty, to use her
words.</div>
					<a name="08043035000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000607"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept
that obtaining leave to go to judicial review is much more difficult if
a process has been followed in terms of an appeal, particularly a
tribunal.</div>
					<a name="08043035000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08043035000608"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> Yes, I accept that, and the
process that I suggest in new clause 5 would build in near enough the
same certainty that the Minister has provided. It would keep the
Transport Tribunal. It would keep the tribunal to which she referred as
an independent body to consider decisions, and it would allow an
approvals board to provide expert advice to the relevant transport
authority. She is trading off what she regards as greater legal
certainty against a loss of democratic accountability, and the loss of
a workable, attractive scheme for something much less desirable. I am
tempted to say that the provision could have been an amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for Wimbledon, but it would be rather unkind to
characterise it in those terms, although it certainly makes quality
contracts less workable.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>
					<a name="08043035000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made the point
myself&#151;the Minister reiterated it&#151;that if, under my
scheme, a local authority were to ignore entirely the advice of the
approvals board, it would be very foolish. It would be sensible to take
advice from the approvals board. It is true that the authority leaves
itself more open to judicial review if it refuses to accept the advice
of the approvals board, but ultimately that is its choice. Its members
are elected. They must make that calculation. They must weigh up what
is important and less important for them. They must weigh up the risk
to the taxpayer. They should take that decision; it should not be
forced on them by an unelected approvals board. The Minister also made
the point that she wants to remove the Secretary of State from
quasi-judicial decisions. So do I, and nothing in new clause 5 would
counteract that. I support the point about removing the Secretary of
State from the process. It is not counteracted by new clause
5.</div>
					<a name="08043035000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Manchester, Blackley set out three alternatives, but we did not hear
the Minister talk about looking at those again on Report, although both
he and I asked her to do so. The most we got was an assurance that she
would take the points away and consider them. I do not think that that
constitutes looking at the issue again on Report. I do not wish to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>over-egg her comments. If she did mean that she will look at the issue
again on Report, that is very welcome. If she did not quite mean that,
that is less
welcome.</div>
					<a name="08043035000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
fourth alternative, which is an amendment that I tabled for
consideration later in Committee. It would remove the Transport
Tribunal, which is one way of removing another hurdle. If I am honest,
it is a far inferior amendment, because it would take away the tribunal
process, but it would limit the number of hurdles. I prefer new clause
5 to the removal of the Transport Tribunal, but that is a fourth
alternative, which we will come to in due
course.</div>
					<a name="08043035000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
respect, I conclude that the Minister needs to think again, because
salient arguments have been made by a number of hon. Members, not least
from her own party, about the problems with the present arrangements
regarding democratic accountability. The new clause 5 alternative
offers her a way forward. I hope that she will take it away and look at
it again seriously, and return on Report with a provision that meets
some of the points that hon. Members have made. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>
