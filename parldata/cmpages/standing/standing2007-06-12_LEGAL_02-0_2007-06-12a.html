								Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): The Government
argued that, by allowing the Lord Chancellor to appoint the Legal
Services Board alone, he would in some way be able to better protect
British consumers. However, that is merely speculative. The Lord Chief
Justice is no less able than the Lord Chancellor to give effect to the
intended statutory regulatory objective to protect the interests of
consumers. Indeed, give the standing of politicians in the public eye
at the moment, it is arguable that the Lord Chief Justice will be seen
as more important and a greater friend to the consumer than the Lord
Chancellor. By the way, contrary to what the Minister said earlier, the
Joint Committee&#146;s Second Reading briefing, which called for the
Legal Services Board to be appointed by an independent
commission&#151;as judicial appointments are made, for
example&#151;rather than by the Secretary of State, also specifically
said that all appointments should be made at arm&#146;s length from
Government. The Lord Chief Justice has a great interest in safeguarding
the independence of the profession, which exists to serve the justice
system that he is in charge
of.</div>
					<a name="0706135000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to rethink
the appointments provisions generally. There are key three issues.
First, the legal services ombudsman and the Law Society Consumer
Complaints Board have limited scope for action, compared with the Legal
Services Board, because they do not deal with the mainstream
regulation, only with complaints. Secondly, as the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey rightly said, the Lord Chancellor now
has a different role from the one he used to have. He is not the head
of the judiciary now and could be a much more political figure in the
House of Commons. Thirdly, this is a modernising Bill, which we
welcome. Just because Nolan worked 10 years ago in its current form,
that is no reason why we should not rethink it now in today&#146;s
circumstances and in relation to the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>
					<a name="0706135000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Transparency
and impartiality are essential attributes of any public appointments
system, especially if it is to retain the confidence and respect of the
general public. The Legal Services Board does not pass this test if the
Lord Chancellor alone is to have sole power to appoint and terminate
it. If agreed to, the amendments could fatally undermine the LSB from
its inception. That is the view of the legal profession, the Law
Society, the Bar Council, other regulators, the Conservatives, the
Liberal Democrats and Cross-Bench peers who amended the Bill in the
House of Lords. This is also the view of certain foreign legal
regulators. The Minister and her colleagues should now open their eyes
to the evidence and ask leave to withdraw their
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0706135000610"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I declare an
interest as a practising solicitor and a member of the Law Society. The
concern is, as my hon. Friend has said, not just about independence,
but about the perception of independence. There is concern that we
ensure that there is a balanced debate. It is all very well for the
Minister to talk about the consumer time and again, but she will note,
as I will mention shortly, that the regulatory objectives are not just
about the consumer. That objective must be properly balanced with other
objectives. It is important that we do not seek to make one compete
against the other at this early stage, before the regulatory objectives
have been properly implemented and worked through. Putting one
regulatory objective above another is not a good example for the
supervisory body or any other regulatory authority to follow, because
we have not succeeded in any amendment with regard to the hierarchy of
those objectives.</div>
					<a name="0706135000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been a wealth of
evidence on the issue. To return to the Joint Committee evidence that
my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon prayed in aid and draw out
some of its conclusions, a number of professional bodies, such as the
Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, the Institute of Trade Mark
Attorneys and others, were four square behind the need for proper
independence, saying:</div>
					<a name="0706135000524"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Chair should therefore be wholly independent of the Executive to avoid
any perception of bias or influence and to ensure maximum confidence in
the regulatory system from consumers
and&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">approved regulators.
Although any debate should focus on the need to bolster independence,
it should work in tandem on the importance of confidence for the
consumers.</div>
					<a name="0706135000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then there
were the consumers groups that gave evidence. I take issue with the
hon. Member for Bassetlaw saying that the Joint Committee was a
lawyers&#146; love-in, as such. It involved&#151;and in a very
short period&#151;a wealth of evidence from a range of consumer
bodies and individuals. It is to the Joint Committee&#146;s credit
that it did such hard work and managed to get a balanced flavour of the
debate.</div>
					<a name="0706135000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of those
loud voices was the National Consumer Council, which said in oral
evidence that although it was</div>
					<a name="0706135000525"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fully in the consumer interest
that the professions are independent of the state...So long as we
have an open appointment process that ensures we have the right people
for the job, that is what really matters here.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>
					<a name="0706135000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what matters to
consumers&#151;getting the right people in the right job. In many
ways, the Minister overstates consumers&#146; concerns about the
current position in the Bill, whereby the appointment takes place with
the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice. I would suggest that
consumers&#146; great concern is not so much about the formality of
the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice, as about the fact that the
appointment, applied through the Nolan process, delivers a candidate
who is there by merit and is the right person in the right job. That is
what matters to
consumers.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<b class="B">
								Mr.
Adrian Bailey</b> (West Bromwich, West) (Lab/Co-op): I have
heard the consumer perspective being prayed in aid of the Lord Chief
Justice having the veto on the chair of the Legal Services Board, but
in all my experience the public perception of the legal fraternity is
that it is a closed shop. The breakdown in confidence is to do with the
profession&#146;s self-regulatory nature, as perceived by the public.
Indeed, members of public have come to me asking for Government
interference, in order that the legal fraternity does not regulate
itself. That totally contradicts the argument that both the hon.
Gentleman and the hon. Member for Huntingdon, the lead member of his
party, have made. I do not believe that there is a great concern among
the public about the interference of the Government. The concern is
about the self-regulatory nature of the
organisation.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000612"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> As I said, the evidence that I heard in the
Joint Committee from the consumers&#146; voices was that the concern
was about the right person getting the job. The concern was not about
any move towards a concurrent process involving the Lord Chief
Justice.</div>
					<a name="0706135000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Although
consumers, as well as clients whom I represent and others, are
concerned about regulation and about those lawyers who are bad and who
need to be properly brought, the primary day-to-day concern when
someone instructs a lawyer is that that lawyer should be independent
from the state. That is of primary importance. If that confidence is
knocked or broken, that will fundamentally affect not only individual
consumers&#146; confidence but, more widely, confidence in the system
and, even more widely, confidence in the rule of law.</div>
					<a name="0706135000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to be as balanced as I
can about the different interests and evidence. During an intervention
on Second Reading, someone said, &#147;Hey, you&#146;ve got the
legal services ombudsman, what&#146;s wrong with that?&#148; As the
ombudsman herself said, &#147;I am independent, impartial and very
clear. I do not work for the Government, I report through the Secretary
of State to Parliament. What&#146;s wrong with the process of
appointing the legal services ombudsman?&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important context, which we
are dealing with, is missing. We are dealing not just with any old
regulation or appointment, but with a supervisory role that is unique
to this country&#146;s system, and with the unique regulation of
lawyers. Some would say that they are unique because they need robust
regulation; others in a balanced way would say that lawyers&#151;love
them or loathe them&#151;have a unique nature and a unique role in
society. I should like to draw those matters out.</div>
					<a name="0706135000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government&#146;s rebuttal in evidence, in today&#146;s sitting and
in the Joint Committee was that it is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>consumer interest that matters, and that the consumer interest is that
the Lord Chief Justice should not have a concurrent role. My concern is
that that rebuttal is not consistent with the regulatory objectives
that the Government sign up to. The objectives represent a balanced
approach in which consumer interest is accounted for in a
non-hierarchical way, the public interest is protected and promoted,
and the constitutional principle of the rule of law is
supported.</div>
					<a name="0706135000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
heard the Minister extol that principle or say that an appointment
process in concurrence with the Lord Chief Justice would in any way
undermine the constitutional principle of the rule of law. She would
not, because she knows very well that the concurrence of the Lord Chief
Justice would properly bolster and affirm those principles, which
include</div>
					<a name="0706135000526"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;improving access
to justice;...promoting the interests of
consumers;...encouraging an independent, strong, diverse and
effective legal profession; increasing public understanding of the
citizen&#146;s legal rights and duties;...maintaining adherence
to the professional
principles.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">They are all
balancing objectives, and any support of the Government amendment to
remove the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice must be properly
justified. One cannot just say, generically, &#147;It is not in the
consumer interest&#148;; one must also justify why one does not
support the other regulatory objectives.</div>
					<a name="0706135000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s argument
for abolishing the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s involvement in any
formal process is the pick-and-choose approach that we were concerned
about in our opening remarks. Our concern is about the way in which we
would deal with the regulatory objectives if the Bill did not ensure
that one interest or objective was not put above another.</div>
					<a name="0706135000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister&#146;s other rebuttal to the concurrence of the Lord Chief
Justice is that with the Commissioner for Public Appointments, there is
an already established process for appointing in the manner that is
being put forward. The argument is that it happens anyway, so why
should lawyers be a special case? Medics are a special case, however,
and the legal profession has a unique role and it should be dealt with
in a unique way. Its regulation is not similar to any other regulation.
The Government might say that the Financial Services Authority is
unique, but their argument would fail to recognise the special position
of legal services regulation. It should not have privileges as such,
but there should be proper regard for its role in society.</div>
					<a name="0706135000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important for good public
administration that appointments to bodies such as the FSA are made on
merit, but it is not a matter of constitutional significance. One would
not find in any regulatory Bill about the FSA regulatory objectives
that also involve supporting the constitutional principle of the rule
of law. They would not be in there. That is why we need to deal with
the supervisory regulation of lawyers in a unique
way.</div>
					<a name="0706135000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us examine the
FSA further. There is no constitutional reason why the Government
should not regulate financial services directly should they wish to do
so. However, the position of legal services is different. It is a
fundamental constitutional principle that the legal profession should
be independent of Government. That can be properly secured only if the
bodies that regulate it are themselves independent of
Government.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>
					<a name="0706135000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister&#146;s other rebuttal is, &#147;Well, just another lawyer
would be put in place by having the Lord Chief Justice there.&#148;
In many ways, that does not give proper credence to and respect for the
Lord Chief Justice&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000613"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):

that.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000614"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> It has been said in debate. Although the
Minister may not have said those words, it was put forward in the other
place as a rebuttal to the Bill. One must take account of the fact that
the independence of the profession is very much bound up in the
independence of the judiciary, which is a cornerstone of our
constitution and should be properly respected. It is not sufficient
just to say that the Lord Chief Justice may well be contacted or
consulted as part of the appointments process and that may happen in
the formal manner. There needs to be a formality to this situation, but
that would not be the case should the amendment be accepted.</div>
					<a name="0706135000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also not adequate to pray
in aid Sir David Clementi. His report did not specifically say that he
wished to have the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice. However, he
was arguing in a context. He
said:</div>
					<a name="0706135000527"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given the
need for independence, and the objective of the rule of
law&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
despite not being a lawyer, he makes particular reference to the rule
of the law. The Government have not mentioned the point much in
supporting this
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0706135000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir David
Clementi continued:</div>
					<a name="0706135000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
seems right that the judiciary should be involved in the appointment;
but that it should be solely their appointment would imply that they
had primary responsibility for the regulatory system and its
performance.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">He was
examining whether the judiciary should be solely responsible for the
appointment, and decided that that should not be the case and that
consultation with the Lord Chief Justice should take
place.</div>

								Mr.
Kevan Jones</b> (North Durham) (Lab): We have not got to the
bit in the report, but is that not contrary to what the hon. Member for
Huntingdon was arguing this morning? I am talking about whether this is
about consultation or direct involvement in these appointments. I can
sit happily with Clementi&#146;s idea that consultation should take
place&#151;the Minister allowed exactly that on Second
Reading.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000616"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> One part of the wide-ranging debate is the fact
that different views exist. We heard that the consumer bodies have
different views about the particular details of the process, but Sir
David Clementi was not against the concurrence of the Lord Chief
Justice as a matter of principle. His primary concern was that this
should not be the sole responsibility of the Lord Chief Justice or the
like. He was also explicitly concerned that there needs to be an
involvement of, and recognition of the responsibility and importance
of, the Lord Chief Justice or the like to maintain the independence of
the profession. That not only needs to be done; it must be seen to be
done.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>
					<a name="0706135000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The concern,
heightened by all the Minister&#146;s justification for the
amendment, is that the independence of the profession must be
guaranteed in the Bill. If one were to apply the process, the Nolan
principles and the Commissioner for Public Appointments would be
involved, there would be consultation with other groups&#151;consumer
groups and the like&#151;and the Lord Chief Justice would be involved
in a formal manner. The concerns of consumer groups would properly be

incredulity to the vested interests. There is nothing wrong with anyone
having a vested interest, but two aspects are unique to the legal
profession. First, unlike any other professionals, lawyers can use
their profession to defend themselves. The Army is probably the only
comparable&#151;</div>

							<a name="0706135000621"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Yes. One of the few things on which the hon.
Gentleman and I would ever agree is that there should be maximum
openness on all issues and in all ways when it comes to politicians.
However, at least we can be voted in and out.</div>
					<a name="0706135000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I raise issues on behalf of
my constituents, only one profession threatens me. The police do not,
although if a constituent of mine has a complaint against them, they
may not be happy. The medical profession does not issue threats,
although a complaint may end up removing a senior consultant and the
profession would not be happy about that. Insurance companies that have
refused to pay but are forced to pay significant amounts for mistakes
may not be happy, but they do not threaten.</div>
					<a name="0706135000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">No&#151;the legal profession
issues threats; lawyers are the ones who write to me and my
constituents and threaten us. That is what is unique. Frankly, when I
get yet another threat of a writ, it is water off a duck&#146;s back.
I used to frame them; there are so many now that they have to go in a
big box file&#151;soon they will have to go in a big garden shed
because I get them so often. The lawyers have never managed to carry
out their threats,
because&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000623"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Well, let me give the hon. Gentleman some facts. Let
me tell him about the 33,619 people who pursued a case for
miners&#146; compensation but died while their claim was ongoing.
Under the law of averages, some would have, but that number says to me
that there is a whole group of solicitors out there who are incompetent
at doing their job on behalf of the people whom they purport to
represent. Furthermore, in that case, they are over-generously paid for
doing so. Those 33,619 died while their claims were ongoing. That is
why there is a big
issue.</div>
					<a name="0706135000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority of
lawyers are decent people doing a decent job. What is unique about the
legal profession is not that it includes a minority of bad solicitors,
although that is the case, or that there is a slightly larger minority
of incompetent or semi-competent ones, although that is also true, but
that if it is challenged, it can and does use the law to threaten.
Thousands of my constituents get threatening letters, and that is just
in my area. Why is that? It is because of the perception among lawyers
that they have access to justice and others have not, and that they
know the system and others do not. Others have to pay for someone to
represent them, but lawyers can do it themselves because they have
access to the courts. That is what is unique and why the system of
regulation needs to be robust.</div>
					<a name="0706135000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear talk about the separation
of powers between the state and the judiciary. I would be happy to vote
for that, and I have done. I would get rid of the House of Lords. If it
cannot be got rid of, I would make it an entirely elected Chamber. We
might then have some separation. What is particularly unique is the
ability to use the House of Lords&#151;there because of a
professional position&#151;to determine legislation. I accept that
its rules of advocacy are significantly less weak than those for the
House of Commons, but with regard to fundamental democracy there is too
much access to not only the legal system, but the parliamentary system.
That is why I have been referring so robustly to the voice of the
consumer. There are 60 million people in this country, yet we
categorise their view into that of the Consumers Association or the
National Consumer Council. The people of Britain have a right to some
basic regulation.</div>
					<a name="0706135000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not criticise the Minister. I understand the pressures that she
is up against when the legal profession is so adamant at protecting its
vested interest at all stages from the judiciary to the lowest level.
However, if I have a criticism of the Government, it is that they could
be more robust and say, &#147;No, that is not acceptable.&#148; I
cite Government amendment No. 33 and wish to highlight
something to which no reference has yet been made. Perhaps someone
would volunteer me to be a member of the Legal Services Board. I am
willing to listen to all arguments. I am a strong supporter of decent
lawyers, barristers and judges. Indeed, I do everything that I can to
highlight the good and contrast them with the useless or the
bad.</div>
					<a name="0706135000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I shall
not get through the necessary criteria because a member needs to have
knowledge of</div>
					<a name="0706135000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
provision of legal
services&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether I or the majority of my constituents can be so classified. A
member must have knowledge of</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>
					<a name="0706135000530"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;legal education and legal

					<a name="0706135000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that I
could profess to having knowledge of consumer affairs. Members must
know about</div>
					<a name="0706135000531"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;civil or
criminal proceedings and the working of the
courts&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">By the way, I am
referring to surveyed perception. I have not surveyed my constituents
about their view of the judiciary, as I have a good idea of what they
might come up with. However, in respect of legal services, they would
perceive that lawyers are people to whom they have to go if they get
into trouble and they want to be defended. If a family member is
arrested, their perception of the legal service is that they must get a
lawyer to defend that person. That view is quantified by the surveys
that I have
conducted.</div>
					<a name="0706135000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could
carry on, but members of the Committee can read the Bill. They do not
need me to take them through it clause by clause. In essence, the board
as proposed by the Government and backed by Opposition parties will be
packed to the rafters by members of the legal profession. It strikes me
that a better membership would be if the board were made up of more
than 50 per cent. of people who were not legal professionals. The
argument about who appoints the members and so on might then be more
tenable. If the board were made up entirely of people who were
independent of the legal profession, such points might have more
credibility.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000624"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I just have two quick things to say. First, I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that paragraph 3 of the schedule
states that the Lord Chancellor</div>
					<a name="0706135000532"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and Lord Chief Justice must have
regard to the desirability of securing that the Board includes members
who (between them) have experience in or knowledge
of&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						such
matters. It does not stipulate that every member must have such
experience, but just that members of the board must have such talents
between them. Secondly, I assume that the hon. Gentleman believes that
it is still relevant, for example, to have somebody who knows about
medicine to consider medical disciplinary matters, or someone who knows
about policing to consider police complaints. All regulatory bodies
need to have somebody who has practiced the service in question. Why?
Otherwise, such bodies would be made up of an entirely ignorant group
of people.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000625"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Of course, that argument could be applied to the
jury system, but I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I did not
suggest that the board should be devoid of people who have a legal
background. My question to the Minister and the main Opposition is:
what percentage of the board, ideally, should be people who have had no
prior professional involvement in the legal service? The answer to that
question would help me to understand the Government amendments. The
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey made the point that one
or two people might be enough. What percentage of a board of, say, 10
should represent the great British public rather than the legal
profession?</div>
					<a name="0706135000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
question is about whether regulators other than the legal services
ombudsman, such as the certification officer for trade unions, should
be subject to similar measures? Should the general secretary of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>the TUC be consulted on who is appointed to regulate trade unions? There
should be consistency in the employment of the argument and it should
apply to other forms of regulation. Such consistency would strengthen
the point. Would Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition agree that, on their
logic, the certification officer for trade unions ought to be appointed
by, or in conjunction with, the general secretary of the
TUC?</div>

						<a name="0706135000626"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): The hon. Member for
Bassetlaw asked some interesting questions. The matter comes down to
the meaning of the word &#147;independent&#148;, and to what sort
of independence we should aspire. I too have been threatened by lawyers
this year&#151;they have threatened to lock me up in Enfield because
of what I was doing regarding various cases in the area. I have never
made money from giving legal advice although, to declare an interest, I
used to write computer programs for lawyers about 15 years ago, so I
have made money out of the legal profession.</div>
					<a name="0706135000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise the problems of
access to justice within the system that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw
identified. The system can be over-complex, as can the statutes for
which we are responsible. Because of that, understanding the system
takes some doing. Unusually, I tend to go to courts in person as a
litigant and, without question, there are problems.</div>
					<a name="0706135000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question of independence is
crucial because, at the end of the day, we can have either the rule of
law or the rule of person&#151;there is not much else to govern
systems. All systems strike a balance between the two and it is a
question of where we should strike that balance. With the rule of
person, as proposed by the Government, the Prime Minister appoints the
Lord Chancellor, who appoints the Legal Services Board, which can in
turn sack a firm of solicitors. That is the procedure and it is a
change from the current system, which allows the legal services
ombudsman to make a recommendation that can be ignored. It amounts to a
clear rule of person over individual practitioners.</div>
					<a name="0706135000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that there are both
good and bad people in the profession, and a lot of people in the
middle territory. The legal profession is different from others because
it can be a nuisance to Government on behalf of clients. According to
the rule of law, the Government are required to follow the law.
Judicial review procedures make the Government follow the rule of law.
A competent solicitor or barrister may force the judicial review
process. Some solicitors make particular efforts on particular cases,
such as those involving Sally Clark and Angela Canning. Those people
were defended against the false allegations that they had hurt their
children by single firms of solicitors. Such cases are a nuisance to
the system and to the Crown Prosecution Service. What the CPS thought
was a case was proven not to be, and that was embarrassing to the
Government. One of the difficulties is that if the Prime Minister is
given the power to sack a firm of solicitors, we move away from the
rule of law towards the rule of person. Government amendment No. 37 is
crucial. It includes the ability to fire the chairman of the Legal
Services Board. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>Government amendments Nos. 35 and 36 raise the issue of getting rid of
Legal Services Board members.</div>
					<a name="0706135000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nolan principles can apply to
appointments even if the appointment is agreed between two people
because, at the end of the day, the Nolan interview process is still in
use. Therefore, Nolan is a red herring in that sense. Government
amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 explain how to get rid of people from the
board. Why is the Government so frightened of including something in
the Bill that is not within their gift?</div>
					<a name="0706135000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the perspective of the
hon. Member for Bassetlaw. My view is that if the Legal Services Board
comprises 10 people, three lawyers would be sufficient. I would
personally support a statutory change&#151;I do not know whether my
hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
would&#151;that requires that the majority of the board have not
worked in the legal profession.</div>
					<a name="0706135000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The medical
profession has had difficulties with self-regulation. The General
Medical Council turns a blind eye to certain things because they are
embarrassing. The fact that the GMC is moving towards taking on a
majority of non-medical people is important. When we talk about
independence, there is often professional loyalty between people so
they, too, tend to move embarrassing things out of the way.</div>
					<a name="0706135000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would strongly support having
a majority of people on the Legal Services Board who have not at any
stage been practising lawyers. That would give an independence from the
profession, which is important. I do not think that the Minister was
right to talk about having a tyranny for the consumer run by the
Minister, which is what she said in the consideration of the draft
Legal Services Bill. In that case, we would be going back to the rule
of person and to the Government controlling the process.</div>
					<a name="0706135000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to remember that clause
41 empowers the intervention directions to operate on individual
practitioners. As I said, when one looks at the detail of the difficult
cases, it is a small number of troublesome lawyers who are obtaining
justice for their clients and often for free&#151;not even on legal
aid.</div>
					<a name="0706135000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing the
Government amendments through is a clear movement away from the rule of
law and towards the rule of person. Although I would strongly support
suggestions that we should maintain the independence of the Legal
Services Board from the legal profession by having a majority of
non-lawyers on the board, it is fundamentally wrong to allow a basic
principle of the British constitution to be undermined in that
way.</div>

						<a name="0706135000627"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I would
also like to put on record and declare my own interest as a barrister
at law albeit non-practising, like the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey.</div>
					<a name="0706135000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon was extremely
well put. He said that the amendments that were passed in the House of
Lords were passed by a substantial majority of 50. They had been very
well thought out and extremely well argued. A huge amount of expertise
was brought to bear. It was not as if it was a short debate at a
particular point of the Bill in the House of Lords. This measure was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>discussed in Committee, on Report and then voted on. I have not counted
up the number of peers and peeresses who spoke in the debate, but we
are talking about a significant number. A lot of expertise was brought
to bear. I urge the Government to look again at the argument that the
Minister has advanced, because this is about checks and
balances.</div>
					<a name="0706135000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power of
patronage invested in the Government is significant. Let us consider
the constitutional changes that are being made at the moment. We have a
Lord Chancellor, who may soon be the Secretary of State for Justice,
sitting in the House of Commons. That may be a good move, but his role
will undergo further fundamental change as a consequence. In future, he
or she may be an ambitious Cabinet Minister who wants to move on in the
world. Having such a power of patronage in one person&#146;s hands,
without the checks and balances, would be a grave
danger.</div>
					<a name="0706135000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key to this
discussion is building in checks and balances. It is about being on the
side of the consumer and trying to create confidence. The separation of
powers is about being on the side of the consumer. The Minister said
that the deletions and reversals that the Government are asking us to
vote through this afternoon will make the Bill more consumer friendly.
I would argue for the reverse because, surely, having checks and
balances built in to try to restore confidence makes the Bill more
consumer friendly and supports the wider
public.</div>
					<a name="0706135000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon pointed out, third parties
have commented on this part of the Bill&#151;not just the magic
circle that he mentioned, including the leading law firms, but the
eminent chairman of the Bar Council, for example. Indeed, my hon.
Friend called in aid a number of overseas organisations, including the
Deutscher Anwaltsverein, the German equivalent of our Law Society.
Other interests have commented on this part of the Bill and stated
clearly that having too much power in the hands of one person without
checks and balances would be a grave mistake. It is about public
perception.</div>
					<a name="0706135000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
I pay tribute to the Minister for the work she has done on the Bill
from the word go. She has put a huge amount of effort, time and work
into it, has worked hard to bring the different organisations and
vested interests together and has got them to speak to each other,
co-operate fully and reach a broad consensus. I applaud her for that,
but I also urge her to listen carefully to the debate in the other
place, which was long and highly involved and had a huge amount of
technical
input.</div>
					<a name="0706135000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
the points made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, who always speaks
with a great deal of passion, I have been following from a distance the
saga of the miners&#146; compensation claims and the scandal
involved; those law firms have completely abused their position and
taken their clients for a ride in the most horrific circumstances. The
work that he has done to expose that is honourable and he deserves
credit for it. I can see where he is coming from in terms of hon.
Members&#146; interests, but as you rightly said, Mr.
Cook, when we declare our interests we do so as honourable Members and
those are on the record. If one took to its logical conclusion his idea
that a barrister or solicitor should not speak or vote on matters to do
with legal services, the same could apply to members of trade unions,
who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>would not be able to speak on employment matters, and to
journalists&#151;hon. Members of all parties make money as
journalists&#151;who would not be able to speak on freedom of
information.</div>

						</b> Would the hon. Gentleman care to read the
introductory speech by the chairman of the Standards and Privileges
Committee on 14 May 2002, which specifies exactly what the situation is
with hon. Members of this
House?</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000629"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has
obviously been following this issue carefully. He would not have made
the comments that he made at the start unless they were backed up by
fact and experience. However, I should like to put on the record my own
view, which is that the House is the richer and Committees are the
richer and more varied because people can bring their expertise to
bear. I think that most of us take that
view.</div>
					<a name="0706135000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Enfield, Southgate sat on the Joint Committee and his
comments on Clementi were helpful and valuable. He was involved with
the whole process running up to the Bill and with all the reports that
went into it. He made the point time and again that this is about
confidence. It is about trying to ensure the maximum confidence in the
consumer, and there is a risk that the consumer will not have
confidence in the new system. After all, we are talking about a
framework that will serve not only one generation, we hope, but many.
This is a once-in-100-years opportunity to reform completely the way in
which the whole legal system is regulated and its framework. Obviously,
the pinnacle is the Legal Services Board.</div>
					<a name="0706135000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about dismissals is
relevant. We have talked a lot about appointments and the need for
concurrence, but as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley pointed
out, we are considering dismissals, too. Many of us can think of
examples of where Ministers have dismissed people. I will not go into
all the examples, but there have been famous cases of heads of quangos
and different organisations being sacked by senior Cabinet Ministers.
It is important to have checks and balances in place, because we are
talking about trying to ensure the progress of the Bill, which has not
divided the parties&#151;we did not vote against it on Third
Reading&#151;and carries a huge amount of goodwill. I urge the
Minister to take on board some of the points that were made in the
House of Lords.</div>
					<a name="0706135000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Obviously,
there are points, such as those to do with the delegation of complaints
procedure, that will be far more controversial than this one. We are
considering something very modest compared with the amendments in the
House of Lords, and that fits in well with the Government&#146;s
pro-consumer agenda, so they should listen and should take on board
what has been said this afternoon. I hope that the Minister will give
my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate a birthday present and
withdraw her amendments.</div>

							<a name="0706135000630"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Once upon a time there was a Lord Chancellor who
was one of the most powerful people in the country. We have had some
famous Lord 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>Chancellors&#151;people like Thomas More. Many people have heard of
him even though they may not remember that he was a Lord Chancellor,
and he came to a sorry end not far from here, as I remember. The Lord
Chancellor had three jobs: he was Speaker of the House of Lords; he was
a member of the Government once Governments were formed in the way that
we know, having previously been the right-hand adviser to the monarch;
and he was the senior judge.</div>
					<a name="0706135000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Lord Chancellor appeared in
the House of Lords in his full attire, he wore a wig and he was a sort
of Lord high everything else, but, to their credit, when the Labour
Government came to office in 1997 they realised that that was
constitutional nonsense. They realised that it was important to
separate the functions of Parliament, Government and judiciary. At
least, that was what they said that they realised. They introduced
legislation in the House of Lords, and it was controversial: to change
the role of the Lord Chancellor. The Liberal Democrats supported it in
both Houses. There were great debates about what the name should be,
and whether the title of Lord Chancellor should stay.</div>
					<a name="0706135000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The outcome, as we all know, was
that we still have a Lord Chancellor. However, although the role has a
link with its historic antiquity, it is the official name&#151;the
constitutional name&#151;for the Secretary of State for Justice, a
Government Minister appointed by the Prime Minister of the day as a
supporter of the Government, sitting in the Cabinet and looking after a
Department with increased status and power, which is important. That is
the Department in which the Minister here serves as one of the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s junior Ministers.
</div>
					<a name="0706135000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have given another
person the job of the Speaker of the House of Lords, and that House now
elects its Speaker. The Lords Speaker in office is the first person to
hold that post. It was made clear in the legislation a couple of years
ago that the senior judge would no longer be the Lord Chancellor but
would be the Lord Chief Justice. That was part of the important
constitutional division of powers referred to my hon. Friend the Member
for Birmingham, Yardley that tried to deal with one historic
anomaly.</div>
					<a name="0706135000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">This week has
seen elections in France for the Assembl(c)e Nationale. France has
a clear separation between the powers of the Government and those of
the Parliament. If an MP is appointed Prime Minister, he or she stops
being an MP. I think that that is a bad idea, but it is what happens.
The President is elected separately and Cabinet members have to give up
being members of the Assembl(c)e Nationale for as long as they are
Cabinet members. We do not have that, but we have a fusion instead. We
have government in Parliament, but it is important that we have a
separate and independent judiciary. I put my first proposition to the
Minister in a question. I think that she is seeking in her amendment to
take away one of the safeguards in the Lords amendment: to provide that
in the appointment process for the authority that will regulate the
legal profession the appointees are absolutely and clearly unconnected
with Government.</div>
					<a name="0706135000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
no doubt that when the Justice Minister of the day appoints people to
the Legal Services Board the Ministry will take advice, place adverts
and receive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>applications, and that people will be suggested and will apply, and will
be appointed from that list. I have no doubt that the proper checks and
balances, and the Nolan principles will apply, but we have had 10 years
of Labour Government and the great British public have not decided that
there is less nepotism or less placing of politicians&#146; friends.
The public are suspicious. The Prime Minister came to office with great
intentions of being whiter than white, but is leaving office, sadly for
him&#151;I do not rejoice in this because we all suffer&#151;with
the reputation of having often put his own people in jobs and used his
own people to do his dirty work. Even the House of Lords, which had an
independent commission, is not yet perceived as being entirely
independent. There is a real crisis of confidence, and we must ensure
that the judiciary is not only seen to be independent, but is respected
for its
independence.</div>
					<a name="0706135000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
remember intervening in a debate when some of the other proposals were
going through Parliament to ask whether Ministry of Justice Ministers
would make a promise&#151;a self-denying ordinance&#151;that from
the moment they took over in the new Ministry at the beginning of May
none of them, including the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the
hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), would ever again
criticise judges. It is completely unacceptable that independent judges
are slagged off by Ministers. They may be slagged off by <i class="I">The Sun</i>
and other papers, but to be slagged off by Ministers is completely
unacceptable.</div>
					<a name="0706135000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
profession is still too male, too old and too white. Judicial diversity
is fundamental, and we must do more to achieve that. Only one Lord of
Appeal in Ordinary is a woman, and there has been little change. None
the less, judges generally have a good reputation, despite some of the
attacks that they have suffered from the press, which should be free to
attack them because that is what our free press is
for.</div>
					<a name="0706135000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister realises that the Government amendment risks making it look as
if the legal profession&#151;it does not have the best reputation in
the world, for reasons that we have often discussed&#151;will have
its regulators appointed by the Minister in charge of the legal
profession, who is a
politician.</div>
					<a name="0706135000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next
point is that it is now entirely possible and, if the rumours are
believed, very likely that the incoming Prime Minister will appoint the
new Secretary of State for Justice from the House of Commons. I would
welcome that, and have argued for that for a long time. The Secretary
of State for Justice should be accountable to the elected Members of
Parliament, not unelected people, but we must wait and see what happens
in the next few weeks. If that happens, it will look even more as if
the appointment is political. It is currently made by the Secretary of
State for Justice, which is a political appointment, and who is still
called the Lord Chancellor and sits in the House of Lords wearing a wig
and breeches, although less often than he used to. The reality is that
he is not perceived as being quite as party political as Ministers in
the House of Commons. When we have a Secretary of State for Justice in
the Commons they will be perceived as being party
political.</div>
					<a name="0706135000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are the
options? I reflected earlier on Committees that go on for a long time,
and there is a cricket analogy and a tennis one. In cricket there are
long periods with not much happening, but now and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>again an important innings occurs. This amendment is one of seven that
the Government are proposing to reverse what has happened in the Lords.
The tennis analogy is better as there are long rallies and lots of
sets, like in the French final the other day, but occasionally there is
a crucial game. This is a crucial game in the midst of the
Committee&#146;s proceedings
because&#151;</div>

Hughes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Oh yes, the tennis is very important; I
accept that. This amendment makes a lot of difference and relates to a
small point. The options are for an appointment to be made by the
Minister after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and other
people, or for a joint appointment to be made by the Minister in
concurrence with the Lord Chief Justice. My hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Yardley and my hon. Friends downstairs stand by the
decision made by the Lords that it should be a joint appointment. The
compromise that might be discussed at the end of six rounds of going up
and down the corridor between the two Houses is a consultation that
guarantees a consultation; but, we are not there yet.</div>
					<a name="0706135000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A good reason
for a joint appointment is that it would be a political appointment
with Nolan rules of somebody entirely independent of politics. To
answer the point made by the hon. Member for North Durham, it would be
someone who is not accountable or under political pressure, and
therefore would not get tainted by the fact that politicians have
appointed them. Yes, for the foreseeable future, such a person is
likely to be a lawyer. In fact, by definition the Lord Chief Justice
will probably always be a lawyer. Some countries appoint people who are
academic lawyers as opposed to practising lawyers and some appoint
judges who are not lawyers and who have come up through the lay
magistracy. The person appointed is likely to be a lawyer, but they
would not be a politician and the present Lord Chief Justice and his
successors are likely to have more credibility with the public than
politicians.</div>

Gentleman&#146;s view of a saintly figure that comes down from on
high and has wisdom that we mere mortals do not. In reality, that is
not the perception that most of the public have. Will the hon.
Gentleman answer a question that is taxing me? If the decision is taken
concurrently what happens if the two individuals&#151;the Lord Chief
Justice and the Lord Chancellor&#151;do not agree? Who has the most
weight in terms of deciding who should be
appointed?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000636"></a>
								Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Let me deal with both points. First, I have never
argued that judges are saintly; in fact I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>probably accused of arguing the opposite. Judges are entitled to be and
are criticised by people who participate in the court process and by
the press, but now mercifully not by Government. The constitution
requires that we have Government, Parliament and the judiciary. Once
the judiciary has been appointed, it must be perceived to be above
politics and be respected by Government&#151;just as judges must
respect the Government. I am clear that members of any
Government&#151;Scottish Government, Welsh Executive Government or
the Northern Ireland Assembly&#151;should never publicly criticise
the judiciary. If people think that judges have been too lenient, there
is a process for referring cases for reconsideration that can go
higher. If people think that judges have been too severe, there can be
appeals and the process can go higher. If people think that judges are
incompetent, there are processes for removing them and for dealing with
judges at all levels. Disciplinary procedures are better than they have
ever been. Let me be clear, I am not saying that judges cannot be
criticised&#151;they are criticised&#151;but that they should not
be criticised by Government and that it does nobody any good, neither
the Government nor the judiciary, if they
are.</div>
					<a name="0706135000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to the
second question, there is no greater weight given. If it is a joint
decision, it is a joint decision. It takes two to tango and both have
to agree; it is very simple. Many appointments in life require more
than one or more than one representative in an organisation to
agree&#151;for example, appointments to local government or to boards
that have to be made jointly by the local authority and the health
authority. All sorts of bodies are jointly appointed and the Lords
proposal states that both individuals need to agree. If the Lord Chief
Justice proposes somebody and the Secretary of State for Justice says,
&#147;No,&#148; that is the end of it. If the Secretary of State
for Justice proposed somebody and the Lord Chief Justice said,
&#147;No,&#148; that would be the end of it too. The good thing
about that is that the person to emerge would be someone who by
definition would command the confidence of both parts of the
process&#151;the political process and the independent
judiciary&#151;so that there would be a double level of confidence.
That would be much better and safer, and the person appointed would
have much more authority as a result.</div>

								Mr.
Jones:
						</b> That is an interesting reply. To follow the logic
of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members this afternoon, the
Lord Chief Justice is being put forward as some type of super-human
independent individual. Are we therefore saying that the Lord Chief
Justice&#146;s views have no more weight than the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s views as a &#147;mere
politician&#148;?</div>

							<a name="0706135000638"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman does not
understand. The Lord Chancellor is the senior Government member in the
Ministry of Justice and is the responsible Cabinet member. He or she
will have the future responsibility for what we are discussing. Let us
not deceive ourselves that he or she will not rely on civil service
people for help, or that there is not administrative back-up, or that
there are no support systems. At the end of the day, there is the
senior person in the Ministry of Justice on the one side&#151;the
senior politician responsible for justice in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>England and Wales&#151;and on the other side is the senior person
responsible for the courts in England and Wales. It is simple; they
have parallel
roles.</div>
					<a name="0706135000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us not
deceive ourselves either that the Lord Chief Justice does not also have
administrative back-up and civil servants, because he does. He would
take advice and he would have administrative processes. We would
therefore have two people, each with the benefit of advice, coming
together to discuss things, and one might seek to persuade the other,
or vice versa. When they agreed, the decision would proceed. The
safeguards for the public would therefore be far better than if one
person made the decision and took the
responsibility.</div>

							<a name="0706135000639"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> I follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s logic, but does
it not also follow that a legal professional would automatically fill
the position, as I fear? The proposal would have to be combined with
the proposal that divides him from the Conservative party, whereby the
chair must be a lay chair, so that the role is not automatically
occupied by a legal professional. Does not his logic require both
proposals to be adopted together, or
neither?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000640"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I do not think that that necessarily follows.
However, I accept the other part of the argument; I accept that it is a
good idea that the chair of the Legal Services Board should be a lay
person. I also share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Yardley that the majority of board members should be lay
people&#151;that is exactly right. I have always taken a similar view
in relation to the medical profession: the General Medical Council
should have a majority of non-medics to stand in judgment on the
medical profession&#151;not exclusively non-medics, but a majority.
Likewise, I have always been of the view that the Independent Police
Complaints Commission should consist of a majority of non-police
officers&#151;although, again, there should be some police officers
in the commission. I hope that I have been consistent in such views
throughout my political
career.</div>
					<a name="0706135000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that one does not have to
implement both proposals, but it would be better if we did. He might
say that, if the other two safeguards of a lay chair and a lay majority
were built in, he would be less troubled by the joint appointment. I
hope that that is the logic of his
position.</div>
					<a name="0706135000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">My answer to
the point made by the hon. Member for North Durham is absolutely no.
The Lord Chief Justice would be just as competent to appoint lay people
as lawyers; he would not be lobbying for lawyers. However, he or she
would bring some knowledge about some of the lawyers who might be
mentioned, because he or she would have seen them practise and know
whether they were good or no good, competent or incompetent, and
whether they had the confidence of the public. That knowledge could be
brought to the table, and the Lord Chief Justice would be able to draw
on the pool of all the experience of all the judges in England and
Wales, whom he is there to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>represent&#151;he and his future successor. His input would be of
benefit; it would be a joint lock.</div>
					<a name="0706135000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point is that a new
structure is being created. The Minister knows that in general terms
the structures that the Government are proposing have been welcomed by
my party. However, we must begin with maximum public confidence, and I
think that that will be governed by whether we have a lay chair, which
would help with that confidence, as would having a lay majority.
However, I am also clear that not keeping the appointments solely in
the hands of a party politician&#151;this year Labour, next year
Conservative and in two years possibly Liberal Democrat, or whatever
the sequence
is&#151;</div>

					<a name="0706135000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going to
appeal to the Minister. I know that she starts from a position of
resistance, but I ask her to reflect across Government. Not all posts
are single ministerial appointments, even post-Nolan. There are still
lots of joint appointments, in central Government, regional government
and local government. The proposal would bring benefits. It would add
credibility and strength, and depoliticise appointments. I hope that
she will realise on reflection that if she does not concede
now&#151;although I do not expect her to concede today&#151;we may,
I fear, come back to the issue several times to come. In the end, there
might have to be a Government concession. It might therefore be easier
for us all if the concession came earlier, because we would have to
spend less time on the Bill between now and
October.</div>

the individual issues raised first. I reassure my hon. Friend the

individuals. Clause 41 allows the LSB to direct the approved regulator,

who took this Bill through the House of Lords in an excellent
fashion&#151;how well she conducted the debates should be put on the
record&#151;has had regular meetings with our colleagues in Europe,
because that is also part of her remit. One of the things that is
interesting to note about the German Bar is that it is coming under
increasing pressure from its own monopolies commission to get it to
allow increased competition.</div>
					<a name="0706135000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that I said something
on Second Reading about using the BRAK as the example of foreign legal
firms being concerned about this measure. The BRAK might want to
protect its own vested interests, and it is not our job to protect the
vested interests of legal firms abroad.</div>
					<a name="0706135000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">To follow up the point, I turn
to the comments made to the Joint Committee. To be fair, the Law
Society has fairly regularly said that it is concerned about the
international effect. However, Sir David Clementi himself told the
Joint
Committee&#151;</div>

						</b> Will the Minister discount the opinion of the
chairman of the Bar Council and of the five largest firms in this
country, as she just has, without considering the problems that they
have raised and deciding what she will do about them&#151;or at least
giving some idea of where the Government are coming from on the issue?
Will she just say that it is Baroness Ashton&#146;s
responsibility?</div>

Prentice:
						</b> I did not say that it was Baroness
Ashton&#146;s responsibility. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we had
had discussions with our foreign counterparts and the answer is yes.
Baroness Ashton has had such discussions, and others with the European
Commissioner, about the issues. There is a great deal of interest in
the development of the Bill among quite a number of people, because
some are thinking about whether to follow suit. Once again, Britain is
leading the way in Europe, and I am pleased about
that.</div>

					<a name="0706135000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to the
report, Sir David Clementi himself said that</div>
					<a name="0706135000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;none of the senior partners of the
major international law firms, whom he consulted in the course of his
review, had &#145;expressed concern&#146; that reform would
&#145;somehow prejudice their ability to win business
overseas&#146;&#148;.</div>

							<a name="0706135000658"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I read out a letter, which was copied to the
Minister among others only last week. It set out the express concerns
that the Minister has just denied. Is she saying that that letter does
not
exist?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000659"></a>
								Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I am well aware that the letter exists; I am
trying to tell the hon. Gentleman that when Sir David Clementi
specifically asked the major international law firms about the issue,
they expressed no concerns about their ability to win overseas
business. Sir David also said that Secretaries of State
have</div>
					<a name="0706135000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;quite large
oversight powers at
present&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that the
proposed system</div>
					<a name="0706135000538"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would be
a good deal more independent of oversight by Secretaries of State than
currently.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall come
back to that point in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="0706135000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir David
thought that it might be appropriate for the Lord Chancellor to consult
the Master of the Rolls. I shall come back to the words
&#147;consult&#148; and &#147;concurrence&#148;; if necessary,
we will get dictionary definitions so that everybody understands the
difference. The Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls said
that</div>
					<a name="0706135000539"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provided that the
LSB was &#145;truly independent&#146;, they did not consider that
the international reputation of the legal professions would be
affected.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we can put
that particular myth to bed.</div>
					<a name="0706135000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman was also
concerned about the fact that the Secretary of State, the Lord
Chancellor, would have that oversight of the legal profession.
Obviously, he has forgotten that under the Courts and Legal Services
Act 1990 the Secretary of State approves the key rules of the legal
professions and can alter those rules by order. Under this Bill, all
that will transfer to the legal services board. That will be a much
more independent, open and transparent
system.</div>
					<a name="0706135000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall go
through some of the other bodies to which ministerial appointment
applies, but before that I want to talk a little about the office of
the Commissioner for Public Appointments. By being blinkered or blind,
the Opposition have simply ignored the role of the Office of the
Commissioner for Public Appointments&#151;established under a Tory
Government after the Nolan committee&#146;s
recommendations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>
					<a name="0706135000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commissioner is appointed by
the Queen, and he is independent of the Government and the civil
service. He regulates, monitors and reports on all ministerial
appointments, and selection processes are monitored by independent
scrutiny, annual audit and the commissioner&#146;s annual report. If
there was concurrence with the Lord Chief Justice, there would be no
formal reason why the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments should apply, and the appointment might not automatically
come under the commissioner&#146;s oversight. Surely that would be a
far less open and transparent system than that which we
suggest.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000660"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> If those were the Minister&#146;s genuine
concerns, would not the appropriate response have been for her to table
amendments to establish in the Bill that appointments process? If the
concerns are that the Commissioner for Public Appointments process
would not properly apply and there would not be any proper
accountability, would not it be an appropriate response to table an
amendment establishing in the Bill the appointments process according
to the Nolan principles or the relevant applicable rules at the time?
That issue was raised in the other place, and it led to the Minister
undertaking that the measure might be subject to the affirmative
procedure.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000661"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I could have done that, but it would have meant
that I accepted the idea that there should be concurrence with the Lord
Chief Justice. I do not fundamentally accept that
case.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000662"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> Assuming that the Minister does not like the
idea of concurrence, which she has made quite plain, it would be
incorrect to say that we ignored the Nolan principles, because I spoke
about them at some length. The point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Enfield, Southgate makes is important. How will the appointments
process work on the basis of what the Government propose? If
concurrence is removed, what will the Government put in to replace it?
One cannot just say &#147;Nolan&#148;. How will the Government
adapt Nolan? Will they put out a paper about it? How will they take it
forward?</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000663"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The appointment will be made in the way that all
public appointments are made: they must follow the Nolan principles as
set out under the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments.</div>
					<a name="0706135000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
record, on the number of appointments that are made to the board in
that way, people are appointed to the Financial Services Authority by
the Treasury, which can remove the chairman and the members of the
governing body. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry appoints
and can remove the chairman and non-executive members of Ofcom; the
Home Secretary appoints the immigration services commissioner after
consulting the Lord Chancellor, and he can dismiss the commissioner on
specified grounds; the Home Secretary also appoints commissioners to
the Commission for Racial Equality; the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government appoints the members and chairman of
the Audit Commission; and the Secretary of State for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>Culture, Media and Sport appoints the chairman and commissioners of the
Gambling Commission.</div>
					<a name="0706135000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why should appointments to the
legal services board be any different from proper public appointments
that are made under the scrutiny of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments, with the Minister accountable to Parliament? I find it
incredible that we have spent so long debating the matter when it is
such obvious and common practice. We should have slightly more faith in
our system of public
appointments.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000664"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The reason why the appointment should be different
is that the board will regulate an entirely different part of public
life: the system that holds the scales, not a bit of a DCMS quango. The
Minister will not be able to give me an answer to the following
question now, but it is cheaper than tabling a written question. Will
she let us have a list of all the joint appointments? She has given us
some of the single appointments. Can she tell us why the answer to the
question that has been bouncing around is that the person appointed
jointly cannot go through the same process of being drawn from the
Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; pool as easily as anybody
else, which guarantees that there will not be a single party political
appointment? That has all the benefits and none of the
disbenefits?</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000665"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I will do my best to find a list of all the
joint appointments and all those made in consultation with other
people. On the position of lawyers, however, the legal services
complaints commissioner, who is appointed fully by the Secretary of
State under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, can fine regulators
when their complaints system has been
failing.</div>
					<a name="0706135000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good practice
has been carried on throughout. It is astonishing for Committee members
to be trying to make this a party political issue. As I have said on
Second Reading and in conversations with Committee members, the idea
that the Lord Chancellor would make an appointment without consulting
the appropriate people, among whom I would include the eminence that is
the Lord Chief Justice, is beyond
me.</div>
					<a name="0706135000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me end by
reading from a letter sent in response to the letter from the magic
circle. It
states:</div>
					<a name="0706135000540"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Claims
by the five &#145;magic circle&#146; leading solicitors&#146;
firms that ministerial appointment of the new legal services regulator
would endanger lawyers&#146; independence amounts to a clever sleight
of hand...Ensuring the independence of the legal professions from
government is important for lawyers&#146; clients too. But the
original proposals safeguard this principle, since the process will be
run by the independent Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments&#151;the standard convention for appointments to public
bodies.</div>
					<a name="0706135000541"></a><div class="hs_brev">In fact, what
matters most to consumers is the regulator's independence. The lord
chief justice is a qualified lawyer and head of the judiciary in
England and Wales. Giving him a veto over who should regulate the legal
professions will undermine public confidence that the legal profession
will be properly
policed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">That comes from
the chief executive of the National Consumer Council. He expresses
clearly the points that I made in my opening
remarks.</div>
					<a name="0706135000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides for an independent board. I believe absolutely that the Lord
Chancellor, whether as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>Minister in the House of Commons or the House of
Lords&#151;he or she could be in either House&#151;will make that
appointment in the way that all public appointments are made under the
Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments and the rules and
codes of practice therein. I see no reason why we need to have a veto
from one member&#151;even the most senior member&#151;of the
judiciary, when that consultation will make it transparent to both
lawyers and consumers that the appointment is made
properly.</div>

North Southwark and Bermondsey had added his name to
it.</div>
					<a name="0706135000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have discussed
several issues today, one of which was about the perception that the

being quiet. I cannot excuse chuntering on the Opposition
Benches.</div>
					<a name="0706135000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said earlier that we need to
maximise public confidence in the Bill. Having lay people in the senior
position of the chair and elsewhere on the board is a way of
demonstrating to the public that we intend the bodies to be
independent.</div>
					<a name="0706135000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
strange that the Bill stipulates that the</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>
					<a name="0706135000543"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;first chairman must be a lay
person&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why only the
first? The legal services ombudsman is appointed by the Lord Chancellor
in accordance with section 21 of the Courts and Legal Services Act
1990. The 1990 Act stipulates that the ombudsman is not a qualified
lawyer and is independent of the legal profession. It is important that
the individual who chairs the board is a lay person. That would give
the confidence to which the hon. Gentleman has
referred.</div>
					<a name="0706135000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
believe that the legal profession needs regulating not with a light
touch, but with a heavy hand, because of the appalling way in which it
has dealt with many of my poor and vulnerable constituents who applied
for compensation through the mineworkers&#146; compensation scheme.
It is clear that the Law Society has fundamentally failed those
individuals and that there is a culture of denial, whereby it is
believed that it can put its own house in order. My hon. Friend the
Member for West Bromwich, West referred on Second Reading to a closed
shop. The Law Society is the best example of a closed shop still in
existence. When trade union closed shops were regulated by the last
Conservative Government, the trade union of the legal profession was
not regulated.</div>
					<a name="0706135000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my
hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has mentioned, no one would
suggest that the certification officer who regulates trade unions
should be a trade union official. People would quite rightly complain
about such a situation.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000722"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned closed shops. Would
he suggest that the provisions in the Bill should also apply to
Government lawyers?</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000723"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I am sceptical about lawyers. My experience is that
irrespective of the form that they take, they are good at protecting
their own interests. It was interesting to see the gutting of the Bill
in the Lords by the vested interests, which we have seen in operation
today. No fewer than four out of the five Members present on the
Opposition Benches are lawyers or barristers. There would quite rightly
be a hoo-hah if a committee set up to consider trade union legislation
was made up entirely of trade union officials or
members.</div>
					<a name="0706135000522"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">
						The
important thing is get public confidence back. Ensuring that lay people
have key roles would do that. I do not accept the arrant nonsense that
the only people who are fit to sit on the kinds of bodies that we are
discussing are people who understand procedure and the law in detail.
People who do not have a legal background are clearly capable of
filling such roles. The incumbent of the office of the legal services
ombudsman, for example, is not legally qualified, yet she has done an
excellent job of championing the rights of the consumer and of people
who need protection. Amending the Bill would go a long way to
protecting the vulnerable from the section of the legal profession that
feels that it is above the law and that uses the law to advance not
only its own case, but that of the whole group.</div>
					<a name="0706135000523"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I do not accept the idea that was
put forward on Second Reading and again today that a legal
qualification bestows some kind of sainthood on a person and makes them
the font of all knowledge and propriety. Clearly, some of the lawyers
that my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw and I have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>
						dealing with will not go to heaven. In fact, they
are destined for eternal damnation, if there is any justice in this
world.</div>
					<a name="0706135000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
going to strengthen the Bill and, as the Minister has said on more than
one occasion, put the consumer at its heart, it is important that the
first chair of the board is a lay person and that lay people are in the
majority on the committees and can argue the case for the consumer
against the vested interest that we have seen not only in the other
place but in this Committee today.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000724"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman mentions that my name
appears on his amendment. I am now going to say something in support of
the amendment. May I say to the hon. Gentleman that he should be much
more worried about the people who oppose him rather than the people who
support him? Sometimes coalitions of the just and the unjust, the
righteous and non-righteous can get the deed
done</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000725"></a>Mr.

					<a name="0706135000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000726"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>That is true, but we have got to try to win
the argument. We hope that we can sway the Government. I hope that the
Government will be bold. I can see why they are where they are at the
moment. They want to give the right impression and create a good start.
After that, they think that they can settle down and leave the options
open. There is a perfectly reasonable argument for that. There are good
lawyers who could become members of the board and even the chair in the
future.</div>
					<a name="0706135000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say in
passing that there are some fantastic lawyers, as the Minister and the
Government know? I have been working with lots of people who are
unhappy with the Government&#146;s legal aid proposals. Many of them
are lifelong committed lawyers in the public service working in the
most difficult parts of Britain with the most difficult clients. There
are also good lawyers in other sectors, such as people who deal with
the entertainment and record industry, commercial transactions and the
most complicated global commercial deals. There is no question that
there are some fantastic lawyers.</div>
					<a name="0706135000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is, what is the
reality and what is the perception? We need to be bold about this. If
we establish a principle that says, &#147;start with a lay chair and
continue with a lay chair&#148;, we will put down a marker.
Mercifully, the majority of adults in Britain are not lawyers. When I
travel around the country and ask people what they want to do, I get
the sense that more and more are giving one of two answers&#151;and I
say this as somebody who is a lawyer&#151;namely accountancy or law.
They are both honourable professions, but I sense that the world is
suffering rather than benefiting from having too many lawyers and
accountants. We probably could do with more roofers, tilers, joiners
and people who do the more functional
things.</div>
					<a name="0706135000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
there is a majority of non-lawyers. The Bill is about regulating the
profession. It is better that it is led by someone who comes from
outside and sees it as others see it. There will be no shortage of
people to give legal advice&#151;staff, board members and many other
people. With the best will in the world, I am sure that the great legal
professions will occasionally drop a line to the Legal Services Board
saying how they feel.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>
					<a name="0706135000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will be
bold, take the amendment and then we can go home with one decision that
makes it obvious to the world outside that these processes are
wonderfully all worth while.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000727"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I was slightly open minded about the amendment.
However, I have to say that both hon. Members have failed to convince
me. How far should the prohibition extend? The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey asked whether those who are qualified as
lawyers but who have worked in business and have not practised as a
lawyer for a number of years should be able to apply. As I read it,
such a person would not come within the definition of a lay person
under paragraph 2(4), and so they would presumably be discriminated
against.</div>
					<a name="0706135000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
layer of prejudice that would be unjust and nonsensical. As I said
earlier, the Prime Minister is a lawyer and so is the Leader of the
House. Lawyers run large private sector corporations and undertake a
variety of public appointments. The head of the judiciary, the Lord
Chief Justice, is a lawyer, and that was put into legislation recently.
The remarks made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw suggest that he
believes that lawyers should not even be in this Committee. There is an
element of nonsense. Why do we need to be quite so aggressive to
lawyers? Has the hon. Member for North Durham&#151;or, indeed, the
Minister&#151;taken advice on the human rights implications of the
amendment? I would pleased to hear
that.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0706135000574"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0706135000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not quite
so open-minded on amendment No. 264. The suggested amendment
seeks to ensure that the majority of ordinary members of a committee
that an approved regulator authorises to exercise its regulatory
functions are lay persons. Under the proposals, the Legal Services
Board is, of course, to have a majority of lay members. It is important
to remember that the role of the Legal Services Board is to monitor the
regulators to whom it has delegated power. The proposal would therefore
go against the Bill&#146;s intention that the Legal Services Board
should be a light-touch supervisor of the regulators, who can come out
of the professions. In effect, the amendment would rip the heart out of
the Clementi proposals.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000728"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> It is not only the Clementi proposals that cause
some concern. I see some rationale or logic to the amendment, and
perhaps it would have some merit if it were part of a package involving
the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice together with the
chairmanship. That might persuade me. Without that package, the
scepticism is raised by the fact that what the public surely want and
what is in the public interest is that the best person for the job
should be appointed. The amendment could, in many ways, get in the way
of the process of following the Nolan principles in an open and
transparent way. To deal with the matter in such a manner, merely
because of the concerns about perception, is a step too
far.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000729"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a common-sense remark, and
offers an intriguing possibility for a Bill later. In the meantime, I
should mention that we would not support amendment No.
264.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000730"></a>
								John
Mann:
						</b> I have certainly no objection to having the odd
lawyer on this Committee. The Nolan principles are clear as outlined in
the House in May 2002 and I am sure that all hon. Members will be
reading them tonight. The issue is about vested interests and
advocating on behalf of those interests, not about whether people
should be able to participate. The real issue is about the
balance.</div>
					<a name="0706135000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would
happen if the initial lay chair were unfortunately to drop dead during
that person&#146;s first year in office, perhaps due to the pressures
of the job? Would that mean that the replacement would automatically be
a lay chair during that initial period? The reason that I think that an
independent chair is important has nothing to do with solicitors. The
Law Society has shown robustness in the past 12 months in looking after
its profession and recognising that the names of all solicitors were
being sullied by the actions of a minority. Indeed, in my
area&#151;the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey will be
surprised to know this&#151;there has been a reduction in the number
of practising solicitors. Those who have sought to battle publicly have
gone out of business. That may or may not be because I called on the
general public to boycott their services, but a major
building&#151;the largest, I believe, in my constituency&#151;is
now vacant and up for commercial letting to another profession, which
might indicate some correlation. That does not necessarily benefit my
constituents, because it presumes that the other people to whom they
can go are competent.</div>
					<a name="0706135000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						What I want to
say to the Minister, however, is that more than anything I do not want
in post someone with wide knowledge, who is a retired ex-judge, who is
well known to one of the appointees&#151;or both, depending on how
the Bill is enacted&#151;and who will look after the vested interests
of the profession that has served him well for 50 years. The general
public do not need that, and I am more concerned about that than about
whether the person in the post is a professional who is deemed to be
professional without a vested
interest.</div>
					<a name="0706135000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
should be a safeguard, and in that regard I was interested in the
comments of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. I
disagree with him, but the Liberal Democrat position is at least
consistent; if we are to have a twin-track appointment, it logically
has to be the appointment of a lay person. That means that the
Minister&#146;s position is consistent too, but if she has any
further deliberations with the other House it is critical that that
consistency should
remain.</div>
					<a name="0706135000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
option always to have a lay person in charge would be a good safeguard;
it would not just give a veneer of propriety but would send a message
to the outside world that the legal profession has the confidence to
deal with anyone in the profession who is behaving badly. That
confidence is what needs to be reasserted; if the majority of good
professionals have the confidence to deal with the minority of either
bad or incompetent ones, that will boost the profession
overall.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000731"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is
actually a very high probability that the Lord Chancellor and Secretary
of State for Justice&#151;or whatever title is then in
use&#151;will be a qualified lawyer in any
event?</div>

					<a name="0706135000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to my
concluding remarks. The legal profession allowed industrial deafness to
be dealt with without challenge by telephone; tens and tens of
thousands of industrial deafness claims were dealt with by telephone. A
lay person would regard that with the same incredulity as I regard
it.</div>
					<a name="0706135000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
seems to me that the most relevant and powerful argument that my
constituents and I can put forward, in light of that, is that having
someone who is removed from the profession is more likely to result in
consideration of the bigger picture. Such a person would be more likely
to speak out whenever something was clearly nonsense, or whenever
gobbledegook was presented as an excuse for their behaviour by a firm
of solicitors. They would be more likely to say, &#147;We are not
having that; we are going to have some common sense for
consumers.&#148; That is the best argument for someone from outside
the legal profession to oversee the board.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000733"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Obviously, given the consumer focus of the
legislation, I understand entirely why my hon. Friend is attracted to
ensuring greater lay representation in the new framework.
Unfortunately, I shall, of course, have to resist his argument. We all
agree that the first chair should be lay, for the reasons that we have
given. If the first chair is a lay person and demonstrably independent
from the legal profession, that will send a message. It will give the
direction that the board will go in, determine the culture of the new
organisation and win the support of consumers. Indeed, the Joint
Committee supported that position.</div>
					<a name="0706135000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, at a reasonable point
in the future&#151;once that has happened and those foundations are
laid&#151;it may be that the best person for the job is someone who
has been a lawyer in the past, as the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate said. We were charged at the beginning of this debate not to
condemn all lawyers or to say that the profession was dreadful. I do
not condemn lawyers, because there are some very good lawyers.
Therefore, someone who has worked in the legal profession in the past
might, at some future date, be a suitable person to chair the
board.</div>

							<a name="0706135000734"></a>Mr.

						</b> I understand my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s
point about the first person setting up the foundations of the
organisation, but will she respond to the point that my hon. Friend the
Member for Bassetlaw made? What happens if the first chair resigns on
the second day or drops dead two weeks into the appointment? Would that
not mean that a lawyer could be put straight in there, so that the
confidence to which the Minister refers will not be
there?</div>

								Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I am reminded of the what if question that the
hon. Member for Huntingdon asked in a previous debate. He asked a
series of what ifs about the role of the Lord Chancellor in the
appointment of the chair. I am also reminded of my teaching days. If
children wanted to divert me from the objective of the lesson, they
would ask a series of what ifs. By the time a teacher went past the
first three, they were in the realms of fantasy and the little men from
Mars were about to descend on to the planet. I do not suggest that my
hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>
						Friend has reached that stage yet, thankfully, but
asking what would happen if a series of strange things happened does
not necessarily move us forward.</div>
					<a name="0706135000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, I
will check what would happen if something dreadful took place within a
week of the chair being appointed. Would that mean that we were into
second-level appointments, as it were? In such a situation, I like to
think that sense would prevail and that, given that we would still be
talking about the board and the organisation as a whole starting out,
another lay person would be the right person to appoint, in order to
ensure that that culture and those foundations were set in a way that
would give the perception of consumer confidence needed. However, I
shall make absolutely sure that that is likely to be the
case.</div>

incentive for them to see it through. The Minister did the right
thing.</div>
					<a name="0706135000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
am right, but will the Minister clarify whether the category defined in
the Bill as &#147;lay persons&#148; would not preclude somebody who
was an academic lawyer only and who had never qualified as a solicitor,
barrister or advocate? If someone were just a law lecturer at
Nottingham university, for example, could they still be appointed? I
just want to be clear for the
record.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> The definition is in paragraph 2(4)(a) to (f) of
schedule 1; if a person did not have one of the roles listed there,
they would qualify as a lay
chair.</div>
					<a name="0706135000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say
briefly why we want to stop at that point and allow someone who may
have been a practising solicitor or barrister to become the chair in
subsequent years. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
mentioned, there are people who practise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>
						law in their 20s and 30s and move out of the legal
profession. They could well then work in consumer
organisations.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000747"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Indeed&#151;in other words, they do not become
Members of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="0706135000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such people
would have good experience from both sides, as it were, and in their
40s or 50s might be appropriate as chair of the board. For the sake of
such people, we should be a little more flexible in respect of the
subsequent years. We have made provisions so that there always has to
be a lay majority. Even if he or she had been a practising lawyer, the
chair certainly could not be one while they chaired the board. That is
a reasonable safeguard to ensure that the board has a strong lay
focus.</div>
					<a name="0706135000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
amendment would mean that the regulatory arm of the approved regulators
would have to have a majority of lay members. I can see why that might
maintain the confidence of consumers, but I do not agree that it should
be a requirement as determined by the internal governance rules made
under clause 30. We have based the Bill on the B-plus regulation model
of Sir David Clementi. That fully recognises the principle of the
self-regulation of the legal profession and the benefits of retaining
the expertise that regulatory bodies have built up. That, of course,
was subject to the very fact that they had to separate out their
regulatory representative functions. It will also be subject to the
supervision of a strong-oversight Legal Services
Board.</div>
					<a name="0706135000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides for the system. We agree with Sir David Clementi that we
should insist on a lay majority at the level of oversight regulator.
That demonstrates independence from the legal profession at the very
apex of the new framework. For that reason, we agree that the board
cannot be, or be seen to be, operating in the pocket of the legal
profession.</div>
					<a name="0706135000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
system is to be effective, there has to be the right level of expertise
involved in the day-to-day regulation. In some cases&#151;not all,
but some&#151;the regulatory arms of the approved regulator may need
some professional members. For example, if a regulator was operating as
a licensing authority, it is plausible that it would be necessary for
professional members with experience of different professions to work
alongside lawyers in ABS firms, and it would be for the regulators,
through the internal governance rules made by the board, to determine
what arrangements work best. To put a requirement in statute that there
must be a lay majority might result in a one-size-fits-all regime that
does not recognise the differences between each of the approved
regulators.</div>
					<a name="0706135000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause
30 clearly states the key principles suggested by the Joint Committee,
including the principle that the regulatory arm is adequately resourced
and can make representations to the board if it considers that its
independence or effectiveness have been compromised. The clause is
drafted in such a way that there is flexibility for the board to
determine the details of what arrangements would work best. It is
perfectly feasible for the board to consider at a later stage whether
there should be a lay majority on the regulatory arms. If it believes
that that is required, it will use the internal governance
rules.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>

						I have said
throughout this debate that we are giving these powers to the board,
and it is appropriate to leave it to the board to make its
determination in future. I ask my hon. Friend the Member for North
Durham to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000748"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I am sorry that the Conservatives do not support
these amendments because, having looked around the Room, I see that we
might have had a majority for them. However, it is perhaps asking too
much for the hon. Member for Huntingdon to give up vested interests,
and to change the habits of a lifetime and the habits of this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0706135000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
to the Minister carefully, but I am afraid that I do not have her trust
in the legal profession. She followed up the suggestion that what I
said was a what if with another what if: what if a 40-year-old who
wanted to practise law then wanted to apply? We can play that both
ways.</div>
					<a name="0706135000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
Minister&#146;s commitment to guarantee that for the first five years
the chair will be a lay person. That is important because if the body
is to have public respect and to regain some credibility after the
hammering that it has had over the past few years, setting up a robust
organisation is important and can be done only with an independent
chair. I presume from what the Minister said that if the chair dies or
resigns half way through the five-year term, the replacement will be a
lay person, and I welcome
that.</div>
					<a name="0706135000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is difficult for the professions to argue that they will not fall back
into their bad old habits of protecting their own interests, and if
their regulatory arms are to be seen to be independent and champions of
consumers&#146; interests, I still think that a majority of the
representatives should be lay people. That is not to say that I
criticise the Solicitors Regulation Authority, because the chair is
doing a good job and taking a robust view, but that must continue and
if there is to be long-term public confidence lay representatives
should play a major part in those
organisations.</div>
					<a name="0706135000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
assurance that the chair will be a lay person for five years, and the
proviso that we may want to return to the matter on Report, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

								Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I do not plan to make a speech on these
Government amendments, I just want some clarification. When the
Minister says that the amendments will bring the Bill into line with
Government policy, is that a new policy? Has it cropped up since the
Bill was published&#151;indeed, since it was presented to the House
of Lords&#151;and, if not, was there an oversight on the part of her
Department? I am slightly concerned, because there are public
expenditure implications. Although Opposition Members are reasonably
understanding, I should like some further clarification now, rather
than waiting to speak at length on the matter
later.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000827"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The amendments follow advice in Treasury
guidelines on how we should approach the matter. Generally, such
positions are not pensionable, but the amendments give the flexibility,
should it be necessary. The Government published the guidance
relatively recently. It requires express provision to be made in
statute if we want to allow for such a possibility. In addition to
complying with the guidance, the key issue is flexibility. The measure
allows us to have the flexibility so that the board can attract the
best calibre of candidate. If necessary, it will compensate board
members and staff when that is appropriate. On that basis, I commend
the amendments to the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000828"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> The Government wish to make the amendment so
that the terms of appointment of the chairman or other ordinary members
of the board may provide for pensions, allowances or gratuities. It
also allows the board to pay compensation to the chairman or other
ordinary members in certain circumstances. At the moment, under
paragraph 10, ordinary board members only receive pay and it is the
chief executive or employees who are entitled to pensions and other
benefits under paragraph 14.</div>
					<a name="0706135000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Government
also seek a similar amendment to be made to schedule 15 so that the
terms of appointment of the chairman or other ordinary members of the
OLC may provide for pensions, allowances or gratuities. It would also
allow the OLC to pay compensation to the chairman or other ordinary
members in certain circumstances.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>
					<a name="0706135000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government&#146;s proposal is certainly generous. However, they seem
to be making a promise now, but working out how to fulfil it at a later
date. Although the Government make these proposals on pensions,
allowances and gratuities, they fail to explain how they will be paid
for or to how much they might amount. Will the Minister please let us
know in more detail how remuneration is likely to work in such bodies?
How non-executive will the board members be? How will that tie in with
their pay? Will it affect the Government&#146;s regulatory impact
assessment?</div>
					<a name="0706135000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk spotted from the
Minister&#146;s comments that the measure would bring the Bill into
line with the Government&#146;s policy. He rightly asked what that
policy was and from where it came. I do not think that the hon. Lady
actually answered his question. If she would come back to the Committee
with further details, we should be grateful.</div>
					<a name="0706135000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the Government have
suggested payment of compensation in certain circumstances, yet they
have failed to explain in what circumstances it would be paid, what
criteria would be used and who would determine whether such an award
would be made. The Government seem keen that such matters should be
sorted out by secondary legislation. They want us to accept their
amendments now and discuss the content later. That seems a haphazard
and superficial way in which to legislate. We would prefer to have
solid proposals to discuss, not just the candy floss on the top with no
substance to
consider.</div>
					<a name="0706135000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
Government have not given the amendment the appropriate consideration
that it deserves. For example, the terms of appointment of the Legal
Services Board are set under paragraphs 4 to 9 of schedule 1. A member,
other than the chief executive, must be appointed for a fixed period,
which must not exceed five years. A person may only be reappointed once
for a further period not exceeding five years. Therefore, the maximum
amount of time that a person may remain on the board is 10 years. Only
10 years&#146; service, and the Government are to reward people with
a pension. While the majority of people in the country work until the
age of 65&#151;not including Members of Parliament, of
course&#151;which means that it takes a period of more than 40 years
to accrue a pension, members of the Legal Services Board can do so in
one quarter of that time. Can the Government justify
that?</div>
					<a name="0706135000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the legal
profession yet again be targeted as a source of payment for such
ministerial largesse? The Exchequer contributes to the cost of the
regulation of the financial services sector. Can the Minister confirm
that it will do likewise in equal measure in respect of the regulation
of legal services? She spoke about following the Government&#146;s
guidelines, but it is not the Government who will seemingly pay for
such measures.</div>
					<a name="0706135000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">My noble
Friend Lord Lyell stated in the other place in relation to setting-up
costs that the</div>
					<a name="0706135000544"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;importance of an independent and
strong legal profession is a matter of very strong public interest. The
Bill is intended to further that public interest. But it is heaping
considerably more costs on the
profession.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>
					<a name="0706135000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same type of issues apply now, so if it
is not the practitioners who will fund such pensions&#151;they will,
I think&#151;will the Minister say who will pay?</div>
					<a name="0706135000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have again failed
to appreciate the significance of the funding issues. As Lord Bach
observed in the other
place,</div>
					<a name="0706135000545"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
start-up costs...my experience of government leads me to the very
firm view that costs are always understated at this stage. I fear that
the start-up costs may be understated in this case,
too.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6 December
2006; Vol. 687, c.
1178.]</div>
					<a name="0706135000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not entirely sure
whether those provisions will impact on the start-up costs, but I
should be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s opinion.</div>
					<a name="0706135000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions will increase the
financial commitment of bodies that provide legal services. Those
costs, which may be significantly greater than their current running
costs, will inevitably be passed on to the very consumers whom the Bill
seeks to protect, hitting the very people whom the Minister says she
prioritises. Moreover, to throw such a provision into the Bill at such
a late stage shows how little the Government have thought the issue
through. At the very least, she should tell us how much the proposals
are likely to cost, and I should be grateful if she could send a paper
giving details about what will be involved.
</div>
					<a name="0706135000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendments
Nos. 41 and 43 are similar to the other amendments. Again, they
represent a proposal for more spending with no thought about the
consequential issues. Will the Minister please advise us how many
employees the Legal Services Board and the OLC are likely to have? What
will they do for their money? We seem to have heard little about that.
How much would the proposed compensation amount to? What conditions
would a complainant have to fulfil to be awarded such compensation?
Would part-time staff qualify for the same compensation as full-time
employees? How would the Government pay for it? Finally, why have the
proposals been brought forward at this late
stage?</div>

					<a name="0706135000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a general rule, non-executive
board members do not receive pensions, but existing Government policy,
which is set out in the Treasury&#146;s guidance, says that we must
make provision in legislation to ensure that there is an option to pay
the pension. The provisions would bring the Bill into line with that

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000833"></a>

Prentice:
						</b> It is because the board will be a
non-departmental Government body that, in such instances, the issue of
pensions must be placed in statute. There is Treasury guidance, which
has been in existence for some time, and that is why the provision must
be included in the Bill. There may be greater flexibility in appointing
members to the board, but they will not in general receive
pensions.</div>
					<a name="0706135000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure that I can add a great deal to that point, except to say that
compensation might be appropriate for several reasons, the most obvious
being an early termination of appointment or a staff redundancy. On

non-executive board members do not receive pensions. However, Treasury

Bill. It is as simple as that.</div>
					<a name="0706135000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about who will pay for the provision. It will
be paid for through the levy on the approved regulator. Pension
provision will form part of the ongoing cost of the regime and will be
at a level determined by the LSB. If it will help, I am happy to write
to the hon. Gentleman in more detail about the complexities of pension
law, which would allow him to chew the matter over in a longer time

						</b> I have four questions for the Minister about
schedule 1. First, what are the Government estimates of the cost of the
legal services board in each of its first three years; what is the best
estimate of what it will cost the taxpayer or, if it is split, the
contributors? Secondly, what is the best estimate that the Government
can give us of the numbers of board members plus staff? How big an
organisation will it be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>in terms of minimum and maximum numbers of people. Thirdly, we had a
long discussion earlier about who will chair the board. I am not one of
those people who is obsessed about this, but considering we have given
up using sexist language, why is it used in the Bill, which refers to
the chairman all the way through? I know that the parliamentary
draftspeople no doubt work from the principle that male stands for male
and female, but surely, in 2007, we should have moved on from that. I
make a plea that we might be groundbreaking by having non-gender
specific language. Fourthly, paragraph 27(2) of schedule 1, which is on
page 126, states that in relation to</div>
					<a name="0706135000547"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part 2 of Schedule 1 to
the Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act
1975&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">the legal services
board will be excluded. That means that someone cannot be on the board
if they are a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly. So, if someone
were appointed to the legal services board, they would have to stand
down, as is the case with all the other offices of profit under the
Crown. Given that this is an England and Wales Bill and not a Northern
Ireland Bill, why does it not apply to Scotland, the Scottish
Parliament and the Welsh Assembly? I do not understand why Northern
Ireland has uniquely been referred to, given it is not a Northern
Ireland Bill, yet Scotland has not been
mentioned.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> I will write to all hon. Members about costs and
I am sure that we will come back to that matter at a later stage of the
Bill. I know that most hon. Members should have received a copy of my
letter to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr.
Beith) and others about our latest best estimate of the cost of
transition and so on, but I will ensure that I provide a more recent
update on that. I will do the same for the numbers of staff. I have
every sympathy with the hon. Gentleman about the language being more
non-gender specific and I find it quite difficult to talk constantly
about the chairman of the board. If we can ever persuade parliamentary
drafting counsel to enter the 21st century, we might get there on that
matter.</div>
					<a name="0706135000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
there is a specific reason why Northern Ireland is included whereas the
other areas are not. I hope that somebody will give me the reason at
some point, but I may have to stand here for some time before that
happens. I am told that Scotland is not included because it is in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and thus does not have to be
specifically mentioned, whereas the Northern Ireland Assembly is
clearly not in that Act, so must be specifically mentioned. We all
learn something new every day.</div>

						</b> The amendments stand in my name and those of
my hon. Friends the Members for Huntingdon and for Bournemouth, East. I
do not know why they do not stand in the name of the birthday boy, but
perhaps that can be put right at a later stage.</div>
					<a name="0706135000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 206 refers to
clause 3, which concerns the legal services board&#146;s duty to
promote the regulatory objectives set out in clause 1(1). Clause 3(2)
states:</div>
					<a name="0706135000550"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Board must, so far as is reasonably practicable, act in a
way&#151;</div>
					<a name="0706135000551"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) which
is compatible with the regulatory objectives,
and</div>
					<a name="0706135000552"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) which the Board
considers most appropriate for the purpose of meeting those
objectives.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one were
to expunge the expression &#147;so far as is reasonably
practicable&#148; from that provision, Her Majesty&#146;s
Government could get exactly what they want from the measures anyway.
Surely the expression unnecessarily qualifies clause 1(1). What is the
point of setting out the regulatory objectives in clause 1, if
one does not require the board to respect them in clause
3(2)?</div>
					<a name="0706135000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that
expression were to be left in that provision, the obligation for the
board to act in accordance with the regulatory objectives would be
removed in some circumstances. Surely, clause 3(2)(b) fulfils exactly
what Her Majesty&#146;s Government ought to want from the provision,
thus not only is the expression &#147;so far as is reasonably
practicable&#148; unnecessary, but it could, in some circumstances,
undermine the objectives set out in clause 1. It represents a possible
escape provision that could undermine the force of the objectives set
out in clause 1.</div>
					<a name="0706135000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 206 is a probing
amendment, and I would like the Minister to comment on what I have
said. I see that her civil servants are nodding, so I must have made a
reasonably cogent point. I am sure that there is an explanation for the
situation that I have outlined.</div>
					<a name="0706135000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is grouped with
amendment No. 244, which fast forwards us to part 4 of the
Bill. We are some way off reaching that part, but amendment No. 244
refers to clause 28, which comes under the
heading:</div>
					<a name="0706135000553"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;General
duties of approved
regulators&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, we are
moving on to a different part of the Bill. Clause 28(2) states
that:</div>
					<a name="0706135000554"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
approved regulator must, so far as is reasonably practicable, act in a

the expression</div>

					<a name="0706135000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not rehearse the arguments in relation to clause 28, but they are
similar to those that I have just made on clause 3. The evening is

Hughes:
						</b> I have put my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Yardley to the main amendment, although not to
the second amendment. In the Lords, there was a long and rather amusing
debate about whether letters had gone astray, and what had happened to
them. I read the Minister&#146;s wonderful response, but I was not
absolutely persuaded that it dealt with the point, so I thought it was
worth bringing the matter
back.</div>
					<a name="0706135000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern is
simply that we should not say, &#147;Here are the objectives. You
ought to follow them, but you do not have to if it is not
practical.&#148; We should have a structure that is firm and not
qualified, and the amendment seeks to remove the
qualification.</div>

							<a name="0706135000844"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> If I may, I shall explain to the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk why the provision is worded as it is, although I
have to say that I found his argument extremely persuasive, and what I
really want to do is to go away and think about how the provision
works. If I correctly understood him, he argues that we should take out
the phrase</div>
					<a name="0706135000558"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so far as is
reasonably
practicable&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
concentrate on whether clause 3(2)(b) encompasses what we want to
achieve. If that represents a correct understanding of his argument, I
have quite some sympathy for it.</div>
					<a name="0706135000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government did not want to
put an absolute requirement on the board and on the regulator to act in
such a way as to be fully compatible with all the regulatory objectives
all the time, because that could result in greater cost and
bureaucracy, and probably in greater intervention by the board in the
regulatory activities of the approved regulators&#151;not least
because there would then be a risk of judicial review if they did not
so act.</div>
					<a name="0706135000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">The flexible
and risk-based approach that Sir David Clementi advocated was the
reason for drafting the clause as it is, such that the right way
forward is to deal with matters on a case-by-case basis. The wording of
clauses 3 and 28 therefore tries to recognise that the objectives might
apply to a greater or lesser extent in the carrying out of functions,
or even, sometimes, not at all.</div>
					<a name="0706135000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall consider whether removal
of the relevant phrase would undermine that flexibility in any way and
whether we could rework clause 3(2)(b) to ensure that it would
encompass the principles that we all agree should apply. On that basis,
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						</b> We come now to the quite serious issue of
proportionality. The amendment was originally suggested to us by the
Chartered Institute of Patent Agents and by the Institute of Trade Mark
Attorneys. My hon. Friends and I propose that the amendment be added as
new subsection (4) to clause 3. In different ways, both amendments deal
with proportionality. Amendment No. 214 addresses the resources and
impact on the regulator. Amendment No. 254 deals with the need to
consider the different types of consumer. Clearly, the concern in both
cases is to avoid a one-size-fits-all
approach.</div>

					<a name="0706135000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause
3 deals with the board&#146;s duty to promote regulatory objectives
and will require the board to have regard to the principles of best
regulatory practice. Specifically, it refers to the importance of
regulatory activities being transparent, accountable, proportionate,
consistent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed. We
endorse the statement in the White
Paper:</div>
					<a name="0706135000559"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Today&#146;s
consumers are very different in the types of legal services they
purchase, how often they engage with legal service providers and their
level of knowledge of both the law and legal service providers. They
need services delivered in ways that are flexible enough to suit their
different needs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">On one
hand, high street practices may advise the inexperienced or the
vulnerable who are unsophisticated in legal matters and, on the other
hand, City solicitors represent a range of sophisticated corporate
clients who often have their own in-house legal teams responsible for
instructing external solicitors. Those consumers require a level of
regulation that is proportionate to their needs and will not
unnecessarily increase their legal costs or lead to unnecessary delays
in transactions. Inappropriate regulation could cause them to look
outside the UK jurisdiction for legal advice, in some cases, and damage
the competitiveness of City firms and other firms throughout the
country.</div>
					<a name="0706135000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proportionality
is such an important issue that guidance should be given about what
considerations the board should take into account. By not listing such
considerations, we are making the Legal Services Board&#146;s job far
more difficult. We have told people what to do, now we need to advise
them on how to do it. The amendment would give them such
guidance.</div>
					<a name="0706135000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger of the term &#147;proportionate&#148; being misinterpreted
and being interpreted in a subjective rather than an objective light or
there being an inconsistency in the way that board members assess
proportionality. It is important that we safeguard against any such
confusion. Therefore, we propose that guidance be given to the board
about what matters they should consider when determining whether
regulatory activities are proportionate. In that way, the Legal
Services Board can carry out its job in line with how the Bill
envisioned that it
would.</div>
					<a name="0706135000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
strong representations on the amendment, not surprisingly from the
smaller end of the regulator&#146;s market. The Chartered Institute
of Patent Attorneys and the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys, which I
shall call the institutes, represent, train and examine more than 2,070
highly skilled professionals in the specialist field of intellectual
property. As I mentioned on Second Reading, there have been few
complaints against those professionals. The institutes support the
amendment. In the House of Lords, Lord Kinsgland asked Baroness Ashton
of Upholland repeatedly about this issue. She refused an amendment on
the grounds that it would define proportionality in legislation,
although she went on to promise to consider guidance on it. She then
admitted that, as an independent body, the LSB would be under no
obligation to have regard to any such guidance issued by the Secretary
of State.</div>
					<a name="0706135000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
institutes continue to believe that this is a vital issue. As two of
the smallest approved regulators in the new system, they strongly
believe that regulation must 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>be proportionate. They aim to engage closely with the Legal Services
Board to ensure that it fully takes into account the effect that
regulation will have on the entry and retention of regulated persons to
their sector and the effect on fees. However, they believe that the
Bill should state more specifically that the board must act
proportionately with regard to smaller
regulators</div>
					<a name="0706135000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patent and
trade mark attorneys are currently regulated with a light touch and the
costs are low. They have concerns that the board may not sufficiently
take into account the dangers of the over-regulation of the smaller
regulators and their members. Currently, those members place only a
very small burden on the regulatory system. They anticipate the risk
that those who have the freedom to opt out will be over-regulated. That
might restrict entry to, and discourage retention in, the professions
and make the position of the approved regulator untenable.</div>
					<a name="0706135000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institutions are not what
are known as closed professions. Firms that are members of the
institutes need not be on the trade mark or patent registers to
practice, unlike, for example, the situation that applies to solicitors
or barristers. People could simply leave the institutes and practice
unregulated, at no cost. Clearly, that would be against
everyone&#146;s interests, not least consumers&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 213 focuses again
on proportionality, which was a central theme of the Lords&#146;
debates; indeed, it runs through the Bill. There is no doubt that all
who have been involved in the passage of the Bill agree that regulation
should be risk-based and proportionate. The Minister has emphasised
that several times, but how do we ensure that the drafting of the Bill
guarantees that the board acts proportionately? The fact remains that
the board will be more or less free to make its own determination of
what is proportionate, which could lead to disputes about the proper
exercise of its functions regarding the
professions.</div>
					<a name="0706135000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
institutes recognise that proportionality depends in many ways on
particular circumstances and that an all-embracing definition is
perhaps too inflexible. However, they believe that the Bill would
benefit from the inclusion of a non-exhaustive list of the key factors
that the LSB should take into account when exercising its regulatory
function. The also believe that that would benefit the future
relationship between the LSB and the
professions.</div>
					<a name="0706135000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment would not define proportionality, but would set out the
particular factors to which the board should have regard when assessing
what is proportionate in the regulation of approved regulators. The
institutes do not feel that it would be too prescriptive, or that it
would restrict the flexibility of the board. Having given some thought
to the matter, we are of the same opinion. The amendment was tabled
because of the concerns of two of the smallest regulators. They fear
that the LSB, which would get used to dealing with larger approved
regulators, would overlook the limited resources of the smaller
regulators, their low-risk status and their strong track record of good
conduct. Further, there is a perceived risk that regulation would
encourage practitioners to operate outside the regulated sector. That
could have the knock-on effect of driving up costs for the remaining
members, which could make CIPA&#146;s and ITMA&#146;s positions
untenable.</div>

proportionate approach should be taken by the Legal Services Board. She
also stated that</div>
					<a name="0706135000561"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Legal Services Board will need to recognise the position of smaller
regulators&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0706135000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">such as ITMA
and CIPA,</div>
					<a name="0706135000562"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when
exercising functions under the Bill. In doing so, the Board will need
to have regard to a number of factors which may include entry and
retention of regulated persons to the sector and the effect on
fees&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statement gave some reassurance that the Government and the institutes
have the same intention, but it is notable that the Under-Secretary
talked about what factors may be included when the board assesses
proportionality. There is no obligation in the Bill that the board must
have regard to such vital issues as entry and retention of regulated
persons and its effect on the regulator&#146;s fees, not to mention
its resources.</div>
					<a name="0706135000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 214 proposes that
the</div>
					<a name="0706135000563"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;role of the Board is
to ensure that the approved regulators act in a way which is compatible
with the regulatory objectives&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0706135000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to state that the
board&#146;s role is supervisory rather than advisory. The Government
have modelled the regulatory regime in the Bill on that of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, with the aim of providing a
light-touch regime. That is what business wants, and the regime set up
by the 2000 Act has in part ensured the success of the City in recent
years. The LSB should respect the principle that primary responsibility
for regulation rests with the professional bodies and accept that its
role is merely to ensure that the approved regulators&#146; actions
comply with the regulatory objectives. The amendment addresses concerns
about whether regulation by the board will be light touch.</div>
					<a name="0706135000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill should provide for the
relative roles of the Legal Services Board and approved regulators. The
amendment reinforces clause 49, about which my hon. Friend the Member
for North-West Norfolk will talk in due course. Clause 49, like the
amendment, strikes the appropriate chord on light-touch regulation, the
importance of which should not be underestimated.</div>
					<a name="0706135000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us not forget that all the
people that the Bill will regulate&#151;firms of solicitors,
barristers&#146; chambers, licensed conveyancers and patent
attorneys&#151;all now operate in a global marketplace. If those
firms are not regulated by their approved regulators, such as the Law
Society, and are seen to be directly regulated by the Legal Services
Board, they are at risk of being thrown out of those foreign
jurisdictions. If the Government are going to back-pedal now, surely
they should assure all those practices with an international dimension
that they will not be negatively affected? Have the Government sought
legal advice on that, as well as on their liability for any financial
losses that could result from such a
move?</div>
					<a name="0706135000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following a
lengthy debate in Committee, on Report in the other place, Lord
Kingsland returned to his view that the Bill did not make it clear that
the lead responsibility for regulation should lie with the professional
bodies, with the legal services board exercising its powers only in the
event of significant regulatory failure. Perhaps the Minister will show
us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>that those concerns can now be allayed. My hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk will address that point in some detail when we
discuss part 4, but if the amendment were agreed to, that
would be a good start.</div>
					<a name="0706135000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">Closely linked with the
amendments are new clauses 11 and 12, which will be proposed
by the Liberal Democrat Members. They concern the need for the board to
consult on its general policies, which is consistent with clause 3, and
on an annual work plan consultation. Generally speaking, the new
clauses, which are covered in a slightly different way by our later
amendments, make sense to me. I shall be interested to hear what the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has to say on
new clauses 10 and 11, and note that the amendments that are
grouped with clause 8 will cover the consultation of practitioners in
greater detail. We will also return to the issue when we debate new
clause 3, as part of our discussion of clause 10.</div>
					<a name="0706135000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, considering the order
of selection today, I should be interested to hear from the Minister
whether the light-touch approach of new clause 10 would be any more
appealing to the Government than new clauses 1, 4, 5 or
6.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000849"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I will be brief, but I want to say a few words
about the new clauses that have been mentioned and to correct the hon.
Member for Huntingdon: I think that he referred to new clauses 11 and
12, but new clauses 10 and 11 are under discussion.</div>
					<a name="0706135000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clauses are almost
self-explanatory. We are in a section on the general functions of the
Legal Services Board and its duty to promote the regulatory objectives.
It is always a question of degree and of how much ought to be put in
the Bill, and so we
propose:</div>
					<a name="0706135000564"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Board must make and maintain effective arrangements for consulting
representatives of practitioners and consumers on the extent to which
its general policies and practices are consistent with its duty under
section 3&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0706135000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the other
proposes that arrangements should include consultation in advance of
setting the work, not least to obtain the views of the consultees of
the targeting of specific interest in the board, and getting a view of
what people think are the big issues on which the board should be
concentrating and whether its work has some proportionality. That
starts to open the question of the balance between the second-tier
regulator and the board and the extent to which the board has a light
or heavy touch.</div>
					<a name="0706135000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not pretending that the drafting is perfect, but I should be interested
to hear the Minister&#146;s general response. The new clauses are an
attempt to see how much we need to include the board&#146;s duties,
particularly its consultation duties, in the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000850"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> One of my aims in the debates on the Bill and in
my discussions with stakeholders, whether they are from the legal
professions, consumers or colleagues, is to ban the phrase
&#147;light touch&#148;. This is not about light touch, but about
proportionality. I want everyone, if I can persuade them, not to use
the words &#147;light touch&#148; or any reference to touch, but
the term &#147;proportionate regulation&#148;. I will then feel
that I have achieved something.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>
					<a name="0706135000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">We very much recognise that the
smaller regulators in particular&#151;ITMA and CIPA have been quoted
extensively&#151;might want statutory assurances about how they will
be considered under the new framework. It is perfectly understandable
that they might be concerned about that, but there can be no question
but that an effective regulator must have regard to at least some of
the considerations listed in amendment No.
213.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0706135000579"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div>
					<a name="0706135000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
therefore nothing between us on the question of whether regulation
should be proportionate. Clearly it should. Where we differ is on
whether we consider it important to try to define it in the Bill.
Indeed, in quoting CIPA and ITMA, the hon. Gentleman recognised that
the board, the Office for Legal Complaints and the approved regulators
must be able to take a proportionate approach on a case-by-case basis,
which is the aspect on which we should concentrate our attention. I am
concerned that trying to define what the board should take into
consideration might cast doubt on whether other important factors also
apply in a particular
case.</div>
					<a name="0706135000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No.
213, the hon. Gentleman highlights a number of different considerations
that he regards as essential to the exercise of proportionate
regulation. However, the key point is that there might be equally
applicable and important factors that are not contained in the
amendment. Setting out those considerations in the Bill could suggest
that they had greater weight than other, non-statutory factors, which
might be more important in relation to a particular regulatory
decision.</div>
					<a name="0706135000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give the
Committee an example, I am sure that hon. Members are all aware that
the principle of proportionality is well established in legislation.
Section 2(3) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006
establishes
that</div>
					<a name="0706135000565"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulatory
activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent,
accountable, proportionate and
consistent&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that
they</div>
					<a name="0706135000566"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should be targeted
only at cases in which action is
needed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0706135000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those concepts
are not defined in the 2006 Act, and we have simply replicated that
model in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0706135000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is of the utmost importance that the board, the regulators and the
Office for Legal Complaints should be free to consider what is
proportionate when making their regulatory decisions. It is equally
important for the protection of the interests of the consumer, whether
a multinational firm or the man or woman in the street, that
proportionate regulation should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Placing definitions in legislation of what is proportionate in a
particular case would serve only to restrict the scope of that
principle.</div>
					<a name="0706135000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 254 would ensure that the board could distinguish between those who
are experienced consumers of legal services and those who are not, for
the purposes of determining what level of regulatory control should
apply. It might be considered as risk-based and proportionate to fix
the arrangements in regulations, but fixing the arrangements in the
Bill, so that they could be changed only by primary legislation, would
mean losing that opportunity for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>flexibility that we have been carefully building throughout the Bill. I
would argue that the board&#146;s regulatory approach is to target
those areas that need
attention.</div>
					<a name="0706135000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">How a
consumer copes in a given environment, based on their experience, is
only one of the variables that we take into account in determining the
level of protection. We have taken the view that the starting point
should be blanket protection for all consumers, which can then be
adapted to fluctuations in the legal services market and can respond to
consumer needs on a case-by-case basis where
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0706135000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the sentiment behind amendment No. 214. We have
consistently made it clear that we embrace the B-plus model of
oversight regulation. Although I understand why the hon. Gentleman
wants to make that explicit in the Bill, I am not convinced that that
would achieve what he wants. In fact, it would lead only to more
intrusive and burdensome regulation. I am sure that he, of all people,
would not want us to go down that road. There would be a risk of
judicial review if the board did not discharge its own duties to ensure
that the approved regulators acted compatibly with all the regulatory
obligations all the
time.</div>
					<a name="0706135000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that the oversight regulator does not micro-manage and second-guess the
actions of the approved regulators, as Members on both sides of the
Committee will agree. I fear that the amendment would increase the
scope for such micro-management by the board, by giving it a statutory
duty to ensure that the approved regulators act in a particular way
that is compatible with all the regulatory objectives all the time. The
Bill already gives effect to the oversight model of regulation. When
there are adverse impacts on the regulatory objectives, the board will
have the right powers to take action. I do not see any reason or merit
in going further than we have
done.</div>
					<a name="0706135000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that the Government tabled amendment No. 6, which puts the
board under a statutory duty to publish a policy statement setting out
how it intends to have regard to the principle that its principal role
is the oversight of approved regulators when formulating its policy
statements. That provision, which also requires the board to take into
account the desirability of resolving matters informally whenever
possible, might provide the kind of principle that the hon. Gentleman
seeks. Our position is that policy statements remain the best place to
set out the relationship with the approved regulator; they can be
adapted as necessary to ensure that the consumer is afforded the
protection of proper regulation for the services that they pay
for.</div>
					<a name="0706135000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to new
clauses 10 and 11, we have discussed amendments to the board&#146;s
duty to consider the views of approved regulators, as well as of
consumers. The Government have made clear their position on the issue.
The Bill provides equal opportunities for representations by consumers
and practitioners, through the approved regulators, to be considered by
the board. That has been expressed differently in the Bill, according
to the bodies involved, and for good reason. Unlike the legal
profession, which already has in place well-established, well-organised
and well-funded bodies that are more than capable of representing the
views and interests of its members, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>consumers do not have such a voice<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i> I sound
as if I am about to lose mine. We therefore thought it necessary to
establish the consumer panel to represent consumers&#146; interests
to the board.</div>
					<a name="0706135000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Approved
regulators already have sufficient opportunities under the Bill to
represent practitioners&#146; views. For example, in addition to the
provisions requiring the board to consider representations, clause 3
specifically requires the board to have regard to key principles,
including any other principle that appears to represent the best
regulatory practice. In line with such practice&#151;the Better
Regulation Executive&#146;s code of practice and consultation, for
example&#151;the board should consider representations, especially if
they come from those affected by its functions. We do not need to set
out any practice in the Bill which could, in effect, become outdated
and irrelevant. It would narrow the focus of the board&#146;s
consultation too much if it were limited to the extent to which its
general policies and practices were consistent with its duties under
clause 3, or to the degree to which the board proposed activities and
targeted them appropriately, whether or not the programme of work was
proportionate.</div>
					<a name="0706135000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
principles apply, too, to any work plan, and it is unnecessary to put
that duty in the Bill. The board has a duty under clause 3 to ensure
that its activities are targeted and used only when appropriate and
necessary. Given the duty for the board&#146;s accounts to be laid
before Parliament, there is sufficient financial accountability, so I
urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="0706135000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0706135000851"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that thoughtful
response to the amendments, and I shall go away and have a good read of
what she said. My immediate thought is that proportionality is not
simply a word that can be defined on the spot. It is an idea, and ideas
are open to interpretation. If someone is given an idea about putting
something together, they are given instructions on how to go about
doing so. That is the sort of principle that we intended to follow. We
are not dictating how the job should be done, but merely suggesting
guidelines to be considered when performing it. If board members each
use different criteria to judge proportionality, there could be a
problem. Our intention is to ensure that a consistent approach is taken
by each regulator. The Minister confirmed that she does not believe
that the one-size-fits-all approach is appropriate, which is important.
If she has thought about whether guidance could be a more appropriate
way to define what is meant by proportionality in the context of legal
services, I should be grateful for her
views.</div>
					<a name="0706135000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
does not like the words &#147;light touch&#148;, but patent and
trade mark attorneys, for example, like light-touch regulation. They
believe that they have a light- touch regulatory existence at the
moment, which allows them to compete effectively at an international
level, so they have concerns about the proposal. The minimum regulatory
cost to members is a registration fee for each register of about
&#163;70 a year. Costings suggest that the combination of a
regulatory levy and operating costs as an approved regulator are likely
to increase the annual regulatory cost to &#163;750 to &#163;1,000
a head, assuming that the number of registered attorneys remains at
current levels, and those figures make no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>provision for set-up costs. For regulators, the concept of a light touch
is a real one, as it will hit them in their pockets, so I hope that the
Minister will consider that further and comment on whether guidance is
appropriate.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> I will certainly consider issuing guidance, but
I am conscious of the fact that if the Government started to do so we
would get back into the argument about Government interference in
regulation. I want to make it absolutely clear that the LSB is
independent of the Government, and that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>must be seen to be so. However, I will consider whether there is a way
of using a code of practice or issuing
guidance.</div>
